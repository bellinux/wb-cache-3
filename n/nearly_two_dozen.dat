In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing.

In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Hypericum perforatum is, with Ginkgo biloba, one of {{the most}} {{frequently}} prescribed medicinal plants in the world. Its popular name, St. John's wort (SJW), {{is due to the fact}} that its flowers, yellow, are gathered around the feast of St. John the Baptist (24 th June) whereas "wort" is an old English word for plant. Of interest, SJW possesses antidepressant actions and is currently used to alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression. <b>Nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> of bioactive compounds have been isolated from SJW. Hypericin, originally described as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor type A, was thought to be responsible for the antidepressant properties of SJW extracts. However, subsequent studies could not confirm this observation and hyperforin, a phloroglucinol derivative, was shown to display antidepressive properties. Indeed, the efficiency of the extracts of SJW has been reported to be dependent on the concentration of hyperforin. However, its effects on brain cells and on the mechanisms underlying its putative clinical antidepressant effect remain poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review article is to propose an overview of the recent scientific publications that have provided new and relevant insights into the neurobiological actions of hyperforin. RESULTS: Hyperforin has been described as an inhibitor of the reuptake of many neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin or glutamate. It is thus a potent modulator of synaptic transmission. In addition, it blocks the activity of many receptors such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. More recently, hyperforin has been shown to activate TRPC 6, a Ca(2 +) -conducting channel of the plasma membrane, which is the only channel opened by this molecule. Interestingly, the other transient receptor potential channels of C type (TRPC) isoforms (TRPC 1, TRPC 3, TRPC 4, TRPC 5 and TRPC 7) are insensitive to hyperforin. Due to this specific property, it is now used as a convenient pharmacological tool to investigate the functions of endogenous TRPC 6 channels in various cell types. Chronically applied to neuronal cell line PC 12, hyperforin promotes the extension of neurites via a mechanism implying TRPC 6 channels. It is also known to trigger an intracellular signalling pathway that involves the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB). This leads to an up-regulation of the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (TrkB) and TRPC 6. This hyperforin-dependent cascade is controlled by Ca(2 +) ions and occurs specifically in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. One key aspect of the cellular responses induced by hyperforin is its impact on the homeostasis of several cations (Na(+), Ca(2 +), Zn(2 +) and H(+)). In vitro experiments demonstrated that hyperforin, which changes the fluidity of membranes, elevates the intracellular concentration of these elements by promoting their influx and/or their release from internal compartments. CONCLUSION: The phloroglucinol derivative hyperforin is an important bioactive molecule of Hypericum perforatum exhibiting antidepressive properties. Although it inhibits the reuptake of many neurotransmitters, hyperforin is in fact a multi-target drug influencing the cellular homeostatic mechanisms of Ca(2 +), Zn(2 +), H(+) and Na(+) due to its effects on their influx and/or release from internal stores. In addition, hyperforin is a potent modulator of mitochondrial functions. In spite of recent progress in the characterization of the cellular hyperforin responses, it remains unclear what pharmacological aspects of hyperforin functions are relevant in vivo...|$|R
5|$|On {{its first}} landfall, the {{tropical}} storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160km/h (100mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, {{with the worst}} conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozen</b> domestic flights {{to and from the}} region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made. By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines. Immediately following the disaster, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority. According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 people lost their lives, 5 others remained unaccounted for, and 11 sustained injuries. One newspaper reported that a motorized craft in the Tañon Strait capsized {{at the height of the}} storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people. Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality. It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident.|$|E

25|$|On 12 October, PA {{police arrested}} two Israeli reservists who had accidentally entered Ramallah, {{where in the}} {{preceding}} weeks a hundred Palestinians had been killed, <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozen</b> of them minors. Rumours quickly spread that Israeli undercover agents were in the building, and an angry crowd of more than 1,000 Palestinian mourners gathered {{in front of the}} station calling for their death.

A British journalist had his camera destroyed by rioters as he attempted to take a picture. The brutality of the killings shocked the Israeli public, who saw it as proof of a deep-seated Palestinian hatred of Israel and Jews. In response, Israel launched a series of retaliatory air-strikes against Palestinian Authority targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The police station where the lynching had taken place was evacuated and destroyed in these operations. Israel later tracked down and arrested those responsible for killing the soldiers.|$|E
