This paper discusses the biostratigraphy and palaeoecology of calcareous nannofossils of the uppermost Mozdu-ran Formation in the Jozak section in west Kopet-Dagh basin. The Mozduran Formation consists of white to grey Limestone. In the studied sections, samples are taken and prepared with smear slides. In the Jozak section, 17 species have been determined. Based on <b>nannoplanktons</b> {{and as a result of}} biostratigraphy studies, the nan-nofossil standard zones (CC 4) are identified. According to this zone, the age of the studied thickness is Early Hauterivian in this section in west Kopet-Dagh basin. The presence of warm water indicators (Nannoconus, Watznaueria, Lithraphidites) suggests warm surface water conditions in the studied thickness. In the Jozak sec-tion based on Nannoconus spp., low fertility conditions are suggested. The studied area is deposited in low to middle latitudes and shallow marine environments...|$|R

40|$|The section studied {{is located}} {{immediately}} {{south of the}} village of Beloc, in the Southern Peninsula of Haiti. Rock sequences of that locality have the distinctive stratigrapbic characteristic of yielding a series that spans {{the transition from the}} Cretaceous to the Tertiary (K/T boundary), which is distinguished by a conspicuous marker bed composed of spherulites. The micropaleontologic data based on foraminifers indicate the presence of several important biozones charateristies of the boundary zone, namely the uppermost part of ihe Abathomphalus mayaroensis Zone, part ? of the Guembelitria cretacea Zone, and the Parvularugoglobigerina eugublna Zone, respectively. The calcareous <b>nannoplanktons</b> also yield transitional taxa that concur with the foramihiferal data, as they are indicative of the Micula prinsii Zone (uppermost Maastrichtian), as well as the lower part of NP 1 or basal Danian. The absolute frequency of the different groups greatly diminish at the level that is assigned to the lowest Danian, which is coincident with the biotic crisis of the K/T boundary event. The dramatic decrease is particularly evident in the nannofos. sils, which are reduced by 7 / 7 00 to 1 / 400 of the assemblages recorded {{toward the end of the}} Maastrichtian. The relatively high frequency ofThoracosphaera spp. (up to 8 percent total), the predominance of heterohelicids, and the remarkable abundance of juvenile globotruncanids (about 50 percent) in the Cretaceous materials seem to also indicate a very unstable planktonic ecosystem toward the end of the Maastrichtia...|$|R

In the Upper Jurassic the CCD was probably much higher and ranged somewhere between 2000 and 3000 meter depth due to a greatly diminished calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> at that time.|$|E

40|$|The Southern Ocean is an {{important}} biogeochemical region on a global scale, in which mineralising phytoplankton {{play a role in}} cycling energy, carbon and nutrients. Mineralising phytoplankton with cells 2 – 20 ?m in diameter (<b>nannoplankton)</b> are poorly enumerated by traditional preservation and microscopy techniques, yet may fulfil {{an important}} role in the Southern Ocean. Here we define the spatial and temporal biogeography for these mineralising <b>nannoplankton</b> assessed by scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with an array of biological, physical, and chemical variables during two cruises to the Scotia Sea region of the Southern Ocean. The cruises encompassed two seasons, austral summer (January–February 2008) and austral autumn (March–April 2009). The biogeography of the three most numerous mineralising <b>nannoplankton</b> groups, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, the smaller (< 10 ?m) species of the diatom genus Fragilariopsis, and chrysophytes of the genus Tetraparma (mostly Tetraparma pelagica) were found to be related to the boundaries of the major circumpolar fronts. E. huxleyi abundances were relatively high in the northern water masses (maximum of 650 cells ml? 1), while T. pelagica abundances were high in the southern water masses (maximum of 1910 cells ml? 1). Small Fragilariopsis spp. abundances were also highest in the southern water masses (maximum of 1820 cells ml? 1), but this group was present throughout the Scotia Sea. Multivariate statistical analysis found that the most influential environmental variables controlling mineralising <b>nannoplankton</b> biogeography were sea surface temperature and silicate concentration. Estimates of biomass indicated that the Scotia Sea mineralising <b>nannoplankton</b> community formed a substantial part of the total phytoplankton community, particularly south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) during the austral autumn, where mineralising <b>nannoplankton</b> biomass reached 36 % of the total phytoplankton biomass. The results that are obtained suggest that traditional microscopic surveys of large Southern Ocean phytoplankton may underestimate total biomass by excluding key mineralising <b>nannoplankton</b> groups. Greater appreciation of the ecological significance of mineralising <b>nannoplankton</b> in the Southern Ocean will improve our understanding of the relationships between environmental parameters, primary production, and the biological carbon pump in this ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|This study {{documents}} {{the distribution of}} calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> in the waters and surface sediments of the Australian Sector of the Southern Ocean, and applies the information to core samples from the region to infer past changes in the ocean between 41 os and 64 °S. The preservation of calcite plates produced by these phytoplankton are preserved in pelagic sediments and are useful in paleoceanography. Water column samples show that calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> can be separated into five distinct assemblages associated with properties of the water mass, i. e., temperature, salinity, light and nutrients. In general the abundance and diversity of <b>nannoplankton</b> decrease poleward from subtropical to polar waters. The surface sediments show an abundance and diversity of calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> different from living assemblages in the water column. Surface sediments are dominated by a single assemblage including C. pelagicus, a species not found in water column samples. The absence of C. pelagicus suggests a 1 recent extinction in the Southern Ocean. Of 45 surface sediment s mples, only eight were identified as younger than 73 ka BP based on currently recognised biostratigraphy, indicating erosion and disturbance of sediments in the region. Preferential preservation of larger, more robust species of <b>nannoplankton</b> in the surface sediments suggests that chemical dissolution of calcite is significant.

40|$|Between March and April of 1986 {{a series}} of water samples were taken in the South Atlantic to study the Recent {{calcareous}} <b>nannoplankton</b> assemblages {{in that part of}} the world.

It is concluded that the transitional floral zone should be redefined on the basis of seasonal changes of the assemblages. In the cold waters between the Subtropic and the Antarctic Convergences near the Antarctic continent, calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> is scarce. Only a monospecific assemblage of malformed Emiliania huxleyi was found.

40|$|Detailed {{analyses}} of well-preserved carbonate samples {{from across the}} Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary in Hole 577 have revealed a significant decline in the d 13 C values of calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> from the Maestrichtian to the Danian Age accompanied by a substantial reduction in carbonate accumulation rates. Benthic foraminifers, however, do not exhibit a shift in carbon composition similar to that recorded by the calcareous <b>nannoplankton,</b> but actually increase slightly over the same time interval. These results {{are similar to the}} earlier findings at two North Pacific Deep Sea Drilling Project locations, Sites 47. 2 and 465, and are considered to represent a dramatic decrease in oceanic phytoplankton production associated with the catastrophic Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary extinctions. In addition, the change in carbon composition of calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary at Hole 577 is accompanied by only minor changes in the oxygen isotope trends of both calcareous <b>nannoplankton</b> and benthic foraminifers, suggesting that temperature variations in the North Pacific from the late Maestrichtian to the early Danian Age were insignificant...|$|E
