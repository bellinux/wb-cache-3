25|$|In organic chemistry, Carnelley's Rule, {{established}} in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that high molecular symmetry {{is associated with}} high melting point. Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three structural isomers with molecular formula C5H12 the melting point increases in the series isopentane −160°C (113 K) n-pentane −129.8°C (143 K) and <b>neopentane</b> −16.4°C (256.8 K). Likewise in xylenes and also dichlorobenzenes the melting point increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with diazine and triazines. Many cage-like compounds like adamantane and cubane with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.|$|E

50|$|The {{boiling point}} of <b>neopentane</b> is only 9.5 °C, {{significantly}} {{lower than those of}} isopentane (27.7 °C) and normal pentane (36.0 °C). Therefore, <b>neopentane</b> is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, while the other two isomers are (barely) liquids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neopentane,</b> {{also called}} 2,2-dimethylpropane, is a double-branched-chain alkane with five carbon atoms. <b>Neopentane</b> is a {{flammable}} gas {{at room temperature}} and pressure which can condense into a highly volatile liquid on a cold day, in an ice bath, or when compressed to a higher pressure.|$|E
50|$|The same {{tends to}} be true for the melting points of alkane isomers, and that of {{isopentane}} is 30 °C {{lower than that of}} n-pentane. However, the melting point of <b>neopentane,</b> the most heavily branched of the three, is 100 °C higher than that of isopentane. The anomalously high melting point of <b>neopentane</b> has been attributed to the tetrahedral molecules packing more closely in solid form. But this explanation is contradicted by the fact that <b>neopentane</b> has a lower density than the other two isomers.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>neopentane</b> = 4CC + 12CH + 12HCH + 12HCC + 6CCC + (5C + 12H) = -40.1 kcal/mol ...|$|E
50|$|The {{melting point}} of <b>neopentane</b> (−16.6 °C), {{on the other}} hand, is 140 degrees {{higher than that of}} {{isopentane}} (−159.9 °C) and 110 degrees higher than that of n-pentane (−129.8 °C). This anomaly has been attributed to the better solid-state packing assumed to be possible with the tetrahedral <b>neopentane</b> molecule; but this explanation has been challenged on account of it having a lower density than the other two isomers. Moreover, its enthalpy of fusion is lower than the enthalpies of fusion of both n-pentane and isopentane, thus indicating that its high melting point is due to an entropy effect resulting from higher molecular symmetry. Indeed, the entropy of fusion of <b>neopentane</b> is about 4 times lower than that of n-pentane and isopentane.|$|E

5000|$|In chain isomerism, or {{skeletal}} isomerism, {{components of}} the (usually carbon) skeleton are distinctly re-ordered to create different structures. Pentane exists as three isomers: n-pentane (often called simply [...] "pentane"), isopentane (2-methylbutane) and <b>neopentane</b> (dimethylpropane).|$|E
50|$|Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), {{also known}} as PENT, PENTA, TEN, corpent, {{penthrite}} (or—rarely and primarily in German—as nitropenta), is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol, and is structurally very similar to nitroglycerin. Penta refers to the five carbon atoms of the <b>neopentane</b> skeleton.|$|E
50|$|Because of neopentane's full {{tetrahedral}} symmetry, all protons are chemically equivalent, {{leading to}} a single NMR chemical shift δ = 0.902 when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride. In this respect, <b>neopentane</b> is similar to its silane analog, tetramethylsilane, whose single chemical shift is zero by convention.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, methanetetracarboxylate is a {{tetravalent}} anion with formula C5O84&minus; or C(COO&minus;)4. It {{has four}} carboxylate groups {{attached to a}} central carbon atom; so {{it has the same}} carbon backbone as <b>neopentane.</b> It is an oxocarbon anion, that is, consists only of carbon and oxygen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} name <b>neopentane</b> {{was still}} {{retained in the}} 1993 IUPAC recommendations, but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations. The preferred IUPAC name is the systematic name 2,2-dimethylpropane, but the substituent numbers are superfluous {{because it is the}} only possible “dimethylpropane.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... neo is a {{non-specific}} {{term for}} [...] "new", usually synthetically produced substances or isomers of long-known n compounds or natural substances (for example neomenthol derived from menthol or neoabietic acid from abietic acid). According to IUPAC neo is only recommended in <b>neopentane</b> or the neopentyl residue.|$|E
5000|$|Larger alkanes, such as ethane, {{are also}} {{reactive}} in magic acid, and both exchange hydrogen atoms and condense to form larger carbocations, such as protonated <b>neopentane.</b> This ion is then cloven at higher temperatures, and reacts to release hydrogen gas and forms the t-amyl cation at lower temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Pentaerythritol is {{an organic}} compound, a white, {{crystalline}} solid with the formula C5H12O4. It is a polyol with the <b>neopentane</b> backbone and one hydroxyl group {{in each of}} the four terminal carbons. It is a building block for the synthesis and production of explosives, plastics, appliances, and many other important chemicals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neopentane</b> is the {{simplest}} alkane with a quaternary carbon, and has achiral tetrahedral symmetry. It {{is one of}} the three structural isomers with the molecular formula C5H12 (pentanes), the other two being n-pentane and isopentane. Out of these three, it is the only one to be a gas at standard conditions; the other being liquids.|$|E
50|$|Molecular graphs can {{distinguish}} between structural isomers, compounds {{which have the}} same molecular formula but non-isomorphic graphs - such as isopentane and <b>neopentane.</b> On the other hand, the molecular graph normally does not contain any information about the three-dimensional arrangement of the bonds, and therefore cannot distinguish between conformational isomers (such as cis and trans 2-butene) or stereoisomers (such as D- and L-glyceraldehyde).|$|E
50|$|The {{symmetry}} of the <b>neopentane</b> molecule {{can be broken}} if some hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms. In particular, if each methyl group has a different number of substituted atoms (0, 1, 2, and 3), one obtains a chiral molecule. The chirality in this case arises solely by the mass distribution of its nuclei, while the electron distribution is still essentially achiral.|$|E
50|$|In the Gronert model these repulsive 1,3 {{interactions}} {{account for}} trends in bond dissociation energies which for example decrease going from methane to ethane to isopropane to <b>neopentane.</b> In this model the homolysis of a C-H bond releases strain {{energy in the}} alkane. In traditional bonding models the driving force {{is the ability of}} alkyl groups to donate electrons to the newly formed free radical carbon.|$|E
50|$|Pentane is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C5H12—that is, an alkane with five carbon atoms. The term may refer {{to any of}} three structural isomers, or to a mixture of them: in the IUPAC nomenclature, however, pentane means exclusively the n-pentane isomer; {{the other two are}} called isopentane (methylbutane) and <b>neopentane</b> (dimethylpropane). Cyclopentane is not an isomer of pentane because it has only 10 hydrogen atoms where pentane has 12.|$|E
50|$|The {{experimental}} heat of {{formation of}} ethane is -20.03 kcal/mol and ethane consists of 2 P groups. Likewise propane (-25.02 kcal/mol) can be written as 2P+S, isobutane (-32.07) as 3P+T and <b>neopentane</b> (-40.18 kcal/mol) as 4P+Q. These four equations and 4 unknowns work out to estimations for P (-10.01 kcal/mol), S (-4.99 kcal/mol), T (-2.03 kcal/mol) and Q (-0.12 kcal/mol). Of course the accuracy will increase when the dataset increases.|$|E
50|$|In {{one example}} {{involving}} this system, the alkane pentane is selectively converted to the halocarbon 1-iodopentane. This transformation was achieved via the thermoloysis of Cp*W(NO)(η3-allyl)(CH2CMe3) in pentane at room temperature, resulting in elimination of <b>neopentane</b> by a pseudo-first-order process, generating an undetectable electronically and sterically unsaturated 16-electron intermediate that is coordinated by an η2-butadiene ligand. Subsequent intermolecular activation of a pentane solvent molecule then yields an 18-electron complex possessing an n-pentyl ligand. In a separate step, reaction with iodine at −60 °C liberates 1-iodopentane from the complex.|$|E
50|$|In propionitrile the cyano group withdraws electrons, also {{resulting}} in a reduced bond length (144 pm). Squeezing a C-C bond is also possible by application of strain. An unusual organic compound exists called In-methylcyclophane with a very short bond distance of 147 pm for the methyl group being squeezed between a triptycene and a phenyl group. In an in silico experiment a bond distance of 136 pm was estimated for <b>neopentane</b> locked up in fullerene. The smallest theoretical C-C single bond obtained {{in this study is}} 131 pm for a hypothetical tetrahedrane derivative.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} side-branches {{of the same size}} alkyl group, their positions are separated by commas and the group prefixed with di-, tri-, tetra-, etc., depending on the number of branches. For example, C(CH3)4 (<b>neopentane)</b> is named 2,2-dimethylpropane. If there are different groups, they are added in alphabetical order, separated by commas or hyphens: [...] The longest possible main alkane chain is used; therefore 3-ethyl-4-methylhexane instead of 2,3-diethylpentane, even though these describe equivalent structures. The di-, tri- etc. prefixes are ignored for the purpose of alphabetical ordering of side chains (e.g. 3-ethyl-2,4-dimethylpentane, not 2,4-dimethyl-3-ethylpentane).|$|E
