The article identifies a lacuna in the Hervormde Kerk in Suidelike Afrika’s ministry to the sick and to those who find themselves engulfed by misfortune in one form or another and believed to have been caused by witchcraft. The article points to the need for a ministry that will be relevant and meaningful in addressing the illnesses and misfortunes of black African Christians.

40|$|Could {{the mass}} media be {{agencies}} of national unity and develop-ment in Uganda, the current violent upheavals <b>notwithstanding?</b> <b>This</b> <b>article,</b> adapted from a historical study, shows that Uganda’s mass media systems could not effectively play that role, given their structures. Socialization, {{the process by which}} people learn to be members of the human race and members of the culture in which they are bom, forms the theoretical framework of the study. At issue, therefore, {{is the extent to which}} {{the mass media}} could be agencies of socializing Ugandans to a common culture whose central elements would be national unity and development. Ugandans have had control of the modem systems of mass media since 1962, when Uganda became independent of Great Britain. But those systems are yet to be reorganized in ways that could make them more responsive and appealing to a broader spectrum of Ugandans. What follows is an assessment of the systems ’ success or failure as agencies of socialization in Uganda in the context of their historical establishment and development. THE PRINT MEDIA IN UGANDA Isoba (1980) stated that religious missionaries played an impor-tant role in developing the press in Uganda. In 1897, the Church Missionary Society (CMS) started a mimeographed English...|$|E

40|$|Established in the 30 's, Schauder {{a priori}} {{estimates}} {{are among the}} most classical and powerful tools in the analysis of problems ruled by 2 nd order elliptic PDEs. Since then, a central problem in regularity theory has been to understand Schauder type estimates fashioning particular borderline scenarios. In such context, it has been a common accepted aphorism that the continuity of the Hessian of a solution could never be superior than the continuity of the medium. <b>Notwithstanding,</b> in <b>this</b> <b>article</b> we show that solutions to uniformly elliptic, linear equations with C^ 0,ϵ̅ coefficients are of class C^ 2,α, for any 0 < ϵ̅≪α < 1, at Hessian degenerate points, H(u) :={X D^ 2 u(X) = 0 }. In fact we develop a more general regularity result at such Hessian degenerate points, featuring into the theory of fully nonlinear equations. Insofar as the optimal modulus of continuity for the Hessian is concerned, the result of this paper is the first one in the literature to surpass the inborn obstruction from the sharp Schauder a priori regularity theory.

40|$|The AEC, {{scheduled}} to be established in 2015, will promote skilled labor mobility among the ASEAN Member Countries. There is convincing evidence that the establishing the AEC (along with the skilled labor mobility provisions) could bring benefits to the ASEAN Members Countries. Yet some criticism on the AEC’s potential efficacy exists. However, a surprisingly few scholars have debated about the proficiency of the provisions. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> neither examines {{the costs and benefits}} of the AEC agreement nor provides conclusions on whether professions should or should not be included in the agreement. Rather, <b>this</b> <b>article</b> examines whether the skilled labor mobility provisions introduced by the AEC are pragmatic. The focus here will also center on indicating potential obstacles to skilled labor mobility. The main argument of <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is that the skilled labor movement provisions of the AEC will facilitate skilled workers who have already planned to seek employment and relocate to another country. Yet <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>this</b> facilitation, <b>this</b> <b>article</b> holds that the provisions do not provide many incentives to encourage mobility among other skilled workers who still reside in their home country. Thus, the labor mobility rate among the ASEAN Member Countries will not substantially increase because of these provisions. This is because the national legal systems, (which are not compatible with the mobility policies), discourage worker’s migration because of barriers such as lack of recognition of qualifications, insufficient information provided for workers, and the nature of social structure. Facilitation for the practical aspects of labor mobility is needed in order to successfully increase the effectiveness of the provisions. The theoretical approach utilized in this project is comparative methodology. This project utilizes a legal analysis as well as subsequent critical comparison to put forward solutions to increase the effectiveness of the labor mobility provisions...|$|R

The Article first addresses the substantive {{and the primary}} issue of liability, vel non, under construction industry indemnification provisions. After offering a historical analysis of Washington case law on the subject, the Article analyzes the recent statutory amendments to section 4. 24. 115 of the Washington Revised Code, which substantially impact {{the current state of}} the law and which should resolve many unsettled or ambiguous issues in the case law. <b>This</b> <b>Article</b> then discusses some unique issues that have arisen in the context of attempts to judicially enforce these indemnification provisions. Finally, <b>this</b> <b>Article</b> proposes a model indemnification provision that equitably formulates the clause, taking into account the precepts enunciated in Washington case law and statutes. <b>This</b> <b>Article</b> discusses certain non-industry cases when principles enunciated in those cases bear upon issues and principles germane to the interpretation of indemnity clauses in construction industry cases. <b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>this</b> brief discussion, the primary focus of <b>this</b> <b>Article</b> is upon the interpretation and enforcement of indemnity clauses in construction industry contracts...|$|R

40|$|To <b>this</b> day, most <b>articles</b> on {{cellular}} automata (CA) employ regular tessellations of R-n, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>this</b> kind of tessellation {{suffers from}} a few serious drawbacks limiting the appraisal of regular CA as full-fledged modelling tools. In <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> we propose an extension to the classical CA paradigm, by allowing irregular tessellations of R-n, which, in essence, encloses the regular tessellations as a special case. After a short review on the major shortcomings of CA on regular tessellations, we establish a definition for CA on irregular tessellations of R-n that {{is followed by a}} profound elaboration of its constituents. In addition, we propose a graph representation that is applicable to an important family of irregular CA, and, in accordance with the framework developed for CA on regular tessellations, we present an enumeration scheme for the k-state, theta-sum irregular (outer-) totalistic CA.

40|$|Delegalization of {{arms control}} is now an {{accomplished}} fact. In this period of potential dramatic revision of the international order, {{it is not surprising}} that the US is seeking increased flexibility in pursuing several strategies, including the full use of military and technological advantages. The motivations behind this include US interests, as well as long run global interests. What may be surprising, however, is the potential risk to our democratic processes from delegalization {{of arms control}}-that is to say, the danger posed by reduced use of arms control treaties with built-in processes of transparency and democratic accountability. The potential risk is particularly apparent in those cases where arms control treaties function in effect as treaties of peace, alliance, or neutrality that arguably should be subject to the control of the constitutional treaty makers. <b>Notwithstanding</b> these concerns, <b>this</b> <b>Article</b> argues that on balance the constitutional text, structure, and history compel the conclusion that the democracy deficit risked by delegalization of arms control is adequately attenuated through continuing congressional participation in the arms control process and, in any event, outweighed by the need for a vigorous executive to exercise the role it assumed at the very beginning of this Republic when 2 ̆ 2 regime change 2 ̆ 2 in Europe was also the question of the day...|$|R
