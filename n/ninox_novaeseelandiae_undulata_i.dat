50|$|The Norfolk boobook (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae</b> <b>undulata),</b> {{also known}} as the Norfolk Island boobook, Norfolk Island owl or Norfolk Island morepork, was a bird in the true owl family endemic to Norfolk Island, an Australian {{territory}} in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. It is an extinct subspecies of the morepork (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae).</b> However, although the taxon is extinct, its genes live on in the descendants of the hybrid offspring of the last female bird, which was sighted for the last time in 1996.|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} of the Norfolk Island boobook owl <b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae</b> <b>undulata,</b> a nocturnal bird restricted to the Australian territory of Norfolk Island, {{was reduced to a}} single female in 1986. Deliberate introduction of two males of its nearest relative, the New Zealand boobook N. n. novaeseelandiae, as a conservation intervention has allowed the taxon to persist on Norfolk Island, albeit in hybrid form. Although declared Extinct in 2000, a re-examination of this unique situation has concluded there is a strong argument that the taxon should be categorized as Critically Endangered because, on average, approximately half the nuclear genome of the original taxon and all the mitochondrial DNA is conserved in all living owls on the island. This thus represents a special case in which the taxon can be considered to be extant, in hybrid form, even though no pure-bred individuals survive. More generally, we suggest that, in exceptional cases, hybridization may not be a threat to highly threatened species and that guidelines are needed to determine when to consider hybrid populations as extant forms of the original taxon, and when to declare extinction through hybridization...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae</b> ocellata is a {{subspecies}} {{of southern}} boobook. The southern boobook {{is the most}} common and smallest owl on the Australian mainland.

Ocellata is the smallest of the boobook subspecies as it is found in the warmer western parts of Australia (north-western New South Wales/western Queensland across to Western Australia). although it is not found in arid areas. The Boobook can be commonly known as the ‘mopoke’ due to its call (double hoot ‘boo-book’). This owl is often confused with the barking owl due to their similar appearance, however the boobook is a fair amount smaller.

40|$|Urbanisation is {{increasing}} rapidly, impacting {{on a broad}} range of species. The proliferation of electric light has transformed the night time environment; however, our understanding on the effects of artificial night lighting on fauna, including nocturnal birds, is extremely limited. The aim ofthis research was to determine whether artificial night light affected the abundance of nocturnal birds. Spotlighting surveys were undertaken in Research Park, Melbourne, Victoria, along three 300 m transects. Each transect was surveyed five times during three light treatments: when lights were on, 20 minutes after lights were turned off and when lights were absent, over a period often nights. A total of 123 nocturnal birds was detected during survey nights. Two species were recorded - the Southern Boobook <b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae</b> and the Tawny Frogmouth Podargus strigoides. The Tawny Frogmouth was detected along all three transects (n= 121); however, the Southern Boobook was detected along one transect only (n= 2). None of the light treatments had a significant effect on bird abundance. Neither did location, habitat or the combined effects of light treatments, location and habitat. The results of this research will contribute to a growing body of knowledge and support future conservation activities for species in areas undergoing urbanisation. {The Victorian Naturalist 127 (5) 2010, 192 - 195) ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{disagreement}} about whether Southern Boobooks <b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae</b> duet. A recent {{review of the}} species concluded that duetting does occur, based on (i) obser-vations of captives and (ii) two reports from wild birds, including one from New Zealand. We examined definitions of duetting, and attempted to collect evidence {{for it in the}} calling behaviour of three mated pairs on adjacent territories observed from October 1996 to October 1999. To identify callers, six adults were colour-marked, and four of the six were radio-tagged. Observations were made on 529 nights from just before the birds left their day roost each evening until one hour after. Of 255 bouts of calling in which Territorial Boobook and Por calls were used, 30 (11. 8 %) overlapped (owls called at the same time); two (6. 7 %) of 30 overlapping bouts were between mated pairs, but without the temporal precision or sequential ordering of elements normally found in duetting. The other 28 overlapping bouts (93. 3 %) were mostly between neighbouring males. We found no convincing evidence in the field, or in the lit-erature, that Southern Boobooks duet. We comment on behaviours that some may interpret as duetting, and suggest caution when estimating, solely from vocalisations, the densities of terri-torial pairs and sizes of home ranges of Ninox...|$|R
5000|$|The {{population}} of the Norfolk boobook declined with the clearance and modification of its forest habitat, especially the felling of large trees with suitable hollows for nesting in. There was also competition for nest hollows with feral honey bees and introduced crimson rosellas. By 1986 the population {{had been reduced to}} a single female bird, named [...] "Miamiti" [...] after a matriarch of the Norfolk Island people. [...] As part of a program to attempt to conserve {{at least some of the}} genes of the insular subspecies, two male Southern boobooks (moreporks) of the nominate New Zealand subspecies, <b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae</b> novaeseelandiae, were introduced to the island as mates for the female. The males were sourced from the New Zealand subspecies rather than one of the Australian subspecies as it was discovered that it was more closely related to the Norfolk Island taxon.

40|$|The morepork (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae)</b> {{project on}} Banks Peninsula was {{initiated}} in July 2014 {{and is expected}} to continue until 2017. The aim of this project led by the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust (BPCT) is broadly to identify the habitats occupied by morepork and based on those findings, improve predator control in targeted areas as well as prohibiting the use of toxins. This work will contribute to improving the breeding and survival success of morepork and therefore increase their abundance in a fragmented and modified habitat on Banks Peninsula. This project successfully combined the use of several data collection methods to create a comprehensive spatial distribution map. Morepork appear to be wide-spread, but patchily distributed across the peninsula, and the number of individuals may still be relatively small. Additional research is required to detect their presence in more remote locations. The morepork monitored in Kaituna Reserve were foraging outside of the reserve, which suggests that small remnants are not sufficient to maintain a breeding pair. These birds did not successfully breed despite the presence of fertile eggs. Defining suitable morepork habitat may not mainly depend on the presence of predators and food sources (small rodents). Additional research is required to identify what characteristics determine the quality of a morepork habitat. The use of nesting boxes, as well as predator control may increase their survival rate...|$|R
40|$|I studied morepork, <b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae,</b> on Mokoia Island from November 1995 {{through to}} March 1997. Radio {{telemetry}} was a technique {{essential for the}} study of this species. Methods for the capture of morepork and attachment of radio transmitters were developed during this study. A population estimate of 25 breeding pairs was made for Mokoia. Thirty-one morepork were captured and transmitters were fitted to 21 of these birds. Both adults and juveniles were radio-tagged successfully. Morphological measurements, a blood sample and plumage descriptions were made at the time of capture. Using the morphological measurements and plumage characteristics the sex of the bird was, in most cases, unable to be determined. However, using the blood sample collected and a DNA based technique, sex could be resolved in all cases. Before this study, little was known about the ecology and breeding biology of morepork. This thesis reveals that morepork are primarily nocturnal, strictly territorial, and roost during the day amongst foliage. It has also confirmed that morepork are primarily insectivorous, but do prey on mice, Mus musculus, and birds. Breeding occurs from September through to January, and nests were located in a variety of locations. Secondary poisoning has received relatively little investigation, both in New Zealand and world-wide. The growing use of second-generation anticoagulant poisons in New Zealand conservation means that more information is needed. Seventeen radio-tagged morepork were monitored following a poison drop in September 1996, to eradicate mice from Mokoia. I followed 14 birds successfully, and of these, one died due to secondary poisoning, and a further two birds died, probably also as a result of poisoning. This thesis, therefore, provides information not only on the ecology and breeding biology of a little known species, but also information of use to conservation managers planning future poisoning operations...|$|R
40|$|Models {{of complex}} natural systems often {{demonstrate}} significant limitations in addressing {{issues such as}} the distribution of animal species, particularly in relation to long recognised “problems of scale”. One of the more important theories of scale is Hierarchy Theory (HT). Not surprisingly this theory provides an important framework for surveying and modelling a range of complex, multi-scale natural systems. In this thesis a range of models are developed that focus on contrasting sized Hawk Owls, the larger Powerful Owl (Ninox strenua) and the smaller Southern Boobook (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae).</b> The models are used to investigate owl distributions from the micro scale (sampling sites) through the meso scale (250 km 2 study area) in forests east of Bathurst NSW, to the macro scale (Bioregion). Two different types of modelling were used. The first is Regression (i. e. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)). The second type is Spatial Point Process (SPP) modelling. Whilst HT has a valuable role as a conceptual construct for multi scale ecological studies, the results from this study challenge some of the presumptions of HT and its relevance to cost effective, practical management. In this thesis I demonstrate that both regression models and spatial point process models {{have a role to play}} in predictive modelling. However, they require an adequate number of data points derived from rigorous spatial sampling design and survey methodology. Furthermore, the results of such models utilised within a specific landscape may lack the capacity to be extrapolated to other landscapes, as well as other locations in a species’ range. Important questions have been addressed relating to the value and role of multi scale spatial species distribution and species environment modelling. For some key species and for some broad scale landscapes, management and species conservation practices may require modelling studies, appropriate spatial sampling design and consequently, costly data requirements.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{importance of}} introduced mammalian predators is well acknowledged in New Zealand, however, {{little research has}} focused on the ecology of native avian predators and their role in communities. This study investigated the ecology of moreporks (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae)</b> on Ponui Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand between August 2007 and April 2008. The primary aim was to investigate the functional response of moreporks to availability of their prey. The contents of regurgitated morepork pellets were compared with relative abundance of prey taxa (invertebrates, small birds and rodents) over the study period. The diet consisted primarily of a range of invertebrate prey, particularly weta (Anostostomatidae and Raphidophoridae) and beetles (Coleoptera). Small numbers of vertebrate prey were recorded including rodents and birds. A positive relationship between the percentage contribution to pellet samples of certain taxa and their relative availability was found, and there were peaks in the occurrence of seasonally abundant taxa including cicadas (Cicadidae), and huhu beetles (Prionoplus reticularis). The tendency of moreporks to prey on abundant taxa indicates that they are unlikely to depress prey populations to low levels, and may have some degree of stabilising influence. A significant increase in the rodent component of the diet in April indicated that the risk to moreporks of secondary poisoning during mammalian pest control operations may vary considerably with the time of year. The secondary aims were to collect data on roost site characteristics and breeding success. Moreporks roosted at a mean height of 4 m, and foliar cover at the 4 - 6 m height tier appeared {{to be the most important}} characteristic of roost sites when compared with control sites. These findings suggested that moreporks were selecting roost sites with high overhead cover. Possible reasons for this include predator avoidance, avoidance of mobbing passerines, and the microclimate provided. None of three established pairs and two other birds were observed to establish a nest or breed successfully. Additionally, only three juvenile moreporks were sighted or heard across the 90 ha study area suggesting low breeding success in 2007 - 08. This may have been influenced by a range of factors including 1), predation by the high densities of ship rats on Ponui, or other predators 2), a lack of suitable nest sites such as tree hollows in some areas or 3), competition for invertebrate prey with high densities of ship rats and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) ...|$|R
40|$|According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red Data List {{nearly a}} quarter of the world's bird species are either {{threatened}} or at risk of extinction. To be able to protect endangered species, we need accurate survey methods that reliably estimate numbers and hence population trends. Acoustic monitoring is the most commonly-used method to survey birds, particularly cryptic and nocturnal species, not least because it is non-invasive, unbiased, and relatively time-effective. Unfortunately, the resulting data still have to be analysed manually. The current practice, manual spectrogram reading, is tedious, prone to bias due to observer variations, and not reproducible. While there is a large literature on automatic recognition of targeted recordings of small numbers of species, automatic analysis of long field recordings has not been well studied to date. This thesis considers this problem in detail, presenting experiments demonstrating the true efficacy of recorders in natural environments under different conditions, and then working to reduce the noise present in the recording, as well as to segment and recognise a range of New Zealand native bird species. The primary issues with field recordings are that the birds are at variable distances from the recorder, that the recordings are corrupted by many different forms of noise, that the environment affects the quality of the recorded sound, and that birdsong is often relatively rare within a recording. Thus, methods of dealing with faint calls, denoising, and effective segmentation are all needed before individual species can be recognised reliably. Experiments presented in this thesis demonstrate clearly the effects of distance and environment on recorded calls. Some of these results are unsurprising, for example an inverse square relationship with distance is largely true. Perhaps more surprising is that the height from which a call is transmitted has a signifcant effect on the recorded sound. Statistical analyses of the experiments, which demonstrate many significant environmental and sound factors, are presented. Regardless of these factors, the recordings have noise present, and removing this noise is helpful for reliable recognition. A method for denoising based on the wavelet packet decomposition is presented and demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of recordings. Following this, wavelets were also used to implement a call detection algorithm that identifies regions of the recording with calls from a target bird species. This algorithm is validated using four New Zealand native species namely Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus), brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli), morepork (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae),</b> and kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), but could be used for any species. The results demonstrate high recall rates and tolerate false positives when compared to human experts...|$|R
40|$|Predation is {{the highest}} cause of {{mortality}} for birds and can place intense selection pressures on their behavioural traits. A {{number of studies have}} shown that some animals have innate predator recognition, while others which are predator-naïve have been unable to adapt to the introduction of exotic predators. For my thesis, I firstly studied how eight species of introduced and native birds respond to model predators at their nests. This enabled me to determine whether the native birds have been able to adapt to introduced mammalian predators and have developed recognition of them being a threat. In most species, the reaction to the stoat (Mustela erminea) (an introduced predator) was similar to that of a model morepork (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae)</b> (a native predator). This suggests these species can successfully recognise introduced mammals as a risk. It also allowed me to test whether recently introduced birds have any innate recognition of snakes, which are a significant nest predator in their native ranges but do not exist in New Zealand. I found that introduced birds did not appear to have any recognition of snakes as being a threat. These losses and gains of recognition may have been caused by evolutionary changes or they may be influenced by learning and experience. Secondly, I examined how South Island robins (Petroica australis) on a predator-free island responded to predator models and compared this to the responses of robins on the mainland (where they co-occur with mammalian predators). The island birds were assumed to show the ancestral reactions to mammalian predators, while any differences in response shown by the mainland robins would indicate they had acquired these behaviours in response to increased predation risk. I found that the island robins did not appear to recognise or react to a taxidermic mount of a stoat while mainland robins did respond to the stoat, confirming that at least some native birds can develop recognition of novel predators. Finally, I compared the personalities of South Island robins on a predator-free island and on the mainland (where mammalian predators are present). I tested where individuals placed on the ‘bold-shy’ continuum by observing their willingness and speed to approach a risky situation in order to collect food. Studies have shown that average personality between populations can differ where predation risk differs. I found that the island robins were on average bolder than mainland robins. They came nearer to the observer and were faster to approach and remove a food item, while mainland robins were less likely to approach, and those that did approach took a longer time. It is likely that these differences were due to selection pressures by mammalian predators favouring shy individuals on the mainland while other pressures such as interspecific competition favours bold individuals on the island. Personality {{has been shown to be}} genetic and heritable, however, learning and experience cannot be ruled out and may also play a part in influencing how personality is expressed. Together, my results support the importance of historical and ontogenetic factors in influencing how predator recognition and personality traits are expressed...|$|R
40|$|Vocalisations {{provide an}} {{effective}} way to overcome the challenge of studying the behaviour of cryptic or nocturnal species. Knowledge of vocalisations can be applied to management strategies such as population census, monitoring, and territory mapping. The New Zealand Morepork (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae)</b> is a nocturnal raptor and, to date, there has been little research into their vocalisations even though this offers a key method for monitoring morepork populations. Although not at risk, population monitoring of morepork will help detect population size changes in this avian predator which may prey on native endangered fauna and may suffer secondary poisoning. This study investigated the vocal ecology of morepork on Ponui Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand from April 2013 to April 2014. The initial goal was to develop a monitoring method for morepork. However, {{due to a lack of}} detailed basic knowledge of their vocalisations, the primary objective shifted to filling that knowledge gap and providing baseline data for future research. The aims of this study were thus to characterise all of the calls given by the morepork on the island; to investigate spectral and temporal parameters of three main calls; to plot the amount of calling across a night and a year; and to study the responses of morepork to playback calls. Eight morepork were caught using mist-nets and subsequently tracked by radio-telemetry. Vocalisations were recorded using manual and automatic digital sound recorders and calls were analysed with manual and automated sound analysis software. I described eleven distinct calls, referred to as more-pork, trill, rororo, more-more-pork, weow, low trill, copulation squeal, single hoot, distress squeak, chicketting and juvenile begging trill and I further analysed the spectral and temporal characteristics of three main calls, more-pork, trill and rororo. I found variation between individual morepork in acoustic parameters of these call types. I found no evidence of sexual variation in the fundamental frequency, fundamental duration nor inter-syllable duration of the three call types. However, sample sizes were small (2 males to 7 females) and a larger sample size would be needed to confirm these results. The average number of all morepork call types showed temporal variation both nightly and monthly. A low amount of calling in winter months compared to summer appeared to coincide with the morepork breeding cycle. The highest numbers of call were heard from November to January, with the numbers of calls during this period being significantly higher than in all other months. The number of calls per hour showed two peaks: one around the middle of the night and the other during the last hour of darkness. The number of calls heard in the first two hours after sunset were significantly lower than during the rest of the night. Playbacks were effective in eliciting responses from morepork, but the proportion of responses to playback was lower than to natural calls. Response rates did not seem to be affected by season. Session time and order of playback had an effect on proportional responses as well as playback call-type whereby rororo elicited the most responses and trill elicited the fewest. This project broadened our knowledge of morepork vocal ecology and therefore contributes to our knowledge of raptor vocal communication. The study also presents information and recommendations that will be useful to future research and also in management of morepork. In particular, this project provides background information needed to help develop protocols for acoustic monitoring of morepork. The techniques used in this study and the general results can be used or applied to studies of other nocturnal species...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} general {{ecology of the}} Raptor Community living in the Canberra Region. In particular, we were {{interested}} in the productivity, reproductive success, food habits and trophic structure. We located 12 species of breeding raptors in the area, similar to previous surveys. Although we located most nests on fannland and non·urban nature reserves, there were II species were breeding inside the city limits, with the only exception being the White-bellied Sea Eagle Haliaeetus lellcogaster. a species that is mainly coastal but is also a breeding resident in this inland region, nesting in rivers and dams. The productivity and reproductive success of the community was high overall, with five species showing higher productivity than average, while four more had average productivity. Only two species had low breeding success and productivity. The Collared Sparrowhawk Accipiter cirrocephalus - who made breeding attempts but failed in most of them - and the Black-shouldered Kite Elanus axilaris - whose tenitories were inactive the first 18 months of survey. and only started breeding late in 2003. The diet of the raptors was similar to previous records, though there were exceptions. This study provided the first account of the food habits of inland Whitebellied Sea eagles. This species captured prey of aquatic origin, like the Australian Wood Duck Chenonettajubatta (23. 3 % of items and 26. 1 % biomass); fish (23. 3 and 26. 1 %) and reptiles (13. 3 and 13. 2 %). The diet of the Brown Goshawk Accipiter gentilis showed an unusually high number of insects (54. 4 %), but birds and mammals provided most of the biomass. The dietary overlap (based on the Pianka index) of the species was low compared to other studies. The trophic structure produced by the UPGMA cluster analysis revealed 3 main feeding guilds: a) Vertebrate-feeders: Wedge-tailed Eagle Aquila audax, Little Eagles Hieraaetus morphnoides and Whistling Kite Haliastur sphenurus, which based their diet on mammals and large birds; b) Insect-small vertebrates guild: formed by the Brown Falcon Falco berigora and the Brown Goshawk; and c) Insect-feeders; Composed by the Nankeen Kestrel F. cenchroides and the Southern Boobok <b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae.</b> The other five raptors were not grouped on any guild. Two of them were very specialized predators, the bird-catcher Peregrine Falcon F. peregrinus and the rodent-catcher Black-shouldered Kite. Finally, we explored some case studies on the topic of trophic dynamics. Two were comparisons of the diet of the same species living in the same area at different times. They provided contrasting examples ofprey-switching. Peregrines and Hobbies adjusted to a decrease in the abundance of their main prey, the Starling Sturnus vulgaris, by consuming small numbers of several native bird species. Interestingly, it seems that the Starling decline is related to an increase of Common Myna Acridotheres Iris/is, a species that neither falcon seems able to capture. On the other case Wedge-tailed Eagles changed from a diet dominated by rabbit to a diet dominated mainly by other species: Eastern Grey Kangaroos (Birds as a group were also important), thus switching one prey species with another, unlike the falcons. On the final example, we used an original approach to evaluate the dietary overlap of two species (Wedge-tails and Sea Eagles) by clustering neighbouring pairs, which are more likely to show interspecific interactions. The neighbouring pairs showed low overlap in their diets despite their close proximity...|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{disease can}} {{play a role in the}} {{population}} dynamics of wildlife species. The introduction of exotic birds and mammals into New Zealand has led to the introduction of novel diseases into the New Zealand avifauna such as avian malaria and toxoplasmosis. However the role of disease in New Zealand’s raptor population has not been widely reported. This study aims at investigating the presence and prevalence of disease among wild and captive New Zealand falcons (Falco novaeseelandiae), Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) and moreporks (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae).</b> A retrospective study of post-­‐mortem databases (the Huia database and the Massey University post-­‐mortem database) undertaken to determine the major causes of mortality in New Zealand’s raptors between 1990 and 2014 revealed that trauma and infectious agents were the most frequently encountered causes of death in these birds. However, except for a single case report of serratospiculosis in a New Zealand falcon observed by Green et al in 2006, no other infectious agents have been reported among the country’s raptors to date in the peer reviewed literature. During the review of post-­‐mortem records, organisms like Mycobacterium avium, Serratospiculum sp, Sarcocystis spp, Trichomonas galllinae and several unidentified helminths were identified as contributing or definite causes of mortality in all three species of raptors. But neither Plasmodium spp nor Toxoplasma gondii infections have been demonstrated in these birds so far. Therefore, a separate study was designed to determine the presence of these pathogens in New Zealand falcon, Australasian harrier and morepork tissues, using established molecular techniques. Molecular analysis of archived New Zealand raptor tissues confirmed the presence of both Plasmodium spp (10 / 117; 8. 5 %) and T. gondii (9 / 117; 7. 7 %) in all three species of raptors. Plasmodium strains identified were P. elongatum GRW 6, P. sp AFTRU 5, and P. relictum GRW 4 and SGS 1. Surprisingly, two Australasian harriers and one morepork tested for the presence of both Plasmodium spp and T. gondii as concomitant infections. However, it is unknown whether any of the positive tested birds suffered from clinical infections, since post-­‐mortem records had no record of clinical signs of disease associated with either infections in these birds. Once the presence of the aforementioned pathogens among New Zealand raptors was established, an attempt was made to investigate their presence among live raptor populations as well. Blood samples were collected from raptors being admitted to Wildbase Hospital, Massey University, Palmerston North and Wingspan-­‐ Birds of Prey Research Centre, Rotorua. Molecular analysis of these samples by PCR did not reveal the presence of Plasmodium spp in any of the ii tested birds, but one New Zealand falcon, Australasian harrier and morepork each tested positive for the presence of T. gondii. Interestingly, none of the positive birds showed any signs of clinical illness that may be associated with toxoplasmosis in raptors. We also analysed faecal samples and throat swabs from these birds to determine the presence of pathogens like Caryospora spp, Serratospiculum spp, Salmonella spp and T. gallinae, since many of these organisms have been detected in New Zealand and are also found affecting raptors in other parts of the world. However, apart from eggs resembling Capillaria spp, none of the other pathogens listed above were identified. My study has some limitations such as a small sample size and a geographic bias in terms of birds being submitted to Massey University, Palmerston North for post-­‐mortem analysis. But this research may be regarded as the first report of Plasmodium spp and T. gondii infections among New Zealand’s three well-­‐known raptor species and further research is required to determine the prevalence of these pathogens among the country’s total raptor population, pathogenicity of the organisms towards them and the role of these birds in the epidemiology of these diseases within New Zealan...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} ways {{to improve}} biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level in Australia {{through the use of}} geospatial science technologies and biological modelling techniques. Following a review of approaches to biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level, including the roles and potential of geospatial science technologies in this regard, I consider biodiversity modelling using a case study of the Burt Plain bioregion in central Australia that focuses on selected taxa, ecosystems and landscapes. The Burt Plain bioregion was chosen since it is one of 19 bioregions nationally that has been given a &# 039;very high&# 039; priority status for biological survey, assessment and potential reservation of land for conservation purposes. The specific research objectives for the Burt Plain bioregion study were to: · describe the species composition, distribution and nature of the dominant vegetation communities within the bioregion; · characterise environmental niche of communities with respect to selected environmental and management variables - latitude, longitude, climate, land systems and land units, geology, hydrography, topography, and tenure; · analyse how well or otherwise taxa have been sampled (during previous ground surveys) with respect to geographical and environmental variables; Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level · develop and compare quantitative habitat models of the potential distribution of selected species based on presence-only distributional data; and · examine the significance of radiometric data as a potential correlate and predictor of the distribution of those selected species. National conservation initiatives such as the bioregional approach and international initiatives such as the biosphere reserves program to support the planning and management of biodiversity conservation are discussed in chapter two. The scientific and related processes underpinning the development of bioregions and strategies across the Australian states and territories are then considered. An important finding arising from this review is the need to improve biological information, especially through systematic surveys and on-going monitoring of ecosystems and populations of species, at the bioregional level to inform land use allocation and management. This finding is consistent with one of the general aims of the thesis to improve the spatial modelling techniques available for bioregional assessment and biodiversity conservation. In chapter three I review the role and limitations of geospatial technologies currently employed for biodiversity conservation management. Current developments and applications of GIS and remote sensing to wildlife research, conservation gap analysis and conservation reserve design are considered. Geographic information systems (GIS) are now routinely used by ecologists to Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level analyse spatial data. Although various forms of GIS have been available for 15 to 25 years, the biological applications of GIS have figured most prominently in the ecological literature only in the past 15 years. The use of computer-generated models to simulate environmental events can provide a greater understanding of ecosystems, and offers improved predictive powers to conservation and land managers. The decision support offered by computer-based modelling techniques appears likely to underpin conservation and management decisions much more into the future providing that adequate biological and other datasets are available for this purpose. Dominant vegetation communities and various environmental gradients were analysed to characterise environmental niches at the bioregional scale for the Burt Plain bioregion (Chapter 4) and more locally at the catchment scale for the Upper Todd River Catchment (Chapter 5). In Chapters four and five I describe in detail the land tenure and use, land systems, climate soil, geology, topography, hydrology, vegetation and biodiversity of the Burt Plain bioregion and Upper Todd River Catchment. The bioregion contains some ephemeral watercourses, which are generally in fair to good condition, but are afforded little protection from a range of threatening processes, including grazing and trampling by feral animals and livestock and weed infestation. The major river systems occurring in the bioregion include parts of the Plenty, Hanson, Sandover and Lander Rivers. In the Upper Todd River Catchment the major watercourses Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level are the Todd River and Station Creek, which exit the area via two narrow gaps in the low rocky hills on the southern boundary of the bioregion. The dominant geology can be summarised as plains and low rocky ranges of Pre-Cambrian granites on red earths. The bioregion has approximately 200 - 250 mm of summer rainfall, with rainfall occurring on 20 - 30 days per year. There is a high variability and range of temperatures, with an annual mean temperature of approximately 22 - 23 °C. In Chapter six I consider a range of species found within the Burt Plain bioregion using existing survey data and techniques that enables the prediction of the spatial distribution of taxa. Using GLM and GAM models, Black-footed Rock- Wallaby (Petrogale lateralis), Spinifex Hopping Mouse (Notomys alexis) and Spencers Frog (Limnodynastes spenceri) were chosen for a more in-depth analysis. Environmental variables correlated with the presence of each species are then described and prediction maps showing the probability or likelihood of the presence of the species within the bioregion developed. In Chapter seven I examine the utility of radiometric data for wildlife habitat modelling. Statistical relationships are tested between the concentrations of the elements uranium, thorium and potassium and terrain characteristics such as position in the landscape, slope and aspect as well as other climatic variables. Radiometric data were found to be useful for developing statistical predictive Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level models of six species: Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus), Desert Dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni), Rabbit (Orcytolagus cuniculus), Brown Honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), Little Spotted Snake (Suda punctata) and Southern Boobook (<b>Ninox</b> <b>novaeseelandiae).</b> I suggest that the utility of radiometric data for wildlife habitat modelling would appear significant and should be explored further using alternative quantitative modelling techniques and presence/ absence records for target faunal species. Predictions of species distributions may be useful for prioritising land acquisitions for reservation {{as well as in the}} future design of biological surveys. The thesis concludes with a synthesis of the major research findings, discussion of the limitations of the datasets available for the study, perspectives on management issues in the Burt Plain bioregion, and possible future research directions. It is important that purposefully-designed biological survey research be undertaken across the bioregions of the arid zone of Australia to enhance basic understanding of biodiversity patterns and their relationships to environmental heterogeneity and site-landscape level processes. Geospatial modelling techniques can assist such biodiversity survey and evaluation and make their conduct more cost-efficient and the inferences drawn from subsequent data analyses more powerful. This knowledge is required to contribute to the emergent concepts and theory of ecosystem dynamics and associated biodiversity patterns in arid Australia and, most significantly, to enhance the conservation and management of the unique biological complement and systems found in this region...|$|R
