40|$|The role {{of nuclear}} spin {{fluctuations}} in the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins by electrons is investigated in (In,Ga) As quantum dots. The photoluminescence polarization under circularly polarized optical pumping in transverse magnetic fields (Hanle effect) is studied. A weak additional magnetic field parallel to the optical axis is used to control the efficiency of <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>cooling</b> and the sign of nuclear spin temperature. The shape of the Hanle curve is drastically modified with changing this control field, as observed earlier in bulk semiconductors and quantum wells. However, the standard <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>cooling</b> theory, operating with the mean nuclear magnetic field (Overhauser field), fails to describe the experimental Hanle curves in a certain range of control fields. This controversy is resolved by {{taking into account the}} nuclear spin fluctuations owed to the finite number of nuclei in the quantum dot. We propose a model describing <b>cooling</b> of the <b>nuclear</b> spin system by electron spins experiencing fast vector precession in the random Overhauser fields of nuclear spin fluctuations. The model allows us to accurately describe the measured Hanle curves and to determine the parameters of the electron-nuclear spin system of the studied quantum dots. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

We monitor {{the temperature of the}} He- 3 inside the blackbody radiator using a vibrating wire resonator. We find that reducing the magnetic field on the aerogel sample causes substantial cooling of all the superfluid inside the blackbody radiator.

40|$|Electron spins in {{semiconductors}} {{are considered}} as candidates for quantum bits. This thesis presents {{a study of}} the spin dynamics of the strongly localized donor-bound electrons in fluorine-doped ZnSe epilayers via pump-probe Kerr rotation technique. A method exploiting the spin inertia is developed and used to measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time (T 1). The excitation of the same samples with helicity-modulated laser pulses results in a transverse nuclear spin polarization, which was detected as a change of the Larmor precession frequency of the donor-bound electron spins in a magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry. A mechanism of optically induced nuclear spin polarization is suggested based on the concept of resonant <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>cooling</b> driven by the inhomogeneous Knight field of the donor-bound electron. The all-optical induction and detection of the nuclear spin polarization allow us to measure the T 1 time of the selenium- 77 isotope. We combine the optical technique with radio frequency methods to measure the inhomogeneous spin dephasing time and the coherence time T 2 of the selenium- 77 isotope. While the T 1 time is on the order of several milliseconds, the T 2 time is several hundred microseconds. This verifies the validity of the classical model of <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>cooling</b> describing the optically induced nuclear spin polarization...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is an {{extremely}} important issue in <b>nuclear</b> <b>cooling</b> system applications. Many scientific and engineering efforts have been contributed to the research of finding an ideal material, which has resistance to corrosive Lead Bismuth Eutectic (LBE). A Delta Loop was designed and constructed in Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) to obtain the experimental data. This loop is a multi-section closed system that differs in diameter from one part to another. As a result, an intensive study on the geometry effect is hence necessary and valuable. In this thesis, this problem was simulated by commercial software STAR-CD. Results provide a good prediction where the highest corrosion rate might occur and how geometry will affect the local corrosion phenomenon. Simple study on reactive flow {{was carried out by}} using STAR-CD + CHEMKIN, which is designed for solving reactions both in flow and on surface. In addition, a self-developed code using finite difference method was employed to reveal how mass transfer is affected by geometry and flow. Parametric study on several factors was carried out...|$|E
40|$|The reexamination {{argument}} on nuclear power has arisen after the Fukushima accident. When nuclear power generation has been stopped, it is forced however, {{to depend on}} thermal power generation. In that case, the two serious problems of a jump of fuel cost and of global warming issue, that is CO 2 emission issue, will be faced. So, it is still required for nuclear power generation to take an important part as basic energy source in our country for years to come. In this paper, we will describe {{the outline of the}} severe accident such as a SBO (Station Blackout) accident which happened in Fukushima and also discuss the safety assessment for the plant action when a SBO accident occurred in the case of PWR power plant through the simulation experiments using a PWR power plant simulator. As a result, fuel and fuel cladding temperatures rose abruptly about 3 hours after the SBO accident occurrence for loss of <b>nuclear</b> <b>cooling</b> functions, and it was also shown that cladding tubes damages begin. Conversely, even if a SBO accident should have happened, when power supply restoration was possible within about 3 hours, it was shown that a nuclear reactor can be changed into a cold shutdown state...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{effective}} parameters such as iron oxide nanoparticles dosage, contact time and solution pH was optimized for removal of Ag(I) and Ni(II) in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>cooling</b> {{system and the}} best conditions were compared. Nearly complete removal (97 %) of Ni(II) and Ag(I) were obtained at adsorbent dosage of 40 and 20 g/L, respectively. Experiments showed that 4 hours was a good choice as optimum contact time for two ions removal. The effective parameter was pH, so that maximum removal efficiency was obtained for Ag(I) in acidic pH= 3 and for Ni(II) in basic pH= 10. It seems that removal of Ag(I) was controlled by adsorption-reduction mechanism, but Ni(II) could place only adsorption. Langmuir and Freundlich model was more suitable for nickel and silver removal by this adsorbent, respectively. Ag(I) and Ni(II) removal efficiency trend by this adsorbent is similar at periods but different in the concentrations, pHs and equilibrium model. The obtained results were very promising, as both Ag(I) and Ni(II) were effectively removed from synthetic wastewater {{and there was a}} possibility to remove Ag(I) very fast. Hence, the idea of using nanoparticles for application of metal ions removal from wastewaters seems to be very efficient and quite promising...|$|E
