500|$|On March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., Sotomayor {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new {{collective bargaining agreement}} and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, {{the day before the}} new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling. [...] The decision raised her profile, won her the plaudits of baseball fans, and had a lasting effect on the game. In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, [...] "I hope <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the South Bronx without knowing about baseball." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1930, {{the quality}} of the {{professional}} game was still in question, with many claiming the college [...] "amateurs" [...] played with more intensity. In December 1930, the Giants played a team of Notre Dame All-Stars at the Polo Grounds {{to raise money for the}} unemployed of New York City. It was also an opportunity to establish the superiority of the pro game. Knute Rockne reassembled his Four Horsemen along with other Notre Dame legends, and told them to score early, then defend. But from the beginning, it was a one-sided contest, with Benny Friedman running for two Giants touchdowns and Hap Moran passing for another. Notre Dame failed to score. When it was over, Rockne told his team, '"hat was the greatest football machine I ever saw. I am glad <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> got hurt." [...] The game raised $115,183 for the homeless, and is often credited with establishing the legitimacy of the professional game.|$|E
