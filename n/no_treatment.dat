5|$|Aphids, {{mealybugs}} {{and other}} invertebrate pests can spread viruses. Symptoms {{vary with the}} species, but a loss of vigour is usual. Cactus virus X has been isolated from S. truncata. There is <b>no</b> <b>treatment</b> for virus diseases; {{it is recommended that}} infected plants be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was better than <b>no</b> <b>treatment</b> for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for {{improving}} function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no better than <b>no</b> <b>treatment</b> for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} <b>no</b> <b>treatment</b> and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. <b>No</b> <b>treatment</b> has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and <b>no</b> <b>treatment</b> has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E

5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but <b>no</b> <b>treatment</b> could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires <b>no</b> <b>treatment</b> apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and require <b>no</b> <b>treatment.</b> In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E

50|$|Because pachygyria is a {{structural}} defect <b>no</b> <b>treatments</b> are currently available other than symptomatic treatments, especially for associated seizures. Another common treatment is a gastrostomy (insertion of a feeding tube) to reduce possible poor nutrition and repeated aspiration pneumonia.|$|R
25|$|Some water {{demanding}} activities do {{not require}} high grade water. In this case, wastewater can be reused with little or <b>no</b> <b>treatment.</b> One example of this scenario is in the domestic environment where toilets can be flushed using greywater from baths and showers with little or <b>no</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E
