RESULTS: VDR(-/-) <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> are rachitic and have lower numbers of putative regulator cells [TCR-alpha/beta(+) CD 4 (-) CD 8 (-) (natural killer T-cells) and CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) T-cells [in central and peripheral immune organs compared with VDR(+/+) NOD littermates. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated VDR(-/-) NOD macrophages expressed lower interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 6, and CC chemokine ligand 2 mRNA, correlating with less nuclear translocation of p 65 nuclear factor-kappaB compared with VDR(+/+) NOD macrophages.

50|$|Non-obese {{diabetic}} or NOD mice, {{like the}} Biobreeding rat, {{are used as}} an animal model for type 1 diabetes.

We tested in vivo {{the sensitivity of the}} cells to rejection and the protective effect of genetic alterations in <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> METHODS: betaTC-tet cells and genetically engineered lines expressing Bcl- 2 (CDM 3 D), a dominant negative mutant of MyD 88 or SOCS- 1 were transplanted in diabetic female <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> or in male <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> with diabetes induced by high-dose streptozotocin. Survival of functional cell grafts in NOD-scid mice was also analyzed after transfer of splenocytes from diabetic <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> Autoreactive T-cell hybridomas and splenocytes from diabetic <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> were stimulated by betaTC-tet cells. RESULTS: betaTC-tet cells and genetically engineered cell lines were all similarly rejected in diabetic <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> and in NOD-scid mice after splenocyte transfer. In 3 - to 6 -week-old male <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> treated with high-dose streptozotocin, the cells temporarily survived, in contrast with C 57 BL/ 6 mice treated with high-dose streptozotocin (indefinite survival) and untreated 3 - to 6 -week-old male <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> (rejection). The protective effect of high-dose streptozotocin was lost in older male <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> betaTC-tet cells did not stimulate autoreactive T-cell hybridomas, but induced IL- 2 secretion by splenocytes from diabetic <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The autoimmune process seems {{to play an important role}} in the destruction of betaTC-tet cells in <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> Genetic manipulations intended at increasing the resistance of beta cells were inefficient.

METHODS: During gestation and postpartum, mice were analyzed under basal feed conditions, and following glucose injection (1 g/kg, i. p.) after overnight fast, using glucose tolerance test (GTT). Glycemia, corticosteronemia, blood and pancreatic insulin, glucagon levels, islet size, and islet morphology were evaluated. Glycemia and mortality were assessed after successive gestations in <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> mated {{for the first time}} at 2 different ages. RESULTS: 1. Basal glucagonemia rose markedly in first-gestation fed <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> 2. β-cell hyperactivity was present earlier in first-gestation non-diabetic fasted <b>NOD</b> and NOD/SCID <b>mice</b> than in age-matched C 57 BL/ 6 mice, assessed by increased insulin/glucose ratio after GTT. 3.

We propose that the resistance of <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> lymphocytes to GC-induced apoptosis is because of inhibition of the repressive action of GC-GR complexes at the level of c-myc transcription. This deficient action of GC-GR results in increased production of nuclear Myc protein, peculiar to <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> cells, following their treatment with GC...|$|R
40|$|<b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> spontaneously develop {{autoimmune}} diabetes. One of the manipulations {{that prevent}} diabetes in <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> is infection with mycobacteria or immunization of mice with mycobacteria-containing adjuvant. Infection of <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> with Mycobacterium avium, done before the mice show overt diabetes, results in permanent {{protection of the}} animals from diabetes and this protective effect is associated with increased numbers of CD 4 + T cells and B 220 + B cells. Here, we investigate whether the M. avium-induced protection of <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> from diabetes was associated with changes in the expression of Fas (CD 95) and FasL by immune cells, as well as alterations in cytotoxic activity, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and IL- 4 production and activation of T cells of infected animals. Our data indicate that protection of <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> from diabetes is a Th 1 -type response that is mediated by up-regulation of the Fas–FasL pathway and involves {{an increase in the}} cytotoxicity of T cells. These changes are consistent with induction by the infection of regulatory T cells with the ability of triggering deletion or anergy of peripheral self-reactive lymphocytes that cause the autoimmune disease of <b>NOD</b> <b>mice...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that an insulin 2 gene knockout, when bred onto nonobese diabetic (<b>NOD)</b> <b>mice,</b> accelerates diabetes. We produced insulin 1 gene knockout congenic <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> In contrast to insulin 2, diabetes and insulitis were markedly reduced in insulin 1 knockout mice, with decreased and delayed diabetes in heterozygous females and no insulitis and diabetes in most homozygous female mice. Lack of insulitis was found for insulin 1 female homozygous knockout mice at 8, 12, and 37 weeks of age. Despite a lack of insulitis, insulin 1 homozygous knockout mice spontaneously expressed insulin autoantibodies. Administration of insulin peptide B: 9 - 23 of both insulin 1 and 2 to <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> induced insulin autoantibodies. Insulin 1 is not the only lymphocytic target of <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> Insulin 1 homozygous knockout islets, when transplanted into recently diabetic wild-type <b>NOD</b> <b>mice,</b> became infiltrated with lymphocytes and only transiently reversed diabetes. These observations indicate that loss of either insulin gene can influence progression to diabetes of <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> and suggest that the preproinsulin 1 gene is crucial for the spontaneous development of NOD insulitis and diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Immunotherapy {{can be used}} {{to induce}} {{immunological}} tolerance by a number of different protocols. During the last decade the ability to use tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) to prevent autoimmunity has received much attention. Many studies have attempted to use immature or semi-mature DCs to induce tolerance in the non-obese diabetic (<b>NOD)</b> <b>mouse</b> model of human type 1 diabetes. However, most studies to date have used protocols in which generation of DCs involved a culture step in fetal bovine serum (FBS) -supplemented medium which may affect tolerance induction in a non-specific fashion. Indeed, several studies have shown that DCs cultured in the presence of FBS will induce a powerful T helper type 2 (Th 2) immune response towards FBS-related antigens which can suppress an ongoing immune response. Hence, this may interfere with diabetes development in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> by induction of immune deviation rather than by antigen-specific tolerance. In order to test whether antigen-specific tolerance induction by DC therapy is feasible in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse,</b> we therefore generated immature DCs using autologous serum [normal mouse serum (NMS) -supplemented cultures] instead of FBS, and we show that these DCs can protect NOD mice from diabetes, if pulsed with insulin-peptide antigens before adoptive transfer. Our data therefore support that DC therapy is able to prevent diabetes in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> in an antigen-specific manner...|$|E
40|$|The nonobese {{diabetic}} (NOD) ' mouse is a {{model of}} human type I diabetes mellitus (1 - 4). The diabetic processes that occur in both species appear to reflect an autoimmune response to the insulin-producing Q cells within the islets of the pancreas (5 - 7). Helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes are found within the affected islets in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> (6, 8). We (9), and Bendelac et al. (10), have recently demonstrated that both the CD 4 and CD 8 T cell subsets are necessary to transfer diabetes in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse.</b> As in man, diabetes in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> is controlled by multiple genetic loci, including one that is linked to, or is located within, the MHC (11 - 13). Although the stimulus for the induction of an autoimmune response in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> is still unknown, periductal and perivascular infiltrates and insulitis are observed within the pancreas beginning at 3 - 5 wk of age (2, 3). To determine whether the primary genetic defect that causes insulitis and diabetes in the NODmouse resides in the immune system or, alternatively, in the tissue that is the target of the autoimmune response, we have initiated a series of studies using irradiated (NOD x B 10) F 1 mice that have been reconstituted with NOD bon...|$|E
40|$|The many commonalities {{between the}} {{development}} of autoimmune diabetes in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> and its development in patients with Type I Diabetes Mellitus have made this model a paradigm for the investigation of autoimmune disease. However, the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> is also susceptible to a panoply of other autoimmune disease manifestations suggesting that this murine system may model more than just diabetes. In Chapter III, we explore {{the possibility that the}} immune system of the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> may share features with other autoimmune prone murine strains. We demonstrate here that CD 4 T cell hypoproliferation which has been extensively characterized in the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> also characterizes the MRL/MpJ and NZBxNZW models of lupus. In Chapter IV, we dissect this phenotype and determine that it is not intrinsic to the T cell compartment of these strains. Rather, it results from reliance on B cell mediated co-stimulation, a finding that implicates deficiencies in other professional APC compartments or altered B cell APC function in these diseases processes. In Chapter V, we utilize a chimeric system within the NOD background to discriminate among these possibilities. Our studies indicate that deficiencies within the compartments of professional APCs may be a crucial factor in {{the development of}} an immune system prone to autoimmune disease. In Chapter VI, we continue to explore the contribution of APC function to the establishment of tolerance. Studies here suggest that the B lymphocyte compartment may {{play a critical role in}} the induction of tolerance mediated by anti-CD 45 RB. The delicate contributions of APC function to the generation and maintenance of a tolerant state may underlie both the development of autoimmunity within the <b>NOD</b> <b>mouse</b> and its subsequent resistance to curative regimens designed to promote tolerance to grafted tissue. ...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear factor-κB protein c-Rel plays a {{critical}} role in controlling autoimmunity. c-Rel–deficient mice are resistant to streptozotocin-induced diabetes, a drug-induced model of autoimmune diabetes. We generated c-Rel–deficient <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> to examine the role of c-Rel in the development of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. We found that both CD 4 ^+ and CD 8 ^+ T cells from c-Rel–deficient <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> showed significantly decreased T-cell receptor–induced IL- 2, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF expression. Despite compromised T-cell function, c-Rel deficiency dramatically accelerated insulitis and hyperglycemia in <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> along with a substantial reduction in T-regulatory (Treg) cell numbers. Supplementation of isogenic c-Rel–competent Treg cells from prediabetic <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> reversed the accelerated diabetes development in c-Rel–deficient <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> The results suggest that c-Rel–dependent Treg cell function is critical in suppressing early-onset autoimmune diabetogenesis in <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> This study provides a novel natural system to study autoimmune diabetes pathogenesis and reveals a previously unknown c-Rel–dependent mechanistic difference between chemically induced and spontaneous diabetogenesis. The study also reveals a unique protective role of c-Rel in autoimmune diabetes, which is distinct from other T-cell–dependent autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, where c-Rel promotes autoimmunity...|$|R
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} acceleration in nonobese diabetic (<b>NOD)</b> <b>mice</b> through coxsackievirus B 4 (CVB 4) infection {{requires a}} preexisting {{critical mass of}} autoreactive T cells in pancreatic islets, {{and in the absence}} of this insulitic threshold, CVB 4 infection leads to long-term disease protection. To understand this acceleration and protection process, we challenged 8 - and 12 -week-old <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> containing a disruption in interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) or gamma interferon (IFN-γ) genes (NOD IL- 4 −/− and NOD IFN-γ−/−, respectively) with a diabetogenic, pancreatropic Edwards strain of CVB 4. The elimination of IL- 4 did not alter the rate of insulitis or diabetes development in <b>NOD</b> <b>mice,</b> while the elimination of IFN-γ delayed these events several weeks. CVB 4 infection in 8 -week-old mice only significantly accelerated the onset of diabetes in a subset of standard, but not IL- 4 - or IFN-γ-deficient, <b>NOD</b> <b>mice.</b> Long-term diabetes protection was established in standard <b>NOD</b> <b>mice</b> as well as in the <b>NOD</b> IFN-γ−/− <b>mice</b> that did not rapidly develop disease following CVB 4 infection at 8 weeks of age.
