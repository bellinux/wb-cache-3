40|$|Bulgaria is a {{significant}} natural gas transit state in the EU (a role set to increase with the South Stream and potential <b>Nabucco</b> West <b>gas</b> <b>pipelines)</b> and a Member State subject to EU regulation. As a result, the regulation of natural gas {{in the country is}} of direct relevance to the development, implementation and realisation of EU energy security policy. However, the transposition of the EU’s Third Energy package seem to be dependent on the role of intermediaries in the process of transiting natural gas through and within Bulgaria. This paper uses a conceptual frame which merges literature on energy infrastructure networks, intermediaries and power to explain some key problems for natural gas supply policy in Bulgaria and the lack of transparency within the sector. The conclusion offers an explanation of how the existence of Bulgarian intermediaries influences the use of national natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipelines</b> as transmission belts for national, Russian and EU policy, as well as a series of objectives including: increasing household gasification, further liberalisation of the Bulgarian natural gas market and increasing transparency in Bulgarian energy policy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fire risk of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage is high. The factors {{contributing}} to <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage most are third party damage, corrosion, design and incorrect operation. The accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage and quantitative risk assessment method of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage consequence are analyzed. In order to achieve quantitative fire risk assessment of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and thermal radiation damage criterion are analyzed. Firstly, the gas leakage quantity is estimated. Then, the heat radiation estimate flux, the thermal dose and damage range are got by using flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and the thermal radiation damage criterion respectively. Combined with an example of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline,</b> damage ranges of different disaster patterns are estimated according to different <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage pattern. Through comparing the accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, this paper provides some reliable scientific references for <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> management departments...|$|R

50|$|On 4 September 2008, Iran's {{deputy foreign}} {{minister}} Mehti Safari confirmed that Tehran opposes the construction of any undersea pipelines in the Caspian because of environmental concerns. This jeopardizes the Trans-Caspian Gas pipeline project, according to regional expert Paul Goble. However, on 22 December 2008 Austria's OMV and Germany's RWE, both partners in <b>Nabucco</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Pipeline</b> International GmbH, announced they were setting up a joint venture named the Caspian Energy Company, to carry out exploration for a gas pipeline across the Caspian Sea that would feed into the Nabucco pipeline.

50|$|The Nabucco {{pipeline}} {{will supply}} {{only a limited}} number of countries in South-East and Central Europe. In 2013, it was confirmed by Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev that the pipeline would transport gas to a minimum of 16 European countries including the gas hub in Baumgarten, Austria. The project has been criticized as uneconomic because there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable. The <b>Nabucco</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Pipeline</b> project, although initially intending to secure gas from Iraq and Iran has readjusted its intentions given the current political and economic instabilities in the two countries. It will initially transport 10 BCM from the Shah Deniz gas field with the ability to increase its capacity to 23 BCM as demand increases, along with supply. One region that could also supply additional gas is the Black Sea, with OMV and Exxon Mobil announcing an enormous gas discovery in February 2012.|$|E
40|$|The incessant oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> vandalization (sabotage) in {{developing}} nations like Nigeria has become a thing of serious concern which threatens both human and national security.

Taking only the lifecycle view of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> management cannot fully account for the problem of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> vandalization (sabotage) since this problem involves certain factors external to the oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline.</b> To fully account for such problem, the stakeholder perspective which puts into consideration all factors external to the oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> will be adopted as well.

40|$|South Stream and Nabucco {{are planned}} {{southern}} corridor projects {{for natural gas}} supply to Europe. South Stream is a Russian construction project of the gas pipeline with the capacity of 63 bcm of natural gas per year. It will connect Russia with Austria through Black Sea, Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary, and with southern Italy through Greece and Ionian Sea, respectively. Nabucco is a European Union planned gas pipeline with the capacity of 31 bcm per year. If built, it will connect Caspian Region and Middle East with Austria through Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. Gas sources for South Stream pipeline are known and available, however it’s construction will be expensive. <b>Nabucco</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> construction costs will be two times less, but the unresolved political relations and non-existent infrastructure have caused it to have no available gas sources at the moment.
