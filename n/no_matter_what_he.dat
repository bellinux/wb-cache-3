5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

25|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm {{beliefs about the}} importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.|$|E
25|$|Thor {{agrees to}} compete in a {{drinking}} contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. Útgarða-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. Útgarða-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, Útgarða-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.|$|E

5000|$|Ahead of the album's release, Renowned for Sound {{published}} a 5 star review which praised Henderson's time on The X Factor Australia as being [...] "the most versatile and well-rounded contestant on the show". The article states about the album and Henderson's performance: [...] "Taylor Henderson has {{a voice that}} you can’t help but want to listen to, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> singing. Part of what makes him so exceptional is that his voice always has the right tone for the right song, and doesn’t {{make the mistake of}} over-singing like so many others".|$|R
25|$|In the 1964 presidential campaign, Johnson restated his {{determination}} to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea; but privately he {{had a sense of}} foreboding about Vietnam—a feeling that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did things would end badly. Indeed, his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls. By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam. U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago, {{there was a}} rich {{merchant}} and his beautiful wife who lived happily in a big house. Despite their good fortune, the couple didn't have any children. One day, they went together to a shrine and made an offering of twelve banana hands to a tree spirit. Not long thereafter the wife became pregnant and the rich man wished {{with all his might}} that the child would be a boy, but his wife gave birth to a girl. His wife, however, conceived again and again. She became pregnant twelve times and each time she had a daughter. By that time his business started to go wrong for him since the ships that took his goods to sell in another country were robbed several times. Finally the rich merchant ended up borrowing a lot of money from his friends trying to fix his business problems. Yet, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, his family kept getting poorer.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} was in stalemate until July 1993, when Abkhaz separatist militias launched an abortive attack on Georgian-held Sukhumi. They surrounded and heavily shelled the capital, where Shevardnadze was trapped. The warring sides {{agreed to a}} Russian-brokered truce in Sochi {{at the end of}} July. But the ceasefire broke down again on 16 September 1993. Abkhaz forces, with armed support from outside Abkhazia, launched attacks on Sukhumi and Ochamchira. Notwithstanding UN Security Council's call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and its condemnation of the violation of the ceasefire by the Abkhaz side, fighting continued. After ten days of heavy fighting, Sukhumi was taken by Abkhazian forces on 27 September 1993. Shevardnadze narrowly escaped death, after vowing to stay in the city <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what.</b> <b>He</b> was forced to flee when separatist snipers fired on the hotel where he was staying. Abkhaz, North Caucasian militants, and their allies committed numerous atrocities against the city's remaining ethnic Georgians, in what has been dubbed the Sukhumi Massacre. The mass killings and destruction continued for two weeks, leaving thousands dead and missing.|$|E

And {{all the while}} the music sounds natural." [...] Gilbert said [...] "Guthrie Govan gives shred a good name.

He wasn't too clever afterwards and his heart was beating ten to the dozen. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> always run as hard as he can and tried his heart out. He's roughed up and out in the paddock now, happy. He's a very popular horse and he gets plenty of cards from people and things like boxes of polo mints. The crowd at Beverley loved him." ...|$|R

He got to the thing where it swung <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing."

500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E

The thinking behind this justification {{may never be}} known since Radcliffe [...] "destroyed all his papers before he left India". He departed on Independence Day itself, before even the boundary awards were distributed. By his own admission, Radcliffe was heavily influenced by his lack of fitness for the Indian climate and his eagerness to depart India.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Potter as Hiro Hamada, a 14-year-old {{robotics}} prodigy. Speaking of the character, co-director Don Hall said [...] "Hiro is transitioning from boy to man, it's a {{tough time}} for a kid and some teenagers develop that inevitable snarkiness and jaded attitude. Luckily Ryan is a very likeable kid. So <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, {{he was able to}} take the edge off the character {{in a way that made}} him authentic, but appealing".|$|E
50|$|The {{methods that}} are used to achieve this are barbaric {{although}} quite understandable considering the low technology development of Great and mighty Cliff's country. The prisoners are forced to stop a machine on the highway with their own bodies, often dying in the attempt, and then to press all possible buttons, levers and keys or try to start the motors manually. Very often nothing happens, in rare occasions the machines explode, but if someone manages to make a machine move he (women are not assigned to this task) is immediately granted amnesty <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done before. Apparently that's the only reason that keeps the prisoners from revolting.|$|R

2500|$|His {{religious}} {{paintings were}} sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ {{in the sky}} in his painting of Saint-Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of Simon Vouet for having [...] "Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy". Poussin responded that [...] "he could {{not and should not}} imagine a Christ, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to look him in the face".|$|E
2500|$|In itself, {{this line}} lays the final {{capstone}} on Hamlet's decision. The line appears to base this decision on his believed predestination as {{the killer of}} the king, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> may do. [...] The potential allusion to predestinarian theology is even stronger in the first published version of Hamlet, Quarto 1, where this same line reads: [...] "There's a predestinate providence {{in the fall of}} a sparrow." [...] Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare was censored, as the word [...] "predestined" [...] appears in this one Quarto of Hamlet, but not in others, and as censoring of plays was far from unusual at the time.|$|E
