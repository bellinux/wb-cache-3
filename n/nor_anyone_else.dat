5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> had the right to say where he should live.|$|E

5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E

Williams is serving his sentence at Telfair State Prison.|$|E
25|$|With another World War looming, 1939 was the {{beginning}} of a difficult period, not just for Pinchon and other artists, but for the vast majority of the world's nations. Pinchon was deeply saddened by the human folly that would lead to such a turn of events. Neither he <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> could have imagined the human loss and destruction that would be unleashed on Rouen. Yet despite the carnage that followed, hope and optimism had not entirely vanished. The 30th Salon des artistes rouennais went ahead as scheduled, with its opening on 19 May 1940; however, due to the gravity of the situation, it was closed two days later. The first bombardment of the city began on June 5, followed by a mass exodus. On June 8 at 10:00p.m. the first German tanks rolled in on la route de Neufchatel, very close to the Pinchon residence.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April 2013, al-Baghdadi {{released}} an audio statement {{in which he}} announced that the al-Nusra Front had been established, financed, and supported by ISI, and that {{the two groups were}} merging under the name Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIL, Al-Sham also translates as the Levant). However, Abu Mohammad al-Julani and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger. Al-Julani issued a statement denying the merger, and complaining that neither he <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in al-Nusra's leadership had been consulted about it. In June 2013, Al Jazeera reported that it had obtained a letter written by al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, addressed to both leaders, in which he ruled against the merger, and appointed an emissary to oversee relations between them {{to put an end to}} tensions. That same month, al-Baghdadi {{released an}} audio message rejecting al-Zawahiri's ruling and declaring that the merger was going ahead.|$|E

25|$|In February–March 1994, {{detailed}} {{reports from}} the Canadian embassy in Kigali meant that the Canadian government {{was one of the}} best informed nations in the world about the coming Rwandan genocide. The foreign minister André Ouellet claimed that he <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in the Cabinet ever saw the reports from Rwanda. On April 6, 1994, the Rwandan genocide began. The government in Ottawa was apparently kept well-informed about what was happening by diplomats and Canadian Forces serving as UN peacekeepers, but the genocide was not considered to be a major problem for Canada, with the Chrétien government taking the view that other powers would stop the genocide. The government first insisted in April 1994 that there was only a civil war in Rwanda, and once it become clear that genocide had begun, on May 2, 1994, Ouellet, speaking for the government in the House of Commons promised humanitarian aid and expressed the hope that the Organization for African Unity would do something to stop the genocide. In 2010, the Canadian government apologized to the people of Rwanda for indifference to the genocide of 1994.|$|E

500|$|However, neither Scott <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in Changi was {{involved}} in the sabotage, or with the raid that led to serious repercussions on 10 October [...] 'The double tenth'. On 28 September, Scott received a message from one of his contacts in the city, telling him that on the previous morning six Japanese ships had been blown up in Singapore Harbour (now Keppel Harbour). This was the first major sabotage since the Japanese had captured the island. The loss of ships in such an important place was an enormous blow to Japanese prestige. Scott and his fellow internees supposed that the saboteurs must have been Chinese guerrillas who had slipped across the straits from their base in Malaya. Sumida, however, believed that Scott and his associates had planned the operation from Changi Prison.|$|E

McLagan commented that Moon [...] "couldn't handle it." [...] Moon would harass them with phone calls, and on one occasion before Kim sued for divorce, he invited McLagan for a drink at a Richmond pub and sent several [...] "heavies" [...] to break into McLagan's home on Fife Road and look for Kim, forcing her to hide in a walk-in closet.

500|$|Michael Stipe {{sings in}} what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley {{described}} as [...] "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures". Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; {{in the chorus}} for [...] "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as [...] "mumbling" [...] by The Washington Post), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Creem writer John Morthland wrote in his review of Murmur, [...] "I still {{have no idea what}} these songs are about, because neither me <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [...] Stipe commented in 1984, [...] "It's just the way I sing. If I tried to control it, it would be pretty false." [...] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of Fables of the Reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|Benchley {{says that}} neither he <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> {{involved}} in its conception initially realized the book's potential. Tom Congdon, however, sensed {{that the novel}} had prospects and had it sent out to The Book of the Month Club and paperback houses. The Book of the Month Club made it an [...] "A book", qualifying it for its main selection, then Reader's Digest also selected it. The publication date was moved back to allow a carefully orchestrated release. It was released first in hardcover in February 1974, then in the book clubs, followed by a national campaign for the paperback release. Bantam bought the paperback rights for $575,000, which Benchley points out was [...] "then an enormous sum of money". Once Bantam's rights lapsed years later, they reverted to Benchley, who subsequently sold them to Random House, who has since done all the reprints of Jaws.|$|E

500|$|Carroll {{considered}} requesting de Barth's {{appointment as}} bishop, but {{decided against it}} because of de Barth's lack of theological study and reputation for having a quick temper. Carroll died in 1815, and his successor, Leonard Neale, offered de Barth the position of bishop, but de Barth declined it. In a letter to Neale, de Barth wrote {{that if you do}} not forward my objections [...] to the Holy See ... I will not accept, but will kneel down and devoutly put the bulls in the fire ... and then farewell, Monseigneur. Neither you <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> shall ever know the corner of the globe where I shall vegetate the few years still left to me to live. Neale accepted de Barth's refusal, and the see remained vacant. In 1817, after Neale died, de Barth traveled to Baltimore to participate in the episcopal consecration of Neale's successor, Ambrose Maréchal.|$|E
500|$|Several events {{occurred}} to obscure and ultimately frustrate this order. The fact that Meares had turned {{back from the}} polar march much later than originally planned meant {{that he did not}} return to Cape Evans until 5 January. Huntford suggests he resigned at this point because he was [...] "disgusted" [...] with Scott's expedition. Fiennes in contrast quotes from a letter by Cherry-Garrard in 1938 that Meares had been ready at Cape Evans to resupply One Ton Depot as ordered, when he had seen the ship arrive in the bay and so stayed at base – the [...] "ship" [...] however {{turned out to be a}} mirage, and the real ship did not arrive until the middle of February. According to Fiennes, Meares was preoccupied with his late father's estate, and was anxious to leave on the ship as soon as he could. Three of the XS rations required for One Ton Depot had been man-hauled there by a party which left Cape Evans on 26 December, but neither Meares <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> transported the missing rations or the dog food to One Ton Depot.|$|E
500|$|Even though several throwers, {{including}} Nilsen, still towered above Thorkildsen on {{the world}} list, the Olympic javelin contest was regarded as widely open – [...] "one of the most open finals in Olympic history", according to the IAAF Olympic coverage. Thorkildsen threw 81.74m in the qualification round, barely earning a mention in the event report as he safely passed the automatic qualifier mark of 81metres to go through to the final. Breaux Greer won the qualification with 87.25 m, but left the stadium in a limping state. In the javelin final held two days later, Thorkildsen opened with an 84.82m release which saw him ranked third {{at the end of}} the first round. Vadims Vasiļevskis of Latvia had thrown a personal best of 84.95m to earn a surprising lead ahead of reigning World champion Sergey Makarov. In the second round Thorkildsen threw a personal best of 86.50metres. As neither Aleksandr Ivanov, Greer <b>nor</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> managed to beat this, Thorkildsen won a surprising Olympic gold medal with Vasiļevskis and Makarov staying in place to take the silver and bronze medals respectively. Commenting on his win, Thorkildsen described the feeling as [...] "completely insane". A second place behind Breaux Greer at the World Athletics Final in Monte Carlo rounded off the season.|$|E

He was in court in January 2009, for two counts of assault causing bodily harm.
