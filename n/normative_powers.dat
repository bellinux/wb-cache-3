40|$|Adolescents, in many jurisdictions, {{have the}} power to consent to life saving {{treatment}} but not necessarily the power to refuse it. A recent defence of this asymmetry is Neil Manson's theory of ‘transitional paternalism’. Transitional paternalism holds that such asymmetries are by-products of sharing <b>normative</b> <b>powers.</b> However, sharing <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> by itself does not entail an asymmetry because transitional paternalism can be implemented in two ways. Manson defends the asymmetry-generating version of transitional paternalism in the clinical context, arguing that it maximizes respect for adolescent autonomy. This article offers an alternative argument in favour of the asymmetry-generating form of transitional paternalism, one that makes appeal to obligations that individuals have to develop self-governance in others. We should share <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> asymmetrically in the clinical context for three reasons. First, the asymmetric version of transitional paternalism takes seriously duties to support adolescents’ developing autonomy, alongside other duties that adults have to young people. It does so by enabling young people to be involved in important decisions that they would otherwise be excluded from. This is of value because participation of this sort is central to the cultivation of their self-governance. Second, only the asymmetric version gives young people a voice in respect of all clinical actions, and only the asymmetric version leaves open the possibility that the coarse lines of legislation might be ‘fine-tuned’ in individual cases. Third, the asymmetric sharing of <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> is consistent with the kind of social arrangements that best support autonomy...|$|E

It {{is based upon}} theoretical researches on <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> and official publications about EU’s <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> in Africa. The aim of the thesis is to analyse the EU’s role in Africa as <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> The following questions are posed: What are the reasons of exercising <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> by the EU in Africa? What are the main areas the EU acts as <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> in African continent? And what are the results of EU <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> activity in Africa? The theoretical approach assumes that the EU {{is no longer a}} <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> But, nevertheless, it can exercise <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> The study is conducted with a qualitative method research. The results show that the EU as a <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> pursues egoistic motives in Africa.

40|$|The {{question}} {{addressed by}} this research is; {{how can the}} concept of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> be morally evaluated? In general terms, <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> {{is thought to be}} an ability or disposition, where A has <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> when it is able to diffuse through communicative acts a norm n to B. However, prevailing theories also assume that all uses of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> are justified, and that this is dependent on the norm promoted being defined as valid. This alters the definition of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> slightly, where A now has <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> if and only if A is able to diffuse through communicative acts a valid norm n to B. Chapter one argues that if <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> is a dispositional form of power, then it cannot be necessarily justified; rather, there are justifiable and unjustifiable uses of <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> Chapter two argues that any moral evaluation of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> that refers to norm content faces difficulties and it is inconsistent to evaluate <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> by reference to the content of the norms diffused. The only feasible way to evaluate <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> is to focus on the mechanisms of diffusion. Because the mechanisms of diffusion are communicative acts, a theory of deliberative democracy would be a useful theoretical standard for evaluating uses of <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> Chapter three identifies and describes three requirements derived from deliberative democracy as suitable criteria for judging a use of <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> First, that the communicative act(s) are non-coercive. Second, that A, in diffusing a norm n, demonstrates reflexivity. Third, that A is inclusive of B in the diffusion of a norm n, in other words, B is included in the deliberative process...|$|R

40|$|In many jurisdictions {{adolescents}} {{acquire the}} right to consent to treatment, but, in some cases their refusals—e. g., of life-saving treatment—may not be respected. This asymmetry of adolescent consent and refusal seems puzzling, even incoherent. The aim here is to offer an original explanation, and a justification, of this asymmetry. Rather than trying to explain the asymmetry {{in terms of a}} variable standard of competence—where the adolescent is competent to consent to, but not refuse, certain interventions—the account offered here focuses more closely on the normative power to render actions permissible. Where <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> are shared they can readily give rise to an asymmetry between consent and refusal. We then turn to why it is justifiable that <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> be shared in adolescence. Transitional paternalism holds that the acquisition of <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> by competent adolescents should not be an instant one, achieved in a single step, but {{that there should be a}} transitional period where paternalistic protection is rolled back, but not entirely withdrawn until a later date. Transitional paternalism could be implemented without generating the asymmetry between consent and refusal but, it is argued, the asymmetric version of transitional paternalism is to be preferred insofar as it offers a greater respect for the adolescent’s decisions than the symmetrical alternative...|$|E

In this article, I will argue that Manson's account fails to explain away the oddness. Rather, I will argue that there are ambiguities to which Manson has not paid sufficient attention.

40|$|The social {{sciences}} have many different understandings of ‘normative power', but in European Union (EU) studies <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> has three particular meanings. The first meaning of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> is {{its emphasis on}} normative theory, that is, how we judge and justify truth claims in social science. The second meaning of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> is {{as a form of}} power that is ideational rather than material or physical. The third meaning of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> is as a characterisation of an ideal type of international actor. Empirical studies of <b>normative</b> forms of <b>power</b> have analysed both the causal and constitutive effects of EU relations with the world in areas ranging from inter-regional relations, through traditional diplomacy, to environmental politics. Research areas of particular interest include the study of the interplay between physical, material and <b>normative</b> forms of <b>power,</b> as well as the constitutive role of normative reflexivity in the EU's international identity through its global engagements. The <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> approach is emerging as a holistic research programme with the potential to cross both policy and disciplinary boundaries {{in the study of the}} EU's status in, and relations with, the rest of the world. Within this research programme, the greatest challenges involve analysing both the causal and constitutive effects of EU principles, actions and impact in world politics. Since the first article on the EU's international identity in 2003, JEPP has published more highly cited articles on the EU's <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> than any other academic journal, including a special issue on "What Kind of Power?" in 2006. As the leading journal in the debate, this special issue brings together seven <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> articles published in JEPP since the 2006 special issue, together with Ian Manners' ‘Normative power Europe reconsidered' article. These articles illustrate the way in which JEPP serves as a central point of reference for <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> research and debate in a wide variety of public policy areas. Included in this research and debate are questions regarding how best to analyse and understand EU international leadership, small state strategy, interregional relations, international compliance, and the management of globalisation, concluding with an ontological and methodological appraisal of the <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> research programme.

40|$|This article aims {{to provide}} an {{overview}} of the evolution of self-regulatory mechanisms in Italy. A brief overview of the Italian system of sources of law has showed that the model of the sources of law rooted in the Italian constitution is typically positivistic and centred on the pivotal role of Parliament, the only body empowered to legislate, either directly or by delegating its <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> to the Government, within expressly specified limits. What room, if any, is there for self-regulatory rules? If {{one of the most interesting}} aims of the research was to analyse to what extent the self-regulatory phenomenon is compatible with Parliament’s undisputed sovereignty and with the linked principle of the rule of law, it should be clear that rules made by private actors (i. e. self-regulatory rules), which pretend to have external effects (binding erga omnes), can be considered as law and, as such, as sources of law, as long as they can be ‘incorporated’ into and recognized in some of the formal sources of Italian law. This seems the only possible and constitutionally compatible interpretation of a phenomenon (self-regulation) which, instead, could potentially be able to place the formal hierarchy of sources of law in jeopardy. On the other hand, the results of the study make clear that, even when Parliament confers its <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> on any other bodies (i. e. either independent administrative authorities or professional orders, or, more in general, any self-regulatory associations), it is unlikely that it will give up determining the limits within which those <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> have to be exercised. Some authors actually consider this sort of ‘delegated legislation’ to be a means for the State to reassert its sovereignty. Anyway, this new pluralistic ‘architecture’ will undoubtedly allow the legislator to retain some exclusive duties: first and foremost, the power to prescribe the institutional conditions which underlie the basis of ‘private self-regulatory governance’, as well as the aims of their future normative action; secondly, to intervene in order to correct, if necessary, the new consensual rules...|$|E
40|$|Central Asia {{has been}} {{the focal point of}} intense geopolitical power {{struggle}} throughout history. At the dawn of the 21 st century, Central Asia has undergone major changes as the European Union and the China-led Shanghai Co-operation Organization have emerged as two <b>normative</b> <b>powers,</b> both seeking to influence the patterns of security governance in the region. This study aims to delve deep into ‘the black boxes’ of the EU’s and China’s foreign policies toward five CA republics. It starts from the premise that the bulk of research on Eurasian politics tend to concentrate mostly on realist and traditional geopolitical doctrine, which seem to have failed to properly explain the normative and ideational transformations that have taken place in the region {{as a result of the}} presence of these two emerging normative agents. By interweaving both realist and constructivist theories of International Relations (IR) into a new all-encompassing analytical framework, termed “meta-geopolitics”, the thesis seeks to trace and examine how geopolitical as well as normative components of the EU and Chinese regional strategies have affected the contemporary power dynamics in the post-Soviet space. I argue that, in contrast to the geopolitical struggle during the 19 th and 20 th centuries, a clash of <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> is brewing in the region between China, under the aegis of the SCO, and the EU. The research also concludes that China has relatively been in a better position in comparison to the EU to render its policies as feasible, effective and legitimate to the Central Asian states. ...|$|E

The results indicate that while the market power of the EU remains an influential factor, the diminishing <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> of the EU in WCPO is weakening any attempts to implement its IUU fishing regulation and Pacific Island nations have promoted their own regulatory agenda. We conclude that the changing asymmetries between market and <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> has led to a differentiated geography of regulatory uptake, and while market power will remain a dominant strategy for the EU, <b>normative</b> <b>power,</b> when exercised should focus on cooperation rather than ‘teaching’ the benefits of an EU regulatory approach...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. This paper {{explores the}} concept of 'normative power Europe' through the {{framework}} of legitimacy. Legitimacy is a central preoccupation of those analysts and policymakers interested in the EU's <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> A recent special issue on <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> in Europe was framed around {{the question of how}} to define <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> in order to enhance its legitimacy as a form of foreign policy. In that issue, Michael Smith noted that from whatever angle we study the question of the EU's foreign policy, "the subject raises major questions about the interaction between internal developments and external structures and processes, about the boundaries of 'civilian' and <b>normative</b> <b>power,</b> and about the legitimacy claims of European foreign policy". 1 Ian Manners recently listed no less than five definitions of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> developed in order that the legitimacy of the EU's actions be judged according to an objective standard of some kind. 2 An ongoing research project inquires into whether or not European norms appear as legitimate in the eyes of non-Europeans. 3 This paper starts off by situating the emergence of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> Europe within the wider context of European integration. Various conceptions of the EU as a foreign policy actor were developed in an attempt to resolve a crisis in the 'Idea of Europe' that began in the early post Cold War period. The specific concept of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> emerged in reaction to the perceived inadequacy of various other qualifying adjectives for European power. For all its popularity, the concept has been subject to criticism ever since Ian Manners first published his seminal article in 2002. Many felt that the very idea of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> Europe needed its own sources of legitimacy: scholars and analysts refused to accept that the prefix 'normative' should automatically put the EU's power beyond critical commentary. As a result, in the academic debate scholars have focused on possible sources of legitimacy external to the <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> concept itself. This paper analyzes in detail three such sources: cosmopolitan law as argued by Helene Sjursen, a post-colonial ethos developed by Kalypso Nicolaïdis, and a set of European social preferences elaborated by Zaki Laïdi. The paper claims that each of these attempts to legitimize {{the concept of}} <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> draw upon different concepts of political community, authority and democracy. This is instructive in terms of our understanding of the EU as a political formation. It also demonstrates that definitions of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> are never neutral - they put forward a particular vision of politics which should be properly identified. The paper compares these sources of legitimacy and limns their weaknesses. The paper concludes with the suggestion that the lack of clarity concerning the identity of the EU as a political formation may be one of the major limitations the EU faces in its hope of becoming a central actor in world politics...|$|R

Crucially, it is the compliant children entering at the statutory age who tend to be from more disadvantaged households, and enjoy no benefit in educational outcomes from their greater maturity...|$|E
40|$|After briefly {{considering}} {{the problems of}} political authority and democratic reform typical of formal transnational institutions, this paper offers a theory of democratization for transnational polities. Democratizing a polity such as the European Union requires two conditions to be realized across borders: the emergence of transnational publics that create social relationships based on mutually recognized communicative freedom and the institutionalization of new <b>normative</b> <b>powers</b> of citizens that realize freedom as nondomination. In light of these conditions, the republican dimension of democratization can be made explicit in a conception of a democratic minimum, in which democratization depends upon the effective capacity of citizens to initiate deliberation. Current theories of cosmopolitan and transnational democracy (either from above or from below) cannot elaborate sufficient institutional conditions that make democratization possible in a multilevel polity such as the EU. civil society; deliberative democracy; democracy; democratization; Europeanization...|$|E

Some say it’s a unique actor {{in the international arena}} because of the different tools it has at its disposal. Ian Manners claims that the EU is what he calls a <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> A <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> has the possibilities to influence other actors’ perceptions of what is normal and tries to affect actors’ behavior by diffusing values. Manners defines nine different values that the EU exports and also in what ways it is done. The purpose of this thesis is to examine if and how the EU acts as a <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> in Belarus. Belarus was chosen because it {{is said to be the}} last dictatorship left in Europe. It was also chosen as {{a critical}} case for the EU’s <b>normative</b> <b>power.</b> To be able to fulfill the purpose of the thesis I have worked with two main questions: • What are the normative values the EU is exporting through its contacts with Belarus? • In what ways are these values diffused? The questions were answered by examining the official EU strategy for Belarus and I found that the values the EU is exporting to Belarus mainly are democracy, human rights, rule of law and sustainable development. Main ways of diffusion were informational diffusion, procedural diffusion and the cultural filter. Keywords: <b>Normative</b> <b>power,</b> diffusion of values, the European Union, Belaru...|$|R

40|$|Introduced by Ian Manners in {{an article}} {{published}} in 2002, the idea of 'normative power Europe' has been very widely debated by scholars in the fields of European studies and international relations. This article marks the first decade of scholarship on <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> Europe through a critical engagement with the concept, its influence and the wider normative turn within the literature on the European Union's role beyond its borders. The article reviews the strands of literature that have drawn on the concept of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> and outlines the contours of the international debate on the concept. It provides an assessment of the impact of <b>normative</b> <b>power</b> and its application through the variety of ways it has been used via engagement, reaction and counter-reaction. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
