5|$|An unusual ion {{containing}} xenon is the tetraxenonogold(II) cation, , {{which contains}} Xe–Au bonds. This ion {{occurs in the}} compound , and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two <b>notoriously</b> unreactive atoms, xenon and gold, with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{life on the}} {{shoreline}} includes yellow-crowned night herons, loggerhead shrikes, prairie warblers and shorebirds. Mangrove cuckoos, a <b>notoriously</b> difficult-to-observe species, may be seen at Convoy Point and Black Point. Biscayne {{has one of the}} largest populations of mangrove cuckoos in Florida.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} Marshalsea, {{the second was}} <b>notoriously</b> cramped. In 1827, 414 out of its 630 debtors were there for debts under £20; 1,890 people in Southwark were imprisoned that year for a total debt of ₤16,442.|$|E
5|$|During Barkley's {{eight seasons}} in Philadelphia, {{he became a}} {{household}} name {{and was one of}} the few NBA players to have a figure published by Kenner's Starting Lineup toy line. He also had his own signature shoe line with Nike. His outspoken and aggressive play, however, resulted in some on-court incidents, <b>notoriously</b> a fight with Detroit Pistons center Bill Laimbeer in 1990, which drew a record total $162,500 fine.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} at {{the county}} level, {{and to some degree}} at the state level, became <b>notoriously</b> tolerant of the illegal activities in Galveston, in no small part because of the prosperity they generated, and the bribery and influence peddled by the Maceos. The city police very early on became entirely complicit.|$|E
5|$|Meyer Wolfshiem– a Jewish {{friend and}} mentor of Gatsby's, {{described}} as a gambler who fixed the World Series. Wolfshiem appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby's funeral. He is a clear allusion to Arnold Rothstein, a New York crime kingpin who was <b>notoriously</b> blamed for the Black Sox Scandal which tainted the 1919 World Series.|$|E
5|$|One of the year's best {{music videos}} was {{directed}} by Jay-Z and cost about zero dollars to make. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's Take-Away Shows, its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a <b>notoriously</b> manicured superstar without embellishment. It's all quite endearing and personal – two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple.|$|E
5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens and noble gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) differ from the organogens: none are universally required for life; arsenic is <b>notoriously</b> poisonous; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E
5|$|Sibyl Mary Collings {{was born}} in Guernsey {{in a house that}} once belonged to John Allaire, her privateering great-great-grandfather, whose {{business}} dealings brought the fief of Sark to his daughter, Marie Collings. Her parents were William Frederick Collings and his Montreal-born wife Sophie (née Moffatt). Collings was born two years after her <b>notoriously</b> intemperate father inherited the fief from his father, William Thomas Collings. She had one sibling, a sister named Doris.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} Tropic of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was <b>notoriously</b> difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were <b>notoriously</b> {{difficult}} for inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
5|$|The college's other {{buildings}} are at Moatside Court, Owengate and Bailey Court. The developments at Moatside Court and Bailey Court {{date from the}} 1960s and 1970s, whilst Owengate was formed {{from a series of}} old houses in the 1950s. Of these, Moatside Court's rooms were of a <b>notoriously</b> poor quality, but have recently been renovated at the cost of over £1 million.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a <b>notoriously</b> difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E
5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, {{sleight of hand}} is also <b>notoriously</b> used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were <b>notoriously</b> pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} are <b>notoriously</b> hard to {{calculate}} exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither {{of which can be}} treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the general {{election}} of 2006, Reinfeldt, as leader of the Moderate Party, participated {{in the creation of the}} Alliance for Sweden. It united the centre-right in a coalition of the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats. Reinfeldt is said to have been instrumental in uniting the four parties, which previously were known for being <b>notoriously</b> divided, in order to present a powerful alternative to the Social Democrats. The parties presented a joint election manifesto for the alliance.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} played board games pitting two players against each other, {{including}} latrunculi ("Raiders"), a game of strategy in which opponents coordinated the movements and capture of multiple game pieces, and XII scripta ("Twelve Marks"), involving dice and arranging pieces on a grid of letters or words. A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board), to which the emperor Claudius was <b>notoriously</b> addicted, may have been similar to backgammon, using a dice-cup (pyrgus). Playing with dice {{as a form of}} gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the December festival of the Saturnalia with its carnival, norms-overturned atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The K Foundation {{was an art}} {{foundation}} set up by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty (The KLF) in 1993, {{following their}} 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo's post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money {{in a number of}} ways, including on a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world, focusing in particular on the Turner Prize. Most <b>notoriously,</b> when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, they burned a million pounds in cash.|$|E
5|$|The {{biography}} of Macrinus is <b>notoriously</b> unreliable, {{and after a}} partial reversion to reliability in the Life of Elagabalus, the Alexander Severus, {{one of the longest}} biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king. Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.|$|E
5|$|The classic view of Domitian {{is usually}} negative, {{since most of}} the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had <b>notoriously</b> {{difficult}} relations. Furthermore, contemporary historians such as Pliny the Younger, Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets Martial and Statius constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.|$|E
5|$|The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulabi_Gang in India. They wear pink saris {{and carry}} lathis (bamboo staves) for {{protection}} against physical attack. They punish abusive husbands, publicly shaming and sometimes beating them. They also {{watch out for}} and expose dowry beatings, dowry death, rape, child marriages, desertion, depriving girls of education, child molestation, and sexual harassment. They have invaded police stations to demand that police investigate these matters, {{and other things that}} affect the community such as corruption. India’s police are <b>notoriously</b> corrupt and sometimes only the threat of a full-scale female riot will get them to act.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision {{for public health}} did not keep pace with them, {{and for a time}} living conditions in some of the towns and cities were <b>notoriously</b> bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box; senators and equestrians watching from the advantageous seats reserved for them; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else packed in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites {{of social and political}} protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most <b>notoriously</b> at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is <b>notoriously</b> hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|The weather of Mount Washington is <b>notoriously</b> erratic. This {{is partly}} due to the {{convergence}} of several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due to the relative temperature differences between the Northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed from the summit of the mountain on average of 110 days per year.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Bristol's {{history the}} Avon Gorge {{has been an}} {{important}} transport route, carrying the River Avon, major roads and two railways. The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary have a very high tidal range of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it <b>notoriously</b> difficult to navigate. Several vessels have grounded in the gorge including the SS Demerara soon after her launch in 1851, the schooner Gipsy in 1878, the steam tug Black Eagle in 1861 and the Llandaff City.|$|E
5|$|Work {{performed}} by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided {{much of the}} labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were <b>notoriously</b> brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming (latifundia), these may have been mostly slaves, but throughout the Empire, slave farm labour was probably less important than other forms of dependent labour by people who were technically not enslaved.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a <b>notoriously</b> bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being <b>notoriously</b> unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is <b>notoriously</b> difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E
5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is <b>notoriously</b> susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Butler's father, in 1924, the newly elected mayor of Philadelphia W. Freeland Kendrick asked {{him to leave the}} Marines to become the Director of Public Safety, the {{official}} in charge of running the city's police and fire departments. Philadelphia's municipal government was <b>notoriously</b> corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge. He replaced corrupt police officers and, in some cases, switched entire units from one part of the city to another, undermining local protection rackets and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|Dredd earned $27.6 {{million from}} markets outside of North America and $13.4 million from North America, {{for a total}} of $41 million. In the UK, Dredd grossed £1.05 million ($1.7 million) from 415 cinemas during its opening weekend. This made it the weekend's number-one film, the first film {{restricted}} to audiences over 18 years of age to do so since Saw 3D in 2010. In its second weekend, the film placed number five, earning £769,381. Dredd was primarily shown in 3D in the UK, and 2D screenings were <b>notoriously</b> limited as the distributor denied cinemas' requests for 2D prints; the decision was considered to have limited the film's audience where 2D was their preferred format. Dredd earned a total of $6.9 million in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Endecott was a zealous and {{somewhat}} hotheaded Puritan, with Separatist {{attitudes toward the}} Anglican Church. This sometimes put him at odds with Nonconformist views that were dominant among the colony's early leaders, which became apparent when he gave shelter to the vocally Separatist Roger Williams. Endecott also argued that women should dress modestly and that men should keep their hair short, and issued judicial decisions banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well {{with those of the}} Puritans. He <b>notoriously</b> defaced the English flag because he saw St George's Cross {{as a symbol of the}} papacy, and had four Quakers put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. An expedition he led in 1636 is considered the opening offensive in the Pequot War, which practically destroyed the Pequot tribe as an entity.|$|E
5|$|Epstein made {{numerous}} {{trips to}} London to visit record {{companies in the}} hope of securing a record contract, but many rejected him, including Columbia, Pye, Philips, Oriole, and most <b>notoriously</b> Decca. On 13 December 1961, at Epstein's invitation, Mike Smith of Decca travelled from London to Liverpool to watch the group at The Cavern Club, which led to an audition in London on 1 January 1962 (see The Beatles' Decca audition). Decca informed Epstein one month later that the audition tapes had been rejected. The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan (ex-drummer of the Shadows) to produce the studio recordings. While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached Ron White, an EMI marketing executive, who contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group. White could not contact EMI's fourth staff producer George Martin, as he was on holiday.|$|E
