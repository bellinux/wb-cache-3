Moreover, this requirement extends to the video transport mechanism which must also ensure synchronous delivery to the central processing hubs.

We focus on the specific problem of imperative nested loop parallelization by describing a direct method for determining the distance vectors of the inter-loop data dependencies in an n-nested loop kernel. These distance vectors define dependence arcs between iterations which are represented as points in n-dimensional euclidean space.

Moreover, this technique is not universally applicable such as in cases where there is no motion in the captured sequences or where interference with the scene is not acceptable. This method of synchronisation is additionally severely limited in the accuracy it can achieve since the resulting video sequences could still be misaligned by as much as half the inter-frame duration, on average.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of pure software-based solutions for cellular positioning. The proposed self-positioning solutions rely solely on the available network infrastructure and do not require additional hardware or any modifications in the cellular network. The main advantage of using RSS rather than timing measurements is to overcome the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>synchronisation</b> between base stations. By exploiting the availability of RSS observations, the self-positioning methods presented in this thesis have been implemented as mobile software applications and tested in real world positioning experiments. The well-known Extended Kalman Filter {{can be used as a}} static positioning process while modeling the uncertainty in signal strength observations. The range estimation is performed using an empirical propagation model that has been calibrated using RSS measurements in the same trial areas where the positioning process is applied. In order to overcome the need for a priori maps of the GSM network, a novel cellular positioning method is proposed in this thesis. It is based on the concept of Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) which represents one of the greatest successes of autonomous navigation research. By merging target localisation and the mapping of unknown base stations into a single problem, Cellular SLAM allows a mobile phone to build a map of its environment and concurrently use this map to determine its position...|$|E
40|$|Space Shift Keying (SSK) {{modulation}} is {{a recently}} proposed MIMO technique, which activates {{only a single}} transmit antenna during each time slot and uses the specific index of the activated transmit antenna to implicitly convey information. Activating a single antenna is beneficial in terms of eliminating the inter-channel interference, and mitigates the peak-to-mean power ratio, while avoiding the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>synchronisation</b> among transmit antennas. However, this benefit is achieved at a sacrifice, since the transmit diversity gain potential of the multiple transmit antennas is not fully exploited in existing SSK assisted systems. Furthermore, a high SSK throughput requires the transmitter to employ {{a high number of}} transmit antennas, which is not always practical. Hence, we propose four algorithms, namely open-loop Space Time Space Shift Keying (ST-SSK), closed-loop feedback-aided phase rotation, feedback-aided power allocation, and cooperative ST-SSK, for the sake of achieving a diversity gain. The performance improvements of the proposed schemes are demonstrated by Monte-Carlo simulations for spatially independent Rayleigh fading channels. Their robustness against channel estimation errors is also considered. We advocate the proposed ST-SSK techniques, which are capable of achieving a transmit diversity gain of about 10 dB at a BER of $ 10 ^{- 5 }$, at a cost of imposing a moderate throughput loss dedicated to a modest feedback overhead. Furthermore, our proposed ST-SSK scheme lends itself to efficient communication, because the deleterious effects of deep shadow fading no longer impose spatial correlation on the signals received by the antennas, which cannot be readily avoided by co-located antenna elements...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{policies}} {{within one}} country or region can have significant global impacts, with unforeseen consequences. As an example, the EU requirements for 20 % of final energy to {{be derived from}} renewable sources by 2020 feeds in to a UK target for renewable energy to make up 15 % of UK final energy demand by 2020; the implications of this are investigated and found to have global repercussions. In order to achieve the UK target it is essential that the existing strategies for delivering wind power and coupling it to the grid are successful but there is an additional, greater, challenge. A large part of the UK renewables target will need to be met by the use of biomass and we show here that the amounts of biomass needed far exceed the supply capacity of the UK; imports will dominate the supply. The imports required are far greater than present day UK imports of coal with substantial potential implications; globally for biomass markets with potential impact on food supply and deforestation, and locally for UK infrastructure in shipping, ports, rail, road freight, electricity transmission networks and the coal industry. The way that a single country's response to a regional energy strategy can have global implications are investigated using one reference scenario for future UK fuel needs as an example. A strong outcome is that to implement this level of rapid change in the energy supply chain whilst avoiding negative impacts in a rapidly expanding global market there is a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>synchronisation</b> of policies across economies as a whole, including anticipated effects beyond national borders, rather than policy measures in separate, isolated areas such as energy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Several {{applications}} {{have been}} proposed for Wireless sensor networks. These include habitat monitoring, structural health monitoring, pipeline (gas, water, and oil) monitoring, precision agriculture, active volcano monitoring, and many more. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposals, researchers have developed prototypes and deployed them into real-world environments. Even though each prototype was developed for a specific sensing task, interestingly most of the networks share several characteristics in common. Some of these are: The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> time <b>synchronisation,</b> high sampling rate of short duration, multi-hop routing, periodical sampling and sleeping, and medium access control. Whereas there are a plethora of existing and proposed protocols to address these issues, each prototype chooses to address the issues in a proprietary manner. The lack of reuse practice poses a generalisation problem. In this paper we motivate toxic gas detection during oil exploration and refinery and demonstrate how existing or proposed protocols can be employed to establish a fully functional network. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive energy model to evaluate the feasibility of employing wireless sensor network for the monitoring task. I...|$|R

We present a set of techniques for benchmarking performance characteristics of insects in free flight, demonstrated using a model species, and comment on the significance of the performance observed. Free-flying blowflies (Calliphora vicina) were filmed inside a novel mirrored arena comprising a large (1. 6 m 1. 6 m 1. 6 m) corner-cube reflector using a single high-speed digital video camera (250 or 500 fps). This arrangement permitted accurate reconstruction of the flies' 3 -dimensional trajectories without the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>synchronisation</b> hardware, by virtue of the multiple reflections of a subject within the arena. Image sequences were analysed using custom-written automated tracking software, and processed using a self-calibrating bundle adjustment procedure to determine the subject's instantaneous 3 -dimensional position. We illustrate our method by using these trajectory data to benchmark the routine flight performance envelope of our flies. Flight speeds were most commonly observed between 1. 2 ms− 1 and 2. 3 ms− 1, with a maximum of 2. 5 ms− 1. Our flies tended to dive faster than they climbed, with a maximum descent rate (− 2. 4 ms− 1) almost double the maximum climb rate (1. 2 ms− 1). Modal turn rate was around 240 °s− 1, with maximal rates in excess of 1700 °s− 1. We used the maximal flight performance we observed during normal flight to construct notional physical limits on the blowfly flight envelope, and used the distribution of observations within that notional envelope to postulate behavioural preferences or physiological and anatomical constraints. The flight trajectories we recorded were never steady: rather they were constantly accelerating or decelerating, with maximum tangential accelerations and maximum centripetal accelerations on the order of 3 g...|$|E

40|$|Node {{clustering}} {{has been}} widely studied in recent years for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) as a technique to form a hierarchical structure and prolong network lifetime by {{reducing the number of}} packet transmissions. Cluster Heads (CH) are elected in a distributed way among sensors, but are often highly overloaded, and therefore re-clustering operations should be performed to share the resource intensive CH-role. Existing protocols involve periodic network-wide re-clustering operations that are simultaneously performed, which requires global time synchronisation. To address this issue, some recent studies have proposed asynchronous node clustering for networks with direct links from CHs to the data sink. However, for large-scale WSNs, multihop packet delivery to the sink is required since longrange transmissions are costly for sensor nodes. In this paper, we present an asynchronous node clustering protocol designed for multihop WSNs, considering dynamic conditions such as residual node energy levels and unbalanced data traffic loads caused by packet forwarding. Simulation results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} achieve similar levels of lifetime extension by re-clustering a multihop WSN via independently made decisions at CHs, without a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> time <b>synchronisation</b> required by existing synchronous protocols...|$|R
40|$|Television is a known {{educational}} device. Video enhanced television, {{that offers}} the trainee rich experience and captures student's attention, {{has been used}} in kindergartens, schools and universities. With the advent of digital television, the possibilities for learning purposes have grown. While better video quality improves the user's experience, the real opportunity lies in the interactivity between the user and the end user terminal or end user and content provider. The ELU (Enhanced learning unlimited) project focuses on the DVB-T environment, which will/is barter for current terrestrial transmission. From the educational point of view, this environment has two specific characteristics: the interaction channel is not granted and the content is not available on demand but is scheduled. In the learning environment where the learning material can not be accessed on demand adaptation of content can be done in a limited and specific way. Shows in the DVB-T environment start at a pre-scheduled time and last only as long as foreseen (the same as movies). As a result, special attention is <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>synchronisation</b> of the interactive and video content in the programme. For learning purposes, we developed interactive content templates such as various games and more generic Multimedia pages that can be delivered to all end users regardless of the interaction channel. Our interactive learning templates are fine tuned through the developed software that enables to prepare a personalised content that can be synchronised with the A/V stream. An exemplary pedagogical element that includes adaptation of the user content and also relates to the time can be seen in Figure 2. The content in the authoring tools is prepared in two steps. In both steps, configuration files based on XML are used to configure pre-prepared MHP applications (Figure 1). The first type of the script files are configurations for the template, or, in other words, what is displayed on the screen. The second type of the configuration file is the so called script file where we define events and their triggers. The trigger can be either a time stamp, a condition or a combination of both. The main advantage of the developed concept is its modular architecture (Figure 3). By using the authoring tools, we create only script files that are platform independent. With the transition to another middleware platform, only parts of the applications have to be rewritten. By using the authoring tools an interactive learning course, i. e. 'Development of traffic skills', was built. The course was broadcasted to users in the laboratory environment using advanced equipment (Table 1). 6 page(s...|$|R

In recent years, a lot of different channel estimation techniques have been developed for wired and wireless OFDM systems. In packet-oriented coherent transmission, e. g. in the LAN standards IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g [2], [3], the physical frame format contains known symbols in the preamble, on which channel estimation can be carried out, and the payload carrying the data. The payload also carries known data on a few subcarriers, called pilots, which usually are <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> frequency <b>synchronisation.</b> Particularly when transmitting with a large payload size or at a high mobile velocity the channel changes significantly during transmission of the payload.

Our approach is also based on a combination of an estimation carried out on the preamble and on the payload. However, the combination is achieved in an optimal manner. First, a Kalman Filter is used for estimation of the channel impulse response on the preamble in the time domain. This has been shown to b...|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} in the classic CAN network is event triggered; peak loads may occur when the transmission of several messages is requested at the same time.

We have found that oestrogen stimulation of T- 47 D human breast cancer cells {{is accompanied by a}} two-fold increase in VP- 16 -induced DNA cleavage as measured by alkaline DNA unwinding, and that this increase in DNA cleavage is accompanied by a corresponding enhancement of drug-induced cytostasis. The enhancement of VP- 16 -induced DNA cleavage seen with oestrogen exposure is antagonised both by antioestrogen treatment and by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, but not by the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin. Increased c-myc protein synthesis is detectable within an hour of oestrogen exposure, while increased VP- 16 -induced DNA cleavage is detectable within 4 h and increased DNA synthesis within 16 h. Only small changes in cell-cycle distribution occur with oestrogen stimulation. In the absence of VP- 16, oestrogen does not reduce DNA double-strandedness, nor does it induce changes in chromatin structure as measured by alterations in DNA superhelicity or chromatin accessibility. These findings suggest that oestrogen enhances VP- 16 -induced DNA damage in asynchronously growing G 1 -phase cells and that this enhancement may be dependent at some point upon de novo protein synthesis.
