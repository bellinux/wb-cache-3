40|$|Although most protein {{pharmaceuticals}} {{are usually}} formulated {{as a solution}} or suspension and delivered by invasive routes such as subcutaneous injections, major efforts in both academic and industrial laboratories have been directed towards developing effective oral formulations and increasing the oral absorption of intact protein {{through the use of}} formulations that protect the macromolecule and/or enhance it&#x 2032;s uptake into the intestinal mucosa. However, in spite of these major attempts, relatively little progress has been made. For the efficient delivery of peptides and proteins by <b>non-parenteral</b> <b>route,</b> in particular via the gastrointestinal tract, novel concepts are needed to overcome significant enzymatic and diffusion barriers. The properties of protein and peptides, which are of major interest in oral delivery, are highlighted in the article.

40|$|Abstract. GBV-C/HGV {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be distributed worldwide with a prevalence in blood donors higher than HCV. This distribution {{in the general population}} probably requires an e€ective <b>non-parenteral</b> <b>route</b> of transmission. A previous study was performed to evaluate the presence of GBV-C/HGV in serum. Saliva, faeces and urine samples of 30 patients (15 males and 15 females) and 15 semen samples from patients whose serum gave a GBV-C/HGV RNA positive result were then tested by a sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Five semen supernatant samples (33. 3 %) tested positive ± four of them belonged to HIV positive patients ± and two saliva samples contained GBV-C/HGV sequences (6. 6 %) ± one from a HIV-positive patient. An internal control was used to detect PCR nonspeci®c inhibitors in the samples. The data suggest possible non-parenteral routes of transmission from this virus. Its presence in body ¯uids other than serum has clinical implications other than possible hepatic damage that remain to be investigated. Key words: Body ¯uids, GBV-C/HGV, PC...|$|E
40|$|The {{delivery}} of insulin by <b>non-parenteral</b> <b>routes</b> has gained significant attention {{over the last}} two decades. In the present study, we prepared hollow quaternized chitosan microspheres by the SPG membrane emulsification technique and glutaraldehyde cross-linking method. The structural properties, as well as the uniform size and autofluorescence, enabled us to develop oral {{delivery of}} insulin which conserved the bioactivity of the encapsulated insulin, achieving bioadhesion of microspheres, increasing the loading ability and optimizing the release profile. In vivo evaluation also saw an optimal reduction in blood glucose level and powerful therapeutic effects after treatment with the designed microspheres, which further confirmed the feasibility of using hollow quaternized chitosan microspheres as insulin carriers for oral administration.

40|$|Peptide {{and protein}} {{therapeutics}} are increasingly {{able to address}} a growing range of clinical pathologies and their high specificity and potency combined with low toxicity of metabolic products and minimal potential for drug???drug interactions makes them attractive candidates for clinical development. The pharmaceutical industry is today more in need of delivery technologies {{that are able to}} stabilise and effectively deliver therapeutic peptides and proteins across physiological barriers and particularly via <b>non-parenteral</b> <b>routes.</b> Nanoparticulate delivery has the potential to stabilise peptide and protein therapeutics from physical and enzymatic degradation, reduce clearance via the kidneys, prolong plasma half-lives and even target these molecules to the tissue of interest. Nanoparticulate technologies have enabled the delivery of peptide therapeutics via the oral, nasal and pulmonary route and numerous preclinical nano-delivery systems such as polymeric nanoparticles, lipidic nanoparticles and drug???polymer conjugates have been investigated for the delivery of protein therapeutics.

40|$|Background: The {{inherent}} {{shortcomings of}} conventional drug delivery systems containing estrogens {{and the potential}} of nanoparticles (NPs) have offered tremendous scope for investigation. Although polymeric NPs {{have been used as}} drug carriers for many active agents, the use of appropriate polymer and method of NP preparation to overcome different challenges is very important. Materials and methods: Poly lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) NPs containing estradiol valerate were prepared by the modified spontaneous emulsification solvent diffusion method. Several parameters including the drug/polymer ratios in range of 2. 5 - 10 %, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) in concentration of 0 - 4 % as stabilizer and internal phase volume and composition were examined to optimize formulation. The size distribution and morphology of the NPs, encapsulation efficacy and in vitro release profile in phosphate buffer medium (pH 7. 4) during 12 hrs were then investigated. Results: The NPs prepared in this study were spherical with a relatively mono-dispersed size distribution. By adjustment of the process parameters, the size and the drug encapsulation efficacy as well as the drug release kinetics can be optimally controlled. The mean particle size of the best formula with encapsulation efficiency of 100 % was 175 ± 19, in which release profile was best fitted to Higuchi's model of release which showed that release mechanism was mainly controlled by diffusion of the drug to the release medium. Conclusion: According to the size and surface properties of the prepared particles, it may be concluded that they are a good formulation for <b>non-parenteral</b> <b>routes</b> of administration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} {{of the public health}} and community harms associated with crack cocaine smoking, particularly the risk of blood-borne transmission through <b>non-parenteral</b> <b>routes.</b> In response, community advocates and policy makers in Vancouver, Canada are calling for an exemption from Health Canada to pilot a medically supervised safer smoking facility (SSF) for non-injection drug users (NIDU). Current reluctance on the part of health authorities is likely {{due to the lack of}} existing evidence surrounding the extent of related harm and potential uptake of such a facility among NIDUs in this setting. In November 2004, a feasibility study was conducted among 437 crack cocaine smokers. Univariate analyses were conducted to determine associations with willingness to use a SSF and logistic regression was used to adjust for potentially confounding variables (p < 0. 05). Variables found to be independently associated with willingness to use a SSF included recent injection drug use (OR = 1. 72, 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 2. 70), having equipment confiscated or broken by police (OR = 1. 96, 95 % CI: 1. 24 – 2. 85), crack bingeing (OR = 2. 16, 95 % CI: 1. 39 – 3. 12), smoking crack in public places (OR = 2. 48, 95 % CI: 1. 65 – 3. 27), borrowing crack pipes (OR = 2. 50, 95 % CI: 1. 86 – 3. 40), and burns/ inhaled brillo due to rushing smoke in public places (OR = 4. 37, 95 % CI: 2. 71 – 8. 64). The results suggest a strong potential for a SSF to reduce the health related harms and address concerns of public order and open drug use among crack cocaine smokers should a facility be implemented in this setting. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Farmácia (Tecnologia Farmacêutica), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2017 A {{key point}} in the {{administration}} of biopharmaceuticals is the recognition of appropriate, effective, safe and biocompatible nanocarriers allowing overcoming extracellular and intracellular biological barriers without loss of drug stability and adequate therapeutic response at the target sites. Since their description by Rainer Müller in the early 1990 ’s, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) have been developed as an effective colloidal drug carrier. Under optimized conditions, SLN can be produced for the entrapment of lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs with the essential requirements for an optimum nanoparticulate carrier. Its colloidal size and the controlled release behaviour allow protection and management when administered by parenteral and <b>non-parenteral</b> <b>routes</b> (e. g., oral, nasal and pulmonary). The pulmonary route has gained interest to the non-invasive administration of biopharmaceuticals on account of the promising anatomical features of the lung, particularly its large absorptive epithelial surface area, low thickness and avoiding the first-pass effect. The lung region where the particles are deposited depends on their aerodynamic diameter. The complex structure of the respiratory tree and the natural defence mechanisms of the lung are fundamental aspects for the design of a proper pulmonary delivery system. Although pulmonary delivery of nanoparticles has an unquestionable interest, it still requires a complex setup and an aerosolization technique, due to their low inertia and small size, which hindering the deposition in the lung, facilitating the exhalation with air. A promising alternative is the formulation of nanoparticles in inhalable microspheres that ensure their release after pulmonary administration. Microspheres have recently been proposed for pulmonary inhalation as dry powders, since they can be designed to achieve appropriate morphological and aerodynamic characteristics. Previous studies have shown that polymeric nanocarriers loaded in microparticulate systems present a great potential for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and genetic material. These microspheres act only as inert vehicles of the nanoparticles, which remain unaltered after the spray-drying process, not affecting the properties or the release profile of the encapsulated active agents, thus constituting a suitable microparticulate carrier for the pulmonary delivery of drug-containing nanoparticles. In this context a research project has been designed to explore the application and versatility of these micro-nanostructured systems as carriers for therapeutic drugs/proteins and genetic material. The SLN containing an anti-tuberculosis drug, a model peptide or a model plasmid (rifabutin, papain and pEGFP-C 1, respectively) were formulated and optimized. Then, for pulmonary administration, SLN were spray-dried using common pharmaceutical excipients (mannitol and trehalose). The integrity and stability of all biomacromolecules studied were not affected by the SLN and microspheres formulation and preparation procedures, which were then considered as suitable for the encapsulation of labile therapeutic molecules. Particularly mannitol and trehalose and the SLN themselves acted as stabilizers of the pharmaceutics during spray-drying. The prepared spray-dried powders displayed good flow and aerosolization properties for pulmonary administration and exhibited high deposition in the lower regions of the respiratory tract determined through a twin-stage liquid impinger, Moreover, the spray-drying process preserved the peculiar nanoparticles features after their disintegration from dry microspheres, exhibiting a sustained release profile of antibiotic and peptide after contact with an aqueous medium containing a lung surfactant. Studies in cell cultures and animal models have revealed the biocompatibility and ability of these nanoparticles to promote the absorption of drugs and peptides through pulmonary epithelium, as well as their excellent potential in gene therapy. In conclusion, all the results obtained in this experimental work showed the interest of these systems as vehicles for the pulmonary administration of antibiotic drugs and therapeutic proteins and nucleic acids...|$|R

The route of administration in opiate dependent patients may change overtime Change from <b>non-parenteral</b> to parenteral <b>route</b> of administration is more common than the reverse transition. In the current study, 17 patients of opiate dependence syndrome (DSM-IV) who had history of reverse transition (Shift from parenteral to inhalational route), were evaluated for the reasons for the reverse transition. Verbatim responses were recorded in response to open-ended questions and a semistructured questionnaire was also used. All the patients gave health-related reasons for this reverse transition and reported knowledge of health hazards of injecting route as {{one of the reasons for}} it. Other reasons cited by subjects for this transition were occurrence of physical complications due to drug use in peers and patients themselves; drug related death of peers, knowledge of risk of HIV/ AIDS and difficulties in getting a vein. The study emphasizes the need to educate the patients about the health hazards of parenteral route.
