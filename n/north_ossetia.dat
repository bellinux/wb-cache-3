5|$|The Ossetian {{people are}} {{indigenous}} to <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia,</b> {{located in the}} North Caucasus. Controversy surrounds the date of Ossetian arrival in Transcaucasia. According to one theory, they first migrated there during the 13th and 14th centuries AD, and lived alongside the Georgians peacefully for centuries. In 1918, conflict began between the landless Ossetian peasants living in Shida Kartli, who were influenced by Bolshevism and demanded ownership of the lands they worked and the Menshevik government backed ethnic Georgian aristocrats, who were legal owners. Although the Ossetians were initially discontented with the economic policies of the central government, the tension soon transformed into ethnic conflict. During uprisings in 1919 and 1920, the Ossetians were covertly supported by Soviet Russia, but even so, were defeated.|$|E

50|$|<b>North</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> OMON {{participated in}} the short but vicious 1992 East Prigorodny Conflict in Russia. They killed or 'disappeared' {{hundreds}} of local indigenous Ingush people. Ossetian OMON reportedly massacred residents of Ingush villages that had first been shelled by Russian federal army tanks that were officially in to the region for 'peacekeeping' purposes.|$|R
25|$|Basayev further said an FSB agent (Khodov) {{had been}} sent {{undercover}} to the rebels to persuade them to carry out {{an attack on a}} target in <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> capital, Vladikavkaz, and that the group was allowed to enter the region with ease because the FSB planned to capture them at their destination in Vladikavkaz. He also claimed that an unnamed hostage-taker had survived the siege and managed to escape.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of the war, about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled the {{territory}} and Georgia proper, most across the border into <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia.</b> A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia to other parts of Georgia. Many South Ossetians were resettled in uninhabited areas of <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> from which the Ingush had been expelled by Stalin in 1944, leading to conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush over the right of residence in former Ingush territory.|$|E
25|$|In July 2006, Basayev {{was killed}} {{near the border}} of <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> {{in the village of}} Ekazhevo, Ingushetia, a {{republic}} bordering Chechnya.|$|E

25|$|According to Torshin, {{the order}} to start the {{operation}} was given {{by the head of}} the North Ossetian FSB Valery Andreyev. However, statements by both Andreyev and the Dzasokhov indicated that it was FSB deputy directors Vladimir Pronichev and Vladimir Anisimov who were actually in charge of the Beslan operation. General Andreyev also told <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> Supreme Court that the decision to use heavy weapons during the assault was made by the head of the FSB's Special Operations Center, Colonel General Aleksandr Tikhonov.|$|R

2500|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Ruslan Aushev, Alexander Dzasokhov, Taymuraz Mansurov (<b>North</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> Parliament Chairman), and First Deputy Chairman Izrail Totoonti {{together}} made contact with President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Aslan Maskhadov. Totoonti said that both Maskhadov and his Western-based emissary Akhmed Zakayev declared {{they were ready to}} fly to Beslan to negotiate with the militants, which was later confirmed by Zakayev. Totoonti said that Maskhadov's sole demand was his unhindered passage to the school; however, the assault began one hour after the agreement on his arrival was made. He also mentioned that journalists from Al Jazeera television offered for three days to participate in the negotiations and enter the school even as hostages, [...] "but their services were not needed by anyone." ...|$|R

2500|$|The attackers mined {{the gym and}} {{the rest}} of the {{building}} with improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and surrounded it with tripwires. In a further bid to deter rescue attempts, they threatened to kill 50 hostages for every one of their own members killed by the police, and to kill 20 hostages for every gunman injured. They also threatened to blow up the school if government forces attacked. To avoid being overwhelmed by gas attack like their comrades in the 2002 Moscow hostage crisis, insurgents quickly smashed the school's windows. The captors prevented hostages from eating and drinking (calling this a [...] "hunger strike", which they said they joined too) until <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia's</b> President Alexander Dzasokhov would arrive to negotiate with them. However, the FSB set up their own crisis headquarters from which Dzasokhov was excluded, and threatened to arrest him if he tried to go to the school.|$|R
25|$|The Uatsdin {{movement}} is active both in <b>North</b> and South <b>Ossetia.</b> Whilst {{there are no}} figures about religious demographics for South <b>Ossetia,</b> in <b>North</b> Ossetia–Alania about 29% of the population adheres ethnic-folk religion according to a 2012 survey.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, after Lyudvig Chibirov {{had been}} elected as South Ossetia's first president, Shavlokhov became Chibirov's prime minister.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1991–1992 South Ossetia War, about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled South Ossetia and Georgia proper, most across the border into <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia.</b> A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia and settled in other parts of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Sporadic {{explosions and}} gunfire {{continued}} at night despite reports that all resistance by militants had been suppressed, until some 12 {{hours after the}} first explosions.

50|$|After the 1917 February Revolution that {{resulted}} in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the Ossetians set up a National Council of Ossetians which convened in Java in June 1917 and advocated the creation of organs of self-rule in Ossetian-inhabited areas on the both sides of the Caucasus. The Council was internally divided along the ideological lines and soon became dominated by the Bolsheviks who called for the unification of <b>North</b> and South <b>Ossetias</b> and the incorporation of South Ossetia into Soviet Russia.|$|R
25|$|In 70 {{years of}} Kabardino-Balkaria, <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia,</b> the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast {{children}} of indigenous nationalities were denied {{the opportunity to}} study in their native language And we have operated {{since the beginning of}} 25 Abkhaz schools, recently the same time - 73 (Abkhazian and mixed), where the language of the titular nation were more than four thousand children.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conflicts}} in Abkhazia, <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> and South Ossetia {{during the early}} 1990s, scores of villages were destroyed in a systematic effort to expel the native Georgian and Ingush populations from those regions. In Darfur, the Janjaweed militia has made house demolition {{a central part of}} its strategy to expel the population of the region, causing 2.5 million people to be displaced as of October 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range {{forms the}} {{northern}} border of South Ossetia with Russia, {{and the main}} roads through the mountain range into Russian territory lead through the Roki Tunnel between South and <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> and the Darial Gorge. The Roki Tunnel was vital for the Russian military in the 2008 South Ossetia war {{because it is the}} only direct route through the Caucasus Mountains.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Georgian government, {{established}} {{after the}} Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, created the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast in April 1922 {{under pressure from}} Kavburo (the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party). Some historians believe that autonomy was granted to the Ossetians by the Bolsheviks {{in return for their}} assistance in fighting against independent Georgia, since this territory had never been a separate entity. Ossetians moved in large numbers to Tskhinvali, which used to have a larger population of Jews and Armenians than of Ossetians. <b>North</b> and South <b>Ossetia</b> were linked for the first time only in 1985 when the Roki Tunnel was opened.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of August 2008 the war between Georgia and South Ossetia broke out, in which the Russian Federation subsequently became involved. After {{the outbreak of the}} war, there were virtually no more attacks or abductions of Ingush civilians by [...] "unknown" [...] forces. Most of the Russian forces were transferred to <b>North</b> and South <b>Ossetias</b> 31 August 2008 Magomed Yevloyev, the head of Ingush opposition and the owner the website ingushetiya.ru, was killed by Russian security forces Shortly before the unrecognised opposition group People's Parliament of Ingushetia Mekhk-Kkhel called for the recognition of the Russian semi-autonomous republic's independence, opposition activist Magomed Khazbiyev proclaimed, [...] "We must ask Europe or America to separate us from Russia." ...|$|R
5000|$|Starting on 4 May 2014, the United Ossetia Party and the Union of Paratroopers in the pro-Russian {{breakaway}} Republic of South Ossetia {{announced a}} recruitment drive meant to send {{veterans of the}} Georgian-Ossetian conflict to protect [...] "the peaceful population of Ukraine's southeast". Some videos issued by an Ossetian militant group {{indicated that they were}} operating in Donetsk. Donbass insurgents interviewed on 27 May admitted that there were sixteen fighters from Ossetia operating around Donetsk for at least two months prior.Head of the State Border Guard of Ukraine Mykola Lytvyn said that officials reports indicated the presence of Abkhaz militants as well. Militants from <b>North</b> and South <b>Ossetia</b> were open about their presence in Donbass in June. One militant named Oleg, part of the Vostok Battalion, told reporters [...] "In 2008 they were killing us and the Russians saved us. I came here to pay my dues to them".|$|R
25|$|On 16 December 2005, Valery Andreyev, {{chief of}} the North Ossetian Federal Security Service (FSB) {{at the time of}} the hostage-taking, testified that he had {{personally}} given the order to overrun the school during the siege. Four days later it was announced that Alexander Dzasokhov, the former leader of <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia,</b> would testify at Kulayev's trial. His presence was demanded by the Mothers of Beslan.|$|E
25|$|Ethnic {{violence}} also flared in South Ossetia but {{was eventually}} quelled, although {{at the cost}} of several hundred casualties and 100,000 refugees fleeing into Russian <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia.</b> In south-western Georgia, the autonomous republic of Ajaria came under the control of Aslan Abashidze, who managed to rule his republic from 1991 to 2004 as a personal fiefdom in which the Tbilisi government had little influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{captured}} suspect, 24-year-old Nur-Pashi Kulayev, born in Chechnya, {{was identified}} by former hostages {{as one of}} the hostage-takers. The state-controlled Channel One showed fragments of Kulayev's interrogation in which he said his group was led by a Chechnya-born man nicknamed Polkovnik and by the <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> native Vladimir Khodov. According to Kulayev, Polkovnik shot another militant and detonated two female suicide bombers because they objected to capturing children.|$|E
25|$|However, ethnic {{tensions}} in <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> which were orchestrated by Ossetian nationalists (per Helsinki Human Right Watch), {{led to an}} outbreak {{of violence in the}} Ossetian–Ingush conflict in late October, when another ethnic cleansing of the Ingush population started. In a possible retaliation, Chechen and Ingush militants took over 500 Osset hostages in Beslan high-school. According to media reports, the school gymnasium was one of several buildings in which the Islamist militants had held hundreds of Osset hostages, many of them women and children. The hostages were all kept in the same gymnasium, and deprived of food and water; at least one newborn, and several dozen male hostages were executed. Over 60,000 Ingush civilians were forced from their homes in the Prigorodny District of <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia.</b> As a result of the conflict, pro-Russian general Ruslan Aushev, a decorated war hero from the War in Afghanistan, was appointed by the Russian government as the first president of Ingushetia {{to stop the spread of}} the conflict. Partial stability returned under his rule.|$|E
25|$|Ossetians {{emigrated from}} <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> {{since the second}} half of the 19th century, end of Caucasian War. Today, the {{majority}} of them live in Ankara and Istanbul. There are 24 Ossetian villages in central and eastern Anatolia. The Ossetians in Turkey are divided into three major groups, depending on their history of immigration and ensuing events: those living in Kars (Sarıkamış) and Erzurum, those in Sivas, Tokat and Yozgat and those in Muş and Bitlis.|$|E
25|$|The crisis {{began when}} a group of armed radical Islamist combatants, mostly Ingush and Chechen, {{occupied}} School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, <b>North</b> <b>Ossetia</b> (an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation) on 1 September 2004. The hostage-takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen terrorist warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded recognition of the independence of Chechnya at the United Nations and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya.|$|E
