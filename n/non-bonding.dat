5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The <b>non-bonding</b> nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Knowledge of {{amino acid}} composition, alone, is {{verified}} {{here to be}} suffi-cient for recognizing the structural class, a, b, a 1 b, or a/b of a given protein with an accu-racy of 81 %. This is supported by results from exhaustive enumerations of all conformations for all sequences of simple, compact lattice models consisting of two types (hydrophobic and polar) of residues. Different compositions exhibit strong affinities for certain folds. Within the limits of validity of the lattice models, two factors appear to determine the choice of particular folds: 1) the coordination numbers of individual sites and 2) the size and geometry of <b>non-bonded</b> clusters. These two properties, collectively termed the distribution of <b>non-bonded</b> contacts, are quantitatively assessed by an eigenvalue analysis of the so-called Kirch-hoff or adjacency matrices obtained by con-sidering the <b>non-bonded</b> interactions on a lat-tice. The analysis permits the identification of conformations that possess the same distri-bution of <b>non-bonded</b> contacts. Furthermore, some distributions of <b>non-bonded</b> contacts are favored entropically, due to their high degeneracies. Thus, a competition between enthalpic and entropic effects is effective in determining {{the choice of a}} distribution for a given composition. Based on these findings, an analysis of <b>non-bonded</b> contacts in protein structures was made. The analysis shows that proteins belonging to the four distinct folding classes exhibit significant differences in their distributions of <b>non-bonded</b> contacts, which more directly explains the success in predicting structural class from amino acid composition.

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the colours of {{lanthanide}} complexes originate almost entirely from charge transfer interactions between the metal and the ligand. f → f transitions are symmetry forbidden (or Laporte-forbidden), which is also true of transition metals, however t-metals are able to use vibronic coupling to break this rule. The valence orbitals in lanthanides are almost entirely <b>non-bonding</b> and as such little effective vibronic coupling takes, hence the spectra from f → f transitions are much weaker and narrower than those from d → d transitions. In general this makes the colours of lanthanide complexes far fainter than those of transition metal complexes. f→f transitions are not possible for the f1 and f13 configurations of Ce3+ and Yb3+ and thus these ions are colourless in aqueous solution.|$|E
500|$|Noble gas {{compounds}} such as xenon difluoride (...) {{are considered}} to be hypervalent because they violate the octet rule. Bonding in such compounds can be explained using a three-center four-electron bond model. This model, first proposed in 1951, considers bonding of three collinear atoms. For example, bonding in [...] is described by a set of three molecular orbitals (MOs) derived from p-orbitals on each atom. Bonding results from the combination of a filled p-orbital from Xe with one half-filled p-orbital from each F atom, resulting in a filled bonding orbital, a filled <b>non-bonding</b> orbital, and an empty antibonding orbital. The highest occupied molecular orbital is localized on the two terminal atoms. This represents a localization of charge which is facilitated by the high electronegativity of fluorine.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{in vitro}} study aimed to compare dentin wall caries {{development}} at different composite-dentin interfaces. METHODS: Dentin samples (10. 4 mm(2)) were restored with composite resin using two adhesive systems (etch-and-rinse and self-etch techniques). Different composite-dentin interfaces with gaps were produced: (a) failed bonded, which were fractured at interface after being submitted to aging protocols (no aging, mechanical loading or water storage); (b) <b>non-bonded</b> interfaces, both without any adhesive material or with adhesive material applied {{only on the}} dentin. Adhesively fractured and <b>non-bonded</b> samples were subjected to a lactic acid gel (pH= 5) caries model with a continuous opening/closing movement of the interfacial gap for 10 days. Transverse wavelength-independent microradiographs were taken, and lesion depth and mineral loss were measured. Data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: Caries development differed among the composite-dentin interfaces (p< 0. 001). The <b>non-bonded</b> interface with adhesive material on the dentin showed less lesion depth than the failed bonded groups, while the <b>non-bonded</b> interface without adhesive on dentin showed the deepest wall lesions. Difference between the adhesive systems was observed only in the <b>non-bonded</b> groups (p= 0. 003), with the self-etch adhesive applied on the dentin showing more severe lesions. Samples broken after mechanical loading aging showed deeper lesions than those broken after water storage (p< 0. 001). SIGNIFICANCE: Composite-dentin interfaces failed after aging presented different demineralization from interfaces that were never bonded, indicating that the restorative treatment changes the tissue in a way relevant to secondary caries development...|$|R
2500|$|In organic chemistry, hyperconjugation is the {{interaction}} of the electrons in a sigma bond (usually C–H or C–C) with an adjacent empty (or partially filled) <b>non-bonding</b> p-orbital, antibonding σ or π orbital, or filled π orbital, to give an extended molecular orbital that increases the stability of the system. Only electrons in bonds that are β to the positively charged carbon can stabilize a carbocation by direct hyperconjugation. However, extended versions of hyperconjugation (such as double hyperconjugation) can be important as well. [...] The Baker–Nathan effect, sometimes used synonymously for hyperconjugation, is a specific application of it to certain chemical reactions or types of structures.|$|E
2500|$|Planar {{monocyclic}} {{molecules containing}} 4n π-electrons are called antiaromatic and are, in general, unstable. [...] Molecules {{that could be}} antiaromatic will tend to change from this electronic or conformation, thereby becoming non-aromatic. [...] For example, cyclooctatetraene (COT) distorts out of planarity, breaking π overlap between adjacent double bonds. Recent studies have determined that cyclobutadiene adopts an asymmetric, rectangular configuration in which single and double bonds indeed alternate, with no resonance; the single bonds are markedly longer than the double bonds, reducing unfavorable p-orbital overlap. This reduction of symmetry lifts the degeneracy of the two formerly <b>non-bonding</b> molecular orbitals, which by Hund's rule forces the two unpaired electrons into a new, weakly bonding orbital (and also creates a weakly antibonding orbital). Hence, cyclobutadiene is non-aromatic; the strain of the asymmetric configuration outweighs the anti-aromatic destabilization that would afflict the symmetric, square configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Systems {{following}} Hückel's rule, having 4n+2 π-electrons, are aromatic, but {{if there}} are 4n π-electrons along with characteristics 1–3 above, the molecule {{is said to be}} antiaromatic. [...] Antiaromatic systems are destabilized and sometimes adopt distorted structures to avoid planarity. [...] An atom in an aromatic system can have other electrons that {{are not part of the}} system, and are therefore ignored for the 4n+2 rule. [...] For example, in furan, the oxygen atom is sp2 hybridized. One lone pair (in the pz orbital) contributes to the π system and the other in the plane of the ring (in the <b>non-bonding</b> sp2 orbital and analogous to the C–H bond in the other positions) does not; consequently, there are 6 π-electrons in furan and it is aromatic. [...] Comparing the nitrogen heterocycles pyrrole and pyridine, each has a 6 π-electron system: the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is required to complete the aromatic sextet in the case of pyrrole while the lone pair of in pyridine is not required. [...] The difference can be seen in the basicity of the two systems, as pyridine can be easily protonated (its lone pair is available for reaction) whilst pyrrole does not react readily. [...] This can be seen in the pKa values of the respective conjugate acids [...] 8.25 for pyridine compared with 0.27 for pyrrole. [...] In the case of oxazole and isoxazole, the lone pairs contributed to the aromatic sextet come from the occupied pz orbital of oxygen atom rather than the nitrogen lone pairs in hybridized sp2 orbitals. [...] Electrostatic potential surfaces illustrate the difference in electronegativity of the heteroatom bearing an electron pair depending on whether or not it forms part of the aromatic system. [...] In the diagram below, the nitrogen atom in pyridine is markedly more electronegative than nitrogen atom in indole, as indicated by the red regions on the surfaces, because the pyridine nitrogen is free to act as a Lewis base whereas the indole nitrogen is not. [...] The surfaces also illustrate that heteroatoms influence the ability to form cation–pi interactions as cations will be attracted to the aromatic system much more strongly in indole and in benzene than will be the case in pyridine where a direct interaction with the lone pair is more favoured.|$|E
