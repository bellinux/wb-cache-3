'You cannot {{walk the}} streets without beholding Democracy {{announce}} itself: the very Tailor has become, if not properly Sansculottic, which to him would be ruinous, yet a Tailor unconsciously symbolising, and prophesying with his scissors, the reign of Equality. What now is our fashionable coat? A thing of superfinest texture, of deeply meditated cut; with Malines-lace cuffs; quilted with gold; so that a man can carry, without difficulty, an estate of land on his back? Keineswegs, By no manner of means! The Sumptuary Laws have fallen into such a state of desuetude as was never before seen. Our fashionable coat is an amphibium between barn-sack and drayman's doublet. The cloth of it is studiously coarse; the colour a speckled soot-black or rust-brown gray; the nearest approach to a Peasant's. And for shape,--thou shouldst see it! The last consummation of the year now passing over us is definable as Three Bags; a big bag for the body, two small bags for the arms, and by way of collar a hem! The first Antique Cheruscan who, of felt-cloth or bear's-hide, with bone or metal <b>needle,</b> <b>set</b> about making himself a coat, before Tailors had yet awakened out of Nothing,--did not he make it even so? A loose wide poke for body, with two holes to let out the arms; this was his original coat: to which holes it was soon visible that two small loose pokes, or sleeves, easily appended, would be an improvement.|$|E

Although the use of “Vacutainer ” tubes in the determination of blood gas has been demonstrated before (1, 2), relatively few laboratories have adopted this system for routine use. The general dissatisfaction with this procedure for arterial blood collection seems to center around the diffi-culty in obtaining an anaerobic specimen with a Vacutainer system designed for venipuncture.

40|$|Injections are {{the most}} common health care {{procedure}} worldwide. In developing and transitional countries alone, some 16 thousand million injections are administered each year. 1 Most injections, more than 90 %, are given for therapeutic purposes while 5 to 10 % are given for preventive services, including immunization and family planning. The majority of therapeutic injections in developing and transitional countries are unnecessary. A safe injection does not harm the recipient, does not expose the health care worker to any avoidable risk and does not result in waste that is dangerous for the community. 2 When injections are medically indicated they should be administered safely. Unsafe injections place patients at risk of disability and death. Reuse of injection devices without sterilization is of particular concern as it may transmit hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), accounting for 30 %, 41 % and 5 % of new infections in 2000, respectively. 3 In addition, inappropriate and unhygienic use of multi-dose vials may transmit bloodborne pathogens. 2 Best infection control practices for intradermal, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections recommend the use of a new, single use injection device for each injection and for the reconstitution of each unit of medication. 4 Sterile single use injection devices are widely available at low cost.

40|$|A 72 -year-old man whowas a known carrierof {{hepatitis}} B under-went computed tomographic (CT) –guided biopsy {{of a mass}} in the liver, {{which had}} been detected during routine sur-veillance. Needle biopsy was performed using a coaxial technique with an 18 -gauge Quick-Core biopsy <b>needle</b> <b>set</b> (Cook Medical) (Figure 1 A). A CT scan taken immediately after the procedure showed a linear streak of gas {{at the site of}} the biopsy. Several gas-filled branching structures that extended to the periphery of the liver were seen, consis-tent with portal venous gas (Figure 1 B, C). As the patient was asymptomatic, treatment was managed conservatively. The patient was discharged in the evening and was well on follow-up three weeks after the procedure. Portal venous gas has historically been considered a rare condition associated with mesenteric ischemia and bowel necrosis, with a potentially fatal outcome. Indeed, timely clini-cal evaluation remains crucial in the appropriate setting. 1 Nev-ertheless, it is now known that portal venous gas is not a dis-ease but rather a manifestation with myriad causes. In recent years, benign etiologies have been increasingly recognized, in part because of the rise in use of imaging techniques such as ultrasonography and CT, leading to its increased detection. Among the roster of benign causes, iatrogenic causes are well described. These include lumbar puncture, 2 double-contrast barium enema, 3 colonoscopy, 4 endoscopic sphincterotomy 5 and radiofrequency ablation. 6 In our patient, transgression of the portal vein with entry of ambient air during biopsy was the likely cause of portal venous gas. Notably, a common feature among the iatrogenic associations of portal venous gas is the benign clinical course. Therefore, portal venous gas can be managed expectantly when it is incidentally detected in an oth-erwise asymptomatic patient who has undergone a procedure.

The variation of the combination coefficient between uncharged aerosol particles and small ions, ɳo, with radius was also examined. The ion-ion recombination coefficient,ɤ, was first evaluated from plots of small ion decay in an aerosol-free mylar vessel of volume 3. 1 m(^ 3). Small ions were produced from corona discharge around {{the tip of a}} steel <b>needle,</b> <b>set</b> at a high voltage. 14 measurements of were made, giving a mean experimental value of 2. 39 (- 0. 14) x l 0 (^- 6) cm(^ 3) sec(^-l).

Methods of number concentration and particle size determination are described. The decay of the ions {{in the presence of the}} particles in the mylar vessel was recorded and compared with a family of theoretical ion-aerosol decay curves plotted by the computer to determine b. A total of 26 b measurements were made and the value ranged from 0. 35 x 10 (^- 6) cm(^ 3) sec(^- 1) to 2. 24 x 10 (^- 6) cm(^ 3) sec(^- 1),corresponding to radii of 0. 41 x 10 (^- 6) cm to 4. 0 x 10 (^- 6) cm.
