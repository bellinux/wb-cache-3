40|$|ABSTRACT. The Australian sugar {{industry}} utilizes rolling almost exclusively for extraction of sucrose from prepared sugarcane. The feeding and extraction performance of rolling mills is strongly {{dependent on the}} friction coefficient between counter−rotating rolls and the fibro−porous sugarcane blanket. Rolls are circumferentially grooved and roughened with weld droplets to assist juice drainage and maximize friction between rolls and blanket. Previous investigators have performed experimental measurements of the friction coefficient between metal surfaces and prepared cane or bagasse. This article develops a multi−variate empirical regression equation based on the experimental measurements of previous investigators to describe the dependence of the interfacial friction coefficient on <b>normal</b> <b>pressure,</b> groove <b>angle,</b> and relative rubbing speed. The friction coefficient was found to decrease exponentially with increasing <b>normal</b> <b>pressure,</b> decrease linearly with increasing rubbing speed, and increase with decreasing groove angle in accordance with simple wedge theory...|$|R

Among the two models, low <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> helical pinion (15 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> with 0.002 mm tip relief) running at slow speed(509.2 rpm) provide improved performance with lesser bending stress (145.588 N/mm 2) over more traditional 20 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> pinion (236.606 N/mm 2).

5000|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>angle</b> in {{relation}} to gear teeth, {{also known as the}} angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of <b>pressure</b> (which is <b>normal</b> to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> gives the direction normal to the tooth profile. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the [...] "standard" [...] <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> are weaker.

40|$|Spur Gear {{vibration}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} indispensable parameter in Maintenance division of an operating plant. Many methods have been adopted to control the vibration in gears. An approach of understanding the influence of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> in spur gear vibration is required in the modern trends. <b>Pressure</b> <b>angle</b> influence in root stress has been analyzed earlier by some of the researchers, but may not be in vibration. Three steel spur gears having the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of 140, 200 and 250 with the same face width, pitch circle diameter and number of teeth are selected for this analysis.

The use of high power density transmission systems such as epicyclic gear trains {{is the way to}} achieve the goal reducing the overall volume and mass compared with traditional configurations. Gears are the main component of the transmissions because they play the crucial role of transmitting the power from the input to the output with a defined ratio. In terms of gear performances, tooth geometry has a direct influence on load carrying capacity: increase the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> modifies the tooth profile with a direct influence on bending and contact stress. To test the benefits of high <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> gears in epicyclic transmissions, four different epicyclic systems with same boundary design conditions have been modelled.

Using high <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> gears in epicyclic transmissions has a beneficial effect on tensile stresses but is unfavourable for the compressive ones. Moreover, it has been seen that <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> effect might be enhanced or nullified if other modifications such as profile shift are used concurrently...|$|R
