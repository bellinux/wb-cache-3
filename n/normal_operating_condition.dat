50|$|CALCE {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of research in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). CALCE formed the first collaborative research effort to address PHM applications. Through the work of their PHM Consortium, CALCE has developed a new paradigm for reliability prediction based on prognostics whereby sensor data is integrated into models that enable in-situ assessment of the deviation of a product from its expected <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> Additionally, CALCE has developed a prognostics roadmap that will be included in the ITRI semiconductor roadmap. In the field of Electronic Part Supply Chain Management, CALCE is the preeminent technical organization for thermal up-rating, counterfeit electronic part management, and electronic part obsolescence forecasting and management. CALCE developed the concept of up-rating, a process that mitigates the risk associated with using semiconductor devices outside manufacturer specifications. CALCE also developed the first quantitative analysis of lifetime buy sizes for electronic parts, which has allowed electronics integrators to reduce their stock inventories and save money.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an online system parameter estimation technique from the response measurements through using the recursive covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification (SSI-COV) approach. In developing the recursive SSI-COV, to avoid time-consumption of singular value decomposition in recursive SSI, the extended instrumental variable version of the projection approximation subspace tracking method is used in SSI-COV. Besides, to reduce the effect of noise on the results of identification, the preprocessing of data using recursive singular spectrum analysis technique is also presented to remove the noise contaminant measurements to enhance the stability of data analysis. On the basis of the proposed method, both the ambient vibration and seismic response data of a tower (Canton Tower) are used to observe the time-varying system natural frequencies of a tower from its operating condition. Results from using off-line SSI-COV method under <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> are also presented. Comparison on the identified time-varying dynamic characteristics of the tower under <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> and earthquake response of distanced earthquake event is discussed.

30|$|The backup {{protection}} plays a {{major role}} in increasing the dependability of the power system protection. This increased dependability is acceptable when the power system is in <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> However, when the system is being operated at its maximum operating limit, a false trip would result in greater damage. Hence, it is desirable to increase the security attribute of the protection system. The security-dependability balance is essential for reliable operation of a power system [6].|$|E
