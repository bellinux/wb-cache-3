5|$|Between 1946 and 1952, uranium {{compounds}} were {{extracted from}} locally mined graptolitic argillite at the Sillamäe Processing Plant (now: Silmet).

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their opponents, {{the action of}} 23 August gave the North Vietnamese Air Force their first major victory since Operation Bolo. The USAF’s confirmation {{of the loss of}} ‘Ford 4’ to a MiG aircraft gave Nguyen Van Coc his second air-to-air victory, and he eventually became the leading ace pilot of the war with nine kills. Earlier in the engagement, flight leader Nguyen Nhat Chieu claimed to have destroyed an F-105 with a missile, but the USAF have <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> that claim. Nonetheless, Chieu also became a ranking ace pilot with six kills attributed to his name. The USAF also claimed one victory against a MiG-17 fighter, attributed to First Lieutenant David B. Waldrop, but the claim was <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> by the North Vietnamese because all their MiG fighters returned to base safely.|$|E

Although he is often listed as a saint, this is <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> by Bede and it has recently been argued that such assertions are incorrect.|$|E
5|$|After a whistle-blower {{reported}} that the MSDF's preference had been improperly changed an investigation was launched. On December 16 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated that it had <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for mentioning the MCH-101 by name during the procurement process to his subordinates.

5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E

5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} evidence from ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> that Leucopholiota decorosa belongs in the Tricholomataceae family.

According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria.|$|E
