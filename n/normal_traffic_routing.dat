30|$|Network <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> is {{fundamental}} in networking and entails selecting {{a path for}} packet transmission. Selection criteria are diverse and primarily depend on the operation policies and objectives, such as cost minimization, maximization of link utilization, and QoS provisioning. <b>Traffic</b> <b>routing</b> requires challenging abilities for the ML models, {{such as the ability}} to cope and scale with complex and dynamic network topologies, the ability to learn the correlation between the selected path and the perceived QoS, and the ability to predict the consequences of routing decisions. In the existing literature, one family of ML techniques has dominated research in <b>traffic</b> <b>routing,</b> Reinforcement Learning.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the Dynamic <b>Traffic</b> <b>Routing</b> {{problem is}} defined as the {{real-time}} point diversion of traffic during non-recurrent congestion. This dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> problem is then formulated as a feedback control problem that determines the time-dependent split parameters at the diversion point for <b>routing</b> the incoming <b>traffic</b> flow onto the alternate routes in order to achieve a user-equilibrium traffic pattern. Feedback linearization technique is used to solve this specific user-equilibrium formulation of the Dynamic <b>Traffic</b> <b>Routing</b> problem. The control input is the traffic split factor at the diversion point. By transforming the dynamics of the system into canonical form, a control law is obtained which cancels the nonlinearities of the system. Simulation results show that the performance of this controller on a test network is quite promising. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Toward {{improving}} {{the ability to}} evaluate self-adaptation mechanisms, we present the automated traffic rout-ing problem. This problem involves large numbers of agents, partial knowledge, and uncertainty, making it well-suited to be solved using many, distinct self-adaptation mechanisms. The well-defined {{nature of the problem}} allows for comparison and proper evaluation of the underlying mechanisms and the involved algorithms. We (1) define the problem, (2) outline the sources of uncertainty and partial information that can be addressed by self-adaptation, (3) enumerate the dimensions along which self-adaptive systems should be evaluated to provide a benchmark for comparison of self-adaptation and traditional mechanisms, (4) present ADASIM, an open-source <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> simulator that allows easy implementation and comparison of systems solving the automated <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> problem, and (5) demonstrate ADASIM by implementing two <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> systems.

40|$|Network {{functions}} typically need to {{be visited}} in a specific order to meet certain objectives, giving rise {{to the notion of}} Service Function Chaining. Software-Defined-Networking enables fine-grained <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> optimization while satisfying correct traversal of network functions. In this work, we investigate the problem of maximizing throughput in SDN-enabled networks with respect to service chaining specifications under both traditional and new constraints. Besides the algorithm design, we also derive rigorous performance bounds. In the offline <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> case, we propose Traffic-Merging-Algorithm and prove that, although the underlying optimization problem is generally NP-hard, our algorithm can efficiently compute the optimal solution in practical settings. In the online <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> case, we propose the Primal-Dual-Update-Algorithm, which comes with a system parameter that trades off the algorithm's throughput competitiveness and its meeting of QoS requirements, and prove that our online algorithm achieves optimal tradeoff. We demonstrate that our solutions can be used to address practical problems by conducting simulation-based evaluation over backbone and data center topologies...|$|R
40|$|Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) {{attacks against}} public web servers are {{increasingly}} common. Countering DDoS attacks are becoming ever more challenging {{with the vast}} resources and techniques increasingly available to attackers. It is impossible for the victim servers {{to work on the}} individual level of on-going traffic flows. In this paper, we establish IP Flow which is used to select proper features for DDoS detection. The IP flow statistics is used to allocate the weights for <b>traffic</b> <b>routing</b> by routers. Our system protects servers from DDoS attacks without strong client authentication or allowing an attacker with partial connectivity information to repeatedly disrupt communications. The new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput by the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in a real network circumstance. The experiment shows that it is with high average detection and with low false alarm and miss alarm. Moreover, it can optimize the network traffic simultaneously with defending against DDoS attacks, thus eliminating efficiently the global burst of <b>traffic</b> arising from <b>normal</b> <b>traffic...</b>|$|R
