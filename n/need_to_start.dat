5|$|The {{proposal}} for {{a new type of}} submarine to replace the Oberon class of diesel-electric submarines began in July 1978, when the RAN director of submarine policy prepared a paper detailing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> considering a replacement for the ageing Oberons. The paper also raised the suggestion {{that the majority of the}} submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six Oberons. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting an impossible task because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who thought it could be done came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the Oberon-class replacement, and led to the view that it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.|$|E
5|$|The {{space station}} {{is divided into}} {{multiple}} sections connected by trams and elevators. Each section is composed {{of a set of}} rooms and corridors separated by doors. Some doors require certain actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For example, some doors require a keycard or a numbered entry code, while others need to be cut with a variety of welding torches or hacked using an electronic device. The player may also encounter computer terminals {{that can be used to}} access information or trigger in-game actions like disabling security cameras or manipulating the space station's air-purification mechanism. The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. To save their progress, players need to locate a terminal in the game and manually insert Amanda's access card in it. If Amanda dies, the player will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the game again from the last saved point. In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a separate game mode, called Survivor Mode, that focuses on short, player-versus-alien scenarios. In each scenario, the player needs to complete a set of objectives while avoiding the alien under a time limit.|$|E
25|$|Many {{optimization}} algorithms <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from a feasible point. One way {{to obtain}} such a {{point is to}} relax the feasibility conditions using a slack variable; with enough slack, any starting point is feasible. Then, minimize that slack variable until slack is null or negative.|$|E

25|$|His three-year {{apprenticeship}} completed, Cook {{began working}} on trading ships in the Baltic Sea. After passing his examinations in 1752, he soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks, starting with his promotion in that year to mate aboard the collier brig Friendship. In 1755, within a month of being offered command of this vessel, he volunteered for service in the Royal Navy, when Britain was re-arming for {{what was to become}} the Seven Years' War. Despite the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> back {{at the bottom of the}} naval hierarchy, Cook realised his career would advance more quickly in military service and entered the Navy at Wapping on 17 June 1755.|$|E
25|$|Zach {{consoles}} Kendall {{while she}} worries for her best friend, Greenlee Smythe, who is pregnant with Ryan Lavery's child. Kendall has seen Ryan angrily voice {{that he never}} wants children, and she fears how Ryan will react to Greenlee's pregnancy. When Greenlee relays to Ryan that they are expecting a child, Ryan goes on an angry rampage, destroying Greenlee's hotel room, and in some time, drives his motorcycle off of a cliff. Everyone presumes Ryan is dead. However, Zach discovers him alive. When Ryan strongly reasons with Zach not to reveal to Greenlee or Kendall, or anyone that he is still alive, Zach agrees, feeling that Ryan's temper is dangerous to Greenlee. He also sees Ryan's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> fresh, just as he once had.|$|E

25|$|By 1855 New South Wales {{had been}} granted {{responsible}} self-government and increasingly took responsibility for its own affairs. The colony remained within, and was fiercely loyal to, the British Empire, and while the Colonial Office continued to determine foreign policy, the decision was taken in London that the Australian colonies would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> taking {{responsibility for their own}} defence. In 1860, as British Army units were being sent to New Zealand, New South Wales attempted to raise a volunteer force of 1,700 men. This number was almost achieved with 1,644 volunteers enlisting, who were formed into one troop of mounted rifles, three batteries of artillery, and 20 companies of infantry. To encourage enlistments, land grants were offered in 1867. It was not considered a success. In 1868, these were later organised into a battalion and regimental structure. The Volunteer Sydney Rifle Corps ceased to exist, being subsumed into the 20 company-strong 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers. During the Maori Wars, although the colony had no official role, New South Wales contributed significantly to the 2,500 volunteers that were sent from Australia in 1863.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{presence}} of burrowing owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> several {{months prior to the}} anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good burrowing owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to be interested in the location – if possible, this should be at the onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way trapdoor design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose. If everything has been correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site {{in the course of a}} few nights at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Russell T Davies {{has said}} that he hopes to defy {{audience}} expectations of monosexual characters: [...] "Without making it political or dull, {{this is going to be}} a very bisexual programme. I want to knock down the barriers so we can't define which of the characters is gay. We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> mixing things up, rather than thinking, 'This is a gay character and he'll only ever go off with men.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez was {{disappointed}} that his team were unable to match their exploits of 2005, when they beat Milan in a penalty shootout. Despite this he was still proud of his players efforts: [...] "Thank you to our supporters, my staff and players who worked really hard and deserved a bit more." [...] Benítez was already thinking of making transfers {{in the aftermath of}} the match, hinting that his team lacked the same calibre of players that Milan had: [...] "You could see the quality they had, and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> thinking how we can improve our team." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{starting}} 2006–07 as second-choice to Ricketts, Howarth {{sought a}} loan away from Bradford for first-team football, saying: [...] "It is approaching {{make or break}} {{in terms of my}} career. I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> playing regularly again as soon as possible". Former club York, by this time playing in the Conference National, made a failed bid to sign him on loan in September 2006. Howarth's first and only appearance of the season, a 2–1 defeat at home to Scunthorpe in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round on 17 October 2006, proved to be the last of his career. He was released by Bradford on 9 May 2007 and subsequently retired from professional football aged 25.|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E

On November 22, 2002, Brown flew the mission that completed all Pentagon-mandated flight test goals <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> {{the next phase of}} the program.

500|$|Sébastien Mitton, {{who acted}} as art {{director}} {{on the first}} game, returned to the position for Dishonored 2. Viktor Antonov, who also helped conceive of Dishonoreds [...] "painterly" [...] look, had moved on as a general creative consultant for Bethesda and thus was less involved {{in the art of}} Dishonored 2. Arkane drew on paintings and sculptures for the art design, and had Lucie Minne mold several clay busts. The game begins and ends in the city of Dunwall, the setting of the first game, with most of the game taking place in Karnaca, [...] "the jewel of the south". The change in setting in part was out of a desire to show another corner of the series' Empire. On using both settings, Harvey Smith commented that Arkane felt [...] "we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> it at home ... and then venture out into an exotic place and come back". Mitton wanted Dishonored 2 to be a visual [...] "journey to a new city", though keeping the same sensibility of the first game and elements like oppression, disease, magic, and decay.|$|E
500|$|Qualifying on Saturday was contested {{under the}} {{retained}} 2016 [...] "elimination format" [...] regulations. Just as in years before, the qualifying procedure {{was divided into}} three parts, with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given point being taken out from contention every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3. At the beginning of Q1, all cars set fast laps, before the top placed drivers returned to the pitline, leaving the track to the ones fighting elimination. Felipe Nasr and Rio Haryanto were unable to set a second timed lap and with the former making a mistake on his only lap, he qualified in last place. While Jolyon Palmer improved his lap time on his second lap, he was quickly dropped back into elimination by a faster lap from Stoffel Vandoorne. Pascal Wehrlein qualified in 16th place, ahead of Force India's Sergio Pérez. Kevin Magnussen qualified 19th, but his penalty during practice meant that he would still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from the pit lane.|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Show {{us what you}} can do." [...] He did praise the visual effects in the episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
