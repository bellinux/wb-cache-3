5|$|As of 2010, major long-standing {{extraction}} {{industries are}} operating in Estonia, Brazil, and China. Its economic viability usually requires {{a lack of}} locally available crude oil. <b>National</b> <b>energy</b> security issues have {{also played a role}} in its development. Critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about environmental management issues, such as waste disposal, extensive water use, waste water management, and air pollution.|$|E
5|$|Cheney was a {{prominent}} member of the <b>National</b> <b>Energy</b> Policy Development Group (NEPDG), {{commonly known as the}} Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the <b>National</b> <b>Energy</b> Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Harper became {{involved}} in politics {{as a member of}} his high school's Young Liberals Club. He later changed his political allegiance because he disagreed with the <b>National</b> <b>Energy</b> Program (NEP) of Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government. He became chief aide to Progressive Conservative MP Jim Hawkes in 1985, but later became disillusioned with the party and the government of Brian Mulroney, especially the administration's fiscal policy and its inability to fully revoke the NEP until 1986. He left the PC Party that same year.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the <b>National</b> <b>Energy</b> Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E
25|$|On September 23, 2014, Cullen tabled Bill C-628 (short-titled An Act to Defend the Pacific Northwest) in the House of Commons, {{which would}} ban supertankers from the Queen Charlotte Sound, the Hecate Strait and the Dixon Entrance, {{as well as}} modify the <b>National</b> <b>Energy</b> Board Act to require any {{pipeline}} review {{to take into account}} the impact of any proposal on employment in the refining and upgrading sectors, and require the <b>National</b> <b>Energy</b> Board to deepen its consultations with communities and First Nations.
