Original families in Malinao have their own pieces of land to work on. The land west of the Aklan River, because of its topography, must have escaped the encomienderos and hacienderos in the early part of Spanish colonization.|$|R

5000|$|A {{blind trust}} is a trust {{in which the}} trust {{beneficiaries}} have <b>no</b> knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> the trust, and no right to intervene in their handling. In a blind trust, the trustees (fiduciaries, or {{those who have been}} given power of attorney) have full discretion over the assets. Blind trusts are generally used when a trust creator (sometimes called a settlor, trustor, grantor, or donor) wishes for the beneficiary to be unaware of the specific assets in the trust, such as to avoid conflict of interest between the beneficiary and the investments.|$|R
50|$|Domesday shows a {{variable}} situation of retreat and advance for the canons <b>of</b> Wolverhampton. They <b>no</b> longer held Wolverhampton itself as tenants-in-chief but as tenants <b>of</b> Samson. <b>No</b> <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> the canons are mentioned at Bilston, either before of after the Conquest: {{the whole of}} Bilston now belonged to the king himself. Other lands he had let out to other priests: certainly Hatherton, although the Victoria County History includes, while Open Domesday does not, Kinvaston, Hilton and Featherstone. At Arley, some of their land had been seized forcibly by one Osbern Fitz Richard. On the other hand, even before the Conquest, they had acquired an estate at Lutley, Worcestershire, and they claimed woodland at Sedgeley: neither of these was in Wulfrun's grant.|$|R
50|$|Until 1996, Mission Hill had {{purchased}} grapes from vineyards owned by others to produce wine, with <b>no</b> vineyard <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> its own. It started to purchase its own vineyards in 1996. Mission Hill Family Estate farms 32 family-owned estate vineyards in the Okanagan Valley. Mission Hill has estate vineyards {{in each of}} the five growing regions; West Kelowna, East Kelowna, Naramata Bench, Black Sage Bench in Southeast Oliver and Osoyoos. Most of the vineyards are planted on benches above the valley floor; on varying degrees of slope that assist with air drainage, improves frost protection and increases the amount of sun the vines receive.|$|R

Williams and Deyoe recommend that libraries perform a targeted collection assessment {{to see if}} the needs of students are being met. Collections, and books available through loans, should [...] "reflect a wide range of LGBTQ experiences", including both [...] "older titles that remain important, and more recent titles so that students can become familiar with titles that reflect changing social trends".|$|R
50|$|Baleira {{has always}} lived on {{livestock}} and agriculture. Livestock {{is a basic}} pillar of {{the economy of the}} municipality for different areas. In the valley area of Eo there are predominantly dairy cows so this area has an important part in milk production in the province of Lugo. In the most mountainous area of the municipality, the most usual Galician cow is called the blonde or la llamada rubia Gallega in Spanish. This area specializes in the production of meat and although there are very few sheep they are also important to the economy. With respect to agriculture, this is usually subsistence. Families practice agriculture for their own benefit, with <b>no</b> large <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> said activity.|$|R

Every possible combination of risky assets, can be plotted in this risk-expected return space, and the collection of all such possible portfolios defines a region in this space. The left boundary of this region is a hyperbola, and the upper edge of this region is the efficient frontier {{in the absence of}} a risk-free asset (sometimes called [...] "the Markowitz bullet"). Combinations along this upper edge represent portfolios (including <b>no</b> <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> the risk-free asset) for which there is lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Equivalently, a portfolio lying on the efficient frontier represents the combination offering the best possible expected return for given risk level.

40|$|A two-country, intertemporal, perfect-foresight {{model with}} micro foundations, {{floating}} exchange rates, uncovered interest parity, and nominal wage rigidities is formulated. The benchmark case corresponds to unit elasticities of intertemporal and intratemporal substitution in consumption, <b>no</b> initial <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> foreign assets and infinite lifetimes. Monetary disinflation {{and an increase}} in government spending then have no spillover effects on foreign consumption and employment and there are no current account dynamics. Four channels of international policy transmission are then analysed. The first is based on capital gains on <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> foreign assets. The spillover effects arising through the second and third channel depend on whether goods are gross substitutes or gross complements and on whether the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is less or greater than unity. The final channel assumes finite lifetimes and no bequest motive. It departs from debt neutrality in order to allow wealth effects and current account dynamics to play a more interesting role and to assess the difference between tax and debt finance.

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} there is a relationship between land distribution and productivity in agriculture. This paper estimates a cross-country agricultural production function that includes for the first time measures of land distribution as elements of productivity. The measures capture both the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> within a country, and the availability <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> across the agricultural population. The estimates suggest a very large and significant role for the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings.</b> This role, though, does not appear to arise because of the decreasing returns to farm size that are often identified in micro-level research. The results indicate that improvements in the distribution of agricultural land are a potential source of gains in agricultural productivity, and income per capita, across countries...|$|R
