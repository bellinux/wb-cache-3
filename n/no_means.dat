5|$|Throughout the 17th century Plymouth had {{gradually}} {{lost its}} pre-eminence as a trading port. By the mid-17th century, commodities manufactured elsewhere in England {{cost too much}} to transport to Plymouth, and the city had <b>no</b> <b>means</b> of processing sugar or tobacco imports, major products from the colonies. It {{played a part in}} the Atlantic slave trade during the early 18th century, although it was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} January 1945, {{the highly}} {{purified}} plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building, where remaining impurities were removed successfully. Los Alamos received its first plutonium from Hanford on February 2. While it was still by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war's end, Hanford was by early 1945 in operation.

5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had <b>no</b> <b>means</b> of {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps {{and hoping that}} someone would see them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It is still there today, though no longer in use.|$|E

5|$|In 1449 Alexander, Lord of the Isles granted part of {{the island}} to Torquil MacNeill of Taynish, the {{remainder}} being owned by the monks of Paisley. In 1493 the whole island came under MacNeill control and it remained in their hands, with various brief interludes, until the 19th century. This prize was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> without its hazards. In 1530 the notorious pirate Ailean nan Sop murdered MacNeill of Taynish and numerous island residents. A dozen years later the title deeds were lost when eleven gentlemen of Gigha were slain by raiders.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, the Croatian {{archeologist}} Ćiro Truhelka excavated {{bones in}} a settlement close to Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (meaning King's Tomb) {{and found the}} skeleton of a decapitated adult male. The head {{was placed on the}} chest, with two coins in the mouth. Though by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> certain, it was assumed that the skeleton belonged to Stephen Tomašević. Despite objection from the friar Antun Knežević, who argued for leaving the bones where they had laid for centuries and constructing a small church at the site, the skeleton was placed in a glass coffin in the right aisle of the Franciscan monastery in Jajce.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} goods {{produced}} indigenously, {{it was estimated}} that due to the inability of traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories {{as a result of the}} war.

The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E

Berg was noted for his {{exhaustive}} research, {{as well as his}} sympathetic, but by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> uncritical, approach to Lindbergh, whose alleged anti-Semitism he addressed in a straightforward, unblinking manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some {{believed that it was}} undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided <b>no</b> <b>means</b> for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals is by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> clear. The {{result is that}} a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavation}} yielded no finds, {{and thus}} it produced <b>no</b> <b>means</b> of reliably dating {{the construction of the}} site.

5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him <b>no</b> <b>means</b> of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach.
