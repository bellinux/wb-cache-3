[...] The first expedition turned up hundreds of theropod teeth identical to those of Majungasaurus, some of which were attached to an isolated premaxilla that was described in 1996. The following seven expeditions would turn up tens of thousands of fossils, many of which belonged to species new to science.

In contrast with previous objective analysis (e. g., Barnes 1964; O’Brien 1970; Lin and Johnson 1994) the ARM objective analysis used the constrained variational analysis method in which the atmospheric state variables are forced to satisfy the conservation of mass, heat, moisture, and momentum.

40|$|In 1989, the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) {{introduced}} a microcomputer-based evaluation tool called the Collection Analysis CD. In 1993, the SUNY Stony Brook Libraries used this tool to measure its collections against those of 27 Association of Research Libraries (ARL) peer libraries {{and of a}} "mythical " peer group. In 1996, the libraries of the State University of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> (SUNY) <b>at</b> <b>Stony</b> Brook used this CD-ROM to compare its collections {{to those of the}} SUNY University Center libraries at Albany, Binghamton, and Buffalo. Because these four libraries have formed a consortium for resource sharing and cooperative collection development, collection evaluation is seen as the first step toward drafting resource sharing agreements and assigning collection responsibilities. Five tables provide lists of subdivisions of ARL member institutions, a list of large academic libraries, and a list of priority academic programs <b>at</b> SUNY <b>Stony</b> Brook. Monograph purchases of each of the four consortium libraries are illustrated with 42 bar graphs. The consortium's total acquisitions are compared against totals from ARL members and large academic libraries; then the purchases of each individual library in various priority programs and other subject areas are compared to purchases in the same areas made by the other three members of the consortium. Data collectors found that while Stony Brook's capacity for acquisition did not compare favorably to the average ARL member, it was only slightly above or below Albany, Binghamton, and Buffalo in most disciplines.
