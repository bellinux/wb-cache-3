5|$|The RAF had {{initially}} planned on a buy of 150 trainers; however, {{with both the}} BAC TSR-2 tactical strike aircraft and Hawker Siddeley P.1154 supersonic V/STOL fighter cancelled, the RAF were looking increasingly hard at their future light strike needs and realizing that they now <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just advanced trainers with some secondary counter insurgency capability. The RAF's strike line-up {{was at this point}} intended to consist of American General Dynamics F-111s plus the AFVG for lighter strike purposes. There was concern that both F-111 and AFVG were high risk projects and with the French already planning on a strike role for the Jaguar, there was an opportunity to introduce a serious backup plan for the RAF's future strike needs – the Jaguar. As a result, by October1970, the RAF's requirements had changed to 165 single-seat strike aircraft and 35 trainers.|$|E
5|$|Grant, who was courteous to Buckner {{following}} the surrender, offered to loan him money {{to see him}} through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. The surrender was a personal humiliation for Buckner and a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000men, 48 artillery pieces, much of their equipment, {{and control of the}} Cumberland River, which led to the evacuation of Nashville. This was the first of three Confederate armies that Grant would capture during the war. (The second was John C. Pemberton's at the Siege of Vicksburg and the third Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox). Buckner also turned over considerable military equipment and provisions, which Grant's troops badly <b>needed.</b> <b>More</b> <b>than</b> 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war were eventually transported from Fort Donelson to Camp Douglas in Chicago, Camp Morton in Indianapolis, and other prison camps elsewhere in the North. Buckner was held as a prisoner at Fort Warren in Boston until he was exchanged in August 1862.|$|E

25|$|There {{were some}} {{disadvantages}} to this system, however. Under the Four Modernizations, technically trained generalists were <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> highly specialized technicians. Also, highly specialized equipment and staff were underused, {{and there was}} an overall shortage of specialized facilities to conduct training. In addition, large expenses were incurred in providing the necessary facilities and staff, and the trend in some government technical agencies was toward more general technical and vocational education.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of AIESEC's {{founding}} {{at the conclusion of}} the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem.|$|E

It was moved by train to Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia, between 10 and 15 February, being brought up to strength by 243 replacements from Fort Huachuca. On 2 March, the regiment moved to Newport News from the camp.|$|E

25|$|Also on 17 February 2005, over 24 {{years after}} the {{original}} underarm delivery, Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath light-heartedly revisited the incident in the first ever Twenty20 international, played between Australia and New Zealand. In the last over of the match, a grinning McGrath mimed an underarm delivery to Kyle Mills, which prompted New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden to produce a mock red card. As New Zealand <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 44 runs to win off the last delivery {{the outcome of the}} game was never in doubt, so it was positively received by the crowd.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 American Airlines {{announced}} {{a requirement for}} a new short-medium range airliner {{with a focus on}} low-cost per-seat operations. While it was looking for a twin-engined plane, the aircraft manufacturers <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one customer to justify developing a new airliner. Eastern Airlines was also interested, but required greater range and needed to operate long routes over water; at the time, this demanded three engines in order to provide redundancy. Other airlines also favored three engines. Lockheed and Douglas responded with designs, the L-1011 TriStar and DC-10 respectively. Both had three engines, transcontinental range and seated around 300 passengers in a widebody layout with two aisles.|$|E
25|$|Death Angel {{is often}} {{referred}} to as one of the key bands in the Bay Area thrash metal movement of the 1980s, and secured opening slots at club venues that decade, including opening for their peers Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, Testament (then-known as Legacy) and Possessed. The underground success of their first two studio albums, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), attracted the attention of Geffen Records, who signed the quintet in 1989. Their 1990 follow-up album, Act III, was also successful. While Death Angel was touring in support of that album, drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy. The band has since continued to record and perform, and their recent studio album, The Evil Divide, was released in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup. In {{the final}} against Sri Lanka, chasing 275, Dhoni {{promoted}} himself up the batting order, coming before an in form Yuvraj Singh. When {{he came to}} bat India <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed. He started building a good partnership with Gautam Gambhir. Due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls, but later accelerated with a greater flow of boundaries, ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. Befitting the occasion, he finished the match of in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and won Man of the Match. Later in the post-match presentation, {{he admitted that he}} came up the order so as to counter the Muralitharan spin threat as he was very familiar with Murali's bowling, who was his team-mate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings. He had come after the dismissal of Virat Kohli, also a right-handed batsman. By partnering the left-handed Gambhir, he ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to settle into a rhythm.|$|E
500|$|Raptor Red was {{an attempt}} to {{introduce}} Utahraptor to the public, as well as explain some of Bakker's theories regarding dinosaur behavior. Bakker's raptors are shown as monogamous, relatively intelligent and social creatures, an assertion he defends, saying [...] "the life of dinosaurian hunters was hard. Most skeletons we excavate have clear marks of old wounds. To survive and raise their young, the predators <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> sharp teeth and strong claws. They needed social bonds." [...] Bakker also advances his controversial theory that an asteroid impact did not kill the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, but rather a disease spread through migration.|$|E
500|$|An adult Columbian mammoth {{would have}} <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> [...] of food per day, {{and may have}} foraged for twenty hours a day. Mammoths chewed their food by using their {{powerful}} jaw muscles to move the mandible forward and close the mouth, then backward while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant, enabling the animal to chew large quantities of food which contained grit. The trunk {{could be used for}} pulling up large tufts of grass, picking buds and flowers or tearing leaves and branches from trees and shrubs, and the tusks were used to dig up plants and strip bark from trees. Digging is indicated on preserved tusks by flat, polished sections of the surface that would have reached the ground. Isotope studies of Columbian mammoths from Mexico and the United States have shown that their diet varied by location, consisting of a mix of C3 (most plants) and C4 plants (such as grasses), and they were not restricted to grazing or browsing.|$|E
