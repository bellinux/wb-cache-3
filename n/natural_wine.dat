6000|$|When {{it comes}} to fish, it is allowed {{that we are not}} an insular people for nothing. There are other forms of good living that Paris knows not of, so to speak, at first hand, native to England. Turtle soup, turbot and lobster sauce, a haunch of venison, and a grouse, are, we may say without chauvinism, a [...] "truly royal repast." [...] But we incur the {{contempt}} of foreigners once more in the matter of wines. To like sherry, the coarse and fiery, is a matter of habit, which would teach us to love betel-root, and rejoice in the very peculiar drink of the South Sea islanders. Some purists include champagne in the same condemnation--the champagne, that is, of this degenerate day. When the Russians drank up the contents of the widow Clicquot's cellars, they found a sweet <b>natural</b> <b>wine,</b> to which they have constantly adhered. But Western Europe, all the Europe which, as M. Comte puts it, [...] "synergizes" [...] after light and positivism, has tended towards champagnes more or less dry. The English serve this [...] "grog mousseux" [...] as a necessity for social liveliness, and have not come back to the sweet wine which was only meant to be drunk with sweets. A Quarterly reviewer is very severe in his condemnation of a practice which will only yield to the stress of some European convulsion in politics and society. These matters are like certain large reforms, they either come to pass without observation in the slow changes of things, or great movements in the world are accompanied by small ones in everyday life. Dry champagne came in after the Revolution; it may go out after a European war, which will make wine either expensive, or, if cheap, a palpably spurious article. [...] "Monotony and base servile imitation" [...] may be the bane of eating and drinking in England; but the existence of monotony shows that the English really do not care very much about dining considered as a fine art. When they do care, they cover their interest in the matter decently, with the veil of humorous affectation. They cannot spontaneously and sincerely make a business of it, as the French do in all good faith. Even if they had a genius for dining, we doubt if a critic is right in thinking they should dine at six o'clock or seven at latest. Whether in the country or in town, the business or amusement of the day claims more time. Sportsmen, for example, in early autumn could not possibly return home by six very frequently, and in summer six o'clock may be so sultry an hour that the thought of food is intolerable. Still, it must be admitted that the unawakened state of the market-gardener and the condition of English soups are matters deserving serious consideration.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>wine</b> {{movement}} {{has grown in}} popularity in response to what some observers have called [...] "Parkerization" [...] or the globalization of wine tasting. A small number of critics' palates and the points system has come to define {{the market value of}} wines. The effect of this on wine producers has been to try to manipulate the taste of their wine (for example trying to increase the intensity of fruit and oak) in order to please certain wine critics and get higher ratings. As a result, critics of these critics say this is causing an increasing uniformity amongst wines and a loss of regional and varietal character. The <b>natural</b> <b>wine</b> movement is one response to the global commodification of winemaking.|$|E

50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>wine</b> is wine {{made without}} {{chemical}} and minimum technological intervention in growing grapes {{and making them}} into wine. The term is used to distinguish such wine from organic wine and biodynamic wine because of differences in cellar practices. All natural wines are, however, farmed organically at a minimum and many growers are biodynamic in the vineyard as well.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Natural</b> <b>Wine</b> Project is a {{collaboration}} between winemakers Dave Powell and Craig Isbel to create as pure of a wine as possible. Made of 100% Grenache, the fruit comes from Powell's organically-farmed vineyard, planted in 2002 in Marananga. Fermentation occurs without the addition of any foreign materials - no yeast, no acid, no nutrients and bottled sans filtration.|$|E
25|$|Wine is {{important}} in cuisine not just for its value as a beverage, but as a flavor agent, primarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet dishes.

50|$|In 1971, {{the term}} Kabinett was officially noted in German wine law, {{and it was}} given its current {{definition}} which applies to wines which are light and non-chaptalized. Kabinett's current definition differs greatly from its etymological implications of it being a reserve wine. Before 1971, the terms Naturwein (<b>natural</b> <b>wine)</b> or Natuerrein (naturally pure) were used in place of Kabinett. These terms designated non-chaptalized wine, where no other designations, such as Spätlese or Auslese, applied.|$|E
50|$|Natural winemakers may use organic or biodynamic grapes {{in their}} wines.

Otherwise the inhabitants lived mainly from fishing and viticulture. Nowadays, tourism stemming from the wine industry plays a significant economic role in the town notably for delicious and rare red dessert wines. Under the Collioure appellation, the town is also a center of quality dry reds, rosés and whites, with a number of producers of <b>natural</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
