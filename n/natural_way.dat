5|$|The {{important}} {{mathematical constant}} , sometimes called Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the natural logarithm. Although exponentiation of e could, in principle, be treated the same as exponentiation of any other real number, such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a <b>natural</b> <b>way</b> to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a <b>natural</b> <b>way.</b> Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E

25|$|The {{symmetric}} group Sn has order n!. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions ofn.

40|$|Nowdays, the {{physical}} culture has become like an existing need for people. {{in everyday life}} people most often use the <b>natural</b> <b>ways</b> of moving like walking and running. The <b>natural</b> <b>ways</b> of moving are given and defined by the nature itself, anatomic-physiological and even phychological factors. Besides <b>natural</b> <b>ways</b> there are constructed ways which are more complex and which are taken out from the natural ones. The first thing, child does when is born, is to turn around, climb up, walk, run, jump, climb up the trees, throw, carry etc. These are the basic ways of moving that will say of natural moving. The <b>natural</b> <b>ways</b> of moving are used in PE in kinderkarten as we; as in the earlier grades in primary schools. They represent: - Spontaneous or conscious, forcable or free changes of mechanical state (condition and place) human body or just some of his particular parts in the space out of it. - They are accomplished with the complex physical-chemical process of change (circulation) of matter and energy inside the body, {{as well as between}} it and outer environment. Everyday moving is in the function existing, working-productive or devensively appropriate: we walk to come to a certain place, came and runaway, rising hand to reach for something, to give or take smthing etc. The aim of moves and moving in {{the physical}} exercises is consciously pointed on the inner physical changes and physical development of the organism. That is why the walking, which is used as a physical exercise, has no longer the purpose to the cariovascular and respiratoric system, strenghtening of the leg muscles etc. The <b>natural</b> <b>ways</b> of moving, as it appears in all domestic and foreign researches, with these children, effect very positevly on the development of bone system, cardiovascular, breathing device, muscular system and even on the positive development of organs and the whole organism.
