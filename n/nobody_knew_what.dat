25|$|The {{most radical}} {{innovation}} of 1976 was the 6-wheeled Tyrrell P34. The P34 {{was a good}} car, often finishing third or fourth and winning the Swedish Grand Prix, {{but it was not}} superior to the best 4-wheeled cars. 1976 also saw the Lotus team fitting brushes or plastic skirts under its rather uncompetitive 77; McLaren and Brabham also experimented with air-dams and splitters in an attempt to cause low-pressure areas under the car but found no significant effect on performance, in fact <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was in Chapman's mind.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times later {{described}} Yesterday's Wine as [...] "the {{last and}} best of [...] Nashville albums", {{saying that it was}} [...] "Organized in the manner of an epic poem, each cut a metaphor in the journey through life... it was Nashville's first fully conceived concept album, and <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to make of it. It soon disappeared quietly and utterly." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] " [...] is the first of his bold, conceptual departures from country's hits-plus-filler norm. Rather than tack rock guitar riffs onto modern honky-tonk sagas, Nelson absorbed the innovations of Bob Dylan and the singer-songwriters into his own distinct style. Even if the narrative concepts don't always hold together, Willie hangs his most ambitious albums on some of his catchiest tunes." ...|$|E
500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it was, including the governor." ...|$|E

500|$|By March, {{they had}} {{finished}} recording the track, but {{felt that it}} was rather unfocused and needed something else. The band had been introduced to Ron Geesin via the Rolling Stones tour manager, Sam Cutler, and were impressed with his composition and tape editing capabilities, particularly Waters and Mason. Geesin was handed the completed backing tracks the band had recorded, and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over the top of it while the band went on tour to the US. Geesin described the composing and arranging as [...] "a {{hell of a lot of}} work. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was wanted, they couldn't read music …" [...] According to him, Gilmour came up with some of the melodic lines, while the pair of them along with keyboardist Richard Wright worked on the middle section with the choir. When it came to recording his work in June with the EMI Pops Orchestra, the session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant garde music over established classical works, and, combined with the relative difficulty of some of the parts, harassed him during recording. John Alldis, whose choir were also to perform on the track, had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians, and managed to conduct the recorded performance in place of Geesin.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933 and 1934 MacDonald's {{mental and}} {{physical}} health declined further, and he became an increasingly ineffective leader as the international situation grew more threatening. His speeches in Commons became incoherent. One observer noted how [...] "Things ... got to the stage where <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the Prime Minister was going to say in the House of Commons, and, when he did say it, nobody understood it." [...] His pacifism, which had been widely admired in the 1920s, led Winston Churchill and others to accuse him of failure {{to stand up to the}} threat of Adolf Hitler. His government began the negotiations for the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. MacDonald was aware of his fading powers, and in 1935 he agreed to a timetable with Baldwin to stand down as Prime Minister after George V's Silver Jubilee celebrations in May 1935. He resigned on 7 June in favour of Baldwin, and remained in the cabinet, taking the largely honorary post of Lord President vacated by Baldwin.|$|E

[...] Absolutely magnificent. [...] No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night. [...] He and he alone brought all of the scared people together. [...] And you've got {{to remember that the}} flight controllers in those days were -- they were kids in their thirties. [...] They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that. [...] All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken. [...] They were faced with things that they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge." ...|$|E

Granite Construction, whose president David H. Watts {{is a member of}} the council board, gave $35,000 to McPherson. He also received $5,000 from Chapin Construction, headed by Donald Chapin. Rep. Sam Farr attended Pico Blanco Scout Reservation as a boy and his father Fred Farr contributed to the camp's development. When asked about the dam and its impact on the river, Farr stated that the dam has been there for almost 50 years. [...] "The rules had changed and <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the rules would be," [...] he said. [...] "All the Boy Scouts asked is how to operate the dam properly." [...] When asked about the influence of the $2000 campaign contribution he received from Granite Construction in 2006, he replied, [...] "That's the analogy that I suggested was insulting.

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Burleson, Clarkson {{was encouraged by}} her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series [...] in May 2002. Despite receiving a [...] "golden ticket," [...] a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as [...] "ghetto", explaining: [...] "On our season we were like kids in camp. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK but America {{is a very different}} market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress." [...] Clarkson {{went on to win the}} competition on September 4, 2002 at the then Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini and without being sent into the bottom three throughout the season.|$|E
2500|$|... "No Sanctuary" [...] {{featured}} several homages {{to various}} horror films. The episode's opening scene involved primary characters Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Glenn Rhee, and Bob Stookey {{being brought to}} a slaughterhouse and lined up over a trough with other Terminus captives, who are violently hit {{over the head with}} baseball bats before their throats are slit to drain their blood. Nicotero said during an interview in the aftershow Talking Dead that the scene was inspired by the film Alien (1979), particularly the [...] "chestburster" [...] scene. [...] " [...] Ridley Scott they had blood tubes hooked up and <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was going to happen...When they rolled six cameras and Veronica Cartwright gets hit with all the blood, all those reactions were real," [...] stated Nicotero, who also opted to use practical effects in filming and kept {{the true nature of the}} scene hidden from the actors. Another scene involved Rick's group escaping from the slaughterhouse and passing by several crates, one of which read: [...] "Arctic Expedition Horlicks University, Attn: Julia Carpenter". Nicotero, who usually inserts several Easter eggs in the episodes he directs, added this as an homage to the film Creepshow (1982) and its director, George A. Romero, who worked with Nicotero in Day of the Dead (1985).|$|E
