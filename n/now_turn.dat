5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, M-52 runs north along Main Street to Church Street. Since November 2009, {{the one-way}} streets were converted back to two-way functionality. Both directions of M-52 <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> east along Church, then north along Broad Street. At Front Street, traffic is diverted west back to Main Street. Continuing north out of downtown Adrian, M-52 follows Main Street over the South Branch of the River Raisin {{and out of}} the city limits, where it once again becomes Adrian Highway. The highway curves from running north-northeast back to due north. West of the city of Tecumseh, the trunkline intersects M-50. M-52 continues north as a limited-access highway. Access to and from the highway is limited to select cross roads only. Just south of the county line, the highway intersects with US12 before crossing into Washtenaw County.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E

An additional black band is developed on {{the fourth and fifth}} segments with two black and two bluish spots on them. The eighth and ninth segments, which earlier provided the camouflage markings now develop a brown and white band. At this stage, the caterpillars are forced to inhabit secluded places.|$|E

25|$|The German Eighteenth Army and the Sixteenth Army {{successfully}} {{conquered the}} remaining parts of Estonia, seizing Chudovo, north of Novgorod, which severed {{one of the}} two main supply lines from Leningrad to Moscow. In support of these operations, Richthofen's Corps dropped 3,351 tons of bombs in 4,742 attacks from 10 to 20 August 1941. On 20 August Richthofen moved strike and fighter aircraft to Spasskaya Polist, 40km north-east of Novgorod, to support an attack that would encircle Leningrad, and cut it off from Murmansk. German XXXXI Panzer Corps sealed in Soviet forces in the Lake Ilmen-Luga-Novgorod sector. The Leningrad Front attempted to relieve them, and Richthofen was ordered to blunt the attack. The Soviets were supported by strong air units, and large air battles broke out. During the course of them Fliegerkorps VIII lost one of its most able Stuka aces, Anton Keil. The Germans succeeded in maintaining their lines, and could <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> to capturing Leningrad.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf {{tells the}} party that Sauron will <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> his eye to Minas Tirith. Gandalf rides on ahead, and sends the party to the ruined city of Osgiliath, to stand {{alongside}} Boromir's brother, Faramir. As they await {{the arrival of the}} army, Berethor muses that Osgiliath seems familiar to him. Éoaden remembers a Gondorian warrior who fought under Boromir during the defense of the city some time ago, but who fled the battle in fear. The party realize that Berethor is that man. He vows he will never flee again, and the party join Faramir in a fight against Gothmog. They defeat him, but he flees before they can kill him. Gandalf then summons the party back to Minas Tirith. Before they leave, however, Berethor learns the reason he fled Osgiliath was because he was stabbed by a Morgul blade, the tip of which is still within him. He and Idrial face the Witch-king, but Idrial explains he cannot harm the Witch-king whilst the blade is still inside him. He cuts it out and they attack the Witch-king, driving him off. The party then head to Minas Tirith.|$|E
25|$|Lucas {{began working}} on Episode III before Attack of the Clones was released, {{offering}} concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles. As he reviewed the storyline that summer, however, he says he radically re-organized the plot. Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, offers evidence that issues in Anakin's fall {{to the dark side}} prompted Lucas to make massive story changes, first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice, Count Dooku, murdered by Anakin as the first act in the latter's turn towards the dark side. After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin's character, re-writing his entire turn to the dark side; he would <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> primarily in a quest to save Padmé's life, rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several, including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental re-write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage, and new and revised scenes filmed during pick-ups in 2004.|$|E

500|$|Traidenis' reign was {{the longest}} and most stable regime {{during the period of}} unrest. After his death the Orders {{finalized}} their conquests: the conquered Baltic tribes did not rebel again and the Orders could now concentrate on Lithuania. In 1274 the Great Prussian Rebellion ended, and the Teutonic Knights proceeded to conquer other Baltic tribes: the Nadruvians and Skalvians in 1274–1277, and the Yotvingians in 1283; the Livonian Order completed its conquest of Semigalia, the last Baltic ally of Lithuania, in 1291. The Orders could <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> their full attention to Lithuania. The [...] "buffer zone" [...] composed of other Baltic tribes had disappeared, and Lithuania was left to battle the Orders on its own.|$|E
500|$|British code-breakers {{were able}} to decrypt some of the German signals, {{including}} an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for Bismarck making for Brest, decrypted by Jane Fawcett on 25 May 1941. The French Resistance provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> his forces toward France to converge in areas through which Bismarck would have to pass. A squadron of Coastal Command PBY Catalinas based in Northern Ireland joined the search, covering areas where Bismarck might head {{in the attempt to}} reach occupied France. At 10:30 on 26 May, a Catalina piloted by Ensign Leonard B. Smith of the US Navy located her, some [...] northwest of Brest. At her current speed, she would have been close enough to reach the protection of U-boats and the Luftwaffe in less than a day. Most British forces were not close enough to stop her.|$|E

500|$|On 26 May, Marlborough reached Coblenz, {{where the}} Moselle meets the Rhine. If he {{intended}} an attack along the Moselle the Duke must <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> west, but, instead, {{the following day}} the army crossed to the right bank of the Rhine, (pausing to add 5,000 waiting Hanoverians and Prussians). [...] "There will be no campaign on the Moselle", wrote Villeroi who had taken up a defensive position on the river, [...] "the English have all gone up into Germany." [...] A second possible objective now occurred to the French – an Allied incursion into Alsace and {{an attack on the}} city of Strasbourg. Marlborough skillfully encouraged this apprehension by constructing bridges across the Rhine at Philippsburg, a ruse that not only encouraged Villeroi to come to Tallard's aid in the defence of Alsace, but one that ensured the French plan to march on Vienna remained paralysed by uncertainty.|$|E
500|$|The {{years from}} 1801 to 1804 are {{something}} of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located {{in the area where}} the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that [...] "having written so much {{on one side of the}} question, I shall <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had [...] "had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love". A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that [...] "the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life" [...] with an unsuitable man.|$|E
