In the course of experiment, the various shape of the <b>netting</b> store, <b>pot</b> such as a square, octagonal and circular type were employed. The deformation of the <b>netting</b> store <b>pot</b> was defined by measuring an oblique angle of the deformed netting against the current.

The experiment on effect of the variation of D/L of mesh to the deformation and resistance were carried out, and it was found that the variation have an effect considerably on the deformation and resistance in the range of less than 0. 2 m/s of the current and they are not affected very much in the vicinity of 0. 4 m/s. Furthermore, the experiments of the linked <b>netting</b> store <b>pots</b> were carried out. It can be considered that there is no effect of the distance between two linked pots on the deformation and resistance in the range of less than 0. 2 m/s of the current, and it is to be recommended that the distance between two pots is nearly equal to the width of the pot.

40|$|Exploitation {{patterns}} of the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, in two Mediterranean areas were studied in three ports, two in the Thracian Sea (Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) {{and one in the}} Catalan Sea (Spain, Western Mediterranean). The study period of one year (July 1998 -June 1999) included a monthly collection of data on commercial landings, fishing effort and length distribution of O. vulgaris. Many gears exploit this species in both areas. Specialised and highly productive artisanal gears (fyke <b>nets,</b> <b>pots</b> and traps) have been developed. Herein it is shown that: (1) trawls are responsible for most octopus landings; (2) trawls exploit mostly the small and immature individuals while the artisanal fleets exploit the large and mature ones; (3) there is a marked seasonality of catches; (4) {{there is little or no}} interaction between the gears fishing octopus, indicating that each gear affects a certain size range; (5) and the octopus specimens from the Greek area are clearly smaller than the ones from the Spanish area.

40|$|Aquaponics {{is the use}} {{of water}} from a fish tank to provide {{nutrients}} to plants in a soil-less environment. The rocks cultivate the bacteria that turns the ammonia into nitrates that the plants need, and the plant bed functions as a filter for the fish tank. In this study, with the guidance of Doctor Dudley Burton, Doctor Brook Murphy, we researched the optimal plant density for basil in an Aquaponics system. We attempted to control or measure all the other variables to consider, as to isolate the variable of distance between plants. The water flow was spread through the plant bed through a manifold and placed on the opposite side as the bell syphon to attempt to evenly spread the nitrates, and plants were selected from 5 or 6 different plants and variously placed in the samples. Plastic sheeting was used to hold the distance between plants constant, and <b>net</b> <b>pots</b> were used to place the plants. A light meter was used to measure the light hitting the 4 corners of the plant bed to account for that variable, {{and the size of the}} plants from the start was mixed within the samples. The preliminary results were, based on observation only, that basil plants at 8 cm and 12 cm apart would be too crowded to reach maximum growth.

Producing lettuce under artificial lighting {{could be a}} solution addressing these concerns. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) offer the advantages of a narrow light spectrum, low power consumption, and little heat production. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of different light sources on the growth of miniature “Tom Thumb” butterhead lettuce in a non-circulating hydroponic system. Lettuce seedlings, started in Oasis Horticubes, were transferred to <b>net</b> <b>pots</b> in containers with a hydroponic nutrient solution. The lettuce was grown in a lab under three light treatments—blue LEDs, red LEDs, and fluorescent lights. At the end of the study, fluorescent lights resulted in greater root dry weight than blue LEDs and red LEDs. Total plant dry weight under fluorescent lights was greater than under red LEDs. There were no significant differences in shoot dry weight and plant height among the treatments. Percent partitioning of dry weight to shoots was greatest with red LEDs, followed by blue LEDS, and fluorescent lights. Percent partitioning of dry weight to roots was greatest with fluorescent lights, followed by blue LEDS, and red LEDs. Leaf chlorophyll content was greater under blue LEDs and fluorescent lights than red LEDs. The pH of the nutrient solution of the blue LED and the fluorescent light treatments were greater than the red LED treatment. Electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution of the fluorescent light treatment was greater than the blue LED treatment and the red LED treatment. In conclusion, LEDs could provide an alternative lighting source for miniature lettuce production. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{pot fishery}} {{directed}} on spider crab (Maja squinado) {{grew out of}} a mixed tangle <b>net</b> and <b>pot</b> fishery for large crustaceans in the early 1980 s. Approximately twenty half decked vessels of 10 m in length have been involved {{for the duration of the}} fishery but the numbers of pots per vessel has increased; currently 10, 000 pots are set for spider crab in Tralee and Brandon Bays during the summer months. Cpue rose initially during the early years of the fishery, then it stabilised and declined although in the late 1990 s it again recovered somewhat. Sampling in 2000 suggests that the size composition of the catch has altered since the early years of the fishery, its main consequence being the removal of the older age groups so that the landings now consist almost entirely of a single year class. Aspects of the biology of the Maja squinado are compared with what is already known of the species and a number of recommendations are made for the future management of the fishery. These include a further increase in the size limit, a ban on tangle nets and a cap on fishing effort. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R

Tabanids were caught on horses during daylight using hand <b>nets</b> and <b>pots</b> at the ecotone zone between secondary forests and paddock habitats. Ticks were collected directly from cattle by hand. The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify possible vectors of bovine trypanosomosis, and register the diversity and abundance of tabanids in the zone. The arthropods were brought to the laboratory for taxonomic determination and protozooans searching in proboscis, midgut, and salivary glands of flies. In the case of ticks, protozoans were searched in hemolymph. One hundred and forty tabanids belonging to four genera and nine species were caught. Among the species, Lepiselaga crassipes was the most abundant (43. 6 %), with the highest abundance in July and a biting peak at 14 : 00 h. The highest diversity of tabanids was observed during September. Three tabanids were found infected with flagellates morphologically compatible with Trypanosoma vivax. 315 ticks belonging to Boophilus microplus species were collected, all of them negative to flagellates.

40|$|Cold water {{coral reefs}} are of {{enormous}} importance {{to science and}} society, being hotspots of biodiversity, indicators of past climate and a potential source of new medicines. However, their existence is under threat from pressures including climate change and deep sea mining. In western Scotland the fishing industry poses the greatest threat due to the productivity of the waters. Previous {{studies have examined the}} potential impacts of different types of fishing gear upon cold water corals. This dissertation aimed to model potential pressure using fishing activity data in order to inform broader marine policy and conservation strategies. This was achieved by weighting each type of gear in accordance with its potential impact and combining the weighted layers to address three scenarios, revealing spatial and temporal patterns of potential pressure. The results showed that the use of less harmful gear such as <b>nets,</b> hooks, <b>pots</b> and traps warrants greater concern than more destructive gear types because of their greater usage. The results also revealed that inshore reefs face greater pressure than offshore reefs, but that pressure facing offshore reefs is increasing. This could reflect the movement of fishing grounds further offshore as inshore grounds are exhausted. These results were used to recommend corals that are most, least and moderately suitable for marine protection and to produce recommendations for fishing restrictions and regulations, thus contributing towards better management of cold water corals reefs by allowing the implementation of better informed marine conservation strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradigm}} that mangroves {{are critical}} for sustaining production in coastal fisheries is widely accepted, but empirical evidence has been tenuous. This study showed that links between mangrove extent and coastal fisheries production could be detected for some species at a broad regional scale (1000 s of kilometres) {{on the east coast}} of Queensland, Australia. The relationships between catch-per-unit-effort for different commercially caught species in four fisheries (trawl, line, <b>net</b> and <b>pot</b> fisheries) and mangrove characteristics, estimated from Landsat images were examined using multiple regression analyses. The species were categorised into three groups based on information on their life history characteristics, namely mangrove-related species (banana prawns Penaeus merguiensis, mud crabs Scylla serrata and barramundi Lates calcarifer), estuarine species (tiger prawns Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus, blue swimmer crabs Portunus pelagicus and blue threadfin Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and offshore species (coral trout Plectropomus spp.). For the mangrove-related species, mangrove characteristics such as area and perimeter accounted for most of the variation in the model; for the non-mangrove estuarine species, latitude was the dominant parameter but some mangrove characteristics (e. g. mangrove perimeter) also made significant contributions to the models. In contrast, for the offshore species, latitude was the dominant variable, with no contribution from mangrove characteristics. This study also identified that finer scale spatial data for the fisheries, to enable catch information to be attributed to a particular catchment, would help to improve our understanding of relationships between mangroves and fisheries production.

40|$|Research PaperThe South Australian rock lobster {{fishery is}} about 2, 700 tonnes annual catch and is {{accessed}} by commercial, charter and amateur fishers. The commercial sector is managed in two zones, {{one based on}} input controls {{and the other on}} individual transferable quotas. The commercial sector pays 100 % of the costs of research, management and compliance through an annual licence fee. Catching rights are linked to a limited number of pots (16, 000), which are freely traded and/or leased within the commercial sector. Amateurs access the fishery by diving, using <b>nets</b> and/or <b>pots</b> and are restricted to 2 pots per person and a daily bag limit of 4 lobster. The amateur fishery is in effect open access, in that any person in South Australia, from interstate and/or overseas can access it. No licence fees are charged for amateur access but people wishing to use pots pay an annual pot registration fee. In June 2001, the then Government announced removal of the limit on total amateur pot registrations and set the amateur share of the fishery at 4. 5 % of the total catch. The Government also announced that should amateur catch exceed the 4. 5 % share, then it would enter the market place and lease catch at commercial rates, sufficient to offset the excess amateur catch. Total catch in effect would remain constrained with less being taken by the commercial sector to balance the extra being taken by the amateur sector. An overview and evaluation of this resource sharing mechanism between sectors based on commercial transactions is presented...|$|R
40|$|Wrasse species {{went from}} having almost no {{commercial}} value in Norway, {{and not being}} fished, to a landing of 21. 2 million individuals in 2014 with 11. 68 million of these being goldsinny. This explosive growth in fishing might have affected the populations of goldsinny severely. Establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) could be a helpful tool in management and conservation of goldsinny populations. Differences in selection of the two gear types used in the wrasse fishery (fyke <b>nets</b> and <b>pots)</b> could also affect the goldsinny populations. To test for effects of MPAs, I compared catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of goldsinny above the legal size limit in four MPAs along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast to that obtained in four neighboring control areas where fishing is allowed. The CPUE of legal size goldsinny was higher in the MPAs compared to the control areas in all four localities, suggesting that MPAs have impacted the abundance of goldsinny. There was much variation in the size and age distribution of the goldsinny populations in the different localities, and no clear trends {{of changes in the}} size and age distribution of the goldsinny populations inside the MPAs were found. The gear type used in the wrasse fishery might also affect the populations since pots seemed to catch more goldsinny than fyke nets, whereas fyke nets seemed to catch larger sized goldsinny than pots. Catch data in this study compared to data from a study on the Skagerrak coast in the late 1990 s indicates that the increased fishing pressure since then has affected the abundance of goldsinny on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Results from this study have shown that MPAs affect the populations of goldsinny on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast and MPAs could be a helpful tool in the management of this species...|$|R
40|$|Many commercially {{important}} {{fish species}} use coastal marine environments such as mangroves, tidal flats and seagrass beds as nurseries or breeding grounds. The ecological importance of spatially connected habitats to conservation {{is well established}} for terrestrial environments. However, few studies have applied spatial metrics, including measures of structural connectivity to marine environments. We {{examined the relationship between}} catch-per-unit-effort for commercially caught species and the spatial patterning of mapped benthic habitat types along the coast of Queensland, Australia in their dominant fisheries (trawl, line, <b>net</b> or <b>pot</b> fisheries). We quantified the composition and spatial configuration of seascapes and calculated coastline length, number of estuaries, river length and geographical latitude using 12 metrics within ninety 30 -nautical-mile grid cells, which supported inshore fish catch data from 21 species groups. Multiple regression analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots indicated that ecological linkages may exist between geomorphic coastal features and nearshore fisheries production for a number of species groups. Connectivity indices for mangroves, salt marsh and channels explained the largest proportion (30 – 70 %), suggesting the importance of connected tidal wetlands for fisheries. Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) catch-per-unit-effort was best explained by the number of wetland patches, mangrove connectivity and wetland connectivity (r 2 = 0. 38, n = 28). Catch-per-unit-effort for the Gulf of Carpentaria was highly correlated with wetland connectivity, the number of estuaries and seagrass patch density (r = 0. 57, n = 29). The findings could guide the spatial design of marine protected area networks to maintain ecosystem services and avoid potential disruption to connectivity caused by habitat removal or modification. Application of the same approach to analyses of finer spatial scales would enable catch information to be related to particular estuarine habitats and provide better understanding of the importance of habitat connectivity for fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Passive capture {{techniques}} {{involve the}} capture of fishes or other aquatic animals by entanglement, entrapment, or angling devices that are not actively moved by humans or machines while the organisms are being captured (Lagler 1978). The behavior and movements of the animals themselves result in their capture. The techniques used in passive sampling of fish populations {{are similar to those}} used for food gathering over the centuries. Nets and traps have been widely used among various cultures, and many of the currently applied techniques were used by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans (Alverson 1963). Based on their mode of capture, passive sampling devices can be divided into three groups: (1) entanglement, (2) entrapment, and (3) angling gears. Entanglement devices capture fish by holding them ensnared or tangled in webbing or mesh made of natural or artificial materials. Gill nets and trammel nets are examples of entanglement gears (Figure 6. 1). Entrapment devices capture organisms that enter an enclosed area through one or more funnel- or V-shaped openings that hinder escape after entrance. Hoop nets, trap <b>nets,</b> and <b>pot</b> devices are examples of entrapment gears (Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3). Angling devices capture fish with a baited hook and line. Trotlines and longlines are examples of passive angling gears (Figure 6. 4). Gear selectivity and gear efficiency are important considerations with respect to passive sampling devices. Often these terms are used interchangeably, but they have different, specific definitions. Gear selectivity is the bias of a sample obtained with a given gear (Box 6. 1). Selectivity for species, sizes, and sexes of fishes occurs in samples taken with specific types of gear. Species selectivity refers to overrepresentation of particular species in samples as compared with the assemblage of species present. Similarly, size or sex selectivity refers to overrepresentation of specific sizes (lengths) or one sex within samples from a fish population. Fisheries scientists may use gear selectivity to their benefit when targeting specific species or sizes of fishes, thereby enhancing their sampling efficiency. The efficiency of a gear refers to the amount of effort expended to capture target organisms (Box 6. 2). It is generally desirable to maximize the efficiency of a sampling gear to save time and money in single-species assessments of fisheries. Even with efficient sampling gear, the sampling effort needed to estimate the relative abundance and other descriptive statistics for a given species may be unrealistic (Gerow 2007) ...|$|R

The present work was conducted to clarify the importance of temperature and soil moisture in an incubation experiment on the dynamics of decomposition and nitrogen (N) mineralization in digested sewage sludge mixed with pyrite mine tailings from the Aitik copper mine, Gällivare, Sweden. The data were fitted to a first order two-compartment model. The importance of pH and plants, barley (Hordeum vulgare) and red fescue (Festuca rubra) was studied in a greenhouse experiment. The experimental conditions (temperature, moisture and pH), were chosen to represent situations occurring under field conditions. Temperature and soil moisture had clear effects on microbial activity in the tailings-sludge mixture and explained 93 % of the variance in respiration rate constants. The proportions of carbon and nitrogen mineralized from the substrate during approximately 100 days, measured in the incubation and the pot experiment, were between 20 and 30 % and 15 and 35 % respectively. The C:N ratio was roughly constant (8 - 10) throughout the experimental periods. From these data, good estimates of the amounts mineralized during the first season under different climatic conditions can be obtained.

40|$|The {{presence}} and activity of animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates, on human cadavers can accelerate {{the processes of}} decomposition because of dismemberment, tissue laceration and consumption, as well as increase of temperature caused by the animal metabolism. Moreover postmortem animal feeding activity may cause considerable damage to bodies resulting in the modification of wounds, loss of identifying features, and injury or removal of internal organs. Until now, {{the majority of the}} published studies and observations concerning the post mortal modifications by animals on carrions and human cadavers have been carried out in terrestrial environments, mainly on exposed bodies. Unlike the situation on land, little information is available in the case of drowning or dead bodies discarded in aquatic environments (e. g., lakes, rivers, sea). However, in the last years several authors tried to bridge this knowledge gap both for freshwater and sea environments. Anyway, aquatic insects and other arthropods can be useful in estimating a Postmortem Submersion Interval (PMSI). The knowledge about the different ‘‘waves’’ of colonization of a submerged body remains incomplete and several differences have been reported case by case. In this study, two experiments were performed in Northern Italy to investigate the effect of crustaceans feeding on carcasses placed in freshwater with a particular attention to Procambarus clarkii (Girard 1982) an alien species illegally introduced into France, Italy and other European countries in 1970 - 1990. The first experiment started in spring 2012, two carcasses of young pigs (Sus scrofa), dead by natural causes, were positioned into the water. The second experiment started in summer in 2012, for this experiment four carcasses were used. One pig, the control, was placed near the water, the remaining three pigs were placed into the water with different types of protection (nothing, antiaphids <b>net</b> and lobster <b>pot).</b> In the spring experiment, only one specimen of P. clarkii was found {{at the end of the}} decomposition process. In the summer experiment, probably due to the increased temperature, P. clarkii individuals were found from the fifth day of the experiment, reaching 69 specimens of this species inside the lobster pot after one month. Our preliminary results indicate that the activity of P. clarkii depend on the water temperature and on the stage of decomposition. This crustacean arrives on a carcass only during the floating decay, skipping the preliminary stages of decomposition...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of disparate biotopes of coral reefs and mangroves in one general area is unique. These biotopes may form ecologically connected ecosystems when occurring {{in close proximity}} such as in tropical Langkawi Island, Malaysia. Connected marine biotopes can provide various ecological services to fish community such as nursery, feeding habitats and shelter. As such, this study aims to test two hypotheses regarding Langkawi’s coral reefs and mangroves 1) the biotopes are ecologically connected via habitat utilization by the fish fauna and 2) the biotopes are ecologically connected via trophic energy pathways. Gill <b>nets</b> and fish <b>pots</b> were deployed to determine common overlapping fish species in both biotopes. Samples of primary producers, sediment and consumers were subjected to dual stable isotope analysis and stomach content analysis {{in the case of}} fishes. Coral community and habitat complexity as proxies for refuge cover were determined based on r-K-S adaptive strategists and coral morphology diversity respectively. The present study discovered a relatively high number of common species, 31 {{out of a total of}} 149 fish species, suggested there was movement of fishes between habitats. Despite the turbid water, the coral cover was considerably high, 47. 21 % with low mortality and dominated by stress-tolerators. The habitat complexity was also relatively high with 2. 06 index of morphological diversity indicated a fairly good refuge area. Stomach content analysis of fish revealed benthic invertebrates and small nekton as the main food items. Stable isotope analysis showed that the δ 13 C values of zooplankton (- 21. 66 ± 0. 72 ‰ SE) were closer to phytoplankton (- 21. 64 ± 0. 79 ‰ SE). The fishes even as far as the upstream mangrove had relatively enriched δ 13 C values (- 8. 88 to - 22. 37 ‰) close to the values of coral zooxanthellae (- 15. 39 ± 0. 33 ‰ SE) and phytoplankton, but distinctly distant from mangrove-derived source (- 28. 83 ± 0. 38 ‰ SE). A Bayesian mixing model of stable isotopic analysis in R (SIAR) depicted coral zooxanthellae as the major carbon contributor to fish nutrition in the coral reefs (90. 0 %) and mangrove (63. 7 %). Since phytoplankton contributed 32. 0 % in the mangrove estuary, mangrove carbon was relatively unimportant to the food web even in the mangrove estuary itself. Under the turbid water condition, mucus productions are expected by corals. It is hypothesized that coral mucus and zooplankton are the vehicles of energy transfer from coral zooxanthellae to consumers in the mangrove habitat. The present study suggests that fish movements and outwelling of extruded mucus and zooplankton connect coral reef to mangrove...|$|R
40|$|Trap gear such as set <b>nets</b> and <b>pots</b> {{are usually}} {{operated}} to fix {{on the sea}} bottom for several weeks. In order to be clear function changes in trap gear frameworks of this thesis were consisted of the following three steps by fishing gear constructions. 1) The netting twines consisted of the fundamental part of a fishing gear may be changed the breaking strength and elongation. 2) The nettings consisted of the minimum unit of function of capture. 3) Pot fishing gears are considered to the simplest model of an actual fishing gear. On the other hand, {{it is important for}} establishing and carrying out of environment-friendly to improve the fishing technology. In fact, trap gear are well-known as never-overfishing gear. It has never studied to be clear the function changes in trap gear during operations. In the present study, the function changes in trap gear were studied with using material engineering and hydrodynamical methods. The results obtaind can be summarized as follows: 1. The breaking strength and elongation of netting twines after soaked in the sea more than three years were measured. Nylon and polyethylene netting twines having thickness of 220 - 1980 denier were used. The breaking strength and elongation were sharply decreased for the first 1 year after soaked in the sea, and became a constant during 2 - 3 years. The retained breaking strength and elongation after 3 years of all test netting twines were about 70 % and 40 - 60 %, respectivly. 2. An encrusted condition of marine foulings on nettings for set nets which consider influence to measure a drag on the fouled plane netting by marine foulings were measured. The test netings were soaked around a set net fishing ground during the periods from 15 to 60 days and some water depthes (1. 5 to 15 m). The test netting consisted of polyester multi-filaments (0. 85 mm in diameter and 17 mm in bar length), which is commonly used for the set net fishing gear. The main marine foulings are fine attaching materials so-called "Nuta", Amphipoda, a kind of hydrozoans Tubulalia mesembryanthemum and a kind of moss animals Bugula neritina. 3. The drag per 1 m² for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing ratio of drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the initial (unused) netting. The mean ratio of drag on each soaking period, however, peaked 6. 5 times of the 30 th day net and then it scarcely changed till 60 th day net. 3. The drag per 1 m 2 for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing raito of the drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the unused net. However, the mean raito og drag on each soaking period peaked 6. 5 times of 30 days in soaking periods and then it scarcely changed till 60 days. The porosity (β) of the nettings before and after fouling changed from 76 to 16 %. The drag coefficient (CD) of fouled nettings can be expressed by the following equation; CD= 35. 98 (Rh) ⁻⁰. ⁴³(1. 7 × 10 ²<Rh< 1. 8 × 10 ³), where Rh is Reynolds number based on hydraulic mean depth of a fouled netting. However, the drag coefficient may be rather influenced the porosity for Rh< 5 × 10 ². The drag coefficient (CD) of a fouled netting was determined to be 1. 3 at 0. 6 <β< 0. 8 and 2. 2 atβ< 0. 5, respectively. The results suggest that the drag coefficient of a fouled netting is determined by its porosity. 4. To evaluate the preferable fishing ground for cuttlefish basket traps from bottom condition and CPUE (kg/trap/day) at two different fishing grounds (off Ariake and off Fukae) in Shimabara sound. The Md φ of off Ariake and off Fukae weres - 0. 3 to 3. 0 and 1. 0 to 1. 5, which were limited range against the whole Shimabara Sound (- 5. 4 to 5. 6). CPUE of off Fukae was 2 -fold greater than that of off Ariake. The significance of differences in CPUE between two fishing grounds was verified by taken together Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). The results suggest that the medium sandy se﻿a bottom is more preferable for capturing of golden cuttlefish by the cuttlefish basket trap. 5. Catches were high at water temperature between 12 - 14 ℃. Daily catches varied periodically due to the change in the lunar cycle, and it became maximum at neap tide, or ebb, and minimum at spring tide. In this region, water temperature seems to be an important long-term factor affecting the main fishing period, and tidal current seems to be an important short-term factor controlling daily catch. The amount of catch might be controlled by both water temperature and tidal current, which is therefore the important factors in the cuttlefish basket trap fishery...|$|R
40|$|Common scab, {{caused by}} plant {{pathogenic}} Streptomyces sp., {{is a major}} soil and tuber borne bacterial disease of potato. Whilst the disease seldom affects tuber yield, infections produce unsightly blemishes on tubers that reduce their value. It causes significant economic losses in the fresh, processing and seed market sectors of the potato industry. Despite several decades of research activity, no single measure has been developed that is able to provide effective control of this disease and comhlon scab therefore remains {{a serious threat to}} the potato production throughout the potato growing areas of the world. This project investigated links between tuber structural attributes and susceptibility to infection, an area of study under-represented in the literature and offering potential to deliver new knowledge on common scab disease that may lead to improved approaches to disease management. A series of experiments was conducted under field, glasshouse and hydroponic conditions to investigate changes in morphology and anatomy of the potato tuber. Inoculation treatments were developed to investigate relationships between structural features at the time of inoculation and the subsequent levels of infection. A novel hydroponic system was developed that allowed inoculation of individual tubers at specific times or stages of development and permitted non-destructive observation of the development of common scab symptoms. A second novel system involved the use of <b>netting</b> in <b>potting</b> bags to separate tubers from the root zone and allowed inoculation at different times during plant growth. This system facilitated study of the pathogen infection window on the tubers, and pathogen-induced structural changes in the tubers, under glasshouse conditions. Field studies were undertaken in 12 commercial crops across a range of production environments, and utilised seed from a single source to allow assessment of site effects on tuber development and disease incidence. Many tuber anatomical and morphological features (stomata and lenticel number, periderm thickness, lenticel structure, pattern of suberisation and internode expansion rate on the tubers) were found to be highly variable under different field and glasshouse conditions, and significant variability within crops/treatments was also observed. Lenticel diameter was determined by growmg environment, but other structural features varied as much between tubers within sites or treatments as between sites or treatments. Given the sporadic nature of occurrence of common scab symptoms within and between crops, the observations of variation in structural features was sufficient to indicate that anatomical features could be playing a role in susceptibility to infection. Detailed study of lenticel development on tubers revealed that two pathways of lenticel formation exist in potato tubers. Formation of lenticels from stomata, the commonly accepted pathway in the literature, occurred on all tubers, but when tubers expanded rapidly, lenticels were found to have also formed directly from peridermal rupture. In most tubers, the majority of lenticels were concluded to have formed from this second pathway. The initiation of lenticel formation in both pathways was shown to be via localised zones of increased cell division in the phellem layer, placing pressure on the outer cell layers and leading to rupture of the periderm. Continued cell division and expansion under the rupture site creates the characteristic raised lenticular shaped structure of a mature lenticel. Suberization in lenticels was observed to occur very late m Luber development in most glasshouse and hydroponically grown tubers, and lenticels with no suberisation were found in mature tubers under all growing conditions in the project. No relationship was found between tuber anatomical features at the time of exposure to the pathogen and either incidence or severity of common scab symptoms. While trends were observed within trials, when data from all experiments were examined there was no structural attribute that was consistently present or absent in treatments that induced high levels of common scab symptoms. Under field conditions, suberisation in the periderm was noted in young tubers in crops that subsequently developed high incidence of common scab, but under glasshouse conditions nonsuberized tubers at the point of inoculation were found to be highly susceptible to the disease. No evidence was found of increased suberisation in lenticels during tuber maturation being associated with reduced susceptibility to infection, with the timing of suberisation varying markedly between trials and in many conditions not recorded until very late in tuber development. The window of tuber susceptibility to common scab disease infection was shown to vary with the season or conditions under which the plants were grown. In addition, the first direct evidence that different intemodes on tubers were susceptible to infection at different times during tuber development was produced. Basal intemodes, which are the first sections of the tuber to expand, are susceptible earliest in tuber development with apical intemodes only becoming susceptible later in tuber growth by which time the basal intemodes are no longer susceptible. Basal intemodes in older tubers, which were less susceptible to common scab infection, were shown to rapidly produce additional phellem cell layers when exposed to the pathogen, whereas the same internodes in young, susceptible tubers were slower to respond. A pathogen-induced suberin deposition in phellem and filling cells was observed in less susceptible tubers in addition to the increased thickness and number of cell layers in the phellem. This result suggested that the phellem layer rather than the lenticels may be involved in common scab infection, with infection occurring directly through the periderm, as suggested by Loria et al. (2003), rather than through the lenticels as suggested by most other authors. This project has contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the role and relationships between pre-existing or induced structural features of the tuber and common scab disease infection of potato. Further investigations on the role of phellem layers in disease infection and pathogen-induced phellem layer responses are recommended...|$|R
