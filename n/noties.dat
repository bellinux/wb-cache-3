40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} evaluation of Pastry, a scalable, distributed object location and routing substrate for wide-area peer-to-peer applications. Pastry performs application-level routing and object location in a potentially very large overlay network of nodes connected via the Internet. It {{can be used to}} support a variety of peer-to-peer applications, including global data storage, data sharing, group communication and naming. Each node in the Pastry network has a unique identifier (nodeId). When presented with a message and a key, a Pastry node efficiently routes the message to the node with a nodeId that is numerically closest to the key, among all currently live Pastry nodes. Each Pastry node keeps track of its immediate neighbors in the nodeId space, and <b>noties</b> applications of new node arrivals, node failures and recoveries. Pastry takes into account network locality; it seeks to minimize the distance messages travel, according to a to scalar proximity metric like the number of IP routing hops. Pastry is completely decentralized, scalable, and self-organizing; it automatically adapts to the arrival, departure and failure of nodes. Experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation on an emulated network of up to 100, 000 nodes confirm Pastry's scalability and efficiency, its ability to self-organize and adapt to node failures, and its good network locality properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} {{inquiries}} to call centers regarding product malfunctions has been increasing in recent years, and thus manufactur-ers are struggling with their responses. The Consumer Affairs Agency in Japan stated that the initial response to an inquiry is especially im-portant, since aming directed toward the company may immediately occur on the Web, and may greatly affect the reputation and sales of the product if the response is inappropriate. However, when a call center accepts the rst inquiry, an operator cannot determine whether the mal-function {{is due to a}} problem of a model or to a user's way of using the product. Therefore, we have developed a system to automatically deter-mine if the inquiry content is the tip of an iceberg by graph-matching the inquiry content to a Linked Data network, which represents the rep-utation information of a product on social media. Moreover, by tracing causal links in the network, the system also determines if the inquiry is connecting to users ' dissatisfaction and discontent, and then <b>noties</b> the inquiry to a quality control section with high priority to prevent aming. In this paper, we rst present our approach for converting social media information to Linked Data, and show that an experiment achieved 94 % accuracy. We also explain the matching between the inquiry content and Linked Data and its accuracy, and a method of extracting the causal link to the users ' complaints. ...|$|E

Transactions are speci- ed as mobile transactional programs that are propagated and executed in the server, thus allowing the validation of transactions based on application-specic semantics. In the proposed model (as in others previously presented in literature) the nal result of a transaction is only determined when the transaction is processed in the central server.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic distributed approach to automatic network fault diagnosis and correction in Wide Area Networks (WANs) using Bayesian networks. Each sub-domain of a WAN is assigned to a single agent that models its own partial knowledge as a Bayesian sub-net. When the agent is <b>notied</b> of an anomaly in one of its managed objects, it computes an initial optimal observation plan given reported abnormal observations. The plan species the order in which the objects are to be observed. Then, information gathering objects are sequentially evaluated using the myopic value of information, and the agent decides upon the object to observe based on its potential to reveal useful information about which component is faulty, and associated cost. To derive the globally optimal restoration plan, agents maintain an interfa [...] ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tangible user {{interfaces}} and end user development are two increasingresearch areas in software technology. Physical representation promoteopportunities {{to ease the}} use of technology and reinforce personality traits ascreativeness, collaboration and intuitive actions. However, designing tangible{{user interfaces}} are both cumbersome and require several layers of architecture. End user development allows users with no programming experience to createor customize their own applications. OBJECTIVE: This dissertation aims toease development of tangible user interfaces by creating a toolkit, called RAPT(Rapid Arduino-Prototyping Toolkit), on the Arduino platform. RAPT will bedeveloped as an Android application to support mobility and accessibility. Therequirements of the toolkit are based on three scenario analysis; home assistance,restaurant and buddy <b>notier.</b> RESEARCH METHOD: First, this dissertationwill explore the underlying concepts of tangible user interfaces and end user development. Second, examine {{the state of the art}} within the domains of tangibleuser interfaces and end user development. Third, we will look at benets ofusing a software toolkit when developing a tangible user interface through anend user development interface. To solve these enquiries, we have conducted asystematic mapping study of tangible user interface and end user developmentdomains. Finally, requirement specications have been formed based on the scenarioanalysis. MEASUREMENTS: To evaluate the toolkit, we have conducteda usability test with ten non-programmers as the target group. RESULTS: Asa prototype, basic functionality is implemented and the usability test conrmsthat the toolkit is heading in the right direction by letting non-technical individualscreate and modify simplistic tangible user interface applications. Mainimprovements are to support other hardware than Arduino and making it easierto add new devices. The usability test illustrates that parts of the toolkit's userinterface can be hard to understand immediately, yet, it is easy to master. </p...|$|R
40|$|Planning and Scheduling {{of classes}} in an {{institute}} is of pivotal importance. Classes which {{have to be}} rescheduled must be immediately <b>notied</b> to the students {{so that they do}} not miss the classes and later blame the authorities for not notifying them. Same is the case for classes which are cancelled. Assignments given by faculties must be immediately relayed to the students since the students have to plan their everyday schedule according to the academic workload. Many a times classes are cancelled or rescheduled on a short notice or extra classes are scheduled prior to any information. This leads to students missing a number of classes or wasting their time and energy to attend a class which was already cancelled. Assignments on the other hand fail to get submitted on time due to misinformation by the intermediaries. The general method used to relay such information is taking the help of the class representative of the class, who either sends SMS or emails to every student,which have an history of failing. All the various information about the timing of classes cancelled or rescheduled, submission of assignments and other important notices is handled by one human which increases the chances of failure from time to time. If the class representative is not available then the problem aggravates to a higher level. In this project, we have tried to replace the manual labour involved in the aforementioned issues and created an automated system which eliminates the work of the class representative to some extent. Also a scheduler is made for students to schedule their daily activities along with the classes so that any change in the academic schedule or any pending assignments or other issues will be re ected and they can plan their day accordingly...|$|R
