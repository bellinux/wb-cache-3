40|$|Abstract: The alkylating {{ability of}} the oxetane ring in the {{carbohydrate}} struc-ture was investigated and a flexible method {{for the construction of}} a bolaform amphiplile skeleton with xylose as the polar head is proposed. The method is based on oxetane ring opening in the easily accessible 3, 5 -anhydro- 1, 2 -O-cyc-lohexylidenexylofuranose (1). One-step nitrogen alkylation in terminal diam-ines with 1 gave the basic cationic bolaform skeleton with xylose as potential polar head and a deliberately chosen length of the <b>non-polar</b> <b>spacer.</b> Under similar experimental conditions, but with an appropriate mole ratio of the alkylating agent, the alkylation reaction provide for selective monoalkylation of the diamines. Successful alkylation in the xanthine series (theophylline) was also achieved with 1, giving a new 5 -deoxy- 5 -(1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro- 1, 3 -dimethyl [...] 2, 6 -dioxo- 7 H-purin- 7 -yl) -α-D-xylofuranose derivative...|$|E
40|$|The phases {{behavior}} of poly(ester imide) s (PEI) based on trimellitic anhydride, 4 -aminocinnamic acid and α,ω-dihydroxydodecane (n = 12) or α,ω-dihydroxyhexadecane (n = 16), resp., {{have been investigated}} by X-ray measurements employing synchrotron radiation. Both PEIs form mono-tropic LC phases which can be quenched into the glassy state. Due to the regular sequence of rigid, polar mesogens and flexible, <b>non-polar</b> <b>spacers</b> smectic phases are formed in the melt and in the solid state, giving rise to sharp X-ray reflections. During transition from the smectic LC phase to the higher ordered smectic crystalline phase these layer reflections shift towards larger scattering angles indicating a narrowing of the layers due to tilting of the mesogens {{with respect to the}} layer plane. X-ray fiber pattern indicate that this tilting already occurs in the frozen LC phase (Sc). The chains are oriented preferably parallel to the fiber direction while the staggering of the mesogens orients the layers inclining an angle of about β = 20 °. During crystallization the mesogens reptate longitudinally in order to fit the lateral lattice and the tilt angle increases up to 41 ° (n = 12) and 35 ° (n = 16) (SH). Isothermal experiments reveal that PEI (n = 12) is capable of forming two different smectic-H phases depending on the thermal treatment. Above 130 ° C SHI, (β = 32 °, d = 27 Å) is formed preferably whereas SH 2 (β = 41 °, d = 24 Å) dominates below 1407 °C...|$|R
