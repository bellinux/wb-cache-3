5|$|It was {{believed}} {{as late as}} 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific diagnosis code for NSML, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, {{although it has been}} shown that the gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: Germline mutations in the PHOX2A or KIF1B gene have {{been implicated in}} familial neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 2 (NF-2) have a 50% {{chance of}} {{developing}} {{one or more}} meningiomas.|$|E
25|$|Skin: If {{children}} show neurofibromas, {{a diagnostic}} procedure {{should be performed}} to decide which form of <b>neurofibromatosis</b> causes the alterations.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} genetic mutations (~50%) involved in meningiomas are inactivation mutations in the <b>neurofibromatosis</b> 2 gene (merlin) on chromosome 22q.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no known}} {{risk factors for}} ganglioneuromas. However, the tumors may be {{associated}} with some genetic problems, such as <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 1.|$|E
25|$|For {{treatment}} of progressive plexiform neurofibromas associated with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type I, early {{research has shown}} potential for using the c-KIT tyrosine kinase blocking properties of imatinib.|$|E
25|$|Anderson {{has been}} active in {{supporting}} numerous charities and humanitarian organizations. She is an honorary spokesperson for the <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> Network and a co-founder of South African Youth Education for Sustainability (SAYes). Anderson was appointed an honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2016 for her services to drama.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} most cases is unclear. Uncommon risk factors include genetic {{disorders}} such as <b>neurofibromatosis</b> and Li–Fraumeni syndrome, and previous radiation therapy. Glioblastomas represent 15% of brain tumors. They can either start from normal brain cells or develop from an existing low-grade astrocytoma. The diagnosis typically is made {{by a combination of}} CT scan, MRI scan, and tissue biopsy.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors include}} {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation such as during radiation therapy, {{a family history}} of the condition, and <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 2. As of 2014 they {{do not appear to be}} related to cell phone use. They appear to be able to form from a number of different types of cells including arachnoid cells. Diagnosis is typically by medical imaging.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} most cases is unknown but {{believed}} to involve {{a combination of}} genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include other affected family members. It can also occur due to another condition such as muscles spasms, cerebral palsy, Marfan syndrome, and tumors such as <b>neurofibromatosis.</b> Diagnosis is confirmed with plain X-rays. Scoliosis is typically classified as either structural in which the curve is fixed or functional in which the underlying spine is normal.|$|E
25|$|Anderson is {{an honorary}} {{spokesperson}} for the <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> Network. She often holds auctions with the profits benefiting the NF Network. Her brother Aaron died from the disease in 2011. In May 1996, Anderson addressed the United States Congress urging for more education and funding for NF research projects. She partners with Doodle 4 NF – an annual fundraiser for the NF Network. She also supported the Children with Tumours organization and the Global Genes movement, which is devoted to helping children with NF.|$|E
25|$|The Pacak-Zhuang {{syndrome}} is a recently described disease manifestation in females that includes multiple paragangliomas and somatostatinomas (in some), both neuroendocrine tumors, and secondary polycythemia {{associated with high}} erythropoietin levels. Paragangliomas in these patients are mainly localized to the abdomen whereas somatostatinomas {{are found in the}} second portion of the duodenum, as shown by imaging or biochemistry. This {{syndrome is}} of special interest as finding more than one type of neuroendocrine tumor in one individual is unusual. Such co-occurrences are usually seen in patients carrying hereditary syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), <b>neurofibromatosis</b> 1 (NF1), or von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{clinical}} trial at Massachusetts General Hospital used the cancer drug Bevacizumab (commercial name: Avastin) to treat 10 patients with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type II. The result {{was published in}} The New England Journal of Medicine. Of the ten patients treated with bevacizumab, tumours shrank in 9 of them, with the median best response rate of 26%. Hearing improved {{in some of the}} patients, but improvements were not strongly correlated with tumour shrinkage. Bevacizumab works by cutting the blood supply to the tumours and thus depriving them of their growth vector. Side effects during the study included alanine aminotransferase, proteinuria, and hypertension (elevated blood pressure) among others. A separate trial, published in The Neuro-oncology Journal, show 40% tumour reduction in the two patients with NF2, along with significant hearing improvement.|$|E
25|$|NF II {{is caused}} by a defect in the gene that {{normally}} gives rise to a product called Merlin or Schwannomin, located on chromosome 22 band q11-13.1. This peptide is thought to have a tumor-suppressive function. In a normal cell, the concentrations of active (dephosphorylated) merlin are controlled by processes such as cell adhesion (which would indicate the need to restrain cell division). It is known that Merlin's deficiency can result in unmediated progression through the cell cycle {{due to the lack of}} contact-mediated tumour suppression, sufficient to result in the tumors characteristic of <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> type II. Mutations of NF II is presumed to result in either a failure to synthesize Merlin or the production of a defective peptide that lacks the normal tumor-suppressive effect. The Schwannomin-peptide consists of 595 amino acids. Comparison of Schwannomin with other proteins shows similarities to proteins that connect the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. Mutations in the Schwannomin-gene are thought to alter the movement and shape of affected cells with loss of contact inhibition.|$|E
500|$|... 1920: Dutch {{ophthalmologist}} Jan van der Hoeve {{described the}} retinal hamartomas (phakoma). He grouped both TSC and <b>neurofibromatosis</b> together as [...] "phakomatoses" [...] (later called neurocutaneous syndromes).|$|E
500|$|Noonan {{syndrome}} {{with multiple}} lentigines {{is caused by}} a different missense mutation of the same gene. [...] Noonan syndrome is fairly common (1:1,000 to 1:2,500 live births), and <b>neurofibromatosis</b> 1 (which was once thought to be related to NSML) is also common (1:3500); however, no epidemiological data exists for NSML.|$|E
500|$|The {{condition}} was first described by Gerhard Engel in 1864 and Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1890, though William Hunter, {{who died in}} 1783, is credited with finding the first example of the disease. [...] "von Recklinghausen's disease" [...] (without the qualification [...] "of bone") is a completely unrelated disorder, nowadays termed <b>neurofibromatosis.</b> In 1884, Davies Colley delivered a presentation to the Pathological Society of London that detailed the manifestation of hyperparathyroidism into a brown tumor of the mandible, {{as well as the}} histological makeup of the tumor.|$|E
500|$|After her miscarriage, much of {{the hostility}} from the family evaporates, with the {{exception}} of J.R. He openly despises her and her brother. In 1979, Pam is told by Digger's doctor that Digger was a carrier of <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> and that she and Cliff, as his children, were carriers; as <b>neurofibromatosis</b> is a potentially fatal disease to infants. Ironically, Pam soon discovers she is pregnant again. As before, however, tragedy strikes as a rattlesnake frightens Pam's horse when she is out riding and throws her, causing a second miscarriage. [...] In 1980, Pam watches Digger die slowly and painfully {{as a result of his}} decades of heavy drinking. On Digger's deathbed, he tells Pam that she's not his biological child, but born after an affair her mother had with Hutch McKinney. Overwhelmed by a sense of loss after Digger's death and deathbed confession, she pushes to find out more about what happened to her mother. She develops a notion – a dream born out of grief – that perhaps her mother isn't dead after all. Then a private investigator turns up evidence that her mother had not died as Digger had believed, but was alive in Houston. Meanwhile, Bobby has taken over Ewing Oil while J.R. is convalescing after being shot. Pam watches her husband get deeper and deeper into the heart of business in an effort to prove himself, and takes note of Bobby's instinctive attraction to power, which she realizes might be a danger to their marriage.|$|E
500|$|... 1862: German {{physician}} Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen, who {{was working}} {{as an assistant to}} Rudolf Virchow in the Institute for Pathological Anatomy in Berlin, presented a case to the city's Obstetrical Society. The heart of an infant who [...] "died after taking a few breaths" [...] had several tumours. He called these tumours [...] "myomata", one of which was the [...] "size of a pigeon's egg". He also noted the brain had [...] "a great number of scleroses". These were almost certainly the cardiac rhabdomyomas and cortical tubers of tuberous sclerosis. He failed to recognise a distinct disease, regarding it as a pathological-anatomical curiosity. Von Recklinghausen's name would instead become associated with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> after a classic paper in 1881.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unclear}} who {{immediately}} succeeded Arsaces I. Bivar and Katouzian affirm {{that it was}} his brother Tiridates I of Parthia, who in turn was succeeded by his son Arsaces II of Parthia in 211BC. Yet Curtis and Brosius state that Arsaces II was the immediate successor of Arsaces I, with Curtis claiming the succession took place in 211BC, and Brosius in 217BC. Bivar insists that 138BC, the last regnal year of Mithridates I, is [...] "the first precisely established regnal date of Parthian history." [...] Due to these and other discrepancies, Bivar outlines two distinct royal chronologies accepted by historians. Later on, some of the Parthian Kings would claim Achaemenid descent. The claim has recently received support from numismatic and other written evidence suggesting that both Achaemenid and Parthian kings suffered from the hereditary disease <b>neurofibromatosis.</b>|$|E
500|$|By the 1st century AD, the Parthian nobility {{had assumed}} great power and {{influence}} in the succession and deposition of Arsacid kings. Some of the nobility functioned as court advisers to the king, as well as holy priests. Strabo, in his Geographica, preserved a claim by the Greek philosopher and historian Poseidonius that the Council of Parthia consisted of noble kinsmen and magi, two groups from which [...] "the kings were appointed." [...] Of the great noble Parthian families listed {{at the beginning of}} the Sasanian period, only two are explicitly mentioned in earlier Parthian documents: the House of Suren and the House of Karen. The historian Plutarch noted that members of the Suren family, the first among the nobility, were given the privilege of crowning each new Arsacid King of Kings during their coronations. Later on, some of the Parthian kings would claim Achaemenid descent. This has recently been corroborated via the possibility of an inherited disease (<b>neurofibromatosis)</b> demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.|$|E
500|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica ( [...] ), is a {{skeletal}} disorder {{resulting in}} a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known as osteitis fibrosa, osteodystrophia fibrosa, and von Recklinghausen's disease of bone (not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease, <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type I), is caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over-active parathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.|$|E
2500|$|Uncommon {{risk factors}} include genetic {{disorders}} such as <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> Li–Fraumeni syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Turcot syndrome. Previous radiation therapy is also a risk. For unknown reasons, GBM occurs more commonly in males.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Fator did a doodle for {{a charity}} celebrity doodle auction for <b>Neurofibromatosis,</b> more {{commonly}} known as NF. [...] 100% of the profit from all the doodles went to help families with NF.|$|E
2500|$|The tumour {{suppressor}} gene NF1 encodes a Ras-GAP [...] its mutation in <b>neurofibromatosis</b> will mean that Ras {{is less likely to}} be inactivated. Ras can also be amplified, although this only occurs occasionally in tumours.|$|E
2500|$|Only one mutated copy of {{the gene}} will be {{necessary}} {{for a person to}} be affected by an autosomal dominant disorder. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. [...] The chance a child will inherit the mutated gene is 50%. [...] Autosomal dominant conditions sometimes have reduced penetrance, which means although only one mutated copy is needed, not all individuals who inherit that mutation go on to develop the disease. [...] Examples of this type of disorder are Huntington's disease, [...] <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 1, <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 2, Marfan syndrome, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, hereditary multiple exostoses (a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder), Tuberous sclerosis, Von Willebrand disease, and acute intermittent porphyria. Birth defects are also called congenital anomalies.|$|E
2500|$|The person's gait is assessed, {{and there}} is an exam for signs of other {{abnormalities}} (e.g., spina bifida as evidenced by a dimple, hairy patch, lipoma, or hemangioma). [...] A thorough neurological examination is also performed, the skin for café au lait spots, indicative of <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> the feet for cavovarus deformity, abdominal reflexes and muscle tone for spasticity.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{genetics}} is {{the practice}} of clinical medicine with particular attention to hereditary disorders. [...] Referrals are made to genetics clinics {{for a variety of}} reasons, including birth defects, developmental delay, autism, epilepsy, short stature, and many others. [...] Examples of genetic syndromes that are commonly seen in the genetics clinic include chromosomal rearrangements, Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome), Fragile X syndrome, Marfan syndrome, <b>Neurofibromatosis,</b> Turner syndrome, and Williams syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Scoliosis {{associated}} with known syndromes is often subclassified as [...] "syndromic scoliosis". Scoliosis can be {{associated with}} amniotic band syndrome, Arnold–Chiari malformation, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, cerebral palsy, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, familial dysautonomia, CHARGE syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hyperflexibility, [...] "floppy baby" [...] syndrome, and other variants of the condition), fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, hemihypertrophy, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, nail–patella syndrome, <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> osteogenesis imperfecta, Prader–Willi syndrome, proteus syndrome, spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy and syringomyelia.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson is {{the eldest}} of three siblings. Her brother Aaron – who was {{diagnosed}} with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> – died in 2011 of a brain tumor, {{at the age of}} 30. Aaron was a DJ, a mentor, and a practicing Buddhist. He was in his second year of a PhD program in Developmental Psychology at Stanford University when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2008. Her sister Zoe is a ceramicist, whom Anderson calls [...] "an exceptional artist". Zoe is openly gay and is married to her partner.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of cases, sarcoma {{may be related to}} a rare inherited genetic alteration of the p53 gene and is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Certain other inherited diseases are associated with an increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas. For example, people with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type I (also called von Recklinghausen's disease, associated with alterations in the NF1 gene) are at an increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. [...] Patients with inherited retinoblastoma have alterations in the RB1 gene, a tumor suppressor gene, and are likely to develop soft-tissue sarcomas as they mature into adulthood.|$|E
2500|$|The genetic {{component}} is {{strong in the}} development of cataracts, most commonly through mechanisms that protect and maintain the lens. The presence of cataracts in childhood or early life can occasionally be due to a particular syndrome. Examples of [...] chromosome abnormalities associated with cataracts include 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, cri-du-chat syndrome, Down syndrome, Patau's syndrome, trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome), and Turner's syndrome, {{and in the case of}} <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 2, juvenile cataract on one or both sides may be noted. Examples of single-gene disorder include Alport's syndrome, Conradi's syndrome, cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, myotonic dystrophy, and oculocerebrorenal syndrome or Lowe syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{scientific}} teams {{worked in}} the 1970s and 1980s to identify genes and their loci {{as a cause of}} cystic fibrosis. Progress was modest until 1985, when Lap-Chee Tsui and colleagues at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children identified the locus for the gene. [...] It was then determined that a shortcut was needed to speed the process of identification, so Tsui contacted Collins, who agreed to collaborate with the Toronto team and share his chromosome-jumping technique. The gene was identified in June 1989, and the results were published in the journal Science on September 8, 1989. This identification was followed by other genetic discoveries made by Collins and a variety of collaborators. They included isolation of the genes for Huntington's disease, <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, inv(16) AML and Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Neurofibromatosis</b> type II (also {{known as}} MISME {{syndrome}} - multiple inherited schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas) is a genetic condition which [...] may be inherited or may arise spontaneously. The main {{manifestation of the}} condition {{is the development of}} symmetric, benign brain tumors in the region of the cranial nerve VIII, which is the [...] "auditory-vestibular nerve" [...] that transmits sensory information from the inner ear to the brain. Many people with this condition also experience visual problems. NF II is caused by mutations of the [...] "Merlin" [...] gene, which seems to influence the form and movement of cells. The principal treatments consist of neurosurgical removal of the tumors and surgical treatment of the eye lesions. Historically the underlying disorder has not had any therapy due to the cell function caused by the genetic mutation. However, new drug research and some clinical trials have shown some promise in having beneficial effects. Collaborative research to find better treatments is ongoing, such as the work of the Synodos NF-2 Consortium of scientists.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 the Silva {{laboratory}} {{moved to}} the Department of Neurobiology at the UCLA School of Medicine. There, the laboratory [...] bridged their growing involvement in animal models of cognitive disorders with clinical studies. Additionally, UCLA's large and highly collaborative neuroscience community was an ideal environment for the interdisciplinary studies that characterized work in the Silva laboratory. [...] The Silva laboratory became more involved in studying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In the late nineties, cognitive deficits associated with this class of disorders {{were thought to be}} caused by genetic disruptions of brain development [...] Animal model studies of <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> type I (NF1) in the Silva lab suggested that the learning and memory deficits associated with NF1 mutations are caused by changes in synaptic plasticity mechanisms in adults. Accordingly, a project led by Rui M. Costa in the Silva Lab demonstrated that the electrophysiological, and more importantly the behavioral deficits, caused by NF1 mutations could be reversed in adults by manipulations that corrected the molecular signaling deficits associated with these mutations. This discovery, and a series of later studies in many laboratories worldwide, have demonstrated the surprising efficacy of adult interventions in reversing cognitive phenotypes in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Following the NF1 studies published in 2002 by the Silva laboratory, other findings that reported adult rescue of neurodevelopment disorders include, for example, animal studies of Lhermitte-Duclos disease [...] and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome in 2003, Fragile X syndrome in 2005, Down syndrome in 2007, Rett syndrome [...] and Angelman syndrome in 2007, Tuberous Sclerosis in 2008.|$|E
