40|$|We {{measured}} the field potential {{and the changes}} in local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) response during somatosensory activation (evoked LCBF) in α-chloralose-anesthetized rats by laser-Doppler flowmetry under <b>normocapnia</b> (PaCO 2 = 34. 3 ± 3. 8 mmHg) and hypercapnia (PaCO 2 = 70. 1 ± 9. 8 mmHg). Somatosensory activation was induced by electrical stimulation (0. 2, 1, and 5 Hz with 1. 5 mA for 5 s) of the hind paw. The neuronal activity of the somatosensory area of the hind paw was linear to the stimulus frequency, {{and there was no}} significant difference in the neuronal activity between hypercapnia and <b>normocapnia.</b> The baseline level of LCBF under hypercapnia was about 72. 2 % higher than that under <b>normocapnia</b> (p< 0. 01). The absolute response magnitude under hypercapnia was greater than that under <b>normocapnia</b> (p< 0. 05). The evoked LCBF under both conditions showed a frequency-dependent increase in the 0. 2 to 5 Hz range, and the difference in the absolute response magnitude at the same stimulus frequency between <b>normocapnia</b> and hypercapnia became large with increasing stimulus frequency (p< 0. 05). On the other hand, after normalization to each baseline level {{there was no significant difference}} in the response magnitude of the normalized evoked LCBF between <b>normocapnia</b> and hypercapnia, indicating that the normalized evoked LCBF reflects neuronal activity even when the baseline LCBF was changed by the PaCO 2 level. The peak time and termination time of LCBF response curves with respect to the graded neuronal activity at 1 and 5 Hz stimulation increased significantly under hypercapnia, compared with those under <b>normocapnia</b> (p< 0. 05), although the rise time of 0. 5 s was nearly constant.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: We {{determine}} whether maintaining <b>normocapnia</b> during hyperoxic treatment of carbon monoxide-exposed research subjects improves cerebral oxygen delivery. METHODS: This experiment used a randomized, single-blinded, crossover design. We exposed 14 human research subjects to carbon monoxide until their carboxyhemoglobin levels reached 10 % to 12 %. We then treated each research subject with 60 minutes of hyperoxia {{with or without}} <b>normocapnia.</b> Research subjects returned after at least 24 hours, were reexposed to carbon monoxide, and were given the alternate treatment. Relative changes in cerebral oxygen delivery were calculated {{as the product of}} blood oxygen content and middle cerebral artery velocity (an index of cerebral blood flow) as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Maintaining <b>normocapnia</b> during hyperoxic treatment resulted in significantly higher cerebral oxygen delivery compared with standard oxygen treatment (P <. 05; 95 % confidence interval at 60 minutes 2. 8 % to 16. 7 %) {{as a result of the}} prevention of hypocapnia-induced cerebral vasoconstriction and more rapid elimination of carbon monoxide due to increased minute ventilation.

On each of 5 days, eight subjects completed a 2 -min maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the elbow flexor muscles, followed by 4 min of recovery, while transcranial magnetic stimulation tested for suboptimal neural drive to the muscle. On 1 day, subjects breathed without instructions under <b>normocapnia.</b> During the 2 -min MVC, ventilation was ~ 3. 5 times that at rest. On another day, subjects breathed without instruction under hypercapnia. During the 2 -min MVC, ventilation was ~ 1. 5 times that on the normocapnic day. On another 2 days under <b>normocapnia,</b> subjects voluntarily matched their breathing to the uninstructed breathing under <b>normocapnia</b> and hypercapnia using target feedback of the rate and inspiratory volume.

The experimental manipulations succeeded in producing voluntary and involuntary hyperpnea. However, maximal voluntary force, fatigue and voluntary activation of the elbow flexor muscles were unaffected by cortically or chemically driven increases in ventilation.

The authors studied diaphragmatic contractility facing acute variations of arterial carbon dioxide tension (Paco 2) and evaluated the contractile function at 60 min after <b>normocapnia</b> recovery. METHODS: Thirteen piglets weighing 15 - 20 kg were anesthetized, ventilated, and separated into two groups: {{a control group}} (n = 5) evaluated in <b>normocapnia</b> (time-control experiments) and a hypercapnia group (n = 8) in which animals were acutely and shortly exposed to five consecutive ranges of Paco 2 (40, 50, 70, 90, and 110 mmHg). Then carbon dioxide insufflation was stopped. Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure variations obtained after bilateral transjugular phrenic nerve pacing at increased frequencies (20 - 120 Hz). For each level of arterial pressure of carbon dioxide, pressure-frequency curves were obtained in vivo by phrenic nerve pacing. RESULTS: In the hypercapnia group, mean +/- SD transdiaphragmatic pressure significantly decreased from 41 +/- 3 to 29 +/- 3 cm H 2 O (P < 0. 05) between the first (40 mmHg) and fifth (116 mmHg) stages of capnia at the frequency of 100 Hz stimulation.

Our {{findings suggest that the}} initial post-resuscitation PaCO 2 is not solely the result of the prescribed MV, and thus it is likely influenced by other treatment-related factors (for example, use of neuromuscular blocking agents, duration and technique of bag ventilation by hand prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation) and multiple patient-related factors (for example, etiology of cardiac arrest, lung compliance, lung injury, intrinsic respiratory drive, persistent post-resuscitation circulatory shock, dead space, body habitus). These data provide scientific rationale for further research to determine the other factors associated with PaCO 2 derangements during the initial post-ROSC period.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Protective {{ventilation}} using limited airway {{pressures and}} ventilation {{may result in}} moderate and prolonged hypercapnic acidosis, as often observed in critically ill patients. Because allow of moderate and prolonged hypercapnia may {{be considered as a}} protective measure for the lungs, we hypothesized that moderate and prolonged hypercapnic acidosis may protect diaphragm against ventilator induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of moderate and prolonged (72 -h of mechanical ventilation) hypercapnic acidosis on in-vivo diaphragmatic function. METHODS: Two groups of anesthetized piglets were ventilated during a 72 -h period. Piglets were assigned to the <b>Normocapnia</b> group (n= 6), ventilated in <b>normocapnia,</b> or to the Hypercapnia group (n= 6), ventilated with moderate hypercapnic acidosis (PaCO 2 from 55 to 70 mmHg) during the 72 -h period of the study. Every 12 h, we measured transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) after bilateral, supramaximal trans-jugular stimulation of the two phrenic nerves to assess in vivo diaphragmatic contractile force. Pressure-frequency curves were drawn after stimulation from 20 to 120 Hz of the phrenic nerves. The protocol was approved our institutional animal care committee's. RESULTS: Moderate and prolonged hypercapnic acidosis was well tolerated during the study period. The baseline pressure-frequency curves of the two groups were not significantly different (Pdi at 20 Hz = 32. 7 +/- 8. 7 vs. 34. 4 +/- 8. 4 cm H 2 O; and at 120 Hz = 56. 8 +/- 8. 7 vs. 60. 8 +/- 5. 7 cm H 2 O, for <b>Normocapnia</b> and Hypercapnia groups respectively). After 72 -h of ventilation, Pdi decreased by 25 % of its baseline value in the <b>normocapnia</b> group, whereas Pdi did not decrease in the hypercapnia group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{generally}} argued that variations in cerebral blood flow create concomitant changes in the cerebral blood volume (CBV). Because nitrous oxide (N(2) O) inhalation both increases cerebral blood flow and may increase intracranial pressure, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that N(2) O acts as a general vasodilatator in cerebral vessels both on the arterial and on the venous side. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of N(2) O on three-dimensional regional and global CBV in humans during <b>normocapnia</b> and hypocapnia. METHODS: Nine volunteers were studied under each of four conditions: <b>normocapnia,</b> hypocapnia, <b>normocapnia</b> + 40 - 50 % N(2) O, and hypocapnia + 40 - 50 % N(2) O. CBV was measured after (99 m) Tc-labeling of blood with radioactive quantitative registration via single photon emission computer-aided tomography scanning. RESULTS: Global CBV during <b>normocapnia</b> and inhalation of 50 % O(2) was 4. 25 +/- 0. 57 % of the brain volume (4. 17 +/- 0. 56 ml/ 100 g, mean +/- SD) with no change during inhalation of 40 - 50 % N(2) O in O(2). Decreasing carbon dioxide (CO(2)) by 1. 5 kPa (11 mmHg) without N(2) O inhalation and by 1. 4 kPa (11 mmHg) with N(2) O inhalation reduced CBV significantly (F = 57, P < 0. 0001), by 0. 27 +/- 0. 10 % of the brain volume per kilopascal (0. 26 +/- 0. 10 ml x 100 g(- 1) x kPa(- 1)) without N(2) O inhalation and by 0. 35 +/- 0. 22 % of the brain volume per kilopascal (0. 34 +/- 0. 22 ml x 100 g(- 1) x kPa(- 1)) during N(2) O inhalation (no significant difference). The amount of carbon dioxide significantly altered the regional distribution of CBV (F = 47, P < 0. 0001), corresponding to a regional difference in Delta CBV when CO(2) is changed. N(2) O inhalation did not significantly change the distribution of regional CBV (F = 2. 4, P = 0. 051) or Delta CBV/Delta CO(2) in these nine subjects.

This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that higher values of intra-operative ETCO 2 decrease the rate of post-operative complications. Materials and Methods: In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 78 adult patients scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into three groups.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{halothane}} and morphine anesthesia on autoregulation of {{cerebral blood flow}} under the conditions of normo-, hypo-, and hypercapinia were studied in eleven dogs. The cerebral blood flow (CFB) from the sagittal sinus was continuously measured by electromagnetic flowmeter. Induced hypertension and hypotension were obtained with intravenous infusion of phenylephrine and blood withdrawal, respectively. In 1. 5 -per cent endtidal halothane group at <b>normocapnia</b> (39 mmHg), the mean CBF did not change significantly within a range of mean cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) from 100 to 138 mmHg, and at hypocapnia (25 mmHg), within mean CPP from 41 to 169 mmHg. At hypercapnia (65 mmHg), change in CPP from 43 to 142 mmHg was accompanied by similar directional change in CBF, resulting in complate loss of autoregulation. In 2 -mg/kg morphine group at <b>normocapnia</b> (35 mmHg) and hypocapnia (24 mmHg) the mean CPP from 84 to 169 mmHg. These results suggest that cerebral autoregulation is better preserved during morphine anesthesia than halothane, and is ameliorated by hypocapnia and impaired by hypercapnia...|$|E

40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of cerebrovascular CO 2 reactivity measurements, it is often assumed that {{the diameter of the}} large intracranial arteries insonated by transcranial Doppler remains unaffected by changes in arterial CO 2 partial pressure. However, the strong cerebral vasodilatory capacity of CO 2 challenges this assumption, suggesting that there should be some changes in diameter, even if very small. Data from previous studies on effects of CO 2 on cerebral artery diameter [middle cerebral artery (MCA) ] have been inconsistent. In this study, we examined 10 healthy subjects (5 women, 5 men, age 21 - 30 yr). High-resolution (0. 2 mm in-plane) MRI scans at 7 Tesla were used for direct observation of the MCA diameter during hypocapnia, - 1 kPa (- 7. 5 mmHg), <b>normocapnia,</b> 0 kPa (0 mmHg), and two levels of hypercapnia, + 1 and + 2 kPa (7. 5 and 15 mmHg), with respect to baseline. The vessel lumen was manually delineated by two independent observers. The results showed that the MCA diameter increased by 6. 8 ± 2. 9 % in response to 2 kPa end-tidal P(CO 2) (PET(CO 2)) above baseline. However, no significant changes in diameter were observed at the - 1 kPa (- 1. 2 ± 2. 4 %), and + 1 kPa (+ 1. 4 ± 3. 2 %) levels relative to <b>normocapnia.</b> The nonlinear response of the MCA diameter to CO 2 was fitted as a continuous calibration curve. Cerebral blood flow changes measured by transcranial Doppler could be corrected by this calibration curve using concomitant PET(CO 2) measurements. In conclusion, the MCA diameter remains constant during small deviations of the PET(CO 2) from <b>normocapnia,</b> but increases at higher PET(CO 2) value...|$|E
