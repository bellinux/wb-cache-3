25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit stage left as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - {{wanted to see}} him, and his run was extended and extended, as was the seating in the theatre; <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.|$|E
500|$|In the {{documentary}} film <b>Not</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>for</b> a Girl, Love, {{who had been}} in the erotic dancing industry for years prior, said that she worked as a stripper to help support the band in its early incarnation. She also cited her work as a dancer as being one of many inspirations for the songs on Pretty on the Inside: [...] "I was blonde, wore makeup, had to support my band by dancing, and had to play this ridiculous archetype at work... so I took, you know, high heels and white pumps, and I had a wigletâ€”I just took that and messed with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. <b>Not</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> a flop movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Publishers Weekly, {{the movie}} {{was one of the}} sleeper hits of 2004, as [...] "word-of-mouth and {{strategic}} marketing kept it in theaters for an entire year." [...] The article states that the domestic gross exceeded $10 million, described as <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> a low-budget documentary, and that the DVD release attained even more significant success with over a million units shipped {{in the first six months}} following its release in March 2005. Foreign gross added another $5 million for a worldwide gross of nearly $16 million.|$|E
2500|$|Bjelland {{was born}} in Salem, Oregon to Lynne Irene (nee Higginbotham) and Lyle Bjelland. She was raised in Woodburn, a small town near Salem. Her parents {{divorced}} when she was young, and she {{claimed to have been}} physically and verbally abused by her stepmother. [...] In the documentary, <b>Not</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>for</b> a Girl (1995), Bjelland revealed: [...] "You know, I really hate to talk about it because she's great now, but in my childhood she was very abusive... like I said, though, it probably did help my creativity a lot. I was always grounded. I hate to talk about it because I feel like she doesn't think that she did it, but she was [...] and it influenced my life quite a great deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevada did {{not have}} any {{prisoner}} of war camps or internment camps like so many of the other states, the latter because Governor Edward P. Carville refused to allow the federal government to use his state as a [...] "dumping ground for enemy aliens." [...] However, enemy aliens, including Japanese Americans, residing within Nevada faced new restrictions which had never been implemented before. Although little research has been done about the topic, it appears that German and Italian aliens received very few of the restrictions and little antagonism when compared to the aliens of the World War I-era. The Japanese, however, were subjected to forced removal by the military and the seizure of their property by the government. Conditions were <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the entire Japanese community though; not all were forced to move to relocation camps. As aliens they had to register in accordance with the law and were required to turn in all weapons and short-wave radios. [...] Some experienced little interference with their daily lives, while others were relocated to WRA internment camps.|$|E
