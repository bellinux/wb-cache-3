25|$|On the American side, {{the defense}} {{depended}} on field fortifications, innovative use of light anti-tank weapons like the bazooka and anti-tank mines, {{and most importantly}} {{the support of a}} formidable array of indirect fire. American tanks and anti-tank guns were considered ineffective against the newer German fighting vehicles. This was compensated to some extent by use of the 76 mm (76.2 mm) M1A1 gun, designated as the 3-inch cannon, mounted on the Sherman tank and the M18 Hellcat tank destroyer. The British had also designed high velocity anti-armor ammunition for the 57mm anti-tank cannon, which gave this gun a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> against the new heavier German units. American gunners were quick to trade for whatever their allies wanted for this highly effective ammunition. The Americans also adapted the 90mm anti-aircraft gun as an anti-tank cannon, the 90mm cannon, and mounted it on an open turret on the Sherman tank as the M36 Jackson tank-destroyer. This was another innovation effective against German heavy tanks.|$|E
25|$|Many {{tactical}} RPGs {{can be both}} extremely {{time-consuming and}} extremely difficult. Hence, the appeal of most tactical RPGs is to the hardcore, not casual, computer and video game player. Traditionally, tactical RPGs have been quite popular in Japan but have not enjoyed {{the same degree of}} success in North America and elsewhere. However, the audience for Japanese tactical RPGs has grown substantially since the mid-90s, with PS1 and PS2 titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden Tactics, Vanguard Bandits, and Disgaea enjoying a surprising measure of popularity, as well as hand-held war games like Fire Emblem. (Final Fantasy Tactics for the PS1 is often considered the breakthrough title outside Japan.) Older TRPGs are also being re-released via software emulationsuch as on the Wii Virtual Consoleand on handheld game consoles, giving games a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> and exposure to new audiences. Japanese video games such as these are as a result no longer nearly as rare a commodity in North America as they were during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known poem in Malayalam, Ramacharitam, {{dated to}} the 12th to 14th century CE, was completed before {{the introduction of}} the Sanskrit alphabet. It shows the same phase of the language as in Jewish and Nasrani Sasanas (dated to mid‑8th century A.D.). But the period of the earliest available literary document cannot be the sole criterion used to determine the antiquity of a language. In its early literature, Malayalam has songs, Pattu, for various subjects and occasions, such as harvesting, love songs, heroes, gods, etc. A form of writing called Campu emerged from the 14th century onwards. It mixed poetry with prose and used a vocabulary strongly influenced by Sanskrit, with themes from epics and Puranas.Rama-charitam, which was composed in the 14th century A.D., may be said to have inaugurated Malayalam literature just as Naniah's Mahabharatam did for Telugu. The fact is that dialectical and local peculiarities had already developed and stamped themselves in local songs and ballads. But these linguistic variations were at last gathered together and made to give a coloring to a sustained literary work, the Rama-charitam, thereby giving the new language a justification and a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, stress {{over the}} closing of his play Just Say No, {{only a few weeks}} after its opening, forced Kramer into the {{hospital}} after it aggravated a congenital hernia. While in surgery, doctors discovered liver damage due to Hepatitis B, prompting Kramer to learn that he was HIV positive. In 2001, at the age 66, Kramer was in dire need of a liver transplant, but he was turned down by Mount Sinai Hospital's organ transplant list. People living with HIV were routinely considered inappropriate candidates for organ transplants because of complications from HIV and perceived short lifespans. Out of the 4,954 liver transplants performed in the United States, only 11 were for HIV-positive people. The news prompted Newsweek to announce Kramer was dying in June 2001, and the Associated Press in December of the same year to claim Kramer had died. Kramer became a symbol for infected people who had <b>new</b> <b>leases</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> due to advances in medicine. [...] "We shouldn't face a death sentence because of who we are or who we love", he said in an interview. In May 2001, the Thomas E.

25|$|In 1953, {{aluminium}} 1-, 2-, and 5-fen coins began {{being struck}} for circulation, and were first introduced in 1955. These depict the national emblem on the obverse (front) {{and the name}} and denomination framed by wheat stocks on the reverse (back). In 1980, brass 1-, 2-, and 5-jiao and cupro-nickel 1-yuan coins were added, although the 1 and 2 jiao were only produced until 1981, with the last 5 jiao and 1 yuan issued in 1985. All jiao coins depicted similar designs to the fen coins while the yuan depicted the Great Wall of China. In 1991, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of an aluminium 1 jiao, brass 5 jiao and nickel-clad-steel 1 yuan. These were smaller than the previous jiao and yuan coins and depicted flowers on the obverse and the national emblem on the reverse. Issuance of the aluminum 1- and 2-fen coins ceased in 1991, {{with that of the}} 5 fen halting in 1994. The small coins were still made for annual uncirculated mint sets in limited quantities, and from the beginning of 2005 the 1-fen coin got a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> by being issued again every year since then up to present. New designs of the 1 and 5 jiao and 1 yuan were again introduced in between 1999 and 2002, with the 1 jiao being significantly reduced in size. In 2005, the metallic composition of the 1 jiao was changed from aluminum to more durable nickel-plated steel. The frequency of usage of coins varies between different parts of China, with coins typically being more popular in urban areas, and small notes being more popular in rural areas. Older fen and large jiao coins are uncommonly still seen in circulation but are still valid in exchange.|$|E

40|$|Alopecia can {{be caused}} by {{defective}} formation, defective regeneration, or increased destruction of hair follicles. Much work has elucidated the roles of diffusible morphogens in modulating hair follicle stem cell activities. Recent studies have revealed novel molecular events within the nucleus, which are required for the activation and progression of hair stem cells. These studies will provide new clues and targets for designing therapeutic strategies for hair loss. Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013) 133, 1450 – 1452. doi: 10. 1038 /jid. 2012. 511 Alopecia {{can be caused}} by decreased formation, decreased regeneration, or increased destruction of hair follicles. As in many organs, formation defects can result from failure of induction, morphogenesis, or differentiation. However, hair follicle miniorgans are unique in that they undergo repetitive regenerative cycling under physiological conditions to renew old appendages (Paus and Cotsarelis, 1999) and accommodate the animal to its physiological needs at different stages of life (Chuong et al., 2012). Hair regeneration involves cyclic activation of hair stem cells and the subsequent reformation of hair organs. Although regenerative cycling gives hair a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> (organ) <b>life,</b> it also opens a new dimension in which things can go wrong, leading to alopecia. To manage alopecia, we need {{to know more about the}} molecular control of hair stem cells.
