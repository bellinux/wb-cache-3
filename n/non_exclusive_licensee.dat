5000|$|While {{maintaining}} {{that there was}} some distinction between assignments and exclusive licenses, the dissent would have held that <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees</b> had the right under the Copyright Act to sue the original owner of the copyright for copyright infringement. The dissent based this position on section 2.7 of the copyright act, which states that an [...] "exclusive license is an authorization to do any act that is subject to copyright to the exclusion of all others including the copyright owner." [...] According to the dissent, it would rob section s.2.7 of effect and meaning if an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> were to be held to have no right of action as against the copyright owner, because in that case the <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> would have no way to give effect to his right to exclude all others including the copyright owner.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Abella (dissent): (writing {{for herself}} and Justice McLachlin): The Act does make {{parallel}} importation an infringement even where the copyright owner is an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{doctrine}} {{could yield}} a harsh result for an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> in a work. If {{a third party}} infringed the work, the copyright holder had no motivation to file suit---the work was no longer marketable. So courts allowed <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees</b> to compulsively join the copyright holder as a plaintiff in such suits. Non-exclusive licensees could not forcefully join copyright holders, {{on the theory that}} in those cases, the work was still marketable and the copyright holder therefore had an interest in protecting his rights.|$|R

50|$|Is {{there any}} {{meaningful}} difference between assignments and exclusive licences? If it is true, as the dissent argues, that <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> {{would have no}} way to give effect to his right to exclude all others including the copyright owner without the right to sue for copyright infringement, then it would seem necessary to collapse any legal distinction between assignments and exclusive licenses in order to give meaning to section 2.7. If {{there was no other way}} to give effect to the right to exclude, than section 2.7 would in fact require that the two concepts be merged.However, it is clear that a claim for copyright infringement is not the only claim that an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> could make; an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> might also claim for breach of contract. The main difference in law between a claim for breach of contract and a claim for copyright infringement is that the normal remedy for breach of contract is to order the payment of damages, whereas the normal remedy for copyright infringement is an injunction forbidding copying henceforth.|$|R

50|$|The {{success of}} this claim {{depended}} on whether an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> under the Copyright Act (in this case Kraft Canada) could sue the owner/licensor of the copyright (in this case the parent companies Kraft Foods Belgium SA and Kraft Foods Schweiz AG).|$|R

50|$|Five of {{the justices}} (Bastarache, LeBel, Charron, Abella, and McLachlin) {{interpreted}} s. 2.7 in the Copyright Act to mean that <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees</b> had the same rights of {{the owner of a}} copyright, and that the right to sue the owner was granted in an exclusive license.|$|R

5000|$|Justice Rothstein (Majority): (writing for himself, Justice Binnie and Deschamps JJ): Pursuant to s. 27(2)(e), {{parallel}} importation {{is secondary}} infringement where the parallel importer is an assignee.

5000|$|Justice Fish: Concurs with Justice Rothstein {{with respect}} to the <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> issue, but does not {{necessarily}} agree than liability would have attached to the parallel importer had the copyright holder been an assignee.
