40|$|Purpose: A {{woman should}} be able to trust that the steroid {{receptor}} status of her cancer is reported correctly. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) allows for specific assessment of tumour cells and the role of automated image analysis (IA) in the assessment of receptor IHC in breast cancer is topical. We compared ER and PR status assessed visually and by IA, and their respective abilities to predict cancer-specific survival and recurrence in a cohort with mature follow up. Patients and methods: Patients (n= 525) treated for primary symptomatic operable breast cancer in Glasgow during 1995 - 8 were studied in triplicate tissue microarray using ER (Dako 6 F 11 / 12) and PR (Leica R 636) IHC. Allred and weighted Histoscores were assigned visually (v-H Scores) and weighted H-scores by IA (ia-H Scores; Slidepath <b>nuclear</b> <b>protocol).</b> Interclass correlation coefficients, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in SPSS v 18. Results: Minimum follow up was 11. 8 years (median 13. 8). There was excellent agreement between steroid receptor v-H and ia-H Scores and both methods predicted cancer-specific survival equally well overall and in the 384 patients who received endocrine treatment. Allred score was also effective. Conclusions: Automated analysis of ER and PR status gave results in excellent agreement with visual analysis and equally effective (but not better) prediction of survival and tumour recurrence. Visual confirmation that the cells being analysed are representative of the invasive carcinoma remains essential and no quality asssurance requirements are made redundant by image analysis if disasters like the Newfoundland ER testing debacle (Hede, K: JNCI 2008; 100 : 837 -) are to be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to determine aldosterone concentration in the plasma and urine in rats with damaged adrenals and to ascertain whether impaired adrenals {{have an effect on}} the development of hypertension. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats (190 - 300 gm) were divided into three groups. Group I consisted of 10 adrenalectornized rats and 6 controls with both adrenals intact. Experimental rats in this group received 6 micrograms/rat/day of d-aldosterone— 21 -acetate injected intraperitoneally and 1. 0 % saline was given for drinking water. The controls received tap water ad libitum. Group II consisted of 5 rats with one-partially damaged adrenal (1 -PDA) and the other adrenal gland was removed. Three controls had one adrenal gland intact and undamaged. Both experimental and control rats for this group received 1. 0 % saline for drinking water Group III consisted of 5 rats with both adrenals partially- damaged (2 -PDA), and 3 controls with both adrenals undamaged. Experimental and control rats received 1. 0 % saline for drinking water daily. The adrenal glands in Groups II and III were damaged by cauterization using a Birtcher (Model 732) Hyfrecator. Sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, 40 mg. kg) was used for the anesthetic agent and all operations were performed under aseptic conditions. Weight, blood pressures and 24 -hr urines were taken at 7, 15, and 30 days after the operations. The New England <b>Nuclear</b> <b>protocol</b> was used for the radioimmunoassay of aldosterone. The mean urine aldosterone values in groups I, II, and III (test rats) were 1. 75, 2. 40, and 1. 55 ng/ 24 hr over the 30 day period. The mean urine aldosterone values in the controls were 1. 40, 4. 60 and 6. 60 ng/ 24 hr respectively. These results show that the cauterization technique was possibly effective because the mean 30 -day output of aldosterone was lower in the partially-damaged adrenals (1 -PDA and 2 -PDA) than in the respective controls. These findings support the fact that at 7 days the partially-damaged (1 -PDA and 2 -PDA) control animals were subjected to 1. 0 % saline as drinking water there was increased excretion of aldosterone with low urine sodium values, whereas at 15 and 30 days the 1 -PDA and 2 -PDA controls have low urine aldosterone values with elevated urine sodium levels. There was no significant increase in blood pressure over the 30 -day period, which may suggest that impaired adrenal function might delay any gradual or rapid increase in blood pressure...|$|E

30|$|In {{realistic}} scenarios, a bulk diamond or {{diamond powder}} will contain {{a large number}} of NV centers within the laser and microwave focus. Consequently, it is worthwhile considering DNP experiments using an ensemble of NV centers. This leads to the challenge that the transition frequency of NV centers may have a distribution of values, for example due to the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions with the surrounding impurity electron spins, or due to the misalignment between the spin preferential (quantization) axis (e.g. the NV symmetry axis) and the direction of the magnetic field, e.g. an ensemble of NVs in diamond powder [33, 34].

A <b>nuclear</b> isolation <b>protocol</b> was developed using the cell wall-less strain of Chlamydomonas, CW 15, after cell lysis with 0. 5 % Nonidet P- 40. Transcriptional activity of isolated nuclei was determined by incorporating [32 P]UTP into TCA-precipitable and phenol- extractable RNA, and by hybridizing newly transcribed RNA to complementary DNA clones containing alpha- and beta-tubulin sequences. Nuclei from deflagellated cells are more active in transcribing sequences that hybridize with alpha- and beta-tubulin complementary DNA probes than are nuclei from nondeflagellated cells. In addition, while total [32 P]UTP incorporation is inhibited 45 % by alpha-amanitin concentrations of 1. 0 micrograms/ml, tubulin RNA synthesis in this system is completely inhibited by this concentration of alpha-amanitin.

40|$|Cloning mammals by nuclear {{transfer}} {{is a powerful}} technique that is quickly advancing the development of genetically defined animal models.

Recipient cytoplasts were prepared from ovulated oocytes. Activation of oocytes could be induced more efficiently when electric stimulation was given 53 hr after the hCG injection or later (66 - 83 %), compared with 52 hr or earlier (11 - 16 %, P 0. 05) for the four- to eight-cell and morula stage embryos, respectively.

There are {{many different types of}} breast cancer, and many have characteristics making them challenging to detect by mammography and ultrasound. BSGI is a cost-effective, highly sensitive and specific technique that complements other imaging modalities currently being used to identify malignant lesions in the breast. Using the current Society of Nuclear Medicine guidelines for breast scintigraphy, Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital began conducting BSGI, breast scintigraphy with a breast-optimized g-camera.

40|$|The {{nucleus of}} a {{eukaryotic}} cell contains both structural and functional elements {{that contribute to}} the controlled operation of the cell. In this context, functional components refers to those nuclear constituents that perform metabolic activities such as DNA replication and RNA transcription. Structural nuclear components, designated nuclear matrix, organize the DNA into loops or domains and appear to provide a framework for nuclear DNA organization. However, the boundary between structural and functional components is not clear cut as evinced by reports of associations between metabolic functions and the nuclear matrix. The studies reported here attempt to determine the relationship of another nuclear function, DNA repair, to the nuclear matrix. ^ One objective of these studies was to study the initiation of DNA repair by directly measuring the UV-incision activities in human cells and determine the influence of various extractable nuclear components on these activities. The assay for incision activities required the development of a <b>nuclear</b> isolation <b>protocol</b> that produced nuclei with intact DNA; the conformation of the nuclear DNA and its physical characteristics in response to denaturing conditions were determined. ^ The nuclei produced with this protocol were then used as substrates for endogenous UV-specific nuclease activities. The isolated nuclei were shown to contain activities that cause breaks in nuclear DNA in response to UV-irradiation. These UV-responsive activities were tightly associated with nuclear components, being unextractable with salt concentration of up to 0. 6 M. ^ The tight association of the incision activities with salt-extracted nuclei suggested that other repair function might also be associated with salt-stable components of the nucleus. The site of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) was determined in salt-extracted nuclei (nucleoids) using autoradiography and fluorescent microscopy. UDS was found to occur in association with the nuclear matrix following low-doses (2. 55 J/M(2 ̆ 72)) of ultraviolet light, but the association became looser after higher doses of ultraviolet light (10 - 30 J/m(2 ̆ 72)). ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT) requires cytoplast-mediated reprogramming of the donor nucleus. Cytoplast {{factors such as}} maturation promoting factor are implicated based on their involvement in nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and premature chromosome condensation (PCC). Given prior difficulties in SCNT in primates using conventional protocols, we hypothesized that the ability of cytoplasts to induce nuclear remo-deling was instrumental in efficient reprogramming. METHODS: NEBD and PCC in monkey (Macaca mulatta) SCNT embryos were monitored by lamin A/C immunolabeling. RESULTS: Initially, a persistent lamin A/C signal from donor cell nuclei after fusion with cytoplasts was observed indicative of incomplete NEBD following SCNT and pre-dictive of developmental arrest. We then identified fluorochrome-assisted enucleation and donor cell electrofusion as likely candidates for inducing premature cytoplast activation and a consequent lack of <b>nuclear</b> remodeling. Modified <b>protocols</b> designed to prevent premature cytoplast activation during SCNT showed robust NEBD and PCC. Coinci-dently, over 20 % of SCNT embryos reconstructed with fetal fibroblasts progressed to blastocysts. Similar results were obtained with other somatic cells. Reconstructed blastocysts displayed patterns of Oct- 4 expression similar to ferti-lized embryos reflecting successful reprogramming.

Highly distinctive spectra for three different crystalline structures of CHOL were obtained. When CHOL crystals were mixed with isotropic CE oil, solubilized CHOL (approximately 13 mol % CHOL) was detected by characteristic resonances such as C 5, C 6, and C 3; the excess crystalline CHOL (either anhydrous or monohydrate) remained in its original crystalline structure, without being affected by the coexisting CE. By use of 13 C-enriched CHOL, the solubility of CHOL in the CE liquid-crystalline phase (approximately 8 mol %) was measured. When phosphatidylcholine was hydrated in presence of CHOL and CE, magic-angle-sampling nuclear magnetic resonance revealed liquid-crystalline CHOL/phosphatidylcholine multilayers with approximately an equal molar ratio of CHOL/phosphatidylcholine.

40|$|Abstract Background While seed {{biology is}} well {{characterized}} and {{numerous studies have}} focused on this subject over the past years, the regulation of seed coat development and metabolism is for the most part still non-elucidated. It is well known that the seed coat has an essential role in seed development and its features are associated with important agronomical traits. It also constitutes a rich source of valuable compounds such as pharmaceuticals. Most of the cell genetic material is contained in the nucleus; therefore nuclear proteins constitute a major actor for gene expression regulation. Isolation of nuclear proteins responsible for specific seed coat expression is an important prerequisite for understanding seed coat metabolism and development. The extraction of nuclear proteins may be problematic due to the presence of specific components that can interfere with the extraction process. The seed coat is a rich source of mucilage and phenolics, which are good examples of these hindering compounds. Findings In the present study, we propose an optimized <b>nuclear</b> protein extraction <b>protocol</b> able to provide nuclear proteins from flax seed coat without contaminants and sufficient yield and quality for their use in transcriptional gene expression regulation by gel shift experiments. Conclusions Routinely, around 250 μg of nuclear proteins per gram of fresh weight were extracted from immature flax seed coats.

40|$|The precautionary {{principle}} has been highly influential in legal systems {{all over the}} world. In its strongest and most distinctive forms, the principle imposes a burden of proof on those who create potential risks, and it requires regulation of activities even if it cannot be shown that those activities are likely to produce significant harms. Taken in this strong form, the {{precautionary principle}} should be rejected, not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all. The principle is literally paralyzing-forbidding inaction, stringent regulation, and everything in between. The reason {{is that in the}} relevant cases, every step, including inaction, creates a risk to health, the environment, or both. This point raises a further puzzle: Why is the precautionary principle widely seen to offer real guidance? The answer lies in identifiable cognitive mechanisms emphasized by behavioral economists. In many cases, loss aversion plays a large role, accompanied by a false belief that nature is benign. Sometimes the availability heuristic is at work. Probability neglect plays a role as well. Most often, those who use the precautionary principle fall victim to what might be called 2 ̆ 2 system neglect, 2 ̆ 2 which involves a failure to attend to the systemic effects of regulation. Examples are given from numerous areas, involving arsenic regulation, global warming and the Kyoto <b>Protocol,</b> <b>nuclear</b> power, pharmaceutical regulation, cloning, pesticide regulation, and genetic modification offood. The salutary moral and political goals of the precautionary principle should be promoted through other, more effective methods...|$|R
30|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most {{prevalent}} forms of cancer in women. In the Netherlands, every year 13, 000 new cases are reported, and it is a condition that affects one in every nine women. Patients with breast cancer have a good prognosis if the disease is detected early. Mammography is the standard modality of choice for screening and diagnosing breast cancer. Unfortunately, the mammogram is not conclusive in all cases, especially in women with dense breast tissue; mammograms can be difficult to interpret and can lead to ambiguous findings. As a result, these patients are referred for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Breast MRI has a high sensitivity for detecting malignancy in the breast, but specificity is sub-optimal, potentially leading to unnecessary invasive procedures [1]. Breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) is an improved breast scintigraphy technique that uses a sensitive single-head small-field-of-view gamma camera [2 – 4]. Patient dose minimisation is an important aspect of the optimisation of any <b>nuclear</b> medicine <b>protocol.</b> The importance of dose optimisation depends, among others, on the patient population. For population screening, a much lower patient dose is acceptable than that for a patient group with a high risk of malignancy because in the screening setting, the number of subjects is higher and the chance of an individual positive finding is much lower. The average mean glandular radiation dose for a two-view digital mammography is 3.7 mGy [5], from which we estimate the patient dose (using ICRP 103 using a weighting factor of 0.12) for a four-view mamography exam to be 0.88 mSv. For a typical BSGI examination, the patient dose varies between 5.9 and 9.4 mSv for an administered activity of 740 to 1, 184 MBq of 99 mTc-sestamibi. Recent work by Hruska et al. showed that significant dose reductions could be achieved when a dual-head breast-specific gamma camera is used [6, 7]. At our hospital, we have a single-head breast-specific gamma camera (Dilon 6800, Dilon Technologies Inc., Newport News, VA, USA) for which we want to explore the possibilities of reducing acquisition times or, equivalently, further reducing patient dose. Specifically, this study concentrates on dose optimisation of the BSGI protocol at our hospital, and we introduce a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) analysis methodology and a phantom-based approach to determine if imaging longer (or equivalently giving a higher dose) could lead to the observation of more hotspots. We also applied the CNR analysis to data from a small group of patients.|$|R
40|$|Brain {{dopamine}} transporters imaging by Single Emission Tomography (SPECT) with 123 I-FP-CIT (DaTScanTM) {{has become}} an important tool in the diagnosis and evaluation of Parkinson syndromes. This diagnostic method allows the visualization of {{a portion of the}} striatum – where healthy pattern resemble two symmetric commas - allowing the evaluation of dopamine presynaptic system, in which dopamine transporters are responsible for dopamine release into the synaptic cleft, and their reabsorption into the nigrostriatal nerve terminals, in order to be stored or degraded. In daily practice for assessment of DaTScan TM, it is common to rely only on visual assessment for diagnosis. However, this process is complex and subjective as it depends on the observer’s experience and it is associated with high variability intra and inter observer. Studies have shown that semiquantification can improve the diagnosis of Parkinson syndromes. For semiquantification, analysis methods of image segmentation using regions of interest (ROI) are necessary. ROIs are drawn, in specific - striatum - and in nonspecific – background – uptake areas. Subsequently, specific binding ratios are calculated. Low adherence of semiquantification for diagnosis of Parkinson syndromes is related, not only with the associated time spent, but also with the need of an adapted database of reference values for the population concerned, as well as, the examination of each service protocol. Studies have concluded, that this process increases the reproducibility of semiquantification. The aim of this investigation was to create and validate a database of healthy controls for Dopamine transporters with DaTScanTM named DBRV. The created database has been adapted to the <b>Nuclear</b> Medicine Department’s <b>protocol,</b> and the population of Infanta Cristina’s Hospital located in Badajoz, Spain...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi is a plant {{pathogen}} that causes dieback disease in southern Australia. It threatens the biodiversity of many natural ecosystems {{due to the}} susceptibility of the native vegetation. If methods of control are to be successful then we must appreciate the genetic variation in the pathogen {{and the ways in}} which this variation is generated. Previously, the only genetic markers available to study P. cinnamomi were isozymes, which showed that isolates in Australia were one of three isozyme types. In this thesis I describe the development of microsatellite DNA markers for P. cinnamomi. Five microsatellites were successfully developed into markers for the <b>nuclear</b> genome and <b>protocols</b> for their use were established. Research into microsatel 1 ites for the mitochondrial genome is also presented though this was unsuccessful in providing markers useful for population genetic studies. The developed micro satellite markers were used to study inheritance in sexual progeny of four P. cinnamomi crosses. All but one of 201 progeny germinated were outcrosses. A large amount of non-Mendelian inheritance of the microsatellite alleles was observed. This could be explained by a high frequency of imperfect meiosis (e. g., nondisjunction, unequal crossing over) leading to additions and deletions in the chromosome complement of the sexually derived progeny. A population genetic study of three intensively sampled P. cinnamomi disease fronts located in southwest Australia is also presented. A total of 647 isolates were analysed from these hierarchically sampled sites with the micro satellite markers along with 133 culture collection isolates from across Australia. This analysis revealed that P. cinnamomi in Australia consists of three clonal lineages, with no sexual reproduction evident, even though both mating types co-occur. However, within these clonal lineages I found evidence for frequent mitotic recombination (mitotic crossing over). This mechanism for producing genetic variation may explain phenotypic variation known to occur within the identified clonal lineages...|$|R
40|$|Preeclampsia is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of pregnancy, which presents risk to both the expectant mother and to the fetus. It affects 3 - 8 % of pregnancies, resolves only upon delivery, and is {{a major cause of}} preterm birth. The disease originates in the complex development of the placenta, and the immunological interplay between mother and fetus. The purpose of this Masters thesis was to implement a high resolution <b>nuclear</b> magnetic resonance <b>protocol</b> for examining urine and serum, in order to study the metabolic signatures of preeclampsia on the biofluids. Following this, a pilot study was carried out on samples from pregnant women with preeclampsia, pregnant women with normal pregnancies and nonpregnant women (controls). Possible discriminatory metabolites were considered. Metabolomic studies on preeclampsia could give insight into the disease pathogenesis, and may provide early predictors of preeclampsia in the future. For the method development, spot urine and venous blood samples were collected from women pregnant at gestational age 11 + 0 – 13 + 6. The samples were analyzed by 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopy and the resulting spectra studied for analytical reproducibility, effects of storage, and different collection and preparation methods. An assessment of the dieretic quantification method was done. For the pilot study, blood and spot urine samples from women with preeclampsia, and age- and gestational age-matched pregnant and nonpregnant controls were collected. The samples were analyzed by NMR and the spectra subjected to unsupervised and supervised multivariate analysis. The implementation of a protocol for NMR analysis of urine and serum samples gave well resolved and highly reproducible spectra. The pilot study showed differing metabolic profiles between women with preeclampsia, women with normal pregnancies and nonpregnant controls. In the spectra of urine samples, the glycine levels were responsible for a major part of discrimination. In the spectra of serum samples, the general lipid levels and the lipoprotein distribution contributed to the discrimination. Levels of very low density lipoproteins were higher in serum samples from women with preeclampsia than those with normal pregnancies. Statistical models predicted samples from women with preeclampsia with 85 – 95 % accuracy. NMR produces excellent quality spectra for use in metabolomics. Minimal pretreatment and fast analysis make the method useful for analyzing large quantities of samples. The multivariate methods were able to effectively discriminate between samples from healthy and preeclamtic women in both urine and serum spectra. The specific metabolites responsible for the discrimination were related to disease-specific processes. The NMR metabolomic method clearly has potential for diagnostic use, and possibly future predictive use in preeclampsia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Xerophyta viscosa Baker (family Velloziaceae) {{can survive}} {{extremes}} of dehydration (desiccation), down to 5 % relative water content (RWC) and resumes full physiological activity within 80 h of rehydration. A {{thorough understanding of}} this phenomenon may provide further insight into possible mechanisms for improving drought tolerance in other plants. In this respect a comprehensive analysis of the nuclear proteome of this plant and its response to dehydration stress at 35 % RWC was carried out. The RWC at 35 % represents a distinct phase of the dehydration process where induction of late protection mechanisms is initiated and is a characteristic of desiccation tolerant species. We optimized nuclei isolation and <b>nuclear</b> protein extraction <b>protocols</b> and successfully employed these protocols to isolate highly purified nuclei and subsequently nuclear proteins from fully hydrated and dehydrated X. viscosa leaf samples. The integrity of the purified nuclei was confirmed with light and fluorescent microscopy. The nuclei were uniform spheres, approximately 5 Î¼m in size. The purity and enrichment of the nuclear proteins were confirmed by chlorophyll assay and Western blot analysis. The nuclear proteins were investigated using two-dimensional (2 D) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technologies. Using the 2 DE approach, a total of 438 proteins spots were reproducibly detected and analysed of which 18 protein spots were shown to be up-regulated in response to dehydration. These proteins contained both regulatory and functional proteins. The largest category comprised five novel protein factors and two proteins with unassigned functions. The second category comprised proteins involved in gene regulation and signal transduction. The third category comprised stress responsive proteins with chaperone type activities. Other categories include proteins involved in energy metabolism, protein degradation and translation. These results demonstrate that dehydration was controlled by multiple genes within the plant nucleus and X. viscosa may possess its own specific nuclear proteins {{that are involved in}} desiccation stress. In addition we comprehensively analyzed the nuclear proteome of X. viscosa using iTRAQ with two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to complement the data obtained from the 2 DE approach. Using iTRAQ, we reproducibly University of Cape Town identified 128 proteins with confidence ¥ 95 % (Ï < 0. 05). Sixty six percent of the identified proteins showed consistent expression levels. The remaining 34 % proteins showed significant changes in expressions. Of the latter, 23 % were shown to be up regulated in response to dehydration stress. The remaining 11 % were shown to be down regulated. The nuclear proteins of X. viscosa up-regulated in response to dehydration stress showed a coordinated response involving both regulatory and functional proteins and were implicated in diverse cellular functions. The characteristic feature of the X. viscosa nuclear proteins is the high level of stress molecules among the dehydration responsive proteins with evident functions in defense mechanisms compared to down regulated proteins and proteins showing consistent expression levels. These results demonstrate that enhanced defense capacity is crucial to desiccation tolerance and strongly support the notion that late dehydration responsive proteins are involved in protection of the cellular structures during dehydration. Proteins showing consistent expression levels during dehydration most likely maintain the minimum viability in cells under all conditions or may be indirectly associated with desiccation tolerance. Down-regulated proteins are likely important for plant survival under normal growth conditions. The proteins up-regulated in response to dehydration stress were assumed to be associated directly with the acquisition of desiccation tolerance. The up-regulated proteins were further categorized into nine functional groups to gain more insight into their roles in desiccation tolerance. The largest group was shown to be involved in gene regulation and signal transduction (36 %), which reflects the role of the nucleus in gene expression and regulation. The second group included stress responsive molecules such as antioxidants, molecular chaperones and compatible solutes (33 %). This reflects the importance of strong defense systems in preventing lipid peroxidation, protein aggregation, membrane leakage and maintaining the integrity of cellular structures during dehydration and in the dried state. The third group contained proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (10 %). This might reflect the capacity of this plant to control the movement of molecules to and from the nucleus during dehydration and the importance of this process in adaptation to dehydration stress. The fourth group contained proteins involved in protein translation (7 %). Proteins categorized to other functions, include proteins with miscellaneous and unknown functions. Proteins with unknown functions were considered to be X. viscosa nuclear-specific proteins. There was good correlation between the up-regulated proteins identified by 2 -DE and iTRAQ approaches. In conclusion, this study revealed that X. viscosa nuclear proteome was responsive to dehydration stress and desiccation tolerance is University of Cape Town genetically encoded. Secondly, X. viscosa relies on readily inducible protection to combat desiccation and desiccation tolerance is controlled by multiple genes within the plant nucleus. Thirdly, the protective mechanisms of desiccation tolerance utilized by X. viscosa appear to involve signal perception genes and modulating gene expression of appropriate genes encoding protective molecules including antioxidants, molecular chaperones, compatible solutes, proteins of translation and degradation machinery, proteins with miscellaneous functions and novel protein factors. Lastly, proteins are crucial to desiccation tolerance allowing X. viscosa to possess a unique stress tolerance with versatile and coordinated actions to provide protection for its cellular structures during desiccation and in the dried state. To our best knowledge this is the first study to provide insight into the nuclear (organellar) proteome of a desiccation tolerant plant...|$|R
