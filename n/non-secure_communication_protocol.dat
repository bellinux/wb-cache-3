40|$|Abstract. Existing {{algorithms}} {{for regular}} inference (aka automata learning) allows to infer a {{finite state machine}} model of a system under test (SUT) by observing the output that the SUT produces in response to selected sequences of input. In this paper we present an approach using regular inference to construct models of <b>communication</b> <b>protocol</b> entities. Entities of <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> typically take input messages in the format of a protocol data unit (PDU) type together {{with a number of}} parameters and produce output of the same format. We assume that parameters from input can be stored in state variables of <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> for later use. A model of a <b>communication</b> <b>protocol</b> is usually structured into control states. Our goal is to infer symbolic extended finite state machine models of <b>communication</b> <b>protocol</b> entities with control states in the model that are similar to the control states in the <b>communication</b> <b>protocol.</b> In our approach, we first apply an existing regular inference algorithm to a <b>communication</b> <b>protocol</b> entity to generate a finite state machine model of the entity. Thereafter we fold the generated model into a symbolic extended finite state machine model with locations and state variables. We have applied parts of our approach to an executable specification of the Mobile Arts Advanced Mobile Location Center (A-MLC) protocol and evaluated the results. ...|$|R

40|$|Multicast group {{communication}} {{is a useful}} augmentation to CORBA both for fault-tolerant and highly available appli-cations and for groupware and cooperative work applica-tions. However, different multicast group <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> are appropriate in different environments, e. g., local area vs. wide area networks, and Internet vs. ATM. In this paper we present a multicast {{group communication}} en-gine and bridge for CORBA that allows different multicast group <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> to cooperate. The group communication engine places Lamport timestamps on mes-sages, and multicasts messages to object groups using one or more group <b>communication</b> <b>protocols.</b> The group <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> reliably deliver the timestamped messages in timestamp order to the group communication engine, which integrates these streams of messages into a single stream for delivery in timestamp order. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Group {{communication}} {{is a useful}} mechanism guaranteeing consistency among replicated objects. The existing approaches do not allow transparent plug-in of group <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> into CORBA. They either require modification of CORBA or OS, or provide no room for incorporating group <b>communication</b> transport <b>protocols</b> into CORBA. We thus propose a generic group communication framework that allows transparent plug-in of various group <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> with no modification of existing CORBA. We extend the Open Communications Interface (OCI) to support interoperability, reusability of existing group communication, and independency on ORB and OS. We also define the Group <b>Communication</b> Inter-ORB <b>Protocol</b> (GCIOP) as a group communication instantiation of the General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) that encapsulates underlying group <b>communication</b> <b>protocols.</b> The proposed scheme can be exploited for fault-tolerant CORBA (FT CORBA) ...|$|R
