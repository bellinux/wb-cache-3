In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee's recommendations proved to be <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>impossible</b> to implement {{in the face of}} defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922. On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff. Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. He attempted to maintain the Army's structure in the face of short-sighted politicians intent on cutting expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When conscription was abolished by Prime Minister James Scullin's government in 1929, it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.|$|E

Reform emerged with 60 Western seats and Official Opposition status, while the demoralized PCs emerged from the brink of oblivion with 20 Eastern seats and regained party status (a minimum of 12 seats is required for official party status in the Canadian House of Commons, allowing the party to have seats on parliamentary committees, guaranteed speaking time in the Commons, additional office space in the east and west blocks of Parliament, and multimillion-dollar federal funding for party research and staffing). More importantly, the Liberals emerged with only a five-seat majority in the election, and many pundits suggested that the combined PC and Reform votes would have been enough to unseat the Liberals or at least reduce them to minority status.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{conventional}} wisdom throughout {{the majority of}} the aviation industry was that manned flight at supersonic speeds, those in excess of the sound barrier, was <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>impossible,</b> mainly due to the apparently insurmountable issue of compressibility. During the 1930s, few researchers and aerospace engineers chose to explore the field of high speed fluid dynamics; notable pioneers in this area were the German aerospace engineer Adolf Busemann, British physicist Sir Geoffrey Taylor, and British engine designer Sir Stanley Hooker. While Germany gave considerable attention to exploring and implementing Busemann's theories on the swept wing and its role in drag-reduction during high speed flight, both Britain and the United States overlooked this research on the whole. It was only by 1944 that information regarding the rocket-propelled Messerschmitt Me 163 or the jet-propelled Me 262, both having been equipped with swept wings, did wider attitudes on its merits begin to change. Prior to this point, the British Air Ministry had already launched a research programme of its own.|$|E

Eliot said he found the view [...] "not convincing", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue [...] "what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs". Orwell let André Deutsch, who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and [...] "lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in Animal Farm."
