There are {{various types of}} combing machines here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb.

50|$|There are two {{competing}} combing technologies: the Noble (1853) comb (variants Lister, Heilman (1846) and Holden) and the French comb. The <b>Noble</b> <b>comb</b> technology is inefficient, hence most combing {{in the world}} is carried out on the French system. The French system is superior as it combs the entire length of a fiber. Noble combs suffer from the problem that they will not comb 2 mm of a fiber's length. The 2 mm is the distance between counter-rotating pins. The French system is a rectilinear combing system as opposed to earlier woollen systems developed in England. Although the Heilman and <b>Noble</b> <b>comb</b> was an original circular design (also developed in min and 18-19th-century England) as it happens in modern history, English mills didn't share technology - resulting in development of superior technology on continental Europe in the mid-19th century, as in France.|$|E

5000|$|Efforts {{were made}} by Bradford to study the {{mechanism}} of <b>noble</b> <b>combing</b> but they failed to produce tangible results. The <b>Noble</b> and French <b>combs</b> are now well understood technology thanks to work by CSIRO. After 1994, Sokolov has endeavored to improve combing performance in the rectilinear comb. Combing technology continues to develop: Sokolov and Kirby developed a theory for combing model, simulation software for combing and drive design in 1982. Current technology used in providing comb drive by introducing innovation on cam performance to deliver textile fiber needs and separate mechanical performance of the comb was developed by Sokolov. [...] The cam technology was an advance on century-old technology of cams by producing a subspecies of new cam design.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular <b>Noble</b> <b>combing</b> machine. [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|R
50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The <b>Noble</b> <b>comb</b> {{is an example of}} circular combing. The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Noble</b> <b>comb</b> is {{no longer}} used in worsted system as {{technology}} is inefficient. Noble combing may have uses for woollen system, or long fibers 250 mm+. The predominant technology for all fibers is the French comb system. A cotton comber is scaled and simplified mechanically version of a rectilinear comb relative to a mean fiber length (similar to Naismith comber). This scaled version of wool comb {{can be seen in}} stroke of the components used in a cotton comber. The scaled down has the purpose of accommodating fiber length and fiber physics requirements. The same scaled-up version of a comb {{can be seen in the}} way flax is combed.|$|E

This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
