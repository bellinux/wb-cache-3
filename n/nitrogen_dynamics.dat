40|$|To {{obtain an}} {{in-depth}} understanding of soil <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics,</b> {{it is necessary}} to quantify a variety of simultaneously occurring gross nitrogen transformation processes. In order to do so, most studies apply N- 15 in a disturbed soil-microbial-root system and quantify gross rates based on the principles of N- 15 isotope dilution. However, this approach has several shortcomings. First, studying disturbed soil provides only limited information on in situ soil <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Secondly, the analytical data analysis allows the quantification of total production and consumption rates of the labelled pool, but does not provide information on process-specific transformation rates. Combining in situ N- 15 isotope labelling over 1 - 2 weeks with numerical data analysis allows determining process-specific gross nitrogen transformations in undisturbed soils under field conditions in the presence of live roots and their associated microbial communities.

40|$|Recently a {{considerable}} amount of effort has been put into quantifying how interactions of the carbon and nitrogen cycle affect future terrestrial carbon sinks. Dynamic vegetation models, representing the nitrogen cycle with varying degree of complexity, have shown diverging constraints of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> on future carbon sequestration. In this study, we use LPJ-GUESS, a dynamic vegetation model employing a detailed individual- and patch-based representation of vegetation dynamics, to evaluate how population dynamics and resource competition between plant functional types, combined with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics,</b> have influenced the terrestrial carbon storage in the past and to investigate how terrestrial carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> might change in the future (1850 to 2100; one representative "business-as-usual" climate scenario). Single-factor model experiments of CO 2 fertilisation and climate change show generally similar directions of the responses of C–N interactions, compared to the C-only version of the model as documented in previous studies using other global models. Under an RCP 8. 5 scenario, nitrogen limitation suppresses potential CO 2 fertilisation, reducing the cumulative net ecosystem carbon uptake between 1850 and 2100 by 61 %, and soil warming-induced increase in nitrogen mineralisation reduces terrestrial carbon loss by 31 %. When environmental changes are considered conjointly, carbon sequestration is limited by <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> up to the present. However, during the 21 st century, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> induce a net increase in carbon sequestration, resulting in an overall larger carbon uptake of 17 % over the full period.

40|$|The {{effective}} management of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> {{is essential for}} cropping systems which have the double objective of achieving acceptable yields and minimizing environmental impact. The decisions to be made are both particularly complex and of great urgency to farmers, including all organic farmers, who rely on organic sources of nitrogen. Models can be useful means of providing {{a better understanding of}} the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> and of supporting decision-making at tactical and strategic levels. This paper presents a model that aims at providing support in the decision-making process based on a target-oriented description of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> in a cropping system. The NDICEA model describes soil water dynamics, nitrogen mineralization and inorganic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> in relation to weather and crop demand. Crop yields are put in to the model, resulting in a target-oriented modelling approach which is distinctive from most other models. Parameter calibration is an inherent component of the modelling philosophy and is geared to establishing plot-specific factors. Using both quantitative and visual performance indicators, and different ratios of calibration to validation data, we evaluate the performance of NDICEA based on three treatments obtained from the Müncheberg dataset. Based on a maximum of 3 years of data for calibration, the root mean square error (RMSE) was found to vary between 14 kg N ha¿ 1 and 37 kg N ha¿ 1, and in the majority of cases absolute prediction error was less than 20 kg N ha¿ 1.

40|$|We use a {{terrestrial}} carbon-nitrogen cycle {{component of}} the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM) to investigate the impacts of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> on regrowing secondary forests over the 20 th century. We further examine what the impacts of nitrogen deposition and land use change history are on terrestrial carbon uptake since preindustrial time. Our results suggest that global total net land use emissions for the 1990 s associated with changes in cropland, pastureland, and wood harvest are 1. 22 GtC/yr. Without considering the secondary forest regrowth, the estimated net global total land use emissions are 1. 58 GtC/yr or about 0. 36 GtC/yr higher than if secondary forest regrowth is considered. Results also show that without considering the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> and deposition, the estimated global total secondary forest sink for the 1990 s is 0. 90 GtC/yr or about 0. 54 GtC/yr higher than estimates that include the impacts of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> and deposition. Nitrogen deposition alone is responsible for about 0. 13 GtC/yr of the total secondary forest sink. While nitrogen is not a limiting nutrient in the intact primary forests in tropical regions, our study suggests that nitrogen becomes a limiting nutrient for regrowing secondary forests of the tropical regions, in particular Latin America and Tropical Africa. This is because land use change activities, especially wood harvest, removes large amounts of nitrogen from the system when slash is burnt or wood is removed for harvest. However, our model results show that carbon uptake is enhanced in the tropical secondary forests of the Indian region. We argue {{that this may be}} due to enhanced nitrogen mineralization and increased nitrogen availability following land use change in the Indian tropical forest ecosystems. Results also demonstrate that there is a significant amount of carbon accumulating in the Northern Hemisphere where most land use changes and forest regrowth has occurred in recent decades. This study indicates the significance of secondary forests to terrestrial carbon sinks, the importance of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> to the magnitude of secondary forests carbon uptake, and therefore the need to include both primary and secondary forests and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dynamics</b> in terrestrial ecosystem models...|$|E
