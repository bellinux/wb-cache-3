5|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (NAD) is a {{coenzyme}} {{found in}} all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide. <b>Nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD and NADH respectively.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. <b>Nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. <b>Nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> {{has several}} {{essential}} roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide,</b> {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E

40|$|Oxidation {{of reduced}} <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> {{is a common}} event for many {{biochemical}} reactions. However, its exploitation for ultrahigh-throughput screening purposes {{is not an easy}} task and is affected by various drawbacks. It is known that such nucleotides induce quenching on the fluorescence of several dyes and that this quenching disappears with oxidation of the nucleotide. We have made use of this property to develop an assay for high-throughput screening with NADH- and NADPH-dependent reductases. Full screening campaigns have been run with excellent assay quality parameters, and inter-esting hits have been identified. The method is amenable to miniaturization and allows easy identification of false positives without needing extra secondary assays. Although it is based on monitoring substrate consumption, it is demonstrated that the effect of fractional conversion on assay sensitivity is negligible.

40|$|Melinacidin, a new {{antibacterial}} agent, {{blocked the}} synthesis of nicotinic acid and its amide in Bacillus subtilis cells. The inhibitory activity of the agent was reversed by nicotinic acid, its amide, or <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides,</b> but not by l-kynurenine, l- 3 -hydroxykynurenine, l-hydroxyanthranilic acid, or quinolinic acid. These properties indicated that the antibiotic interferes with the conversion of quinolinic acid to nicotinate ribonucleotide by the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyl-transferase. However, the activity of a purified preparation of this enzyme derived from a Pseudomonas strain was not impaired by the antibiotic. This suggested that, in B. subtilis, melinacidin interferes with a reaction which occurs before the formation of quinolinic acid in the biosynthetic pathway leading to nicotinic acid. Failure of quinolinic acid to reverse melinacidin inhibition in B. subtilis cultures {{might be due to}} insufficient penetration of the cell membranes by quinolinate...|$|R
5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> {{are used in}} these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
5|$|In metabolism, <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> is {{involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then {{be used as a}} reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> {{have emerged}} as key signals of the {{cellular}} redox state. Yet the structural basis for allosteric gene regulation by the ratio of reduced NADH to oxidized NAD+ is poorly understood. A key sensor among Gram-positive bacteria, Rex represses alternative respiratory gene expression until a limited oxygen supply elevates the intracellular NADH:NAD+ ratio. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism for NADH/NAD+ sensing among Rex family members by determining structures of Thermus aquaticus Rex bound to (1) NAD+, (2) DNA operator, and (3) without ligand. Comparison with the Rex/NADH complex reveals that NADH releases Rex from the DNA site following a 40 ° closure between the dimeric subunits. Complementary site-directed mutagenesis experiments implicate highly conserved residues in NAD-responsive DNA-binding activity. These rare views of a redox sensor in action establish a means for slight differences in the nicotinamide charge, pucker, and orientation to signal the redox state of the cell...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium that alternates {{between two}} metabolically different developmental forms. We performed fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of the metabolic coenzymes, reduced <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> [NAD(P) H], by two-photon microscopy for separate analysis of host and pathogen metabolism during intracellular chlamydial infections.

An increase of the fluorescence lifetime of protein-bound NAD(P) H [t 2 -NAD(P) H] inside the chlamydial inclusion strongly correlated with enhanced metabolic activity of chlamydial reticulate bodies during the mid-phase of infection.

5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E

Kinetics of the intermediates during dark/light/dark transitions showed a light-induced interchange of 14 C between malate and aspartate, usually resulting in an accumulation of 14 C in malate and a decrease of it in aspartate. 14 C-Phosphoenolpyruvate also showed a marked decrease during illumination. Changes in other intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were relatively minor. The kinetic data have been analyzed using the Chance crossover theorem to locate control points during the dark/light/dark transitions. The major apparent control points are located at malate and isocitrate dehydrogenases, and less frequently at citrate synthase and fumarase.

40|$|Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (GAPDH) is {{a classical}} metabolic enzyme involved in energy production and {{plays a role}} in additional nuclear functions, including transcriptional control, recognition of misincorporated nucleotides in DNA and maintenance of telomere structure. Here, we show that the recombinant protein T. cruzi GAPDH (rTcGAPDH) binds single-stranded telomeric DNA. We demonstrate that the binding of GAPDH to telomeric DNA correlates with the balance between oxidized and reduced forms of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> (NAD+/NADH). We observed that GAPDH-telomere association and NAD+/NADH balance changed throughout the T. cruzi life cycle. For example, in replicative epimastigote forms of T. cruzi, which show similar intracellular concentrations of NAD+ and NADH, GAPDH binds to telomeric DNA in vivo and this binding activity is inhibited by exogenous NAD+. In contrast, in the T. cruzi non-proliferative trypomastigote forms, which show higher NAD+ concentration, GAPDH was absent from telomeres. In addition, NAD+ abolishes physical interaction between recombinant GAPDH and synthetic telomere oligonucleotide in a cell free system, mimicking exogenous NAD+ that reduces GAPDH-telomere interaction in vivo. We propose that the balance in the NAD+/NADH ratio during T. cruzi life cycle homeostatically regulates GAPDH telomere association, suggesting that in trypanosomes redox status locally modulates GAPDH association with telomeric DNA...|$|R

The <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> NAD and NADP consist of an ADP molecule with a ribose group and a nicotinamide moiety attached to the terminal phosphate.

Our results show that, at physiological concentrations, NAD and NADP interact with the nucleotide inhibitory site of Kir 6. 2 to inhibit Kir 6. 2 /SUR 1 currents.

Enzymes which have activities involving the reduction or oxidation of these dinucleotide cofactors, or which can be coupled to such enzymes, can be conveniently located in column ef?luents, with greater than 90 % of the effluent available for further use. Thus the time required for manual enzyme assay of individual fractions is eliminated. APPBRATUS The procedure was developed with the AutoAnalyzer (Technicon Instruments Corporation, Chauncy, N. Y.).

Interference of this branched-chain fatty acid with the oxidative metabolism of amino acids may have consequences for the downstream biosynthesis of essential cofactors. Objectives We aimed to evaluate the effect of VPA on amino acid and NAD(+) metabolism using targeted MS-based metabolite profiling. Methods Plasma samples from patients under chronic treatment with VPA were analyzed. VPA was administered to Wistar rats mimicking prolonged and acute treatment, the latter with two different doses. Plasma and liver samples were collected for targeted metabolomics studies using UPLC-MS/MS and GC-FID. Results Analysis of amino acids in rat plasma and liver and in human plasma demonstrated that drug intake is associated with a particularly significant drop in the levels of tryptophan, and increased levels of glycine and lysine. The lowered plasma tryptophan levels prompted us to study the intracellular content of tryptophan and various <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides.</b> A significant decrease of NAD(+) and NADP(+) was observed in the liver of rats after the single {{administration of}} VPA at two different doses, but not after repeated administration.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-opts hepatic lipid {{pathways}} to facilitate its pathogenesis. The virus alters cellular lipid biosynthesis and trafficking, and causes {{an accumulation of}} lipid droplets (LDs) that gives rise to hepatic steatosis. Little is known about how these changes are controlled at the molecular level, {{and how they are}} related to the underlying metabolic states of the infected cell. The HCV core protein has previously been shown to independently induce alterations in hepatic lipid homeostasis. Herein, we demonstrate, using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, that expression of domain 2 of the HCV core protein (D 2) fused to GFP is sufficient to induce an accumulation of larger lipid droplets (LDs) in the perinuclear region. Additionally, we performed fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous reduced <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotides</b> [NAD(P) H], a key coenzyme in cellular metabolic processes, to monitor changes in the cofactor’s abundance and conformational state in D 2 -GFP transfected cells. When expressed in Huh- 7 human hepatoma cells, we observed that the D 2 -GFP induced accumulation of LDs correlated with an increase in total NAD(P) H fluorescence and an increase in the ratio of free to bound NAD(P) H. This is consistent with an approximate 10 fold increase in cellular NAD(P) H levels. Furthermore, the lifetimes of bound and free NAD(P) H were both significantly reduced – indicating viral protein-induced alterations in the cofactors’ binding and microenvironment. Interestingly, the D 2 -expressing cells showed a more diffuse localization of NAD(P) H fluorescence signal, consistent with an accumulation of the co-factor outside the mitochondria. These observations suggest that HCV causes a shift of metabolic control away from the use of the coenzyme in mitochondrial electron transport and towards glycolysis, lipid biosynthesis, and building of new biomass. Overall, our findings demonstrate that HCV induced alterations in hepatic metabolism is tightly linked to alterations in NAD(P) H functional states...|$|R
