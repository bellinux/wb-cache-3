He {{arrives at the}} Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but <b>Ned</b> <b>and</b> his family get in their car and race off without him. Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly through his nose, causing Ned to yell at Homer. This alarms the congregation, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for <b>Ned</b> <b>and</b> convinces the congregation to give him another chance.

Bart and Todd agree that the competition is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, <b>Ned</b> <b>and</b> Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that plant diversity influences <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P cycles. However, the effect of plant diversity on complete ecosystem <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P budgets has not yet been assessed. For 20 plots of artificially established grassland mixtures differing in plant diversity, we determined <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P inputs by bulk and dry deposition <b>and</b> <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P losses by mowing (and subsequent removal of the biomass) and leaching from April 2003 to March 2004. Total deposition of <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P was 2. 3 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 2 +/- 0. 01 g m(- 2) yr(- 1), respectively. Mowing was the main <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P loss. The net <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P budgets were negative (- 6. 3 +/- 1. 1 g <b>N</b> <b>and</b> - 1. 9 +/- 0. 2 g P m(- 2) yr(- 1)). For N, this included a conservative estimate of atmospheric N- 2 fixation. Nitrogen losses as N 2 O were expected to be small at our study site (3 -N leaching from the canopy increased in the presence of grasses attributable to the decreased <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P demand of grass-containing mixtures.

40|$|Nitrogen (<b>N)</b> <b>and</b> {{phosphorus}} (P) {{are the two}} {{nutrients that}} cause the most concern with respect to environmental pollution from animal manure. Generally, higher concentrations of <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P in the ration result in their greater excretion in urine (<b>N)</b> <b>and</b> feces (<b>N</b> <b>and</b> P). Overfeeding these nutrients can be a significant problem, particularly if nutrient levels accumulate in the soil and contaminate water sources through leaching or surface runoff. Nitrogen can also volatilize as ammonia and pose a potential environmental problem with air emission standards, which are currently under review. Phosphorus does not volatilize and typically will stay attached to soil particles and saturation can occur.

40|$|The {{depletion}} of dry matter, <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P from seeds of Posidonia australis Hook. f. and Posidonia sinuosa Cambridge et Kuo during germination and seedling establishment is described. Seeds of both species showed {{essentially the same}} patterns of depletion, which resembled those of terrestrial plants. Seed reserves of <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P were retrieved with an apparent efficiency of ca. 95 %, and linear relationships existed between the loss of these nutrients and dry matter from seeds during {{the first nine months}} of seedling growth. The distribution of dry matter, <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P amongst plant parts of both species was very similar. Leaves were major sinks for <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P during the first two years of plant development. Leaves contained the highest concentrations of <b>N</b> <b>and</b> rhizomes the highest levels of P.

5|$|Martin drew much {{inspiration}} from actual history for the series, having several bookcases filled with medieval history {{for research and}} visiting historic European landmarks. For an American who speaks only English, the history of England proved the easiest source of medieval history for him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor. For example, <b>Ned</b> <b>and</b> Robb Stark resemble Richard, 3rd Duke of York and his son Edward IV, and Queen Cersei resembles both Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville. Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments, to have the facts at hand if needed during writing. The series was in particular influenced by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses, although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations. Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon, which are about the French monarchy in the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to <b>Ned</b> <b>and</b> Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General George Rogers Clark's {{invasion}} of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the Battle of Piqua on August 7. In October, when Boone was hunting with his brother Ned, Shawnees shot and killed Ned. Apparently thinking that they had killed Daniel Boone, the Shawnees beheaded <b>Ned</b> <b>and</b> took the head home as a trophy. In 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under Banastre Tarleton captured Boone and several other legislators near Charlottesville. The British released Boone on parole several days later. During Boone's term, Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky unabated. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the Battle of Blue Licks, in which his son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war.|$|E

40|$|We present {{estimates}} for nitrogen (<b>N)</b> <b>and</b> phosphorus (P) sewage inputs to 19 Indonesian rivers for 1970 – 2050. Future trends {{are based on}} the four scenarios of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Our results indicate a rapid increase in <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P pollution from sewage over time. In 1970, <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P inputs to rivers were low because not many households were connected to sewage systems discharging to rivers. Sewage connection is increasing over time.

40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} dynamics during leaf development, senescence, and decomposition of tall and dwarf {{forms of the}} red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle L., were studied in south Florida. Mature leaves of tall mangroves had significantly higher nitrogen (<b>N)</b> <b>and</b> phosphorus (P) concentrations than those of dwarf mangroves, which suggests that <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P are important factors associated with mangrove growth. Based on N:P ratios, both mangrove growth forms were P-limited, but dwarf mangroves were more so than tall mangroves. <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P were resorbed before leaf abscission {{as evidenced by the}} decrease in leaf <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P concentrations during leaf senescence. Mangroves showing indications of greater P-limitation had significantly higher phosphorus resorption efficiencies and proficiencies (PRE and PRP, respectively). PRP, however, was more sensitive to the molar N:P ratio and the phosphorus concentration of mature leaves than PRE. <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P immobilization was indicated by the gradual increase in leaf <b>N</b> <b>and</b> P concentrations during leaf decomposition.

The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed to be appropriate for a democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA that had occurred before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a non-governmental organization, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business).

After a while, Bart starts to enjoy being a member of the Junior Campers, which Homer mocks him relentlessly for. When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to go together but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so. Homer does not enjoy the experience, especially when he learns that he and Bart have to share a raft with <b>Ned</b> <b>and</b> his son, Rod. Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the wrong turn and find themselves lost at sea.

Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things.
