5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses,</b> while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>naming</b> <b>and</b> <b>addressing</b> for data {{networks}} {{is a fundamental}} architectural consideration, and several current or anticipated problems in the Internet – including mobility dynamics, forwarding table growth in the core routers, and security – point out possible limitations with <b>naming</b> <b>and</b> <b>addressing</b> schemes in use today. A seminar {{on the topic of}} <b>naming</b> <b>and</b> <b>addressing</b> for next generation internetworks was held at the Schloß Dagstuhl from October 29 to November 1, 2006. Researchers from different fields discussed their views and recent results pertaining to <b>naming</b> <b>and</b> <b>addressing</b> problems. Over twenty talks covered topics such as routing, naming components, APIs, mobility, delaytolerant architectures, flat routing and deployment issues. This article briefly summarizes the seminar presentations and discussions...|$|R
5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses</b> for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
5|$|To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns {{and passed the}} notes among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses</b> were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, short {{messages}} from {{prisoners of war}} were often read by studio announcers at stations in Germany, Japan, and other Axis powers countries. A number of shortwave listeners copied the prisoner <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses</b> and notified families by mail or telephone, and the practice became known as “Prisoner of War relay” or “POW monitoring". Although the Allied government provided similar services, the families usually heard from shortwave listeners first, sometimes as many as 100 at a time.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, former AAGPBL player June Peppas {{motivated}} a {{group of}} friends and began assembling a list of <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses</b> of her former pals. Her initiative turned into a newsletter and resulted in the league's first-ever reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. Stemming from that reunion, a Players Association was formed in 1987 and many former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1998. Regularly, English attended the reunions of the association and collaborated on many aspects of its purposes.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, a {{financial}} crunch {{meant that the}} station {{might be forced to}} close down. The St. Olaf senior class and local newspaper, The Northfield News, campaigned for donations. Money came in from across Minnesota and several nearby states. This made WCAL the first listener-supported station in the United States. From 1928-circa 1954, WCAL was entirely listener-supported and received no direct financial support from St. Olaf College. In 1949, the station's card file held the <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses</b> of over 60,000 donors. The station's AM signal was heard as far as the western United States, Mexico, Florida, Alaska and Canada.|$|E

25|$|Greece {{is ranked}} {{as the first}} country in the Balkans with most people who were awarded as Righteous Among the Nations. The Greek {{population}} was significantly active in hiding fellow Greeks of Jewish religion from the Nazi German forces during the Axis occupation of Greece. Even though Jews of Thessaloniki were easily deported from Thessaloniki, collaboration was minimal in capital Athens, where Nazi propaganda was not as effective, as the ancient Romaniote Jewish communities were well-integrated into the Orthodox Greek society and could not easily be singled out from the Christians, who in turn were more ready to resist the German authorities' demands. The Archbishop of Athens Damaskinos ordered his priests to ask their congregations to help the Jews and sent a strong-worded letter of protest to the collaborationist authorities and the Germans. Many Orthodox Christians risked their lives hiding Jews in their apartments and homes, despite threat of imprisonment. Even the Greek police ignored instructions to turn over Jews to the Germans. When Jewish community leaders appealed to Prime Minister Ioannis Rallis, he tried to alleviate their fears {{by saying that the}} Jews of Thessaloniki had been guilty of subversive activities and that this was the reason they were deported. At the same time, Elias Barzilai, the Grand Rabbi of Athens, was summoned to the Department of Jewish Affairs and told to submit a list of <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses</b> of members of the Jewish community. Instead he destroyed the community records, thus saving the lives of thousands of Athenian Jews. He advised the Jews of Athens to flee or go into hiding. A few days later, the Rabbi himself was spirited out of the city by EAM-ELAS fighters and joined the resistance. EAM-ELAS helped hundreds of Jews escape and survive (especially officer Stefanos Sarafis), many of whom stayed with the resistance as fighters and/or interpreters.|$|E
