25|$|<b>Nautical</b> <b>etiquette</b> {{requires}} that merchant vessels dip their ensigns in salute to passing warships, which acknowledge the salute by dipping their ensigns in return. Contrary {{to popular belief}} the United States Navy does dip the Stars and Stripes in acknowledgement of salutes rendered to it.

25|$|The rank flag or {{distinguishing}} flag is {{the flag}} flown by a superior officer on his flagship or headquarters (hence the term flagship). The origins {{of this are}} from the era before radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony, when orders were given by flag signals. The flag denotes the ship which must be watched for signals designating orders. Such flags are also flown when leaders of the government (presidents, prime ministers or defense secretaries) are aboard Navy ships, showing the ship to hold the headquarters of highest level of authority for the Armed Forces. Today, with the progress in communications, this flag indicates the obligation of the other Naval vessels to pay the relevant honours (Manning the rails, firing cannon salute, attention, etc.) according to <b>nautical</b> <b>etiquette.</b> In a group of naval ships all commanded by superior officers, only {{the commander of the}} group or the officer of the highest rank can fly his flag.|$|E
6000|$|... "Luff!" [...] {{called out}} the Skimmer, so quickly as {{to show that}} he took the {{movements}} of the cruiser for his guide. The ship came closer to the wind, but the sudden bend in the stream no longer permitted her to steer in a direct line with its course. Though drifting to windward with vast rapidity, her way through the water, which was greatly increased by the contrary actions of the wind and tide, caused the cruiser to shoot across the current; while a reef, over which the water madly tumbled, lay immediately in her course. The danger seemed too imminent for the observances of <b>nautical</b> <b>etiquette,</b> and Trysail railed aloud that the ship must be thrown aback, or she was lost.|$|E
