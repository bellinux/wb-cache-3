40|$|Some locally {{consumed}} fruits, sugarcane and wines sold in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, {{were investigated}} for their phenol content and antioxidant {{potential of the}} methanolic extracts {{with a view of}} exploring the health-promoting effect of the fruits and wines. The total phenolic content in each fruit and wines was determined spectrophotometrically according to Folin-Ciocalteu method and calculated as Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE) while the antioxidant properties of some of the fruits were estimated by the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryhydrazyl method (DPPH). The results obtained showed the highest phenolic content in red grape (1. 129 ± 0. 073 mgGAE/ml) and the lowest in sugar cane (0. 160 ± 0. 003 mg/GAE/ml). The wines also varied in their phenolic contents with Baron D ’ Romeo Red wine (0. 306 ± 0. 014 mgGAE/ml) having the highest phenolic content for the alcoholic wines class and Eva of Spain (0. 132 ± 0. 002 mgGAE/ml) had the highest phenolic content in the non-alcoholic group. The results also showed that the phenolic content of the alcoholic was greater than that found in the <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>wines.</b> On the other hand, the antioxidant properties determined in red grape, banana, sweet orange, apple and watermelons showed a change in colour from purple to light yellow instantly in all the fruits except water melon. The study concluded that the fruits are valuable sources of natural phenolic antioxidants which are known to have health promoting properties. Also, that <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>wines</b> should be improved upon by inclusion of fruits known to contain antioxidant potentials...|$|E

40|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} frequently ensues {{during the}} climacteric due to hormonal and metabolic changes. Non-pharmacological interventions such as lifestyle and dietary modifications are emerging as valuable strategies {{to counteract the}} cardiovascular consequences of ageing. A number of chemical components of wine, including alcohol and some polyphenols, {{are known to be}} active on the vessels. However, the molecular mechanisms through which they modulate endothelial function are largely unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>wine</b> fractions from five different wines on the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) via the expression and enzymatic activation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human endothelial cells. All non-alcoholic fractions studied increased NO synthesis, although with different potencies. All wine extracts maximally enhanced NO production at doses in the range achieved with a moderate wine intake, with decreasing effects with further increases of the dose. Interestingly, a part of these actions was recruited via estrogen receptors (ERs). Within the polyphenols with known binding activity for ERs contained in the tested wines, resveratrol, epicatechin, syringic acid, apigenin, malvidin and ellagic acid were largely responsible for eNOS activation. These findings show that some of the <b>non-alcoholic</b> components of <b>wine</b> enhance the production of NO by the vessels acting on ERs, and suggest that a moderate intake of wine may benefit the cardiovascular system through estrogen-like effects...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Having an {{identity}} as a ‘drinker’ {{has been linked to}} increased alcohol-related harm, self-reported consumption and self-reported intention to engage in risky drinking behavior. These effects have been observed when identities have been measured using explicit measures (e. g. via questionnaires) and implicitly (e. g. using Implicit Association Tests [IATs] adapted to measure identity). Little research has used actual behavioral measures to measure alcohol consumption in-the-moment, nor compared the effects of implicit and explicit identities directly. Methods: Participants' (n =  40) implicit and explicit identities associated with being a drinker were measured. Attitudes towards one's own drinking were measured explicitly. Participants completed a Pouring Taste Preference Task [PTPT] involving the consumption and rating of <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>wine.</b> This provided a behavioral measure of intention (pouring), a behavioral measure of consumption and a measure of the implementation of intention into behavior. Results: Results showed an interactive effect of implicit and explicit identities on attitudes and behavior. Explicit identities predicted attitudes towards drinking, but not behavior. Neither identity predicted the amount poured. Implicit identities predicted the amount consumed. A greater proportion of wine poured was predicted by higher implicit identities when explicit identities were absent. Conclusion: These results suggest that explicit identities may be associated more with those beliefs about drinking that one is aware of than behavioral intention. In addition, explicit identities may not predict behavioral enactment well. Implicit identity shows effects on actual behavior and not behavioral intention. Together this highlights the differential influence of reflective (explicit) and impulsive (implicit) identity in-the-moment behavior...|$|R

Blood samples were collected 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 h after beverage consumption. Baseline and radiation-induced genome damage was measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and total plasma catechin concentration was measured. Consumption of de-alcoholized red wine significantly decreased the gamma radiation-induced DNA damage at 1 and 2 h post-consumption by 20 %. In contrast alcohol tended to increase radiation-induced genome damage and complete wine protected against radiation-induced genome damage relative to alcohol. The observed effects were only weakly correlated with the concentration of total plasma catechin (R=- 0. 23). These preliminary data suggest that only the non-alcoholic fraction of red wine protects DNA from oxidative damage but this effect cannot be explained solely by plasma catechin...|$|R

40|$|How the Eucharist’s motive of communion in {{combination}} with Lögstrup’s ethics could motivate a <b>non-alcoholic</b> sacramental <b>wine</b> in the Church of Sweden. The purpose of this essay is to illuminate the meeting between the person who gives out bread and wine in the Eucharist {{and the person who}} receives the wine, from tree perspectives: the communion in the Eucharist, the ethical demand of K. E. Lögstrup, and today’s knowledge of alcohol and it’s negative effects on the human being. I want to study how these three perspectives can affect the interpersonal meeting in the Eucharist when it comes to giving out alcoholic wine, and to investigate if Lögstrups ethical demand could be used by the Church of Sweden when to decide about a sacramental wine with or without alcohol. I have started to study K. E Lögstrup and his theory about the ethical demand, and then researched the Eucharist in the Church of Sweden and the results of recent sociological and medical research of alcohol’s effect on the individual and on society. This has been done through relevant literature studies. The motive of communion in the Eucharist has become more prominent in the 20 th century and this has brought on questions of ethical standpoints. Many people today think of the Eucharist as communion and meeting and that it results in actions of love towards my neighbour. According to Lögstrup and his theory about the ethical demand, the individual shall be unselfish and sacrifice his own gaining. Not to get happy, but because life is a gift to the individual and to the neighbour, and the individual has the neighbour’s life in his hand. When studying the meeting between the individual and the neighbour in the Eucharist with the eyes of Lögstrup and his demand, my conclusion is {{that it is hard to}} practice Lögstrup’s ethical demand in this particular interpersonal situation, but if the Church of Sweden is put in the individual’s place then the concern about the vulnerable must be considered before the church’s own expectations...|$|R

40|$|Background: Prior {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} individuals who consume alcohol show diminished inhibitory control towards alcohol-related cues. However, such research contrasts predominantly alcoholic appetitive cues with non-alcoholic, non-appetitive cues. As such, {{it is not clear}} whether it is specifically the alcoholic nature of the cues that influences impairments in inhibitory control or whether more general appetitive processes are at play. Aims: The current study examined the hitherto untested assertion that the disinhibiting effects of alcohol-related stimuli might generalise to other appetitive stimuli, but not to non-appetitive stimuli. Method: Fifty-nine participants (Mage = 21. 63, SD = 5. 85) completed a modified version of the Stop Signal Task, which exposed them to visual stimuli of three types of liquid: Alcoholic appetitive (e. g., <b>wine),</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> appetitive (e. g., water) and non-appetitive (e. g., washing-up liquid). Results: Consistent with predictions, Stop-signal reaction time was significantly longer for appetitive (alcoholic, non-alcoholic) compared to non-appetitive stimuli. Participants were also faster and less error-prone when responding to appetitive relative to non-appetitive stimuli on go-trials. There were no apparent differences in stop signal reaction times between alcoholic and non-alcoholic appetitive products. Conclusions: These findings suggest that decreases in inhibitory control in response to alcohol-related cues might generalise to other appetitive liquids, possibly due to evaluative conditioning. Implications for existing research methodologies and intervention approaches are discussed, with particular focus on the use of appetitive control conditions within tests of alcohol-related inhibitory control...|$|R
40|$|Wine {{and olive}} oil, {{essential}} {{components of the}} Mediterranean diet, are considered important factors for a healthy life style. Tyrosol (T) and caffeic acid (CA) are found in both {{extra virgin olive oil}} and in white wine. Three white wines from the northeast Italy and four white wines from Germany were analyzed for their content of T and CA. These compounds were tested for their antioxidant activity and their capacity to modulate three different cytokines: IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and TNF-alpha, which are currently considered to be the major cytokines influencing the acute phase of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of T and CA was analyzed by monitoring the oxidation of a redox-sensitive probe by using laser scanning confocal microscopy. T and CA, applied at nano molar range, were found to significantly reduce the generation of oxidants induced by azobis-amidinopropanedihydrochloride. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers were incubated at 37 degreesC for 12 hours with 100 ng LPS (E. coli and P. maltofilia). Increasing doses of T and CA (150 nM to 300 muM) were added and cell-associated IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha were determined by immunoreactive tests after three freeze-thaw cycles. IL- 6 release was also determined in cell surnatants. LPS-stimulated PBMC showed a significant increase in cytokine release, while T and CA, used at nanomolar concentrations, were able to modulate their expression.

Anthocyanidin intake and their food sources for 36   037 subjects, aged between 35 and 74 years, in twenty-seven redefined centres were obtained using standardised 24  h dietary recall software (EPIC-SOFT). An ad hoc food composition database on anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin) was compiled using data from the US Department of Agriculture and Phenol-Explorer databases and was expanded by adding recipes, estimated values and cooking factors. For men, the total anthocyanidin mean intake ranged from 19 · 83 (se 1 · 53) mg/d (Bilthoven, The Netherlands) to 64 · 88 (se 1 · 86) mg/d (Turin, Italy), whereas for women the range was 18 · 73 (se 2 · 80) mg/d (Granada, Spain) to 44 · 08 (se 2 · 45) mg/d (Turin, Italy). A clear south to north gradient intake was observed. Cyanidins and malvidins were the main anthocynidin contributors depending on the region and sex.

40|$|In their survey/study - Adult Alternatives for Social Drinking: A Direction - by John Dienhart and Sandra Strick, Assistant Professors, Department of Restaurant, Hotel and Institutional Management, Purdue University, Dienhart and Strick begin with: “Changes in {{consumer}} habits have {{brought about a}} change in the business of selling alcoholic drinks and have impacted upon hotel food and beverage operations. The authors surveyed a sample of hotel corporate food and beverage directors to ascertain how they are handling this challenge. ” Dienhart and Strick declare that the alcoholic beverage market, sale and consumption thereof, has taken a bit of a hit in contemporary society. “Even to the casual observer, it 2 ̆ 7 s obvious that the bar and beverage industry has undergone a great deal of change in the past few years,” say the authors. “Observations include {{a change in the}} types of drinks people are ordering, as well as a {{decrease in the number of}} drinks being sold,” they qualify. Dienhart and Strick allude to an increase in the federal excise tax, attacks from alcohol awareness groups, the diminished capacity of bars and restaurants to offer happy hours, increased liability insurance premiums as well as third-party liability issues, and people’s awareness of their own mortality as some of the reasons for the change. To quantify some empirical data on beverage consumption the Restaurant, Hotel, and Institutional Management Department of Purdue University conducted a study “… to determine if observed trends could be documented with hard data. ” In regards to the subject, the study asks and answers a lot of interesting questions with the results presented to concerned followers via percentages. Typical of the results are: “When asked whether the corporation experienced a change in alcoholic sales in the past year, 67 percent reported a decrease in the amount of alcohol sold. ” “Sixty-two percent of the respondents reported an increase in non-alcoholic sales over the past year. The average size of the increase was 8 percent. What Dienhart and Strick observe is that the decrease in alcoholic beverage consumption has resulted in a net increase for non-alcoholic beverage consumption. What are termed specialty drinks are gaining a foothold in the market, say the authors. “These include traditional cocktails made with alcohol-free products, as well as creative new juice based drinks, cream based drinks, carbonated beverages, and heated drinks,” say Dienhart and Strick by way of citation. Another result of the non-alcoholic consumption trend is the emergence of some novel marketing approaches by beer, wine, and spirits producers, including price increases on their alcohol based beverages as well as the introduction of faux alcoholic drinks like <b>non-alcoholic</b> beer and <b>wine.</b> Who or what is the big winner in all of this?
