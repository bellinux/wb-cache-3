5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> pairing choice by black hens.|$|E
