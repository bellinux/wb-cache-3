50|$|The <b>narrownose</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> (Mustelus schmitti) is a houndshark of {{the family}} Triakidae. It is found on the {{continental}} shelves of the subtropical southwest Atlantic, from southern Brazil to northern Argentina, between latitudes 30° S and 44° S, at depths between 60 m to 195 m. It can reach a length of 74 centimeters.|$|E
50|$|Protected species {{include the}} Starfish species Asterina stellifera, Astropecten brasiliensis, Astropecten marginatus, Coscinasterias tenuispina, Narcissia trigonaria and Oreaster reticulatus,loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), {{green sea turtle}} (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), {{olive ridley sea turtle}} (Lepidochelys olivacea), {{southern}} right whale (Eubalaena australis), La Plata dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), <b>narrownose</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> (Mustelus schmitti), Tube-dwelling anemone Cerianthomorphe brasiliensis,neon goby Elacatinus figaro,slate pencil urchin Eucidaris tribuloides,sea cucumber Isostichopus badionotus,decapod Minyocerus angustus,sea urchin Paracentrotus gaimardi,white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) and black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris).|$|E
50|$|<b>Narrownose</b> <b>smooth-hounds</b> feed on {{crabs and}} {{probably}} other crustaceans, and presumably small fishes. <b>Narrownose</b> <b>smooth-hounds</b> are also caught and utilized for human consumption.|$|R
50|$|The {{speckled}} smooth-hound {{is found}} off the Pacific coast of South America, including the Galapagos Islands and the Juan Fernández Islands. Its range {{extends from the}} Isla Lobos de Tierra in Peru to {{the southern tip of}} Chile. It is a demersal fish and swims close to the seabed on the continental shelf at depths of between 16 and 50 m. Reports of this fish occurring in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Argentina are thought to be erroneous, and are likely to refer to the <b>narrownose</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> (Mustelus schmitti), another shark that is speckled with white spots.|$|E
40|$|Artisanal {{fisheries}} in Uruguay involve {{directly or indirectly}} more than 5000 people and constitute {{the main source of}} income in several coastal communities. However, and despite its economic and environmental importance, this activity is poorly documented. As such, this scarcity of information constrains the understanding and effective management of artisanal fisheries. This study aims to characterize different strategies of marine artisanal fisheries on the Uruguayan Atlantic coast and describe the spatial distribution of fishing effort. Based on a Principal Components Analysis we identified four fishing strategies targeting different species (mainly whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furniert, <b>narrownose</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> shark Mustelus spp., angel shark Squatina spp. and Brazilian codling Urophycis brasiliensis), exhibiting different seasonal patterns and fishing gear usage. Finally, the above outlined strategies showed differences in spatial utilization of the fishing area. Our results provide a spatially explicit framework for the management of Uruguayan marine artisanal fisheries...|$|E
