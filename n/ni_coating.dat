40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringIn {{secondary}} {{system of}} pressurized water reactors (PWRs), carbon steel undergoes severe corrosion owing to high temperature and pressure, and fast flow velocity. These circumstance, named as flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC), induces corrosion and eventually failure of power piping. Flow velocity brings about destruction of oxide layer by electrochemical corrosion and mechanical shear stress at the oxide/water interfaces. The piping {{system in the}} secondary circuit of PWRs mainly consists of carbon steels being vulnerable to FAC because Fe, main element of carbon steel, forms Fe 3 O 4 dissolved to secondary water system by changing to Fe ion. To mitigate corrosion of carbon steel, chemical and mechanical treatments to carbon steel or changing secondary water chemistry has been widely studied. Addition of Cr and/or Mo to carbon steel components {{is one of the}} adequate countermeasure to mitigate FAC by anodic passivation. Mechanical treatments are controlling surface roughness because reducing surface roughness can decrease flow turbulence at the oxide/water interface. Increasing pH, dissolved oxygen contents, and addition of advanced corrosion inhibitor to secondary system can decrease corrosion rate of carbon steels. However, maintaining homogeneous chemistry condition of water is hardly possible and changing chemical composition of carbon steel needs not only research of corrosion properties but also other mechanical properties. In contrast, application of coatings to the steel surface can be easily applied to the secondary system. Therefore, thermal spray to steel surface using less corrosive metal is widely used. Among them, cold spray has advantage with lower process temperature than that of other spray coatings which leads to low residual stress and oxidation or decarburization of coating. In this study, tungsten carbide (WC) and nickel (Ni) particles are used as feedstock materials for the coating. WC exhibits high corrosion resistance in acidic aqueous media due to the phase stability. Moreover, the oxidation resistance of WC in O 2 containing atmosphere at high temperature is applied to industry which is exposed to severe corrosive environments However, in alkaline solution, the dissolution of WC increases by forming WO 4 -. Moreover, high melting temperature and poor plastic deformation make cold spray coating difficult. To suppress the corrosion of and increase the deposition efficiency of the coating, Ni, which has better plastic deformation and lower corrosion potential and melting temperature than WC, is used as a binder metal. Ni acts like a sacrificial metal to WC so corrosion and oxidation of Ni occur before those of WC. To evaluate the potential of the coating as an effective corrosion barrier, series of corrosion tests at simulated secondary water chemistry is carried out and quantitative analysis is conducted. Surface and cross-section morphologies of the coatings before and after FAC simulation tests is investigated by scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. Electrochemical experiments are carried out for quantitative analysis. Cold spray coatings using WC- 10 Ni with different Ni contents have rough and porous surface but significant changes of surface is not observed by SEM image. However, lower current density is measured at 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> than carbon steel, P 22, 20 Ni and 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> from potentiodynamic polarization experiments in pH 9. 3 ETA solution at room temperature. After 2 weeks FAC experiments, weight loss of coating is increased with increases Ni contents in coating but weight of 20 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> is increased. On the other hands, weight loss occurs at 20 Ni and 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> and weight of 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> is increased after 4 weeks FAC experiments. Although weight change of coatings is smaller than carbon steel after 2 weeks and 4 weeks FAC experiments, weight change of 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> shows better corrosion performance than P 22 comparing with 20 Ni and 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating.</b> As a result, Ni has lower corrosion potential than WC and it induces galvanic corrosion of Ni and prevents WC corrosion or oxidation at early stage of corrosion process. Moreover, oxidation product of Ni, Ni(OH) 2 is dissolved into water by Ni ion because of poor thermal stability of Ni(OH) ¬ 2. Therefore, high Ni contents in coating increases weight loss during the early stages by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. However, after 4 weeks of immersion, WC oxidizes and transforms into WO 3 increasingly which is influenced by Ni contents. 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> induces continuous weight loss during FAC simulation because of low WC contents which means weight gain by WO 3 formation is smaller than weight loss by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. Therefore, weight loss occurs at 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating.</b> Contrarily, 20 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> do not protect WC dissolution after 2 weeks because the absence of Ni and Ni(OH) 2. accelerates WC oxidation and WO 3 dissolution to water. To be concluded, WC- 10 Ni + 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> specimens exhibit the best corrosion resistive performance, the lower corrosion current density and the small weight change than other coatings. Therefore, WC- 10 Ni + 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> is possibly suggested to one of the option to mitigate corrosion of carbon steels. ope...|$|E

It is shown that during the coating deposition and thermal annealing the irreversible increase in the electrical resistance by the value from tenth parts to a few Ohms is observed. This {{is caused by the}} diffusion processes of coating atoms on the grain boundaries of base layers...|$|E
40|$|NiSi/SiC {{core-shell}} nanorods and {{nanowires grown}} on nickel (<b>Ni)</b> <b>coated</b> glass substrates by hot-wire {{chemical vapour deposition}} were studied. The Ni {{was used as a}} catalyst to induce the growth of these core-shell nanorods and nanowires. These nanorods and nanowires were growth at different deposition pressures in the range between 1 and 3 mbar. Increase in deposition pressure prefers to the growth of the nanowires at 3 mbar. These nanowires consisted of single crystalline NiSi and amorphous SiC attributed to core and shell of the nanowires respectively. Moreover, an increase in deposition pressure induces a phase transition of the nanowires from crystalline Si phase to amorphous SiC phase. The shell of the nanowires showed presence of 3 C-SiC nano-crystallites embedded within an amorphous matrix. Presence of these nano-crystallites embedded within the amorphous SiC matrix exhibits broad PL emission spectra in visible region. The effects of the deposition pressure on the growth and structural properties of these core-shell nanowires are discussed.

40|$|The use of soft X rays {{near the}} carbon edge of {{absorption}} 270 300 eV greatly enhances studies in various branches of science. However, {{the choice of}} reflecting coatings for mirrors operating in free electron and X ray free electron laser FEL and XFEL beamlines in this spectral range is not so evident and experimental justifications of the mirror efficiency are rather limited. In the present paper it is demonstrated experimentally that the reflectivity of B 4 C and <b>Ni</b> <b>coated</b> grazing incidence mirrors is high enough for their operation in FEL or XFEL beamlines near the carbon K edge of absorption. The minimal reflectivity of both mirrors proves to exceed 80 near the carbon absorption edge at a grazing angle of 0. 6. An in depth profile of the chemical elements composing the reflecting coatings is reconstructed based on analysis {{of a set of}} reflectivity curves measured versus the grazing angle at different photon energies in the soft X ray spectral region. This allows us to predict correctly the mirror reflectivity at any X ray energy and any grazing angl...|$|R
40|$|SBA- 15 {{materials}} were synthesized through the hydrothermal method. The SBA- 15 prepared at the hydrothermal time of 24 h possessed a higher surface {{area and a}} good hexagonal structure, so it {{was used as the}} catalytic support in this experiment. The base metals (Cu, Co, <b>Ni)</b> <b>coated</b> on SBA- 15 were prepared for toluene removal. The results revealed that the catalytic activity of Cu/SBA- 15 for toluene removal was about 70 % at 250 degrees C, which was the best among the three catalysts. The modification of Cu/SBA- 15 by adding different transition metals (Ce, Co, Ni, Mn) to improve the removal efficiency of toluene and NO was also investigated in this study. The results indicate that the catalytic activity of Mn-Cu/SBA- 15 for toluene removal was about 100 % at 250 degrees C. The toluene as a reductant on the removal of NO was also determined. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of Mn-Cu/SBA- 15 for NO removal can reach about 70 % at 300 degrees C when toluene is used as reductant...|$|R
