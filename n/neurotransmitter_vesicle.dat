Two kinds of <b>neurotransmitter</b> <b>vesicles</b> exist: large dense core vesicles and small clear core vesicles. Large dense core vesicles contain neuropeptides and large neurotransmitters that are created in the cell body of the neuron and then transported via fast axonal transport down to the axon terminal. Small clear core vesicles transport small molecule neurotransmitters that are synthesized locally in the presynaptic terminals. Finalized <b>neurotransmitter</b> <b>vesicles</b> are bound to the presynaptic membrane.

40|$|The Tagging/Retagging {{model of}} {{short term memory}} was {{introduced}} earlier (1) to explain the linear relationship that exists between response time and correct response probability for word recall and recognition: At the initial stimulus presentation displayed words are tagged by creating a set of neurons in an excitation equilibrium which is the particular brainâs âdefinition â of the word. This tagging level drops logarithmically with time to 50 % after 14 seconds and to 20 % after 220 seconds.

40|$|Depletion of {{synaptic}} neurotransmitter vesicles induces a form {{of short}} term depression in synapses throughout the nervous system. This plasticity affects how synapses filter presynaptic spike trains. The filtering properties of short term depression are often studied using a deterministic synapse model that predicts the mean synaptic response to a presynaptic spike train, but ignores variability introduced by the probabilistic nature of vesicle release and stochasticity in synaptic recovery time. We show that this additional variability has important consequences for the synaptic filtering of presynaptic information. In particular, a synapse model with stochastic vesicle dynamics suppresses information encoded at lower frequencies more than information encoded at higher frequencies, while a model that ignores this stochasticity transfers information encoded at any frequency equally well. This {{distinction between the two}} models persists even when large numbers of synaptic contacts are considered.

Neurons aging under stress conditions, showing aging hallmarks, are the most susceptible to amyloid binding and show the largest decrease in membrane stiffness upon AÎ² treatment.

40|$|The way the {{cerebellar}} {{granular layer}} transforms incoming mossy fiber signals into new spike patterns {{to be related}} to Purkinje cells is not yet clear. Here, a realistic computational model of the granular layer was developed and used to address four main functional hypotheses: center-surround organization, time-windowing, high-pass filtering in responses to spike bursts and coherent oscillations in response to diffuse random activity. The model network was activated using patterns inspired by those recorded in vivo. Burst stimulation of a small mossy fiber bundle resulted in granule cell bursts delimited in time (time windowing) and space (center-surround) by network inhibition. This burstâburst transmission showed marked frequency-dependence configuring a high-pass filter with cut-off frequency around 100 [*]Hz. The contrast between center and surround properties was regulated by the excitatoryâinhibitory balance. The stronger excitation made the center more responsive to 10 â 50 [*]Hz input frequencies and enhanced the granule cell output (with spikes occurring earlier and with higher frequency and number) compared to the surround. Finally, over a certain level of mossy fiber background activity, the circuit generated coherent oscillations in the theta-frequency band. All these processes were fine-tuned by NMDA and GABA-A receptor activation and <b>neurotransmitter</b> <b>vesicle</b> cycling in the cerebellar glomeruli. This model shows that available knowledge on cellular mechanisms is sufficient to unify the main functional hypotheses on the cerebellum granular layer and suggests that this network can behave as an adaptable spatio-temporal filter coordinated by theta-frequency oscillations...|$|E

This leads to a deficiency in vesicle transport and storage, which affects <b>neurotransmitter</b> <b>vesicle</b> turnover and release in the central nervous system. Since the genomic sequence of the Ap 3 d 1 gene of mocha mouse is not known, precise mapping of the deletion as well as reliable genotyping protocols are lacking. Findings We sequenced the Ap 3 d 1 gene (HGNC GeneID: 8943) around the deletion site in the mocha mouse and revealed a 10639 bp deletion covering exon 2 to 6. Subsequently, new PCR primers were designed yielding a reliable genotyping protocol of both newborn and adult tissue. To examine the genotypes further, hippocampal neurons were cultured from mocha and control mice. Patch-clamp recordings showed that mocha neurons had a higher input resistance, and that autaptic EPSC in mocha cultures depressed faster and stronger as compared with control cultures. Conclusion Our study reports the sequence of the deleted part of the Ap 3 d 1 gene in mocha mice, {{as well as a}} reliable PCR-based genotyping protocol. We cultured hippocampal neurons from control and mocha mice, and found a difference in input resistance of the neurons, and in the synaptic short-term plasticity of glutamatergic autapses showing a larger synaptic depression than controls. The described procedures may be useful for the future utilization of the mocha mouse as a model of defective vesicle biogenesis. Importantly, as genotyping by eye color is complicated in newborn mice, the designed protocol is so fast and reliable that newborn mice could rapidly be genotyped and hippocampal neurons dissociated and cultured, which is normally best done at P 0 -P 2. </p...|$|E
