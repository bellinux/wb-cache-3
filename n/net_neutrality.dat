40|$|International audienceWe study a {{microfluidic}} flow model where {{the movement of}} several charged species is coupled with electric field and the motion of ambient fluid. The main numerical difficulty in this model is the <b>net</b> charge <b>neutrality</b> assumption which makes the system essentially overdetermined. Hence we propose to use the involutive and the associated augmented form of the system in numerical computations. Numerical experiments on electrophoresis and stacking show that the completed system significantly improves electroneutrality constraint conservation and recovers analytical results while a direct implementation of the initial model fails...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} pH {{can also be}} {{explained}} in terms of pHpzc of the biosorbent. The pHPZC is an important characteristic for adsorbents to determine the pH at which the surface has <b>net</b> electrical <b>neutrality.</b> The initial pH of each solution was adjusted with 0.1  M HCl and NaOH. At pH < PZC, the surface charge of the adsorbents is positive which results in low As(III) sorption. At pH > PZC, the surface charge of the adsorbents is negative and the As(III) ions in solution were attracted to the surface to a greater extent. The PZC value of the ZnO nanorods is found to be 6.5.|$|R

25|$|On 23 April 2014, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was {{reported}} to be considering a new rule that will permit ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier <b>net</b> <b>neutrality</b> position. A possible solution to <b>net</b> <b>neutrality</b> concerns may be municipal broadband, according to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, permit fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving <b>net</b> <b>neutrality.</b> On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve <b>net</b> <b>neutrality.</b> On 16 January 2015, Republicans presented legislation, {{in the form of a}} U.S. Congress H.R. discussion draft bill, that makes concessions to <b>net</b> <b>neutrality</b> but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers. On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying ("with some caveats") Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015. Adoption of this notion would reclassify internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and, according to Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, ensure <b>net</b> <b>neutrality.</b> The FCC is expected to enforce <b>net</b> <b>neutrality</b> in its vote, according to the New York Times.|$|E

30|$|The pHpzc of the {{adsorbent}} {{material is}} an important parameter; it determines the pH at which the adsorbent surface has <b>net</b> electrical <b>neutrality.</b> The determination of the pHpzc of the used pine sawdust was as follows: a series of 20  mL of 0.01  mol/L NaCl solutions were poured in closed conical flasks, the pH was adjusted {{in the range of}} 0.5 – 10. Then, in each solution, 0.2  g of adsorbent was soaked under agitation at room temperature and the final pH was measured after 24  h. The pHpzc is defined as the point where the curve pHinitial versus pHfinal crosses the line pHinitial = pHfinal.|$|R

40|$|The City of Seattle {{recently}} commissioned {{an analysis}} of the technical feasibility of a range of strategies in transportation, building energy, and waste sectors to achieve <b>net</b> carbon <b>neutrality</b> by the year 2050 from maximum deployment of known technologies at reasonable penetration rates. The energy-saving strategies that were identified provide opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and redesign urban landscapes, architecture, and transportation systems to become more resilient to climate change and higher fossil fuel prices. They also introduce policies, incentives, and regulations, and require investments that other cities and regions have not necessarily made. Do these initiatives disadvantage businesses and households in Seattle, or do they incentivize efficiency and innovation and position the city more competitively for growth in the future? This report reviews the relevant literature in economics to help provide answers to these important questions. We consider how the suite of regulations and incentives considered by Seattle could affect business profitability and competitiveness. We also explore the benefits to Seattle and its businesses of becoming a more climate friendly. The report does not analyze the specific economic impacts of the emissions reduction strategies under consideration. Rather, i...|$|R
40|$|A regular {{progression}} of polymorphic phase behavior was observed for mixtures of the anionic phospholipid, cardiolipin, and the cationic phospholipid derivative, 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -ethylphosphocholine. As revealed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy and small-angle x-ray diffraction, whereas the two lipids separately assume only lamellar phases, their mixtures exhibit a symmetrical (depending on charge ratio and not polarity) sequence of nonlamellar phases. The inverted hexagonal phase, H(II,) formed from equimolar mixtures {{of the two}} lipids, i. e., at <b>net</b> charge <b>neutrality</b> (charge ratio (CR((+/-))) = 1 : 1). When one type of lipid was in significant excess (CR((+/-)) = 2 : 1 or CR((+/-)) = 1 : 2), a bicontinuous cubic structure was observed. These cubic phases were {{very similar to those}} sometimes present in cellular organelles that contain cardiolipin. Increasing the excess of cationic or anionic charge to CR((+/-)) = 4 : 1 or CR((+/-)) = 1 : 4 led to the appearance of membrane bilayers with numerous interlamellar contacts, i. e., sponge structures. It is evident that interactions between cationic and anionic moieties can influence the packing of polar heads and hence control polymorphic phase transitions. The facile isothermal, polymorphic interconversion of these lipids may have important biological and technical implications...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} is {{a carbon}} sequestration technology that entails {{the reaction of}} CO 2 with oxides or silicates of magnesium, calcium or iron to produce stable carbonate compounds. Magnesium-rich tailings from the platinum industry in South Africa {{have been identified as}} a potentially viable and attractive feedstock for CO 2 sequestration through mineral carbonation. Many of the strategies proposed to enhance the dissolution kinetics of silicate minerals, {{such as the use of}} elevated temperatures and pressures and chemical additives, as well as pretreatment through mechanical and thermal activation, are energy intensive and will thus reduce the net CO 2 sequestration capacity of the overall mineral carbonation process. As a result, there is growing recognition of the need to evaluate the processes using life-cycle based approaches and tools to ensure they result in net CO 2 reduction. However, to date, research and development has focused primarily on the optimisation of extraction and/or carbonation efficiencies, with specific emphasis on the relatively reactive silicate minerals, such as olivine and serpentine. This project seeks to investigate the viability of using pyroxene-rich PGM tailings for the sequestration of CO 2, with specific emphasis on <b>net</b> carbon <b>neutrality.</b> Promising mineral carbonation processes have been identified on the basis of an extensive literature review, and include the: ammonium salts pH swing, Lackner's HCl multi-stage, gas-solid Abo Akademi University process, direct aqueous process, and mineral acid pH swing. Material and energy balances were then conducted for these processes on the basis of the sequestration of 1 ton of carbon dioxide, using Aspen Plus v 8 simulation software package. The material and energy data were then used to determine the total carbon footprint contributions, through the use of SimaPro v 7. 7. 3. life cycle assessment software...|$|R

25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with the way things are and want {{to find new ways to}} do things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, <b>Net</b> <b>neutrality</b> for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough.

25|$|Xfinity Voice allows {{communication}} {{over the}} internet using VoIP, but uses a private network instead of a public IP address, which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on DOCSIS 1.1 Quality of service standards. For the customer, this has the benefit of preventing network congestion from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or Smart pipe, has been seen {{by some as a}} violation of <b>net</b> <b>neutrality,</b> who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or dumb pipe. Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009. In their response, Comcast stated that services that use telecommunications are not necessarily telecommunications services, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as an information service exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast Voice was a separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.|$|E
