40|$|A {{prototype}} decoder for a serially concatenated pulse position modulation (SCPPM) code {{has been}} implemented in a {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA). At {{the time of this}} reporting, this is the first known hardware SCPPM decoder. The SCPPM coding scheme, conceived for free-space optical communications with both deep-space and terrestrial applications in mind, is an improvement of several dB over the conventional Reed-Solomon PPM scheme. The design of the FPGA SCPPM decoder is based on a turbo decoding algorithm that requires relatively low computational complexity while delivering error-rate performance within approximately 1 dB of channel capacity. The SCPPM encoder consists of an outer convolutional encoder, an interleaver, an accumulator, and an inner modulation encoder (more precisely, a mapping of bits to PPM symbols). Each code is describable by a trellis (a finite directed graph). The SCPPM decoder consists of an inner soft-in-soft-out (SISO) module, a de-interleaver, an outer SISO module, and an interleaver connected in a loop (see figure). Each SISO module applies the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm to compute a-posteriori bit log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) from apriori LLRs by traversing the code trellis in forward and backward directions. The SISO modules iteratively refine the LLRs by passing the estimates between one another much like the working of a turbine engine. Extrinsic information (the difference between the a-posteriori and a-priori LLRs) is exchanged rather than the a-posteriori LLRs to minimize undesired feedback. All computations are performed in the logarithmic domain, wherein multiplications are translated into additions, thereby reducing complexity and sensitivity to fixed-point implementation roundoff errors. To lower the required memory for storing channel likelihood data and the amounts of data transfer between the decoder and the receiver, one can discard the majority of channel likelihoods, using only the remainder in operation of the decoder. This is accomplished in the receiver by transmitting only a subset consisting of the likelihoods that correspond to time slots containing the largest numbers of observed photons during each PPM symbol period. The assumed number of observed photons in the remaining time slots is set to the mean of a <b>noise</b> <b>slot.</b> In low background noise, the selection of a small subset in this manner results in only negligible loss. Other features of the decoder design to reduce complexity and increase speed include (1) quantization of metrics in an efficient procedure chosen to incur no more than a small performance loss and (2) the use of the max-star function that allows sum of exponentials to be computed by simple operations that involve only an addition, a subtraction, and a table lookup. Another prominent feature of the design is a provision for access to interleaver and de-interleaver memory in a single clock cycle, eliminating the multiple clock-cycle latency characteristic of prior interleaver and de-interleaver designs...|$|E

40|$|Recently, it was {{observed}} that the low frequency <b>noise</b> of <b>slotted</b> SQUIDs is not affected when cooling them down in magnetic fields up to 0. 05 mT. This behavior is ascribed to the fact that magnetic vortices are expelled out of the narrow strips into the slots. Thus 1 /f noise by hopping of vortices in the superconducting structure is eliminated. Here we present a systematic investigation on a series of slotted high-Tc dc SQUIDs. The number of slots varies from zero to eight. A model is developed that provides values for the effective area and inductance of the slotted washers and the current distribution within the slotted SQUIDs. The model can explain the experimentally observed maximum in the effective area for four slots very well. The observed agreement with respect to the modulation depth supports the theoretical values for the inductance. The white <b>noise</b> of the <b>slotted</b> SQUIDs is higher than expected, while the expected rise of low frequency noise for field cooled solid washer SQUIDs was not observe...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the static, wind-on aerodynamic and static noise characteristics of an augmentor wing having lobe type nozzles. The study was made in the Ames 7 -by 10 -Foot No. 1 Wind Tunnel using a small-scale, quasi-two-dimensional model. Several configurations of lobe nozzles as well as a normal slot nozzle were tested. Results indicate that lobe nozzles offer improved static and wind-on aerodynamics and reduced static <b>noise</b> relative to <b>slot</b> nozzles. Best wind-on performance was obtained when the tertiary gap was closed even though the static thrust augmentation was maximum with the gap open. Static thrust augmentation, wind-on lift and drag, and static noise directivity are presented as well as typical static and wind-on exit velocity profiles, surface pressure distributions and noise spectrums.

40|$|The channel {{capacity}} C and the cutoff rate R sub o of two (M + 1) -ary decision rules for noisy M slots/symbol optical pulse position modulation (PPM) with ideal photon counting are computed and compared. Also {{the values of}} the optimum thresholds needed to minimize the signal requirements are given. With a minor increase in hardware complexity, the symbol by symbol threshold decision rule is shown to be superior to the slot by slot threshold detection and decision rule in two aspects: first, it saves more than 0. 5 dB in signal energy for the very noisy cases of more than one <b>noise</b> photon per <b>slot</b> (for low <b>noise</b> cases it also saves signal energy, but a negligibly small amount).

50|$|PCI-X has {{technological}} and economical disadvantages compared to PCI Express. The 64-bit parallel interface requires difficult trace routing, because, {{as with all}} parallel interfaces, the signals from the bus must arrive simultaneously or within a very short window, and <b>noise</b> from adjacent <b>slots</b> may cause interference. The serial interface of PCIe suffers fewer such problems and therefore does not require such complex and expensive designs. PCI-X buses, like standard PCI, are half-duplex bidirectional, whereas PCIe buses are full-duplex bidirectional. PCI-X buses run only {{as fast as the}} slowest device, whereas PCIe devices are able to independently negotiate the bus speed. Also, PCI-X slots are longer than PCIe 1x through PCIe 16x, which makes it impossible to make short cards for PCI-X. PCI-X slots take quite a bit of space on motherboards, which can be a problem for ATX and smaller form factors.|$|R

40|$|Resource sharing on {{carrier sense}} {{multiple}} access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) networks {{can be accomplished}} by using window-control algorithms for bus contention. The window-control algorithms are designed to grant permission to transmit to the station with the minimum contention parameter. Proper operation of the window-control algorithm requires that all stations sense the same state of the newtork in each contention <b>slot.</b> <b>Noise</b> causes the state of the network to appear as a collision. False collisions can cause the window-control algorithm to terminate without isolating any stations. A two-phase window-control protocol and approximate recurrence equation with noise as a parameter to improve the performance of the window-control algorithms in the presence of noise are developed. The results are compared through simulation, with the approximate recurrence equation yielding the best overall performance. Noise is even a bigger problem when it is not detected by all stations. In such cases it is possible for the window boundaries of the contending stations to become out of phase. Consequently, it is possible to isolate a station other than the one with the minimum contention parameter. To guarantee proper isolation of the minimum, a broadcast phase must be added after the termination of the algorithm. The protocol required to correct the window-control algorithm when noise is not detected by all stations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the various}} {{issues that are}} likely to arise with price regulation of privately owned airports. It begins with a brief background on Australian airports, and a review of regulatory experience elsewhere. Issues which can create problems for price regulation include congestion, noise and other externalities, quality degradation and underinvestment, and the choice of the initial price level. Price regulation limits the use of prices as rationing devices where congestion is present. Efficient handling of congestion can be reconciled with price caps if the regulator determines the appropriate congestion/capacity trade off, and supervises allocation of slots, e. g. through auctions or creating a market for <b>slots.</b> <b>Noise</b> externalities can be handled through noise charges set by a regulator who may also be called upon to resolve capacity/noise trade offs. Resolving the problem of quality degradation and underinvestment is inherently difficult, and may need to involve active participation in investment decisions by the regulator and airlines. The difficulties of setting initial price levels arise from conflicts in ensuring that existing assets are utilised efficiently, and that prices give efficient signals for future investment. Regulatory design issues, dealing with whether pure price caps or mixed regulatory rules are superior, are examined in the airport context. The paper concludes with a brief examination of the price regulatory regime as announced by the Australian government. airports price-caps regulation congestion noise externalities investment incentives quality regulation...|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic <b>noise</b> {{originating}} from <b>slotted</b> slats represents the {{major component of}} high-lift related airframe noise. Therefore slatless high-lift systems are considered effective means to reduce airframe noise. The major challenge within the design of such systems is to compensate the deficit in maximum lift performance for slatless wings, and the possibility to remove the gap between main airfoil and Fowler flap. One way to achieve the required high-lift capabilities is active flow control, like e. g. wing trailing edge blowing. Such a circulation control technology was investigated in the EU co-financed research project TimpAN (Technology to improve Airframe Noise). Both numerically and experimentally obtained results showed the expected good aerodynamic performance. High lift coefficients could be achieved with a limited fraction of the cold engine flow used for blowing. In this paper the results from noise measurements on a wing-flap configuration using circulation control to generate high lift are documented. Noise tests were performed in the open test section of the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig for predefined operational conditions. A comparison of noise data for the 3 -element DLR F 16 high-lift model of the same profile geometry and for the same lift performance shows that a noise reduction {{in the order of}} 3 dB to 6 dB is achieved for the 2 -element high-lift wing with flow control in the frequency range between 2 kHz and 20 kHz (at model scale), while a noise increase is observed to occur at low frequencies. The latter, however, might be due to excess installation noise {{originating from}} the current test set-up...|$|R
40|$|The sound {{generated}} by a 2 -D, 20 % thick elliptical circulation control airfoil with single slot blowing is experimentally investigated in the University of Florida Aeroacoustic Flow Facility. Experiments are conducted {{at a variety of}} freestream and slot jet velocities for three different slot heights h. The airfoil’s lift characteristics compare favorably with data from a previous research study in a conventional closed-wall wind tunnel. A large aperture microphone array reveals low noise contamination in the UFAFF test section. Data from farfield microphones indicate both tonal and broadband noise sources. Vortex shedding from the rounded trailing edge occurs when jet momentum levels are insufficient to prevent flow separation. High frequency tonal noise is also identified due to vortex shedding, where fD/Ujet = 0. 21, from the D = 0. 28 mm thick slot lip. For large jet velocities, high frequency broadband <b>slot</b> jet <b>noise</b> is identified as the dominant noise source for fh/Ujet> 0. 1. Jet velocity amplitude and frequency non-dimensionalization collapse the high-frequency portion of the spectra reasonably well when freestream velocity is low or zero. For curvature and <b>slot</b> <b>noise</b> {{generated by}} the external boundary layer flow, local mean velocities at the trailing edge and above the slot are not more effective than freestream and jet velocities when non-dimensionalizing frequency. Finally, freestream amplitude and Strouhal number scaling show a remarkable collapse of spectra for a variety of freestream velocities, jet velocities, and slot heights for a constant momentum coefficient.
