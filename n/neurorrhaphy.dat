40|$|Injuries of {{extremities}} can {{be followed}} by various neuromuscular complications. Injury of peripheral nerves directly depended on the topographic localization of injury (fractures, cuts, contusions). The neuromuscular complications were diagnosed and under follow-up, based on clinical, x-ray, neurologic and neurophysiological findings. The timing of physical treatment and assessment of the necessary neurosurgical intervention depended on the obtained findings. After surgeries, we continued to apply physical treatment and rehabilitation. The aim of the paper {{was to assess the}} significance of proper timing for surgery and adequate postoperative rehabilitation, as well as treatment results, depending on the extent of peripheral nerve injury. Material and methods: Based on the study condocted in the period from 2000 - 2002, most surgeries were done on the ulnar nerve (4 pts), median nerve (4 pts), radial nerve (3 pts), peroneal nerve (2 pts) and plexus brachialis (3 pts). Paresis and peripheral nerve paralysis, associated with sensibility disorders, predominated in clinical features. In most patients surgery was done during the first 3 - 6 months after injury. In early postoperative treatment positioning of extremities with electrotherapy were most often used in early postoperative treatment, Bioptron and dosed kinesitherapy. Depending on the neurophysiological findings, in later treatment stage we included electrostimulation, thermotherapy, kinesitherapy and working therapy, with the necessary application of static and dynamic orthroses. Study results showed that the success of treatment depended on the extent of injury, i. e. whether suture of liberalization of the nerve had been done, on the adequate timing of surgery, {{as well as on the}} adequate timing and application of physical therapy and rehabilitation. More rapid and complete functional recovery was achieved if the interval between injury and surgery was shorter, as well as physical therapy was applied early. Based on the analysis of the achieved results, we concluded that peripheral nerve lesions after fractures and contusions had better prognosis in relation to isolated sections of peripheral nerves, having in mind that these were mostly conductive block transfer and nerve stretching lesion, which do not leave sequelae after completed treatment After <b>neurorrhaphies</b> and applied therapy, motor and sensitive deficit mostly depended on good timing of surgery and continual physiatric treatment. It is also important to point out the significance of team-work among neurosurgeon, neurologist and physiatrist necessary in early detection and successful treatment of numerous sequelae and invalidity in patients with peripheral nerve lesions...|$|R

5000|$|All {{procedures}} in general show an improvement of symmetry of smile and patient satisfaction, although time of recovery differs between different approaches. Primary <b>neurorrhaphy</b> {{provides the best}} possible outcome, as the anatomy and function of the damaged facial nerve is restored. After primary <b>neurorrhaphy</b> {{of the facial nerve}} mean recovery time typically is 6 to 12 months. The contraction amplitude after using a CFNG is usually not very powerful, but it results in a relatively spontaneous smile because the contralateral healthy facial nucleus controls the movements. After a CFNG procedure the first signs of reinnervation usually occur between 4 and 12 months. The use of the masseteric nerve provides an amount of movement that is within the normal range, resulting in a more symmetrical but not completely emotional smile. Nerve transfers using the hypoglossal or massseteric nerves and the [...] "babysitter" [...] procedure result in first contractions of the mimic muscles after approximately 4 to 6 months.

Although the masseteric nerve transfer provides a strong smile within the range of normal, it never becomes truly spontaneous and emotional. But with practice, the majority of patients can provide a spontaneous smile some of the time due to the plasticity of the cerebral cortex.

40|$|Background: End-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> is {{controversial}} {{in the literature}} and has sparked debate over its degree of recovery. In this study, nerve regeneration was assessed in rats after end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> by morphometric analysis, electromyography, electron microscopy, and retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Fluoro-Gold (FG; Fluorochrome Inc., Denver, Colo.) transport and then compared to end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy</b> and sham operation. Methods: Thirty-seven animals were operated on and divided randomly into 4 groups: group 1, sham; group 2, end-to-end neurorrhaphy; group 3, end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with an epineural window; and group 4, end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> without an epineural window. Three months after surgery, HRP was injected into the peroneal muscles. After 48 hours, nerve segments and lumbar spine segments were collected. Electromyography data were compared between groups, and FG uptake was compared in 20 other animals. Analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer correction was used for group comparison. Results: The fiber count after end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy</b> was higher than after end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with an epineural window (q = 5. 243 and P < 0. 01) or without an epineural window (q = 4. 951 and P < 0. 01).

40|$|In {{peripheral}} nerve injury, end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> involves coaptation of the distal stump of a transected nerve {{to the trunk}} of an adjacent donor nerve.

Experimental and clinical data suggests that end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> can provide satisfactory functional recovery for the recipient nerve, without any deterioration of the donor nerve function. The most accepted mechanism of nerve regeneration following end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> is collateral sprouting.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to quantitatively assess reinnervation of musculocutaneous nerve (MCN) stumps using motor and primary sensory neurons after plasmid phVEGF transfection and end-to-end (ETE) or end-to-side (ETS) <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> The distal stump of rat transected MCN, was transfected with plasmid phVEGF, plasmid alone or treated with vehiculum and reinnervated following ETE or ETS <b>neurorrhaphy</b> for 2 months. The number of motor and dorsal root ganglia neurons reinnervating the MCN stump was estimated following their retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Ruby and Fluoro-Emerald. Reinnervation of the MCN stumps was assessed based on density, diameter and myelin sheath thickness of regenerated axons, grooming test and the wet weight index of the biceps brachii muscles. Results Immunohistochemical detection under the same conditions revealed increased VEGF in the Schwann cells of the MCN stumps transfected with the plasmid phVEGF, as opposed to control stumps transfected with only the plasmid or treated with vehiculum. The MCN stumps transfected with the plasmid phVEGF were reinnervated by moderately higher numbers of motor and sensory neurons after ETE <b>neurorrhaphy</b> compared with control stumps. However, morphometric quality of myelinated axons, grooming test and the wet weight index were significantly better in the MCN plasmid phVEGF transfected stumps. The ETS <b>neurorrhaphy</b> of the MCN plasmid phVEGF transfected stumps in comparison with control stumps resulted in significant elevation of motor and sensory neurons that reinnervated the MCN. Especially noteworthy was the increased numbers of neurons that sent out collateral sprouts into the MCN stumps. Similarly to ETE <b>neurorrhaphy,</b> phVEGF transfection resulted in significantly higher morphometric quality of myelinated axons, behavioral test and the wet weight index of the biceps brachii muscles. Conclusion Our results showed that plasmid phVEGF transfection of MCN stumps could induce an increase in VEGF protein in Schwann cells, which resulted in higher quality axon reinnervation after both ETE and ETS <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> This was also associated with a better wet weight biceps brachii muscle index and functional tests than in control rats. </p...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: One of the {{techniques}} used for treating facial paralysis is double muscle innervation using end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with sectioning of healthy nerves. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether double muscle innervation by means of end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> could occur, with maintenance of muscle innervation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Experimental study developed at the Experimental Research Center, Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, Unesp. METHODS: One hundred rats were allocated to five groups as follows: G 1, control group; G 2, the peroneal nerve was sectioned; G 3, the tibial nerve was transected and the proximal stump was end-to-side sutured to the intact peroneal nerve; G 4, 120 days after the G 3 surgery, the peroneal nerve was sectioned proximally to the neurorrhaphy; G 5, 120 days after the G 3 surgery, the peroneal and tibial nerves were sectioned proximally to the <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> RESULTS: One hundred and fifty days after the surgery, G 3 did not show any change in tibial muscle weight or muscle fiber diameter, but the axonal fiber diameter in the peroneal nerve distal to the <b>neurorrhaphy</b> had decreased. Although G 4 showed atrophy of the cranial tibial muscle 30 days after sectioning the peroneal nerve, the electrophysiological test results and axonal diameter measurement confirmed that muscle reinnervation had occurred. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that double muscle innervation did not occur through end-to-side neurorrhaphy; the tibial nerve was not able to maintain muscle innervation after the peroneal nerve had been sectioned, although muscle reinnervation was found to have occurred, 30 days after the peroneal nerve had been sectioned...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hypoglossal-facial <b>neurorrhaphy</b> {{has been}} widely used for {{reanimation}} of paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal injury {{of the facial nerve}}. However, complete section of the hypoglossal nerve occasionally results in hemiglossal dysfunction and interferes with swallowing and speech. To reduce this morbidity, a modified technique with partial section of the hypoglossal nerve after mastoid dissection of the facial nerve (HFM) has been used. We report our experience with the HFM technique, retrospectively comparing the outcome with results of the classic hypoglossal-facial <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in 36 patients who underwent hypoglossal-facial <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with the classic (n = 12) or variant technique (n = 24) between 2000 and 2006. Facial Outcome was evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system, and tongue function was evaluated with a new scale proposed to quantify Postoperative tongue alteration. The results were compared, and age and time between nerve injury and surgery were correlated with the outcome. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} the two techniques concerning facial reanimation. A worse outcome of tongue function, however, was associated with the classic technique (Mann-Whitney U test; P < 0. 05). When HFM was used, significant correlations defined by the Spearman test were identified between preoperative delay (p = 0. 59; P = 0. 002) or age (p = 0. 42; P = 0. 031) and results of facial reanimation evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system. CONCLUSION: HFM is as effective as classic hypoglossal-facial <b>neurorrhaphy</b> for facial reanimation, and it has a much lower morbidity related to tongue function.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to evaluate collateral sprouting capacity in an end-toside repair model with long regenerative distance, {{with or without}} the use of erythropoietin for stimulating axonal regeneration. Materials and methods: Forty-five male Wistar rats were used and divided into four groups, according to the reparative procedure following peroneal nerve division: (A) “double” end-toside <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with a regenerative distance of 0. 6 cm; (B) “double” end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with a regenerative distance of 1. 2 cm; (C) “double” end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with a regenerative distance of 1. 2 cm plus erythropoietin administration; and (D) nerve stumps buried into neighboring muscles. In all animals, the contralateral healthy side served as a control. Functional assessment of nerve regeneration was performed at intervals up to 5 months using the Peroneal Function Index (PFI). Evaluation 150 days after surgery included peroneal and tibial nerve histologic and morphometric examination and wet weight of the tibialis anterior muscle. Results: Functional evaluation and axonal counting data demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between groups A and B. Consequently, 1. 2 cm gaps can effectively be bridged by collateral sprouting mechanism. Although erythropoietin administration enhanced regeneration during the first four weeks after surgery, did not manage to maintain its satisfactory functional results {{at the end of the}} study. There was no functional or histologic evidence of donor nerve deterioration. Conclusion: The present study confirms that “double” end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> may be useful for the repair of divided human nerves with long gaps.

40|$|Objective: Facial nerve {{paralysis}} or compromise can {{be caused}} by lesions of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle and their treatment. When the facial nerve is transected or severely compromised and primary end-to-end repair is not possible, hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis remains the most popular method for accomplishing three main goals: restoring facial tone, restoring facial symmetry, and facilitating return of voluntary facial movement. Our objectives are to evaluate the surgical feasibility and long-term outcomes of our technique of direct facial-to-hypoglossal <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with a parotid-release maneuver. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Academic tertiary care referral center. Patients: Ten patients with facial paralysis from proximal nerve injury underwent the facial-hypoglossal <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with a parotid-release maneuver. Main outcome measures: The Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and photographs. Results: Facial-hypoglossal <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with parotid release was technically feasible in all cases, and anastomosis was performed distal to the origin of the ansa hypoglossi. All patients had good return of facial nerve function. Nine patients had scores of C or better, indicating strong eyelid and oral sphincter closure and mass motion. There was no hemilingual atrophy and no subjective tongue dysfunction. Conclusions: The parotid-release maneuver mobilizes additional length to the facial nerve, facilitating a tensionless communication distal to the ansa hypoglossi. The technique is a viable option for facial reanimation, and our patients achieved good clinical outcomes with continual improvement...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{incidence}} of symptomatic neuroma in finger nerve injuries varies widely in the literature. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the {{incidence of}} symptomatic neuroma after repair of digital nerve injuries (<b>neurorrhaphy)</b> and after amputation {{of one or more}} fingers. We also determined the need for re-operation on symptomatic neuroma patients. Methods: In a retrospective study, we collected data from medical files. All patients who were treated for a hand trauma in the emergency department during the last 10 years were included. We gathered data on the presence of symptomatic neuroma and re-operation of the patients. Results: In our database, 583 people had a peripheral nerve injury of whom 177 people had an amputation. The incidence of digital nerve injury without amputation followed by <b>neurorrhaphy</b> was 1 %. In digital nerve injuries with amputation the incidence was 7. 8 %, which is significantly higher than after digital nerve injuries without amputation. Conclusions: People with an amputation injury have significantly more symptomatic neuroma than people who undergo <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> People who have a symptomatic neuroma after digital nerve injuries have been operated significantly more than people who have a non-symptomatic neuroma or no neuroma at all. This information can be of help when treating digital nerve injuries. Type of study/Level of evidence (LOE) : Prognostic.

40|$|Using {{ulnar nerve}} as donor and musculocutaneous nerve as {{recipient}} we recently demonstrated that end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy</b> in young adult male Wistar rats resulted in good recovery following protracted survival. Here we explored whether anti-inflammatory drug- methylprednisolone, re-generation/myelination-enhancing agent- methylcobalamin and neurite growth-enhancing and angiogenic factor- pleiotrophin accelerated its recovery. Methylprednisolone suppressed the perineuronal microglial reaction and periaxonal ED- 1 expression while pleiotrophin increased the blood vessel density and nerve fiber densities in the reconnected nerve as expected. Neither methylprednisolone nor methylcobalamin altered {{the expression of}} growth associated protein 43 in the neurons examined suggesting {{that they did not}} interfere with axonal regeneration attempt. Surprisingly methylcobalamin enhanced the recovery of compound muscle action potentials and motor end plate innervation and the performance on sticker removal grooming test and augmented the diameters and myelin thicknesses of regenerated axons dramatically while enhancing S- 100 expression in Schwann cells; remarkable recovery was achieved 1 month following <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> Simultaneous methylcobalamin and pleiotrophin treatment resulted in quick and persistent supernumerary reinnervation but failed to enhance the recovery over that of the former alone. Methylprednisolone transiently suppressed the enumeration of regrowing axons. In conclusion, methylcobalamin may be preferred over methylprednisolone to facilitate the recovery of peripheral nerves following end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> The long-term effect of this treatment however remains to be clarified.

40|$|OBJETIVO: O tratamento das lesões do plexo braquial representa um grande desafio, principalmente as lesões tardias, com mais de 12 meses de evolução. Analisamos retrospectivamente pacientes que foram submetidos a uma das possibilidades para tentar restaurar a função do membro {{superior}} afetado nestas condições, a transferência microcirúrgica do músculo grácil para flexão do cotovelo. MÉTODOS: Foram incluídos oito pacientes, divididos em dois grupos: um cujo procedimento realizado consistia em neurorrafia do retalho muscular com enxerto de nervo sural e anastomoses mais distais; o outro em que a neurorrafia era realizada diretamente no nervo espinal acessório, e anastomose nos vasos toracoacromiais. RESULTADOS: Encontramos significante diferença entre os grupos, sendo que aqueles submetidos à neurorrafia direta obtiveram resultados satisfatórios em maior número (75 % M 4) quando comparados com o outro grupo, que fez uso de enxerto para neurorrafia, em que foi menor o sucesso do procedimento (25 % M 4). CONCLUSÃO: Pacientes submetidos à transferência funcional microcirúrgica do músculo grácil cujas anastomoses vasculares foram realizadas nos vasos toracoacromiais apresentaram melhor resultado funcional do que aqueles que tiveram suas anastomoses realizadas na artéria braquial e consequente utilização de enxerto de nervo. OBJECTIVE: Treating {{brachial plexus}} injuries {{is a major}} challenge, especially lesions that are presented late, with more than 12 months of evolution. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent one of the possibilities for attempting to restore the function of upper limbs affected under such conditions: microsurgical transfer of the gracilis muscle for elbow flexion. METHODS: Eight patients were included, divided into two groups: {{one in which the}} procedure consisted of <b>neurorrhaphy</b> of the muscle flap with sural nerve grafting and anastomosis more distally; and the other, in which the <b>neurorrhaphy</b> was performed directly on the spinal accessory nerve, with anastomosis in thoracoacromial vessels. RESULTS: We found {{a significant difference between the}} groups. A greater number of satisfactory results (75 % M 4) were found among patients who underwent direct <b>neurorrhaphy,</b> whereas the procedure using grafts for <b>neurorrhaphy</b> was less successful (25 % M 4). CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent microsurgical functional transfer of the gracilis muscle in which vascular anastomoses were performed in thoracoacromial vessels presented better functional outcomes than shown by those whose anastomoses were in the brachial artery with subsequent use of a nerve graft...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{sciatic nerve}} {{regeneration}} between non-diabetic (control) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats. METHODS:Four subgroups were evaluated. CN: Non-diabetic rats submitted to <b>neurorrhaphy</b> (n= 9); DN: Diabetic rats submitted to <b>neurorrhaphy</b> (n= 9); CG: Non-diabetic rats submitted to nerve grafting (n= 10); DG: Diabetic rats submitted to nerve grafting (n= 9). The nerve regeneration was evaluated by walking track analysis (sciatic functional index), electrophysiological test, histomorphometric analysis and triceps surae muscle weight. RESULTS:At 60 days post-surgery, functional recovery of DN {{was similar to}} that of the non-diabetic rats (CN, CG), but DG didn't achieve the same. Evoked potential amplitudes showed no statistically significant differences among subgroups. Triceps surae muscle was heavier in CN. No statistically significant differences were observed between the control and diabetes subgroups with respect to histomorphometric analysis. CONCLUSION: After 60 days, DN had a functionally similar recovery to that of the control animals, whereas nerve grafting in diabetic rats didn't allow the same. The muscle atrophy was lower in CN. In the rest of evaluations, as electrophysiological and histomorphometric, diabetic rats were not different from control ones...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Compare two {{new methods}} with the {{traditional}} end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups. In A-L group the peroneal nerve was sectioned and the distal stump {{was connected to the}} lateral of the tibial nerve (donor) with two 10 - 0 nylon points. In A-R group two perineurium flaps embraced the donor nerve. In the B-R group a suture embraced the donor nerve. Group B-L was the control. After six months tibial cranial muscle mass and morphometry of the distal stump of the peroneal nerve were evaluated. RESULTS: Muscle mass in groups A-R, A-L and B-R were lower than B-L group (p 0. 05). Groups A-R, B-R and A-L had a lower number of nerve fibers when compared with B-L (p= 0. 0155, p= 0. 016, p= 0. 0021). CONCLUSION: The three types of <b>neurorrhaphy</b> showed no differences related to muscle mass and number of nerve fibers suggesting that the embracing with a single suture has great potential due its simplicity and usefulness in deep areas...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the functional axonal anatomy of a termino-lateral <b>neurorrhaphy</b> (TLN). We hypothesize that axons populating a TLN must relinquish functional connections with their original targets prior to establishing new connections via the TLN. Two-month-old F 344 rats underwent a TLN between the left peroneal nerve and a nerve graft tunneled to the contralateral hindlimb. Three months postoperatively, an end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy</b> was performed between the nerve graft and the right peroneal nerve. Four months after the second operation, contractile properties and electromyographic (EMG) signals were measured in the bilateral hindlimbs. Left peroneal nerve stimulation proximal to the TLN site resulted in bilateral extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle contractions, with significantly lower forces on the side reinnervated by TLN. Evoked EMGs demonstrated that the right and left hindlimb musculature were electrically discontinuous following TLN. These data support our hypothesis that axons can form functional connections via a TLN, but they must first relinquish functional connections with their original targets. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|This study {{employed}} a rat model of sciatic nerve injury {{to investigate the}} effects of postoperative low-power far-infrared (FIR) radiation therapy on nerve repair following end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy.</b> The rat models were divided into the following 3 groups: (1) nerve injury without FIR biostimulation (NI/sham group); (2) nerve injury with FIR biostimulation (NI/FIR group); and (3) noninjured controls (normal group). Walking-track analysis {{results showed that the}} NI/FIR group exhibited significantly higher sciatic functional indices at 8 weeks after surgery (P< 0. 05) compared with the NI/sham group. The decreased expression of CD 4 and CD 8 in the NI/FIR group indicated that FIR irradiation modulated the inflammatory process during recovery. Compared with the NI/sham group, the NI/FIR group exhibited a significant reduction in muscle atrophy (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, histomorphometric assessment indicated that the nerves regenerated more rapidly in the NI/FIR group than in the NI/sham group; furthermore, the NI/FIR group regenerated neural tissue over a larger area, as well as nerve fibers of greater diameter and with thicker myelin sheaths. Functional recovery, inflammatory response, muscular reinnervation, and histomorphometric assessment all indicated that FIR radiation therapy can accelerate nerve repair following end-to-end <b>neurorrhaphy</b> of the sciatic nerve...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to histologically compare the axonal {{sprouting}} after end-to-side <b>neurorrhaphy</b> with or without epineurotomy. Methods: twenty male Wistar rats were used, divided into two groups of 10 rats each. A 1. 0 cm segment of the tibial nerve E was dried and sutured on the opposite side, where it was sutured into the sciatic nerve D. In Group I, the suture was made directly in the epineurium and in Group II, epineurotomy was performed. After 4 weeks, histological evaluation was carried out of the transposed segment and the sciatic nerve distal to the suture. Results: the results showed a small number of remyelinated fibers, varying from 7 to 51 fibers in Group I and from 10 to 91 fibers in Group II. The Mann-Whitney U test was used, with p= 0. 311, showing there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups. There was no positive relation between the number of remyelinated fibers in the graft and in the suture site distal to the sciatic lesion. Conclusion: lateral-ending <b>neurorrhaphy,</b> with or without epineural window, does not promote efficient remyelinization. Level of Evidence: Level II, prospective comparative study...|$|E
