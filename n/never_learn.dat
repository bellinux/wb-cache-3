25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is {{not overly}} fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creating–in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson. We <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> {{anything}} about her husband, {{but we do know}} that she hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of Hallowe'en Party. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E
25|$|MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome, {{is marked}} by severe {{neurological}} symptoms. These include progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, some deafness and loss of vision, and an inability to sleep {{for more than a}} few hours at a time. This disorder tends to have three main stages. During the first stage, early mental and motor skill development may be somewhat delayed. Affected children show a marked decline in learning between ages 2 and 6, followed by eventual loss of language skills and loss of some or all hearing. Some children may <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> to speak. In the syndrome's second stage, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, profound dementia, and irregular sleep may make children difficult to manage, particularly those who retain normal physical strength. In the syndrome's last stage, children become increasingly unsteady on their feet and most are unable to walk by age 10.|$|E
500|$|The [...] is a sub-race of the Viera, {{characterized}} by light {{blond hair and}} shorter ears than standard Viera. They are {{the descendants of the}} Aegyl chief Feolthanos who {{fell in love with a}} full-blood Viera. The Feol were from birth treated as exiles by their full blood kin, cast out of the Wood to take refuge at Roda Volcano, where none dare enter. Since they have no wings, Feolthanos left the airship Galbana and the Auracite in the hopes that one day they come to him. His inheritance was received by Mydia/Judge of Wings, who decimated all that remained of his progeny to ensure that her people would <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> the truth behind their patriarch.|$|E

500|$|Back {{in their}} room, they {{continue}} to bond. Galinda tells Elphaba of her plans to marry Fiyero even though he hasn't proposed and Elphaba confesses that her father blames her {{for the death of}} her mother, who died birthing Nessarose. Galinda decides that she will help Elphaba become popular and she gives her roommate the nickname [...] "Elphie" [...] ("Popular"). When Elphaba arrives at class the next day, Fiyero sees Galinda's influence, and tells Elphaba that she doesn't need to change. Dr. Dillamond enters to tell the class that he is leaving - he is no longer permitted to teach. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. The students are introduced to the new technological advancement of the cage, which will keep Animals controlled, so that they <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> to speak. Elphaba's outrage cannot be contained, and in the ensuing chaos, she and Fiyero grab the Lion cub ("Cowardly Lion") in the cage and escape.|$|E

Wounded Rhymes second single, [...] "I Follow Rivers", is Li's best performing single to date; it reached the top five on multiple charts and peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia) and Germany, and earned certifications in Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland. Li's third studio album I <b>Never</b> <b>Learn</b> (2014) showcased a more melancholic sound compared to her previous releases, and was {{named one of the}} best albums of 2014 by several American music publications.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

2500|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of all these}} attempts to defeat frequency counting attacks is that it increases complication of both enciphering and deciphering, leading to mistakes.

2500|$|With his parents' {{reluctant}} permission, in 1898 Klee {{began studying}} {{art at the}} Academy of Fine Arts in Munich with Heinrich Knirr and Franz von Stuck. [...] He excelled at drawing but seemed to lack any natural color sense. [...] He later recalled, [...] "During the third winter I even realized that I probably would <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> to paint." [...] During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{difference}} between Seinfeld and sitcoms which preceded {{it is that the}} principal characters <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's producers was: [...] "No hugging, no learning". Entertainment Weeklys TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as [...] "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings". This leads to very few happy endings, except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters getting a justly deserved [...]|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a [...] out of 4-star rating.

However, he praised Culkin's performance. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the film a [...] "D" [...] grade, criticizing the film for its [...] "sadistic festival of adult-bashing".

2500|$|Webcomic Sluggy Freelance's main {{character}} is Torg, a bright but uncomplicated fellow whose last name we <b>never</b> <b>learn.</b> In Pete Abrams' first parody, Torg Potter and the Sorcerer's Nuts, Torg is mistaken for the Lastnameless One and brought into Hoggelrynth to learn magic.

2500|$|For Chinese input, Shape-based input {{methods such as}} Cangjie(pronounced as ChongKit in Cantonese) or Chinese {{handwriting}} recognition {{are the most common}} input method. The use of phonetic-based input method is uncommon {{due to the lack of}} official standard for Cantonese romanisation and people in Hong Kong almost <b>never</b> <b>learn</b> any romanisation schemes in schools. An advantage of phonetic-based input method is that most Cantonese speakers are able to input Traditional Chinese characters with no particular training at all where they spell out the Cantonese sound of each character without tone marks, e.g. 'heung gong' for 香港( [...] ; Hong Kong) and to choose the characters from a list. However, Microsoft Windows, which is the most popular operating system used in desktops, does not provide any Cantonese phonetic input method, requiring users to find and install third-party input method software. Also, most people find the process of picking characters from a list being too slow due to homonyms so the Cangjie method is generally preferred.|$|E

A photograph of the Franklin River taken on one of these missions (and showing the construction road) was signed after the case by all the judges involved and a copy is displayed in the Australian National University College of Law staff library. On 1 July 2008, twenty five years after the High Court decision that saved the Franklin River an anniversary dinner was held at Hobart's Grand Chancellor Hotel where former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke stated that the campaign to protect the Franklin River had important lessons for the struggle against global warming: [...] "And as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The conservatives: they never change, they <b>never</b> <b>learn.</b> What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost economic growth.
