5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>matrix</b> (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>matrix,</b> an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In this study, DNA-depleted <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>matrices</b> are {{isolated}} from HeLa S 3 cells. These <b>nuclear</b> <b>matrices</b> consist of peripheral laminae, residual nucleoli, and internal fibrillar structures. High molecular weight, heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) is quantitatively {{associated with these}} structures and can be released intact only by affecting {{the integrity of the}} matrices. It is, therefore, concluded that hnRNA is part of a highly organized nuclear structure. By irradiation of intact cells or isolated <b>nuclear</b> <b>matrices</b> with ultraviolet light, proteins tightly associated with hnRNA can be induced to cross-link with the RNA. Performing the crosslinking in vivo is an extra guarantee that only hnRNA-protein (hnRNP) complexes existing in the intact cell are covalently linked. Such hnRNP complexes were isolated and purified under conditions that completely dissociate nonspecific RNA-protein complexes. By comparison of the hnRNP found in <b>nuclear</b> <b>matrices</b> and the published data on the composition of hnRNP particles, {{it was found that the}} so-called hnRNP "packaging " proteins (32, 000 - 38, 000 mol wt) were not efficiently cross-linked to hnRNA by UV irradiation.

There are six known antigens, which are all associated with the centromere; CENP-A to CENP-F. CENP-A is a 17kDa histone H3-like protein. CENP-B is an 80kDa DNA binding protein involved in the folding of heterochromatin. CENP-C is a 140kDa protein involved in kinetochore assembly. CENP-D is a 50kDa protein of unknown function, but may be homologous to another protein involved in chromatin condensation, RCC1. CENP-E is a 312kDa protein from the kinesin motor protein family.

25|$|The E2 protein {{serves as}} a master {{transcriptional}} regulator for viral promoters located primarily in the long control region. The protein has a transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain. E2 facilitates the binding of E1 to the viral origin of replication. E2 also utilizes a cellular protein known as Bromodomain-4 (Brd4) to tether the viral genome to cellular chromosomes. This tethering to the cell's <b>nuclear</b> <b>matrix</b> ensures faithful distribution of viral genomes to each daughter cell after cell division. It is thought that E2 {{serves as a}} negative regulator of expression for the oncogenes E6 and E7 in latently HPV-infected basal layer keratinocytes. Genetic changes, such as integration of the viral DNA into a host cell chromosome, that inactivate E2 expression tend to increase {{the expression of the}} E6 and E7 oncogenes, resulting in cellular transformation and possibly further genetic destabilization.|$|E

These {{studies showed that}} (i) T- and U-antigens can be defined by separate classes of antigenic determinants and (ii) the U-antigenic determinants in SV 40 -transformed cells and in hybrid virus-infected cells are similar. The apparent discrepancy in the subcellular location of U-antigen in SV 40 -transformed cells (nuclear location) and in hybrid virus-infected cells (perinuclear location) as determined by immunofluorescence staining of methanol/acetone-fixed cells could be resolved by treating hybrid virus-infected cells with a hypotonic KCl solution before fixation. Upon this treatment hybrid virus-infected cells also showed nuclear U-antigen staining.

In these regions, the twist-four <b>nuclear</b> parton <b>matrix</b> elements are evaluated numerically and compared to the factorized form for different nuclear sizes within a schematic model of the two-nucleon correlation function.
