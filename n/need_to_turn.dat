Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away hundreds of students every year.|$|E

25|$|The body rotates {{about its}} long axis with every arm stroke {{so that the}} {{shoulder}} of the recovering arm is higher than {{the shoulder of the}} pushing/pulling arm. This makes the recovery much easier and reduces the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the head to breathe. As one shoulder is out of the water, it reduces drag, and as it falls it aids the arm catching the water; as the other shoulder rises it aids the arm at end of the push to leave the water.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an overall}} underpricing of formal water and {{sanitation}} services in Sub-Saharan Africa. A first consequence is an insufficient cost recovery, leading to dependency on foreign aid and governmental support, and to insufficient investments. Second, underpricing is socially unfair. Since the poorest social groups are less connected to water networks and sewerage, they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to alternatives, and they pay in some cases a multiple of the formal tariff. Hence, the poorest are hit twice: they have less access to improved water supply and sanitation, {{and they need to}} pay more.|$|E

5000|$|A pallet {{inverter}} or {{pile turner}} is {{a machine that}} is used <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> over pallets whilst still loaded with products. The reasons for <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> over a pallet are varied, but one main reason is the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> replace a broken or inappropriate pallet without unstacking the whole load. Sometimes a manufacturer simply <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their products <b>to</b> stop their contents settling. In some industries, {{it is necessary to}} transfer goods from one type of pallet to another [...] - [...] for example, when plastic pallets are used for on-site storage and wooden pallets are used for shipping. Pallet inverters can be built into production lines or be used as a stand-alone product. The term pallet inverter is also used to cover machines that turn the palletised load through 90 degrees only.|$|R

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} humankind's sinfulness may be illustrated {{in a number}} of ways. Although terrifying scenes of Christ the Judge were common in medieval art, they became less common in the art of the Renaissance. On the other hand, there were numerous depictions of the Genesis story of Adam and Eve eating the fruit that they had been forbidden by God to touch. There were also depictions of the so-called Seven Deadly Sins and the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Bridesmaids. All this sought to confirm humankind's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to Jesus to receive God's saving grace.|$|E
25|$|Forestry is an {{important}} economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, {{are some of the}} obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their attention to eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.|$|E
25|$|Today {{tourists}} {{enter the}} Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, a tunnel purportedly created around AD 820 by Caliph al-Ma'mun's workmen using a battering ram. The tunnel is cut {{straight through the}} masonry of the pyramid for approximately , then turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in {{the ceiling of the}} Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending Passage, which alerted them to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden.|$|E

25|$|After {{almost four}} years out of the game, McAllister, {{who was part of}} the squad the last time Leeds had won the league championship, was {{appointed}} manager of Leeds United on 29 January 2008 with an initial contract {{until the end of the}} season. The club was sitting in sixth place after former boss Dennis Wise's surprise departure to Newcastle. McAllister's first game came four days after his appointment, a 1–0 away defeat to Southend United. Leeds lost their next game 2–0 to Tranmere Rovers and slipped to eighth in the table and it became clear that McAllister would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the tide if Leeds were to regain a play-off spot. The new manager bagged his first win at the fifth attempt, in a 1–0 away victory over Swindon Town, before following it up with his first home victory against Bournemouth, in which Leeds beat the relegation-threatened side 2–0.|$|E

A [...] train, painted yellow, was also able to carry 108passengers, but had two extra driver's cabs in the centre, allowing it to be split into two separate [...] trains, each capable of carrying 54passengers. It was envisaged that when the line was busy both trains would be used, but during quiet periods the line could be operated by {{the two halves of}} the yellow train. The red train was modified so that it could also be split, reducing its capacity to 102 as the two rows of seats at the centre were replaced by driver's cabs.|$|E

50|$|The LH-16 has {{the ability}} to switch between two modes: DF and Receive. In DF mode, the {{direction}} of the needle on the dial indicates the direction the operator <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in order <b>to</b> face the direction of the signal. For example, if the operator <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the right to face the signal, the needle will point to the right, and if the operator is facing the signal, the needle will be centered. Care <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be taken in this mode to ensure that one is not facing the opposite direction of the signal, as in this case the needle will also be centered. In Receive mode, the needle indicates signal strength 90 degrees {{to the left of the}} device. Either or both modes may be used in operating this device, depending upon operator's preference and the needs of the search. Often, the operator will use DF to find two options for signal, and receive to find out which of the two directions the operator <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> follow.|$|R
