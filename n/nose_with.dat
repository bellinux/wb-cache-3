5|$|Many {{obstacles}} were in {{the course}} rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream; and Gum Drop, a gigantic gumball machine replica filled with plastic balls into which contestants would leap.|$|E
5|$|The SS192 was {{discontinued}} in late 2004. It used a 1.8g (28grain) {{hollow point}} bullet with a copper jacket and an aluminum core. The projectile had {{a length of}} 21.6mm (.85in). It had an unmarked hollow <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a depth of 7.6mm (0.3in) and a 0.8-mm (0.03in) opening. The SS192 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level IIIA vest when fired from the Five-seven.|$|E

5000|$|The EA and E1 had sloping <b>noses</b> <b>with</b> {{recessed}} headlights, {{while the}} E2 {{had a more}} bulbous [...] "bulldog" [...] nose. Models E3 through E6 had a sloping <b>nose</b> but <b>with</b> a protruding headlight, while models E7 through E9 used a less sloped (closer to vertical) style like the freight F-units. A patent of 1937 signed by several EMC engineers defined the styling.|$|R

5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric <b>nose,</b> <b>with</b> the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prominent}} {{forms of}} display among these animals is whistling and bounding. Instead of scent-marking its territory, the reedbuck {{will give a}} shrill whistle to make the boundaries of its territory be known. As it whistles, it expels air through its <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> such a force that the whole of its body vibrates. These whistles, usually one to three in number, are followed by a few stotting bounds. This behaviour {{is also used to}} raise alarm in herds. In this, the reedbuck raises its neck, exposing the white patch on its throat, but keeping the tail down, and leaps in a way similar to the impala's jumps, landing on its forelegs. This is accompanied by the popping of the inguinal glands in the legs. Fights begin with both opponents holding their horns low, in a combat stance; followed by the locking of horns and pushing one another. These fights can even lead to deaths.|$|E
40|$|Tests to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of a}} conical windshield on the drag of a bluff body at supersonic speeds were performed for the following configurations: a sharp <b>nose</b> fuselage <b>with</b> stabilizing fins,a blunt <b>nose</b> fuselage <b>with</b> a hemispherical shape, and a blunt <b>nose</b> fuselage <b>with</b> a conical point. Results of the drag coeeficient are described at Mach 1. 0 and the greatest Mach number of 1. 37...|$|R

25|$|SF 37: Single-seat {{photographic}} {{reconnaissance aircraft}} (SF: Spaning Foto), with radar replaced by battery of cameras in <b>nose,</b> <b>with</b> provision for additional reconnaissance pods. It {{made its first}} flight on May 21, 1973. 28 built, with deliveries from April 1977, serial numbers 37950-37977. 25 airframes upgraded to AJSF 37. Partially decommissioned in 1998.|$|E
25|$|With {{design of}} the DH.98 started, {{mock-ups}} were built, the most detailed at Salisbury Hall, where E0234 was later constructed. Initially, the concept was for the crew to be enclosed in the fuselage behind a transparent nose (similar to the Bristol Blenheim or Heinkel He 111H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a conventional canopy.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, {{anthropologist}} Arnold Henry Savage Landor {{described the}} Ainu as having deep-set eyes and an eye shape typical of Europeans, {{with a large}} and prominent browridge, large ears, hairy and prone to baldness, slightly flattened hook <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> large and broad nostrils, prominent cheek bones, large mouth and thick lips and a long region from nose to mouth and small chin region.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the leather}} is natural {{as well as}} delicate, the wearer must take {{precaution}} as to not damage them. The constant handling of damp or wet surfaces will discolor lighter-colored gloves and stiffen the leather of any glove. The wearer will often unknowingly damage or stain their gloves while doing such tasks as twisting a wet door knob or wiping a running <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a gloved hand.|$|E
25|$|If {{hospital}} {{care is not}} possible, the World Health Organization has guidelines for care at home that have been relatively successful. In such situations, recommendations include using towels soaked in bleach solutions when moving infected people or bodies and applying bleach on stains. It is also recommended that the caregivers wash hands with bleach solutions and cover their mouth and <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a cloth.|$|E
25|$|The paramedian {{forehead}} flap has two disadvantages, one operational and one aesthetic: Operationally, {{the reconstruction}} of a <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a paramedian forehead flap is a two-stage surgical procedure, which might {{a problem for the}} patient whose health (surgical suitability) includes significant, secondary medical risks. Nonetheless, the second stage of the nasal reconstruction can be performed with the patient under local anaesthesia. Aesthetically, although the flap donor-site scar heals well, it is noticeable, and thus difficult to conceal, especially in men.|$|E

25|$|Listen to it — Ezra! Ezra! And a {{third time}} — Ezra! He has a wonderful, {{beautiful}} face, a high forehead, prominent over the eyes; a long delicate <b>nose,</b> <b>with</b> little, red, nostrils; a strange mouth, never still & quite elusive; a square chin, slightly cleft in the middle — the whole face pale; the eyes grey-blue; the hair golden-brown, and curling in soft wavy crinkles. Large grotesque eyes, with long, well-shaped fingers and beautiful nails.|$|E
25|$|Proprioception, the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E
25|$|Development of the SB continued, meanwhile, with {{revisions}} {{being made}} to reflect the lessons of early operations in Spain. As problems were encountered in converting pilots to fly the SB, a trainer version, the USB was built in September 1937, with a modified <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> an open cockpit for an instructor and dual controls. Problems were also encountered with the armament, the nose guns having limited traverse and so being little use against head-on attacks and later aircraft were modified with a better field of fire. From 1940, the dorsal gun position was replaced by an enclosed turret, while the ventral gun position, which was difficult to use, was also modified.|$|E
