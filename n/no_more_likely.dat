Scholars have stressed that Welsh and Cornish place-names from the Roman period seem <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to survive than English ones: 'clearly name loss was a Romano-British phenomenon, not just one associated with Anglo-Saxon incomers'. Other explanations for the replacement of Roman period place-names include adaptation of Celtic names such that they now seem to come from Old English; a more gradual loss of Celtic names than was once assumed; and new names being coined (in the newly dominant English language) because instability of settlements and land-tenure.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of all the things said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the {{national}} health ministries of the listed countries reviewed the pertinent studies for causal links among silicone-gel breast implants and systemic and auto-immune diseases. The collective conclusion {{is that there is}} no evidence establishing a causal connection between the implantation of silicone breast implants and either type of disease. The affected women complained of systemic disease manifested as fungal, neurologic, and rheumatologic ailments. The Danish study Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants (2004) reported that women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report an excessive number of rheumatic disease symptoms than would the women of the control group. The follow-up study Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update (2006) reported a decreased standardized mortality ratio and an increased risk of lung cancer death among breast implant patients, than among patients for other types of plastic surgery; the mortality rate differences were attributed to tobacco smoking. The study Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants (2006), about some 25,000 women with breast implants, reported a 43 per cent lower rate of breast cancer among them than among the general populace, and a lower-than-average risk of cancer.|$|E

Bias blind spot does, however, appear to increase susceptibility to related biases.

During the 1976 federal election campaign, Jimmy Carter made it one of the Democratic Party's platforms, saying [...] "The B-1 bomber {{is an example of a}} proposed system which should not be funded and would be wasteful of taxpayers' dollars." ...|$|E
500|$|The white (W) locus {{was first}} {{recognized}} in mice in 1908. The mutation {{of the same}} name produces a belly spot and interspersed white hairs on the dorsal aspect of the coat in the heterozygote (W/+) and black-eyed white in the homozygote (W/W). While heterozygotes are healthy, homozygous W mice have severe macrocytic anemia and die within days. A mutation which affects multiple systems is [...] "pleiotropic." [...] Following the mapping of the KIT gene to the W locus in 1988, researchers began identifying other mutations as part of an allelic series of W. There are over 90 known W alleles, each representing a unique mutation on the KIT gene, which primarily produce white spotting from tiny head spots to fully white coats, macrocytic anemia from mild to lethal, and sterility. Some alleles, such as sash produce white spotting alone, while others affect the health of the animal even in the heterozygous state. Alleles encoding small amounts of white are <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be linked with anemia and sterility than those encoding conspicuous white. Presently, no anecdotal or research evidence has suggested that equine KIT mutations affect health or fertility. A recent study showed that blood parameters in horses with the W1 mutation were normal.|$|E
