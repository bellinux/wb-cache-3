5|$|As Tropical Depression 07W, locally named 'Henry' by PAGASA, <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> provence the {{northern}} Philippines, {{a total of}} 17 provinces were placed under a storm alert as winds of 30kts (55km/h) were likely to affect areas near the depression. Residents in {{the northern}} Philippines were advised to avoid low-lying areas and be alert for flooding. About 15,000 people were evacuated following heavy rains from the outer bands of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 26, Tropical Storm Kyle {{was deemed}} {{to be a threat}} to Bermuda and a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the islands. Later that day the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning as the storm <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> island. The following day, the warning was discontinued as Hurricane Kyle bypassed the island.|$|E
5|$|L'Estrange {{performed}} in the Domain from January through to April 1877, but not without incident. On 7 February 1877, as L'Estrange <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> end of his wire act, sparks from the fireworks going off around him fell into the nearby store of gunpowder and fireworks, igniting them. The store's shed was demolished, a surrounding fence knocked down, part of L'Estrange's performance tent caught fire, and two young boys were injured.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, Fern reached hurricane {{status as}} it <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> Texas coastline. The hurricane reached a peak intensity of 90mph (140km/h) and its barometric pressure dropped to 979 millibars. An incoming mid-latitude trough caused Fern to stall east of Texas for twelve hours. After the trough moved by, Fern turned southwest, paralleling the Texas coastline before making landfall on September 10 between Freeport and Matagorda.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} increased {{again in}} November 1985 as magma <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur {{began to appear}} in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard around the building during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take the building. As the crowd <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> building, the police opened fire. Several were injured and the crowd was driven away.|$|E

30|$|Other endwall suction schemes {{minimally}} {{influence the}} distribution of exit flow angles. The variations are mainly <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall. The overturning of flow angles <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall decreases because these endwall suction schemes decrease the cross-passage pressure gradient <b>near</b> <b>the</b> end wall, especially between the suction surface and the suction slot. ESB increases the exit flow angles <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall most.|$|R
5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|As Mikawa's force <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships {{launched}} three floatplanes for {{one final}} reconnaissance of the Allied ships, {{and to provide}} illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of the Allied ships heard and/or observed {{one or more of}} these floatplanes, starting at 23:45 on August 8, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat, and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner.|$|E
5|$|As Representative Mark Larson <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> {{end of his}} term-limited {{tenure in}} the Colorado House of Representatives, Roberts began {{to work with him}} on {{learning}} the legislative process, in preparation for seeking elected office herself. She instigated a bill, introduced by Larson and eventually signed into law, to require that remains be handled in accordance with the wishes of the deceased. She also lobbied the legislature, unsuccessfully, for the creation of an interim committee to study palliative care.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{the high}} command of Nazi Germany {{transferred}} most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> city {{and the head of}} the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses were in danger. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were threatened by the advancing Soviet army, which might have slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of its duration, Agatha steered toward the north while {{embedded}} within a deep southerly flow. Steady intensification continued, and the storm reached winds of 50 mph (90 km/h) six hours after being upgraded as it <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> coast of Mexico. By the afternoon of June 2, the center exhibited an elongated appearance within its associated central dense overcast, a large area of organized mid-tropospheric convection. Around 1800 UTC that same day, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg).|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was shown}} to {{potential}} distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers {{did not feel that}} it was a good deal. As the film <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Arlene {{originated}} {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} associated with a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline on August8. Tracking towards the southeast in a gradual anticyclonic loop, the system slowly increased in organization and intensity. By August10, the low <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas but remained disorganized. The following day, while located over Andros Island, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression, the third of the season, based on its appearance on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked {{towards the}} {{northeast}} {{in response to}} an area of low pressure within the westerlies. By October11, the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg) after bypassing the Azores islands. Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran had little effect on land.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{officials}} {{declared a}} yellow alert, moderate hazard, as Hurricane Ida <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> Yucatán Peninsula on November9. Roughly 36,000 tourists and 1,500 residents were evacuated from coastal areas of Quintana Roo. The Mexican Navy {{was placed on}} standby to assist in relief efforts once the storm had passed. Later that day, the alert was raised to red, the highest level, as hurricane-force winds and heavy rains threatened the region. A total of 95 shelters were opened {{in the state to}} house the evacuees.|$|E

Kemp prepared {{an open letter to}} Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham and other conservative talk show hosts on McCain's behalf to quell their dissatisfactions. In addition, Kemp and Phil Gramm advised McCain on economic policy.|$|E
5|$|On October18, another {{period of}} {{intensification}} took {{place as the}} storm <b>neared</b> <b>the</b> northern Philippines. Early in the day, Elsie was upgraded to a super typhoon, a storm with winds of at least 240km/h (150mph). Hours before making landfall in Luzon, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a barometric pressure of 898hPa (mbar). The peak intensity of Elsie was assessed by the JMA at the same time. They reported that the typhoon attained winds of 175km/h (115mph 10-minute sustained) and a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar). The center of Elsie crossed the Philippine coastline at around 0300UTC on October19.|$|E
