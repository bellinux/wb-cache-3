The following day, the inspectorate gave permission for the trains to be taken into use, despite noting a series of <b>non-conformities</b> with safety regulations: the inspectorate lacked a list of the train's deviations from the safety regulations; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains, particularly when automatic train stop was disconnected; lack of safety training for the crew; lack of an evacuation analysis; and lack of control of the marking of safety equipment. Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks. Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical.|$|E

In some studies, a majority of those who identify as gay or lesbian self-report gender <b>non-conformity</b> as children. However, the accuracy of these studies have been questioned, especially within the academic community. The therapeutic community is currently divided on the proper response to childhood gender <b>non-conformity.</b> One study suggested that childhood gender <b>non-conformity</b> is heritable.Although it is heavily associated with homosexuality, gender nonconformity {{is more likely to}} predict childhood abuse. A recent study illustrated that heterosexuals and homosexuals alike who do not express their gender roles according to society are more likely to experience abuse physically, sexually, and psychologically.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} which {{dimensions of}} schizotypy {{are associated with}} a reduction in latent inhibition (LI), akin to that seen in schizophrenia. DESIGN: LI was compared in low and high scorers on the four dimensions of the OLIFE questionnaire (Mason, Claridge, & Jackson, 1995), with the predictions that the unusual experiences and impulsive <b>non-conformity</b> subscales would be associated with loss of LI, while the introvertive anhedonia subscale would not be. METHODS: A total of 80 healthy volunteers completed a visual LI task. Half of these participants were pre-exposed to the conditioning stimulus; the others were not. The primary outcome measure was the number of trials taken to learn the task. RESULTS: LI was reduced for the dimensions of unusual experiences, impulsive <b>non-conformity</b> and cognitive disorganization. There was no effect of introvertive anhedonia. The effect of unusual experiences and impulsive <b>non-conformity</b> upon LI was mediated via changes in the pre-exposure group and not in the non-pre-exposed group. Conversely, high scorers on the cognitive disorganization scale showed slower learning in non-pre-exposure, but with no effect upon stimulus pre-exposure. As the unusual experiences and implusive <b>non-conformity</b> scales were correlated, we examined if either of these was primary. Analysis showed unusual experiences to be primary, with impulsive <b>non-conformity</b> not contributing significant additional independent variance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the proposition that the cognitive processes underlying the mediation of LI are related to the genesis of unusual experiences in schizotypy and, by extension, the positive symptoms of schizophrenia...|$|R
50|$|Parents {{with gender}} {{non-conforming}} children {{may not know}} where to turn to express their feelings. Many parents accept their child’s choice but are more concerned for the overall well being of the child. In some cases families are not accepting of their child’s <b>non-conformity,</b> typically lashing out with punishment grounded on homophobia and sexism. Regardless of the stance a parent decides to take on gender <b>non-conformity,</b> it will affect the child and the child’s relationship with the family.|$|R
50|$|Corrective and {{preventive}} action (CAPA, also called corrective action / preventive action, or simply corrective action) are improvements to an organization's processes taken to eliminate causes of <b>non-conformities</b> or other undesirable situations. It {{is usually a}} set of actions which are required to be taken and implemented in an organization at levels of manufacturing, documentation, procedures or systems in order to rectify and eliminate the recurrence of nonperformance. Nonperformance is identified after systematic evaluation {{and analysis of the}} root cause of the nonperformance. Non-conformance may be a market complaint or customer complaint or a failure of a machinery or a quality management system, or misinterpretation of written instructions to carryout a work. The corrective {{and preventive}} action is designed by a team including quality assurance personnel and the personnel involved in the actual observation point of nonconfirmance, and is required to be systematically implemented and observed for its ability to eliminate further recurrence of such non-conformation in future.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} how {{contact with}} {{gay and lesbian}} persons affects adolescents' attitudes toward them, and whether this association is mediated or moderated by one's acceptance of gender <b>non-conformity.</b> We analyzed survey responses from 456 Dutch adolescents aged 12 - 15 who reported having no same-sex attractions. Data were collected in 2008 at 8 schools in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Preliminary analyses showed that contact with lesbian/gay persons outside of school was positively associated with attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Multilevel analyses showed that acceptance of gender <b>non-conformity</b> mediated rather than moderated the relationship between intergroup contact and sexual prejudice in males. The effect of intergroup contact on females' attitudes toward lesbian women was no longer significant in multilevel analyses. The findings suggest that attention to both intergroup contact and acceptance of gender <b>non-conformity</b> would enhance our understanding of attitudes toward homosexuality in adolescents...|$|R

However, the feature specification task is usually based on natural language, which can present lack of clarity, <b>non-conformities</b> and defects. In {{order to understand}} the feature non-conformity in SPL, this paper presents an empirical study to investigate the possible correlation between feature granularity and feature non-conformity, based on an SPL industrial project in the medical domain. The investigation aims at exploring the features <b>non-conformities</b> and their likely root causes using results from a previous study, which captured and classified 137 features <b>non-conformities,</b> identified in 92 features. The findings indicated that there is significant association between the variables feature interaction and feature granularity. From predictive models to estimate feature <b>non-conformities</b> based on feature granularity and feature in teraction values, the variable feature interaction presented positive influence on the feature non-conformity and the variable feature granularity presented negative influence on the variable feature non-conformity...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the most {{frequent}} <b>non-conformities</b> identified in different European countries in the processes of forest management certification according to FSC standards. A total of 31 active certificates from five countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Romania, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) were analysed, including all active certificates (as of 1 st of June 2014) from three countries along with a sample of 13 FSC certificates issued in the UK and one certificate covering 95 % of the certified forest area in Slovenia. 253 <b>non-conformities</b> in relation to FSC standard requirements were identified as formulated by the audit teams and the most frequently identified <b>non-conformities</b> in the certification process were those related to Principle 6 - Environmental impact (34 %), Principle 4 - Community relations and workerâ€™s rights (17 %) and Principle 8 - Monitoring and Assessment (13 %). A slight positive correlation was noticed between the FSC certified area and the total number of <b>non-conformities,</b> with a closer link in the case of Principle 9 - Maintenance of high conservation value forests, and Principle 4. The <b>non-conformities</b> related to Principles 4, 6 and 9 appeared to be significantly influenced in occurrence by country development; less often in the UK compared with the other four countries...|$|E
