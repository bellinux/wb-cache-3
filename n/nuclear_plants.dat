5|$|For decades, {{nuclear power}} {{has played a}} limited role {{relative}} to many other developed countries, {{in part because of}} public perception {{in the wake of a}} 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants</b> were filed.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{numerous}} radioactive isotopes of zirconium, 93Zr {{is among the}} most common. It is released as a product of 235U, mainly in <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants</b> and during nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s. It has a very long half-life (1.53 million years), its decay emits only low energy radiations, and it is not considered as highly hazardous.|$|E
50|$|The Jinshan <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> or Chin Shan <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (金山核能發電廠), First <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (第一核能發電廠 or 核一), is a <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> in Shimen, New Taipei, Taiwan. Commissioned in 1978 for {{its first}} <b>nuclear</b> reactor, the <b>plant</b> is Taiwan's first <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> as well as Taiwan's {{smallest}} <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sinop <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (Sinop Nükleer Enerji Santrali) is {{a planned}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant</b> located at Sinop in {{northern}} Turkey. It {{will be the}} country's second <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> after the projected Akkuyu <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kuosheng <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> or Guosheng <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (國聖核能發電廠), Second <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (第二核能發電廠 or 核二), is a <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> in Wanli, New Taipei, Taiwan. The {{plant is}} {{currently}} the largest <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> in Taiwan, before {{the opening of the}} 2,700 MW Longmen <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> which is still under construction.|$|R
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants,</b> require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants.</b> Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E
5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants,</b> benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 to be built in 2040 for about half the cost of a fission plant today.|$|E

5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the US Department of Energy and conducted by Oregon State University, the Idaho National Laboratory, and other colleges beginning in 2000. At the time, Oregon State's nuclear department had been developing passive water-circulation techniques for cooling in <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants.</b> The research grant ended in 2003, but {{a group of scientists}} at Oregon State University continued the work. They built a test lab at one-third the actual scale of the technology and inherited related patents from the university in 2007, in exchange for a small equity in the company. NuScale was founded that same year. Its first funding round was in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum. It began seeking certification with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|Jordan aims {{to benefit}} from its large uranium {{reserves}} with two <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants,</b> 1000 MW each, scheduled for completion in 2025. Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity compared with its other Arab neighbours. The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce a minimal amount of Jordan's electricity needs. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds reach over 7m/s in the mountainous areas. King Abdullah inaugurated several large-scale projects like the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant in the 2010s. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. The government has set a target to satisfy 20% of Jordan's electrical consumption with renewable resources by 2020, a total of around 1800 MW.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants.</b> In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E

50|$|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Itochu {{will build}} the power plant, {{which will have}} a {{capacity}} of around 4,480 MWe. Four generation III pressurized water reactors (PWR) of type Atmea I developed by Atmea will be installed in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant.</b> French electric utility company Engie {{will be in charge}} of the operation of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant.</b> It is intended that Turkish Electricity Generation Corporation (EÜAŞ) will have 20-45% shares in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants</b> can also secure substantial emission benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such as Los Angeles, México City, Santiago, Chile, São Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, {{the location of the}} plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.|$|E
25|$|In November 2016, a {{referendum}} was held concerning a Green Party initiative {{that would have}} phased out all <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants</b> after a life-span of 45 years. The 3 oldest <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants</b> (Beznau 1 and 2, and Mühleberg) {{would have had to}} be shut down as early as 2017, and every remaining plant by 2029.
