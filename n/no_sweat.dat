25|$|The common ostrich has <b>no</b> <b>sweat</b> glands, {{and under}} heat stress {{they rely on}} panting to reduce their body temperature. Panting {{increases}} evaporative heat (and water) loss from its respiratory surfaces, therefore forcing air and heat removal without the loss of metabolic salts. Panting allows the common ostrich {{to have a very}} effective respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL). Heat dissipated by respiratory evaporation increases linearly with ambient temperature, matching the rate of heat production. As a result of panting the common ostrich should eventually experience alkalosis. However, The CO2 concentration in the blood does not change when hot ambient temperatures are experienced. This effect is caused by a lung surface shunt. The lung is not completely shunted, allowing enough oxygen to fulfill the bird’s metabolic needs. The common ostrich utilizes gular fluttering, rapid rhythmic contraction and relaxation of throat muscles, in a similar way to panting. Both these behaviors allow the ostrich to actively increase the rate of evaporative cooling.|$|E

5000|$|... "Sweating like a Pig" [...] {{to denote}} {{sweating}} profusely. While pigs do have sweat glands, {{they are not}} very effective, and pigs prefer wallowing in cool water or mud to keep cool. [...] The origin of this phrase {{may have to do}} with cooking a whole pig on a spit over a fire. As the pig is cooked it begins to “sweat”. While opinion varies, a slight sweat is commonly considered ideal. Too much sweating means the fire is too high and too close to the pig. Too little or <b>no</b> <b>sweating</b> means the fire is too cold or too far from the pig.|$|R

After the first encore of the tour–"Get the Party Started" [...] from Missundaztood–Pink returned to the stage wearing a black robe, as glitter fell from the ceiling. Pink would begin singing while walking {{to the center of}} the runway extension of the stage. There, she took off the robe to reveal a white leotard and joined three female acrobats covered in glitter on suspension rigging which then lifted into the air. Pink continued through the song, twirling in suspended fabric above the audience. Underneath her, the acrobats performed, according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "slow-motion, geometric Cirque du Soleil poses". The apparatus dropped her into a tank of water and lifted her again to the air, before descending her at the end of the performance. Michael Menachem of Billboard commented, [...] "When Pink finally touched down, she continued singing with bombast, as though the entire spectacle had been <b>no</b> <b>sweat.</b> If the rest of the show hadn't already made the case that Pink has one of the best pop-rock voices—and the most brazen moves—of her generation of stars, this final moment certainly did".|$|E

40|$|Heat {{loss and}} {{moisture}} retention properties of footwear were characterized using a walking thermal manikin foot. The {{same type of}} military boot was equipped with different membranes: (i) GORE TEX with IQ TEX, (ii) halve OUTDRY, (iii) full OUTDRY, and (iv) OUTDRY with IQ TEX. In a separate experiment a single boot type {{was used to evaluate}} four different sock fabrics: (i) wool/polypropylene, (ii) polypropylene, (iii) polypropylene/polyamide, and (iv) wool/polyamide. Both boot membranes and sock fabrics were assessed under three conditions: (i) standstill <b>no</b> <b>sweating,</b> (ii) walking <b>no</b> <b>sweating,</b> and (iii) walking and sweating. The walking rate was set at 15 step min- 1 and the sweat rates were 9 g h- 1 and 12 g h- 1, for boot membrane and sock fabric measurements, respectively. Moisture retention was assessed by weighing the footwear components before and after each measurement. GORE TEX with IQ TEX resulted in a higher heat loss during walking without sweating compared to the other membranes (p= 0. 017). GORE TEX with IQ TEX retained more moisture in the sock compared to the other membranes (p < 0. 001) but also retained more moisture in the inlay sole compared to halve OUTDRY (p= 0. 015). No differences in heat loss were found among sock fabrics, while wool/polyamide retained more moisture compared to polypropylenežpolyamide (p= 0. 036). Furthermore, a moisture vapour transmission rate of 61. 2 +- 6. 6 g m- 2 h- 1 was calculated for all sweating conditions. Finally, the measurements suggest that no pumping effect takes place in the measured footwear under the present conditions. Relevance to industry: Understanding heat loss and moisture retention of footwear is necessary for optimization of footwear for blister incidence and (thermal) comfor...|$|R

40|$|Controversy remains {{regarding}} the thermoregulatory sweat function in Parkinson disease (PD) patients. We herein performed both a thermoregulatory sweat test and palmar sweat test in PD patients {{and discuss the}} function of the perspiratory sympathetic nervous system. At the same time, we also carried out digital plethysmography, the head-up tilt test, [^ I] raeto-iodobenzylguanidine (^ I-MIBG) myocardium scintigraphy, cognitive tests while, in addition, discussing the spread of autonomic dysfunction and relationship between palmar sweating and cognitive function. According to the findings of the thermoregulatory sweat test, two patients demonstrated anhidrosis, while one showed partial hypohidrosis. Because one case who had anhidrosis also showed other severe autonomic dysfunctions, the dysfunction of the perspiratory nervous sytem in this case was thus considered to be severe. However, another case who had ahidrosis showed no other autonomic dysfunction. The thermoregulatory sweating in PD patients was therefore suspected to not be involved with the autonomic nervous system. On the other hand, five of nine patients showed <b>no</b> <b>sweating</b> evoked by mental and somanosensory tasks. These results were considered to not be related to the cognitive function but three of five patients showed a cardiovascular dysfunction. Depending on these results, the palmar sweating in PD patients was therefore supeculated to be caused by an invasion of sympathetic ganglions...|$|R

40|$|Skin {{pressure}} application on {{one side}} of the lateral chest of experimental subject led to a decrease of sweat production on the ipsilateral side of the skin. This is the so-called hemihidrotic phenomenon which was first described by Kuno. The purpose of the study was to reconfirm the hemihidrotic phenomenon by the application of skin pressure with a special newly designed apparatus. Local heat load or general heat load was applied to induce thermal sweating, detected by capacitance hygrometer-sweat capture capsule method on both sides of the forehead and chest in an environmental control chamber. Sweat-onset time was markedly prolonged on the ipsilateral side of skin pressure application. In addition, strong suppression of sweat production was observed close to the skin pressure application area. Skin temperatures were detected by means of thermistors and thermography, under the condition of <b>no</b> <b>sweating.</b> Chest skin temperature detected by thermistors at the ipsilateral side of pressure application was lower than that of the contralateral side. However, cheek skin temperature detected by thermography at the ipsilateral side of pressure application was higher than that of the contralateral side.
