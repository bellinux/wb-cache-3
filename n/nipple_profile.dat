40|$|In this thesis, the {{operations}} regarding the tubing hanger crown plugs {{and the internal}} tree cap are studied and analyzed based on experience data collected from the Statoilo perated fields of Norne, Gullfaks, Åsgard and Heidrun. The Internal Tree Cap (ITC) has been analyzed considering operations involving puling of the lower Tubing Hanger Crown Plug (THCP) through the ball valve. Due {{to the extent of}} the problems seen with operating the ball valve, the cap is recommended pulled before pulling the lower crown plug. A contingency procedure is described in form of a decision tree, and should be use if the cap for some reason is not pulled. For the lower THCP problems have been identified for both pulling and setting operations. Problems with the Upper Wireline Plug (UWLP) are mostly during setting operations. For the lower THCP premature setting of the plug {{is one of the main}} problems. The premature setting is seen in connection with use of a brass pin as the upper shear pin in the CPHRT. A steel-steel combination for the two shear pins in the hydraulic running tool is therefore recommended. The CPHRT should also always be checked for water intrusion in order to ensure that the pistons in the RT are free to move all theway down when trying to lock the dogs into the tubing hanger <b>nipple</b> <b>profile.</b> It is recommended that the number of pistons in the running tool and the setting pressure should follow the table given in the Halliburton manual. Different methods have been used for pulling the THCP. Equalizing across the plug isseen as a necessity for a successful pulling operation. The pulling method with the highest success rate is the”Pressure up above” method. This method is currently just in use for the RLWI system but it is recommended that it be adapted and used for pulling through the WOR. Braided wire should be used when pulling the plug. Displacing fluid through the ¼” TCI-line between the upper and lower plug is seen asone of the challenges when trying to set the UWLP. Calculations done for setting inthe WOR and MR show that the pressure needed in the riser is dependent on the displacement velocity. The higher the pressure in the riser the faster the fluid willdisplace through the TCI-line. In the MR only hydrostatic pressure is available so alonger displacement time should be accounted for. A design failure with the UWLP setting tool has been investigated. When the runningtool is set in compression, a premature energizing of the plug locking dogs can occurand the plug is not able to set. It is recommended that the running tool should be held in tension until the plug has landed and it should be evaluated if a re-design of the tool is needed. New technology regarding the crown plugs is presented. This new technology includes an equalizing crown plug, a motorized setting tool and a pulling/jetting toolall under development for FMC Technologies. Best practice guidelines are developing for the installation and retrieval of the crown plugs based on the analyses performed. Best practice guidelines and recommendations are also made for operating the ITC. The analysis and recommendations given in this thesis should be used as a basis for developing a finalized best practice for crown plug operations. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a simple, fast, {{and accurate}} method for automatically locating the nipple on digitized mammograms {{that have been}} segmented to reveal the skin-air interface. If the average gradient of the intensity is computed in the direction normal to the interface and directed inside the breast, {{it is found that}} there is a sudden and distinct change in this parameter close to the nipple. A <b>nipple</b> in <b>profile</b> is located between two successive maxima of this parameter; otherwise, it is near the global maximum. Specifically, the nipple is located midway between a successive maximum and minimum of the derivative of the average intensity gradient; these being local turning points for a <b>nipple</b> in <b>profile</b> and global otherwise. The method has been tested on 24 images, including both oblique and cranio-caudal views, from two digital mammogram databases. For 23 of the images (96 %), the rms error was less than 1 mm at image resolutions of 400 μm and 420 μm per pixel. Because of its simplicity, and because it is based both on the observed behavior of mammographic tissue intensities and on geometry, this method has the potential to become a generic method for locating the nipple on mammograms...|$|R
40|$|Mammograms are X-ray {{images of}} the {{compressed}} breast and are widely used for early detection of breast cancer. A mammogram must be of sufficient quality for the radiologist to detect lesions or other abnormalities with high sensitivity and specificity. Some algorithms are presented for the automatic assessment {{of the quality of}} positioning on mediolateral oblique (MLO) view mammograms. Anatomic features, including the breast border, nipple location and pectoral margin, were first extracted from each image. Then several quality criteria, including breast tissue exclusion, <b>nipple</b> in <b>profile,</b> inclusion of inframammary fold, and positioning of the pectoral muscle, were used to assess the adequacy of breast positioning. The assessment method was tested on 322 digitized mammograms in the MIAS database...|$|R
50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking <b>profiles</b> (<b>nipples)</b> {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole <b>profile</b> (<b>nipple).</b> The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.|$|R
