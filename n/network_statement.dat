Congress {{has found that the}} Iranian government continues to engage in systematic and ongoing violations of human rights, including the suppression of freedom of expression. Such violations have reportedly increased {{in the aftermath of the}} disputed presidential election in Iran on June 12, 2009. Of particular concern has been the Iranian regime's crackdown on freedom of expression and interference with the use of the Internet, mobile phones, and other means of communication in order to restrict the free flow of information. According to a Freedom House report, the Iranian authorities have employed extensive and sophisticated methods to tamper with Internet access, mobile phone services, and satellite broadcasting; monitor dissenters online; and use monitored information to intimidate and arrest dissenters. The U. S. government, governments of other nations, and nongovernmental organizations have expressed concern that firms outside Iran have aided the Iranian government in monitoring and suppressing its citizens' activities. For example, in 2008, Nokia Siemens Network, as part of a contract for mobile phone network technology, sold communications monitoring equipment to the Iranian government. As a result of credible reports that the Iranian government misused the technology to suppress dissent and freedom of speech, the company halted all work related to monitoring centers in Iran in March 2009, according to a Nokia Siemens <b>Network</b> <b>statement.</b> Congress directed us to review issues related to Iran's monitoring, filtering, and disruption of information and communications flows in two mandates: (1) Section 106 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) requires us to review a procurement ban against entities that export technologies to the Iranian government for monitoring, filtering, and disrupting information and communications flows, and (2) Senate Report 111 - 201 related to the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 directs us to identify entities that have a financial interest in the development of Iran's ability to monitor, filter, and disrupt information and communication flows and determine which entities have contracts with the U.

40|$|A m?dia tem desempenhado um papel de extrema relev?ncia no processo de constru??o/desconstru??o/reconstru??o de identidades e representa??es na sociedade contempor?nea. Na era da midiatiza??o, muitos dos perfis identit?rios de nossa sociedade, em todas as ?reas de atua??o, t?m se originado a partir do cotidiano das produ??es jornal?sticas de nossas institui??es midi?ticas. O presente estudo busca analisar o trabalho discursivo operado pela m?dia no ?mbito do discurso pol?tico, abordando os efeitos de sentido produzidos pela revista Veja em torno do processo de discursiviza??o do esquema de corrup??o, denominado pelas diversas m?dias como o ?Caso do Mensal?o?. A escolha pela Veja foi motivada pela pr?tica do jornalismo investigativo e de den?ncia. Pela posi??o que ocupa no mercado de vendas de revista, assim como pela credibilidade que defende em rela??o ao discurso pol?tico, que atravessa o seu discurso jornal?stico. Para tanto, pesquisamos, mediante {{consulta}} ao acervo digital da revista Veja, mat?rias e imagens do referido ve?culo de comunica??o, as quais trataram de tal acontecimento hist?rico. Buscamos, especificamente, verificar como foi produzido o jogo de sentidos relacionado ? figura do ex-presidente Lula e ao caso de corrup??o que teve o envolvimento de importantes personagens do Governo do ent?o presidente, a partir da an?lise de enunciados verbais e imag?ticos. O intuito desse empreendimento anal?tico ? o de contribuir para a identifica??o de aspectos constitutivos do complexo dom?nio imagin?rio pol?tico da sociedade brasileira, do in?cio das investiga??es do caso (2005) aos dias atuais. Nosso corpus anal?tico ? constitu?do por capas da revista, referidas ao presidente Lula, que foram publicadas desde o in?cio do caso. Este estudo ? fruto de pesquisas da produ??o identit?ria na esfera midi?tica, assim como os discursos do cotidiano na perspectiva da an?lise do discurso de linha francesa (AD), seguindo a orienta??o te?rica de Michel P?cheux, Michel Foucault e Jean-Jacques Courtine. Esta ? uma teoria de interpreta??o que tem como um de seus primeiros objetivos lan?ar m?o da dimens?o da Hist?ria, da Lingu?stica e da Psican?lise para alcan?ar a tessitura do interdito, do equ?voco, de uma exterioridade que lhe ? constitutiva. Neste trabalho, utilizamos as categorias de an?lise relacionadas ? mem?ria, como interdiscurso, redes de mem?ria, enunciado, sujeito, forma??o discursiva etc., bem como analisaremos, sobretudo as imagens, sob a perspectiva da semiologia hist?rica. A pertin?ncia deste trabalho reside no fato de que ele pretende levar a uma reflex?o cr?tica sobre como a m?dia afeta nosso cotidiano e nossa mem?ria coletiva, a partir do enfoque no discurso pol?tico; como a m?dia funciona enquanto espa?o de re-constru??o de significados e lugar de conflu?ncia de sentidos entrecruzados. Em suma, como o discurso pol?tico tem se adequado ? ?ntima, complexa e pr?xima rela??o com os meios de comunica??o de massa de nossa sociedade contempor?nea. The {{media has}} developed a role of extreme relevance {{in the process of}} construction/deconstruction/reconstruction of identities and representations on contemporaneous society. In the mediatized era, a lot of identities profiles of our society, in all the areas of actuation, have been originated from the daily journalistic productions of our media institutions. The present study aims to analyze the discursive work operated by media in the range of the political discourse, approaching the sense effects produced by the Veja magazine about the process of discursivization of the corruption scheme, nominated by the diverse media as the ?Caso do Mensal?o?. The choice for Veja was motivated by the practice of the reporting and investigative journalism. By the position that it occupies in the market of magazine sailing, as well as the credibility that it champion in relation to the political discourse, which crosses its journalistic discourse. For that, we researched, beyond consultation to the digital collection of the Veja magazine, materials and images of the referred communication vehicle, which treated of this historical happening. We sought, specifically, to verify how the senses game was produced in relation to the figure of the ex-president Lula and to the case of corruption that had the involvement of important people from the Govern of this president, from the analysis of verbal and imagetic statements. The intention of this analytic enterprise it to contribute to the identification of constitutive aspects of the complex imaginary politic domain of the Brazilian society, the start of the case studies (2005) to today. Our analytic corpus is constituted of magazine covers, referred to the president Lula, which were published {{since the beginning of the}} case. This study is the fruit of researches of the identity production in the mediatic sphere, as well as the daily discourses in the perspective of the French discourse analysis (DA), following the theoretical orientation of Michel P?cheux, Michel Foucault and Jean-Jacques Courtine. This is an interpretation theory that has as one of its first objectives to consider the dimensions of History, Linguistics and Psychoanalysis to achieve the range of an exteriority that is constitutive to it. In this work, we used the categories of analysis related to memory, as interdiscourse, memory <b>network,</b> <b>statement,</b> subject, discursive formation etc., as well we analyzed, specially the images, on the perspective of historic semiology. The pertinence of this work is consisted by the fact that it intends to promote a critical reflection about how the media affects our daily life and our collective memory, from the focus on the political discourse; how the media works as a space of re-construction of meanings and place of intercrossed senses confluence. In summary, how the political discourse has been adequate to the intimate, complex and next relation with the mass communicative means of our contemporaneous society...|$|E
