500|$|An 1837 essay of his, {{centered}} on a debate regarding the translation of Homer's works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> criticism, children, it {{is the time for}} writing, so write as much and as good as you can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer. Write with a clear conscience". Paraphrased as [...] "Write anything, boys, as long as you go on writing!" [...] (Scrieţi, băieţi, orice, numai scrieţi!), this quote became the topic of derision in later decades, and was hailed as an example of Heliade's failure to distinguish between quality and quantity. The latter verdict was considered unfair by the literary historian Şerban Cioculescu and others, who argued that Ion Heliade Rădulescu's main goal was to encourage the rapid development of local literature to a European level. Although he recognized, among other things, Heliade's merits of having removed pretentious boyar discourse from poetry and having favored regular rhyme, Paul Zarifopol accused him and Gheorghe Asachi of [...] "tastelessness" [...] and [...] "literary insecurity". He elaborated: [...] "Rădulescu was arguably afflicted with this sin more than Asachi, given his unfortunate ambitions of fabricating a literary language".|$|E

2500|$|Saving Hope: The Long Way to the Arab Spring (...) is a 2013 non-fiction book by Bahraini {{cultural}} critic Nader Kadhim. Written in Arabic, it is {{the ninth}} book by Kadhim, {{who works as a}} Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bahrain. Written in two stages, before and during the Arab Spring, the book discusses this wave of protests from two sides; the past and the future. The past is divided into three waves, each of them corresponding to an era of hope and aspiration. First is the enlightenment wave, followed by the revolutionary wave and finally the democratic wave. The author then tackles the Arab Spring and argues that it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> celebration, but an important station in the long way towards democracy.|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{to the day}} the Prime Minister {{triggered}} Article 50, formally {{allowing the}} process of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Scottish Parliament voted 69 to 59 in favour of another independence referendum, formally giving Sturgeon the legal mandate to write to Theresa May to allow another referendum to take place. By the end of that week, on March 30, 2017, Sturgeon wrote to the Prime Minister requesting a Section 30 order, formally devolving the responsibility and power to the Scottish Government to plan for and hold another referendum on Scottish Independence. Previously, May and David Mundell, Secretary of State for Scotland, have both highlighted that as the negotiations begin with the European Union on the United Kingdom's withdraw, it is important for Scotland to work with the UK Government to get the best exit deal for both the United Kingdom and Scotland, stating that [...] "now is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> another referendum".|$|E
2500|$|Political {{analysts believe}} {{the result of}} the March 31 vote can be {{attributed}} to concerns over how a [...] "long goodbye" [...] by a sitting premier can affect governing parties. [...] There were still fresh memories across Canada of former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's lengthy retirement notice and a belief that this delay was the cause of party infighting in 2004 followed by reduction to a minority government in the 2004 federal election and then defeat in the 2006 election. [...] In addition, many Albertans believed that crucial and decisive actions would need to be taken in the coming months as a result of Alberta's booming economy and massive budgetary surplus, thus they believed it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a lame duck premier to remain in office. [...] Even worse for some, Premier Klein's retirement plans, had they been carried out as intended, would inevitably have resulted in him appointing lame duck cabinet ministers who would replace the leadership candidates only to face probable removal from the Cabinet following the leadership vote.|$|E
