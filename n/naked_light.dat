In 1911 the company worked the Six Foot seam westward to a north-south fault. A cross-measures drift was dug northwards to intersect the Three Foot and Four Foot coals and between 1911 and 1914, 45 acres was worked.

5000|$|The report states: [...] "These gauze or safety lamps {{were not}} Davy lamps, {{but of a}} kind in common use {{throughout}} Scotland. They are much larger that the Davy lamp and give a better light. Mr Moore lead inspector has frequently tested them in gas, and on no occasion has the gas been exploded outside". It {{is interesting to note}} in this context that Lupton writing 15 year later inveigles against modifications to the Davy lamp including: [...] "The larger the lamp the greater the force of the explosion, and if the lamp were too large, the explosion would force the flame through the gauze; for that reason the diameter of the gauze must never be larger than 1½ inch". In addition, the Blantyre explosion was before Trimdon Grange (1882) and the Bedford Colliery Disaster of 1886 and so the shielding of gauzes from direct currents of air had not yet been introduced. Not withstanding Moore's claims for the Scottish safety lamp, the report's conclusions call for the banning of <b>naked</b> <b>lights</b> and the introduction of locked Davy lamps which [...] "are better than the present safety lamps".|$|R

50|$|After Twining was heard, Robert Grigor - Land Surveyor {{took the}} stand {{followed}} by William Wilson, one of the miners. Wilson stated that fire damp had been present in the mine {{from time to time}} since October 1878. Precautions had been taken and the mine was considered reasonably safe. He advised that in England areas of old working were usually bricked off and sealed to prevent build ups of fire damp - entering that area of the mine was considered unsafe, although Archie Hodge had been into the area to get some rails on occasion. He also recalled that Andrew Javie had been burnt in a minor explosion about three months earlier at the east end of the workings. The miners used <b>naked</b> <b>lights</b> unlike the English miners who used the safety lamps. Wilson considered that the most likely source of the explosion was the old workings as there would not enough buildup of fire damp in new workings to cause an explosion of such magnitude. John Irving, another miner gave a similar testimony and suggested that Hodge may have entered the old area to find more rails. He also said that he did not think Hodge was able to assess the danger in the old workings. The hearing was then adjourned.|$|R

Like many of the best artists of his generation he is indebted to the New York School, especially his mentor Philip Guston with whom he studied at Boston University. According to a New York Times article by Barry Schwabsky, “Guston’s lesson in cultivating the unknown has clearly stuck with Mr. Komarin. And on a more superficial level, the teacher’s peculiar sense of form can also still be traced in his former student’s work - in the way Mr. Komarin’s bulbous forms can seem to echo, in an abstract way, the cigars, cyclopean heads and <b>naked</b> <b>light</b> bulbs in Guston’s paintings.” ...|$|E

[...] Ballin had her interior design work done by Johann Poppe, the designer at Hamburg America's rival line, North German Lloyd, whose ships already had a reputation for elegance. She was immediately successful, but she and her sister ship were an economic drain on the line because they required more coal than slower ships and could not carry much freight or many steerage passengers and were therefore profitable only in the summer season, and it was risky to operate them at all from Hamburg in very bad weather, when the Elbe was packed with ice.|$|E
5000|$|The lamps {{had to be}} {{provided}} by the miners themselves, not the owners, as traditionally the miners had bought their own candles from the company store. Miners still preferred the better illumination from a <b>naked</b> <b>light,</b> and mine regulations insisting that only safety lamps be used were draconian in principle, but in practice neither observed nor enforced. After two accidents in two years (1838-9) in Cumberland pits, both caused by safety checks being {{carried out by the}} light of a naked flame, the Royal Commission on Children's Employment commented both on the failure to learn from the first accident, and on the 'further absurdity ' of 'carrying a Davy lamp in one hand for the sake of safety, and a naked lighted candle in the other, as if for the sake of danger. Beyond this there can be no conceiveable thoughtlessness and folly; and when such management is allowed in the mine of two of the most opulent coal-proprietors in the kingdom, we cease to wonder at anything that may take place in mines worked by men equally without capital and science' ...|$|E
50|$|Allan Holmes, Company Director, {{took the}} stand {{following}} Binns. He was asked whether {{he knew about the}} gas. He said that Holmes had told him in either July or August 1878. Hodge had taken quite a casual attitude to it and Holmes had asked him to institute safety lamps. Beardsmore had been tasked with inspecting the mine for fire damp prior to letting the men enter the mine. In January 1879 safety lamps had been ordered. After his evidence the Coroner provided instructions to the jury, before they retired to consider their verdict, on what they needed to determine. After 50 minutes the jury returned with a finding:First, your Worship, the Jury find that Archibald Hodge, through entering the old workings without ordinary precaution and with a <b>naked</b> <b>light,</b> caused an explosion of fire-damp whereby 34 men and boys lost their lives. Second, the Jury find That William Hodge has not used the necessary precautions to prevent an explosion of fire-damp in the mine over which he had the management. As a rider, we add that seeing that there is no law for inspection and supervision in the conduct of mining, we express the necessity of measures being adopted whereby many accidents may in the future be averted.|$|E
