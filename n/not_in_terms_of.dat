5|$|From 118 BC to 5 AD, the {{government}} minted over 28,000,000,000 coins, {{with an annual}} average of 220,000,000 coins minted (or 220,000 strings of 1,000 coins). In comparison, the Tianbao period (天寶) (742–755 AD) of the Tang dynasty produced 327,000,000 coins every year while 3,000,000,000 coins in 1045 AD and 5,860,000,000 coins in 1080 AD {{were made in the}} Song dynasty (960–1279 AD). Coin cash became the common measure of wealth during Eastern Han, as many wages were paid solely in cash. Diwu Lun (第五倫) (fl. 40–85 AD), Governor of Shu Province (modern Sichuan), described his subordinate officials' wealth <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> landholdings, but in the form of aggregate properties worth approximately 10,000,000 coin cash. Commercial transactions involving hundreds of thousands of coins were commonplace.|$|E

25|$|A {{handful of}} {{comparative}} psychologists {{have attempted to}} demonstrate quasi-economic reasoning in non-human animals. Early attempts along these lines focus {{on the behavior of}} rats and pigeons. These studies draw on the tenets of comparative psychology, where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in experimentally-tractable non-human animals. They are also methodologically similar to the work of Ferster and Skinner. Methodological similarities aside, early researchers in non-human economics deviate from behaviorism in their terminology. Although such studies are set up primarily in an operant conditioning chamber using food rewards for pecking/bar-pressing behavior, the researchers describe pecking and bar-pressing <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> reinforcement and stimulus-response relationships but instead in terms of work, demand, budget, and labor. Recent studies have adopted a slightly different approach, taking a more evolutionary perspective, comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of non-human primate, the capuchin monkey.|$|E

25|$|Nadal then played Federer in {{the final}} of Wimbledon for the third {{consecutive}} year, in the most anticipated match of their rivalry. Nadal entered the final on a 23-match winning streak, including his first career grass-court title at the Artois Championships staged at the Queen's Club in London prior to Wimbledon. Federer had won his record fifth grass-court title at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, and then reached the Wimbledon final without losing a set. Unlike their previous two Wimbledon finals, though, Federer was not the prohibitive favorite, and many analysts picked Nadal to win. They played the longest (in terms of time on court, <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> numbers of games) final in Wimbledon history, and because of rain delays, Nadal won the fifth set 9–7 in near-darkness. The match was widely lauded as the greatest Wimbledon final ever, with some tennis critics even calling it the greatest match in tennis history.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} dominions, {{provision}} {{was made for}} an Oath of Allegiance. Within dominions, such oaths were taken by parliamentarians personally towards the monarch. The Irish Oath of Allegiance was fundamentally different. It had two elements; the first, an oath to the Free State, as by law established, the second part a promise of fidelity, to His Majesty, King George V, his heirs and successors. That second fidelity element, however, was qualified in two ways. It was to the King in Ireland, not specifically to the King of the United Kingdom. Secondly, {{it was to the}} King explicitly in his role as part of the Treaty settlement, <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> pre-1922 British rule. The Oath itself came from a combination of three sources, and was largely the work of Michael Collins in the Treaty negotiations. It came in part from a draft oath suggested prior to the negotiations by President de Valera. Other sections were taken by Collins directly from the Oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), of which he was the secret head. In its structure, it was also partially based on the form and structure used for 'Dominion status'.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, J. Bruce Ismay, {{director}} general of the White Star Line, and Lord Pirrie, chairman of the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast, decided to build a trio of ocean liners of unmatched size to compete with the Cunard Line's Lusitania and Mauretania <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> speed but in terms of luxury and safety. The names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size: Olympic, Titanic and Gigantic. The plan to build these three ships was realised by naval architects Thomas Andrews and Alexander Carlisle. Construction of the Olympic and the Titanic began in 1908 and 1909 respectively. Their sizes were so large that it was necessary to build a special portico and the largest scaffolding in the world at the time in order to shelter them. Only two ships could be built at a time. The three ships were designed to be 270 metres long and to have a gross tonnage of 48,000. Their designed speed was approximately 22 knots, well below that of the Lusitania and Mauretania, but still allowing for a transatlantic crossing of less than one week.|$|E

500|$|Kenji Doya {{has argued}} that the cerebellum's {{function}} is best understood <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the behaviors it affects, but the neural computations it performs; the cerebellum consists {{of a large number of}} more or less independent modules, all with the same geometrically regular internal structure, and therefore all, it is presumed, performing the same computation. If the input and output connections of a module are with motor areas (as many are), then the module will be involved in motor behavior; but, if the connections are with areas involved in non-motor cognition, the module will show other types of behavioral correlates. Thus the cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of many differing functional traits such as affection. emotion and behavior. The cerebellum, Doya proposes, is best understood as predictive action selection based on [...] "internal models" [...] of the environment or a device for supervised learning, in contrast to the basal ganglia, which perform reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex, which performs unsupervised learning.|$|E
500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Maximum Homerdrive" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. James Plath of DVD Town {{described it as}} [...] "funny," [...] and Brian Tallerico of UGO Networks considered it {{to be one of}} the season's best episodes, describing it as having [...] "some awesome road comedy." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide gave the episode a positive review as well, writing [...] "The life of the trucker, as made popular in C. W. McCall's 1976 hit single [...] "Convoy", is brought to life here in all its glory. For once, Homer is in the right and you cannot help but cheer as the truckers spectacularly fail to stop him getting to Atlanta." [...] They concluded by writing [...] "A nice, bonding story for Homer and Bart which is diametrically opposed to the one featuring Marge and Lisa." [...] On the other hand, giving the episode a more mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "If nothing else, 'Homerdrive' takes unanticipated paths. The eating contest leads to a long truck drives leads to that 'shocking secret'. All of this means the show manages to become pretty unpredictable." [...] However, he maintained that the episode is only [...] "sporadically" [...] funny, and that it [...] "doesn’t ever excel in that department – at least <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the trucker story." [...] He enjoyed the episode's B-story more, because of its [...] "absurdity", however he criticized the inclusion of Gil in the episode, calling the character [...] "increasingly overused".

500|$|... "Meat" [...] {{was made}} {{alongside}} [...] "Sleeper", the second {{episode of the}} series which was also directed by Teague, as part of block two of production which ran from 3 June to 5 July 2007. It originally had the working title [...] "Another Working Day". In discussing {{the origins of the}} central alien writer Catherine Tregenna states that [...] "we were just throwing ideas around and true to form Russell [...] said [...] "why isn't it just a great big whale in a warehouse?"" [...] Davies states the alien was designed to be [...] "one of Torchwood and Doctor Whos biggest monsters" [...] <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> concept but its [...] "literal size". He felt this provided insight into [...] "the strangeness of life". Producer Richard Stokes states that the concept design team created an idea of what they envisaged the whale to look like. Tregenna felt that the original design for the creature was [...] "a little fanciful" [...] in that it was a bit too [...] "beautiful and exotic" [...] before deciding [...] "if it looked like that they [...] would exhibit it, it would be a freak show." [...] She characterises the final design as resembling [...] "a giant kebab". Contrary to observations from commentators, Tregenna did not intend the story to promote vegetarianism as she is not a vegetarian— she simply wanted to write an episode that was more action based than her series one episodes ("Out of Time" [...] and [...] "Captain Jack Harkness"). The hypothetical size of the space whale resulted in Teague having to find this [...] "huge great warehouse" [...] and hire a fifty-foot crane for camera angles. Whilst {{the main body of the}} alien was created using computer-generated imagery a prosthetic version of the cut wound in the side of the alien was available for the actors to interact with on set. Actor Eve Myles describes it as being like filming within a [...] "blood soaked, soppy big sponge". The opening of the creature's eye was created using green screen. Owen felt having to react to this to be the most unusual acting experience he'd had whilst filming Torchwood.|$|E
