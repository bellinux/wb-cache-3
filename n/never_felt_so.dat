500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the massacre, Wills experienced flashbacks, nightmares and an irritable heart—features {{of what is now}} known as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Having immersed himself in the drinking culture of colonial sport, he increased his alcohol consumption in a likely attempt to blot out memories and alleviate sleep disturbance. Wills' sister Emily wrote of him two months after the massacre: [...] "He says he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> changed in the whole course of his life".|$|E

500|$|When an English anarchist named John Turner {{was arrested}} under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and {{threatened}} with deportation, Goldman {{joined forces with}} the Free Speech League to champion his cause. The league enlisted the aid of attorneys Clarence Darrow and Edgar Lee Masters, who took Turner's case to the US Supreme Court. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda. She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> weighed down," [...] she wrote to Berkman.

500|$|Eleven {{weeks before}} the Beatles' arrival in the U.S. President JohnF. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation was in mourning, in fear, and in disbelief. The {{assassination}} came after a fifteen-year build-up of Cold War tension. The motivation and identity of the assassin would be doubted by many Americans for decades, despite the Warren Commission's issued report in September 1964. As the United States tried to restore a sense of normality, teenagers in particular struggled to cope, as their disbelief began {{to be replaced by}} a personal reaction to what had happened: in school essays, teenagers wrote that [...] "then it became real", and [...] "I was feeling the whole world is going to collapse on me", and [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> empty in all my life".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, with reviewers commenting that Jackson {{could have made}} a better effort for it and that it was not his best material, while other reviewers generally praised the song's composition and Jackson's vocal performance. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] was commercially successful worldwide and peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jackson's first top ten song in the United States in over six years, and his last in the country until [...] "Love <b>Never</b> <b>Felt</b> <b>So</b> Good" [...] (a duet with Justin Timberlake) hit number 9 in 2014. This success was achieved on airplay alone, as the song was not released as a commercial single in the United States. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] topped the French music chart for three consecutive weeks. It also reached the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life I have <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> disappointed and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E
