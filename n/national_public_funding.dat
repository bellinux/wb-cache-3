40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial {{results of a}} significant research project conducted under the IOC PhD Student Research Grant Program {{with the support of}} the Hungarian Olympic Committee. Macro- and meso-level analyses were conducted within the framework of this research to analyze the competitive position of the Hungarian elite sport policy system. In the following, an essential part of the research will be presented with the aim of modeling the efficiency of the Hungarian sport funding system as the increasingly international sporting competition forces governments to invest more money in elite sport development just so they can maintain their elite sport success as the supply of medals remains basically constant. Due to these diminishing returns to the scale of investment, an elite sporting system with an efficient structure will be key in future sporting success. Data collection was based on information gained through a general questionnaire and interviews with the main stakeholders of national sport federations and the Hungarian Olympic Committee, which is the main governing body of Hungarian high-performance sport. Data collection focused on the sixteen prioritized sport federations and the five team sports that benefited from a tax relief system. Secondary data were collected regarding the <b>national</b> <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> for sport, elite sport, and sport by sport since 2006, and Gracenote’s database was used to analyze historical performance in the different disciplines and compare Hungarian performance with that of other countries. This research will provide information to policy makers about the competitive position of Hungary in elite sport and, in this respect, explore the critical success factors that will allow Hungary to assess how best to manage its future success in an increasingly competitive international environment...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAimTo {{examine the}} {{engagement}} of French registered nurses with the Ministry of Health's initiative to spur scientific inquiry in the community. BackgroundFrench nursing research {{has suffered from}} a lack of dedicated funding. Positive signs of change have recently appeared, with the launch of the first <b>national</b> <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> programme dedicated to nursing research. This initiative, begun in 2010, was launched by the French Ministry of Health. Through this initiative, 149 registered nurses, serving as principal investigators, and their teams submitted research proposals between 2010 and 2011. The administrative guidelines of the funding programme are clearly oriented towards producing quantitative and exogenous nursing research. MethodA cross-sectional analysis of 149 nursing research projects submitted during the first and second years of a French national funding programme for hospital-based nursing research was conducted. Research proposals were included in the analysis whether they received funding or not. Data collection took place in 2011. The categories used in the analysis were the following: (1) the socio-demographic data on the registered nurse principal investigators, (2) the research teams and (3) the research proposals (methodologies, bibliography, focus of the research, output, the status of the research proposals). ResultsThis study highlights the presence of methodological homogeneity among the research proposals submitted for funding. Clear tendencies were towards interventional and quantitative studies and those with an exogenous factor research objective. Between 2010 and 2011, 25 projects were funded out of 149 submitted. They were mostly quantitative and/or focused on the exogenous factors in patient care. ConclusionThe socio-political context of a funding programme designed to encourage nursing research has had an implicit influence on the type of research to which French nurses have committed themselves to and the scientific positions with which these nurse researchers align themselves...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrification}} of {{road transport}} or electro-mobility {{is seen by}} many as a potential game-changing technology that could have a significant influence on the future cost and environmental performance of personal individual mobility as well as short distance goods transport. While there is currently a great momentum vis-à-vis electro-mobility, it is yet unclear, if its deployment is economically viable in the medium to long term. Electromobility, in its early phase of deployment, still faces significant hurdles that need to be overcome in order to reach a greater market presence. Further progress is needed to overcome some of these hurdles. The importance of regulatory and financial support to emerging environmentally friendly transport technologies has been stressed in multiple occasions. The aim of our study was to collect the information on all on-going or recently concluded research, development and demonstration projects on electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which received EU or <b>national</b> <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> with a budget > 1 mln Euro, in order to assess which of the electric drive vehicles (EDV) challenges are addressed by these projects and to identify potential gaps in the research, development, and demonstration (R, D & D) landscape in Europe. The data on R, D & D projects on electric and plug-in vehicles, which receive public funding, has been collected by means of (i) on-line research, (ii) validation of an inventory of projects at member state level through national contacts and (iii) validation of specific project information through distribution of project information templates among project coordinators. The type of information which was gathered for the database included: EDV component(s) targeted for R&D, location and scope of demo projects, short project descriptions, project budget and amount of public co-funding received, funding organisation, project coordinator,number and type of partners (i. e. utilities, OEMs, services, research institutions, local authorities), start and duration of the project. The validation process permitted the identification of additional projects which were not accounted for in the original online search. Statistical elaboration of the collected data was conducted. More than 320 R, D & D projects funded by the EU and Member states are listed and analyzed. Their total budgets add up to approximately 1. 9 billion Euros.

40|$|The Lisbon Strategy demands large {{investments}} in transport projects, broadband networks and energy infrastructure. Despite the widely-acknowledged need for {{investments in}} new infrastructures, European and <b>national</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> are scarce {{in the current}} economic climate. Moreover, both policy-makers and economists largely agree that the public financing of such investments should {{no longer be the}} standard, as it may have been some decades ago. As a result, private investors become increasingly important when it comes to investments in infrastructure. Yet, such investments are generally high, they involve political risks, and they often have uncertain returns and long payback times, which implies that private parties may also be reluctant to invest. Departing from these drawbacks for private initiatives, we address the question as to what policy-makers can do to improve the climate for private investment in new and innovative infrastructures in the fields of energy supply, telecom and transport. This paper formulates seven imperatives to stimulate private investment in innovative infrastructures: Allow private companies to earn a decent profit Create political stability and certainty for companies Stimulate innovative financing structures Allow money to flow Refrain from making technological choices Allow contractual freedom Reduce the administrative burde...|$|R
