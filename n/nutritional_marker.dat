Using vitamin C concentration as a <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker,</b> we found no clear or significant difference in the nutritional content between organically grown and conventionally grown fruit. The fruits analyzed were: oranges, mangoes, kiwi, lemons, gala apples, and red delicious apples. Of the six types of fruits analyzed by cyclic voltammetry only one, lemon, demonstrated a significantly higher vitamin C concentration for organically grown versus conventionally grown fruit. Our results suggest that other factors are more influential on vitamin C levels than whether fruits are organically or conventionally grown...|$|E
40|$|IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor-I) is a peptide hormone, {{produced}} predominantly by {{the liver}} {{in response to}} pituitary GH (growth hormone), which {{is involved in a}} wide variety of physiological processes. It acts in an endocrine, paracrine and autocrine manner to promote growth. The production of IGF-I signals the availability of nutrients needed for its anabolic actions. Recently, there has been growing interest in its role in health and disease. IGF-I has long been known to be regulated by nutrition and dysregulated in states of under- and over-nutrition, its serum concentrations falling in malnutrition and responding promptly to refeeding. This has led to interest in its utility as a nutritional biomarker. A considerable evidence base supports utility for measurement of IGF-I in nutritional contexts. Its concentration may be valuable in providing information on nutritional status, prognosis and in monitoring nutritional support. However, it is insufficiently specific for use as a screening test for under nutrition as its serum concentration is influenced by many factors other than nutritional status, notably the APR (acute-phase response) and endocrine conditions. Concentrations should be interpreted along with clinical findings and the results of other investigations such as CRP (C-reactive protein). More recently, there has been interest in free IGF-I which holds promise as a <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker.</b> The present review covers nutritional regulation of IGF-I and its dysregulation in disease, then goes on to review recent studies supporting its utility as a <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> in clinical contexts. Although not currently recommended by clinical guidelines, it is likely that, in time, measurement of IGF-I will become a routine part of nutritional assessment in a number of these contexts...|$|E

This research is part of the Study Elderly/Goi&# 226;nia, which evaluated 418 elderly community in a cross-sectional design. Polypharmacy was defined as the use of five or more concomitant medications. The following <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> were investigated: BMI, waist circumference, percentage body fat, weight gain and loss, use of diet, daily consumption of fruits, vegetables, skimmed and whole milk. Multivariate analysis was performed using hierarchical Poisson regression, with significance level set at 5 %. The prevalence of polypharmacy was 28 % (95 %CI 23. 1 - 32. 5), with a significant association with feminine gender, age range 75 - 79 years, eutrophic nutritional status and obesity, use of diet, poor self-rated health and presence of two, three or more chronic diseases.

40|$|Abstract To {{study the}} effects of {{selection}} marker, pro-moter type, and copy number on heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans, strains were constructed with single- and multicopy plasmid integrations bearing a reporter gene (lacZ) under the control of either an inducible (alcA) or constitutive (gpdA) promoter and one of three Aspergillus <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> genes (argB, trpC, or niaD). β-Galactosidase activity in the transformants varied over three orders of magnitude, with the majority of levels in the range of 5 × 103 – 1 × 104 U/mg. Significant differences in mean expression levels were found when comparing single-copy transformants with the same promoter but a different marker. Transformants with the argB marker had the highest average expression, ∼threefold over the trpC or niaD clones. For each promoter, maximal expression for the set was seen in the range of the single-copy clones, implying that increasing the copy number does not reliably increase expression in Aspergillus...|$|E

40|$|Aminoacid based PD {{solution}} (AAD) {{has been}} shown to induce positive nitrogen balance and improve <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> of malnourished patients. But its effcets on body fluid composition and various <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> are contradictory. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> may influenced by patient's ECF volume status. So we evaluate effects of AAD on <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> and body composition by analysis using multi-frequency bioimpedance analyzer. 35 PD patients(> 6 months duration of CAPD) were prospectively randomized to 17 AAD(Nutrineal, one time use/day) and 18 GD group(keep their glucose based PD solution). After 3 months follow up, AAD group showed marginally increased body weight and fat mass, decreased ECF volume(12. 45 ± 0. 54 L vs 12. 10 ± 0. 57 L, p= 0. 06), no changed ICF volume(22. 2 ± 0. 9 L vs 22. 3 ± 0. 9 L, p> 0. 05) and marginally increased drainage volume(8. 77 ± 0. 76 L vs 9. 12 ± 0. 83 L, p= 0. 09). AAD group also showed favored several markers include nPCR(1. 59 ± 0. 07  vs 1. 98 ± 0. 08, p= 0. 00), BUN and albumin level (3. 54 ± 0. 11 vs 3. 74 ± 0. 11, p= 0. 02). Although serum albumin level was increased, correction with ECF volume(albumin level X ECF volume) makes it no difference (43. 45 ± 2. 13  vs 44. 80 ± 2. 28, p= 0. 14). Furthermore △albumin vs △ECF showed negative correlation pattern(r=- 0. 46, p= 0. 07) that means serum albumin change was influenced by ECF volume change. In conclusion, AAD treatment improved <b>markers</b> of better <b>nutritional</b> status. However the change in serum albumin level was influenced by patient's ECF volume status, which can partially explain contradictory effect of aminoacid based PD solution on serum albumin level...|$|R
40|$|A {{system that}} permits {{molecular}} genetic manipulation of mycobacteria was developed {{on the basis}} of the yeast paradigm of gene replacement by homologous recombination. A shuttle vector that can replicate autonomously at a high copy number in Escherichia coli but must integrate into homologous DNA for survival in Mycobacterium smegmatis was constructed. The vector contains a ColE 1 origin of replication, antibiotic resistance markers for ampicillin and kanamycin, a <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> (pyrF) that allows both positive and negative selection in E. coli and M. smegmatis, and unique restriction sites that permit insertion of foreign DNA. Transformation of mycobacteria with this vector results in integration of its DNA into the genomic pyrF locus by either a single or a double homologous recombination event. With this system, the 65 -kilodalton Mycobacterium leprae stress protein antigen was inserted into the M. smegmatis genome and expressed. This gene replacement technology, together with a uniquely useful pyrF marker, should be valuable for investigating mycobacterial pathobiology, for the development of candidate mycobacterial vaccine vehicles, and as a model for the development of molecular genetic systems in other pathogenic microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies have been {{undertaken}} to find cases in which heterokaryons show adaptative response to environmental change. Comparisons have also been made between the phenotypes of heterokaryons and corresponding heterozygotes. Unsuccessful {{attempts were made to}} produce heterokaryons, on complete medium, balanced by one previously-existing mutant and one newly-obtained slow-growing mutant. Adaptation was achieved in heterokaryons carrying different mutant alleles conferring resistance to: (a) acriflavine, (b) actidione and (c) p-fluorophenylalanine. Comparison with the heterozygote in case (a) suggested a highly localised action of the allele determining resistance. A similar comparison for (b) suggested a non-localised action. In cases (b) and (c) dosage effects were observed in the degree of resistance that the heterokaryons, compared with the corresponding heterozygotes, could achieve. In case (c) interaction of the resistance marker with a <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> (nic 8) has been investigated further and a new unteraction between nic 8 and Act 1 detected.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} status in {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) patients is a predictor of prognosis during the first period of dialysis. Serum albumin is {{the most commonly used}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker.</b> Another index is plasma amino acid profile.

A significant decrease in plasma valine, leucine and albumin levels was observed in CKD patients when compared with the controls (P < 0. 05). No significant difference in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was observed between the two groups. Malnutrition seen in our CKD patients in the form of hypoalbuminemia and decreased concentrations of BCAA points to the need to evaluate the nutritional status in the early stages itself.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains bearing temperature-sensitive alleles of {{the cell}} {{division}} cycle gene CDC 31 are specifically defective in duplication of the spindle pole body, the microtubule-organizing center of yeast. To define the function encoded by CDC 31 more fully, we have isolated genomic clones of the gene by selection for complementation of a temperature-sensitive allele. The locus from which the clone was derived was marked by integration of a <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> and found by meiotic mapping to cosegregate with CDC 31. The polypeptide sequence of the open reading frame in the CDC 31 gene was determined and compared with the sequences of other known proteins. This revealed significant homology with the calmodulins {{and other members of}} the Ca 2 +-binding protein family. On the basis of comparison with these related proteins, it is evident that the CDC 31 gene product has at least two binding sites for Ca 2 + and is also homologous with other regions of the calmodulin sequence.

40|$|Background: Obestatin is a {{recently}} identified ghrelin gene product that {{was reported to}} inhibit appetite and gastric motility in contrast to ghrelin. We investigated fasting obestatin and ghrelin levels in patients with obesity and anorexia nervosa. Methods: Fasting plasma obestatin, acyl-ghrelin, desacyl-ghrelin, leptin, glucose serum adiponectin, and insulin were measured in 10 obese subjects, 11 restricting-type anorexics, and 11 control subjects. Results: Obese group had significantly lower levels of obestatin (p <. 01), while anorexic group had significantly higher levels (p <. 01). Obestatin was negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = -. 74), glucose (r = -. 56), insulin (r = -. 55), leptin (r = -. 66), and also with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R) (r = -. 49) and {{was positively correlated with}} acyl-ghrelin (r =. 65) and desacyl-ghrelin (r =. 60). No correlation was seen between obestatin and adiponectin, but the latter was negatively correlated with both acyl-ghrelin and desacyl-ghrelin. Desacyl-ghrelin to acyl-ghrelin ratio was significantly different between anorexic and control groups (p <. 05), while no difference was seen between obese and control groups. Conclusions: Both obestatin and ghrelin are increased in anorexic and decreased in obesity.

Our aim was to evaluate a test that measures the blood antioxidant capability in CF children. METHODS:This antioxidant capability was assessed by the Kit Radicaux Libres (KRL) test in 44 CF children (24 boys). We recorded also anthropometric measures, pulmonary function, CF severity scores, and plasma nutritional and inflammatory parameters (proteins, vitamins, erythrocyte fatty acids, and micronutrients). We performed univariate and multivariate analyses with linear regression models. RESULTS:The mean age at the first KRL assessment was 12. 2 ± 3. 8 years. Factors that correlated with decreased antioxidant capacity were mostly related to the severity of pulmonary disease [forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV 1), acute exacerbation, and congestion. In multivariate analysis, the correlation between Brasfield score and erythrocyte antioxidant potential remained significant (β = - 0. 611, p < 0. 001). Among nutritional factors, the ω 6 /ω 3 ratio was significantly correlated to erythrocyte antioxidant potential (β = - 1. 213, p = 0. 01). CONCLUSION:The blood antioxidant capability, measured by the KRL test, appears to be an interesting biomarker to evaluate oxidative stress in CF.

MethodWe enrolled 63 PD patients beginning in November 2000, and measured C-reactive protein (CRP) and various <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers,</b> including prealbumin. ResultsCRP level was elevated in 29 % of the PD patients. Diabetics had higher CRP than non-diabetics (24 vs. 9. 3 mg/L, P = 0. 016). Patients who were hospitalized during the study had higher enrollment CRP (16 vs. 12. 5 mg/L, P = 0. 05) and lower enrollment albumin (3. 5 vs. 3. 9 g/dL, P = 0. 002), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (40 vs. 49 mg/dL, P = 0. 034), and protein catabolic rate (nPCR) (0. 88 vs. 1. 0 g/kg/day, P = 0. 02) than those who were not hospitalized. Enrollment level of CRP was inversely correlated with <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> prealbumin (r = - 0. 5, P < 0. 0001) and creatinine (r =- 0. 35, P < 0. 01). After adjusting for age, race, gender, diabetes, and CRP level, prealbumin continued to correlate with other <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers.</b> There was a trend toward association of elevated CRP with all-cause mortality in PD patients.

In the present study, we undertook an evaluation to determine whether estimation of geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and lymphocyte subset counts {{can be helpful in}} diagnosis of malnutrition in hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Methods: We examined the GNRI and lymphocyte subset counts of 50  HD patients (55. 8 ± 12. 7 years; 28 men and 22 women) and 16 CAPD patients (49. 8 ± 14. 5 years; 10 men and 6 women). The GNRI is calculated based on the serum albumin level and total lymphocyte count and uses the following equation: GNRI=[14. 89 ×albumin (g/dL) ]+ [41. 7 ×(weight/ideal body weight) ]. Logistic regression analysis was performed for predicting malnutrition in dialysis patients. Results: The average GNRI value was 100. 1 ± 8. 4 in HD patients and 99. 2 ± 8. 1, and GNRI values were normally distributed. lymphocyte subset counts were not different between HD patients and CAPD patients. Lymphocyte subset counts were lower in patients with higher GNRI (GNRI ≥ 100). According to logistic regression for predicting malnutrition according to GNRI, age, female and CD 19 count predicted malnutrition in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients Conclusions: These results suggest that GNRI and lymphocyte subset counts (especially CD 19 count) may be a significant <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> in HD and CAPD patients...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the association between specific alleles genotypes of TNF-α with Index of Coexistent Disease (ICED) score (an index of comorbidity), karnofsky index (a measure of functional status), serum albumin and <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> (body mass index) in 43 ESRD pediatric patients on regular HD. All participants were genotyped for TNF- 308 promoter region polymorphism by PCR followed by digestion and gel electrophoresis. The TNF-α high producer genotype (A/A and G/A) had significantly higher comorbidity (ICED scores >= 2) and lower functional scores compared with the TNF-α low producer genotype (G/G). Serum albumin levels were lower in patients with the TNF-α high producer genotype compared with those with the low producer genotype. Also body mass index was lower in the TNF-α high producer genotype compared with the TNF-α low producer genotype (p< 0. 05). On multivariate analysis, the TNF-α high producer genotype was associated with increased significance for a higher ICED score, lower karnofsky index, lower serum albumin and lower body mass index compared with the low TNF-α low producer genotype (p< 0. 05). Single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of TNF-α show a strong association with indices of comorbidity, functionality, biological and nutritional markers in ESRD patients on long-term HD. The TNF-α high producer genotype seemed to be associated with adverse clinical outcome in ESRD patients. Prognostic TNF-α genetic assay provides a more precise approach for identification of high risk ESRD patients and development of accurate individualized treatment strategies...|$|E
40|$|Protein- energy malnutrition, wasting and {{inflammation}} {{are frequent}} complication among patients with {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD). Malnutrition is associated with cardiac co-morbidity, inflammation and poor survival in ESRD patients. Serum albumin is a well-known marker of nutrition in ESRD patients. Serum albumin {{is still the most}} commonly used <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> in ESRD patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), the major acute phase response (APR) protein is elevated in these patients. High CRP levels are linked to the degree of atherosclerosis in coronary, peripheral, and extracranial brain arteries. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate nutritional factor (albumin) and CRP levels in ESRD patients. In this cross- sectional study a total of 300 patients who had ESRD and had been on hemodialysis treatment for at least 6 months were selected. The laboratory tests consisted of measurement of CRP and albumin using high sensitive ELISA kits. The study patients included 157 males (52. 3 %) and 143 females (47. 7 %) with average age of 41. 5 ± 14. 3 years. Mean CRP level was 7. 96 mg/ dl (± 1. 52), mean serum albumin was 4. 07 g/dl (± 0. 19). Of 300 patients, 21 died (7 %). These were patients with serum albumin 9. 5 mg/dl. This study showed that low albumin and high CRP levels are the main predictors for death. There was a significant difference between CRP and albumin levels in ESRD patients (P< 0. 0001). Measuring CRP as a marker of inflammation can be helpful in managing these patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} muscle function (MF) {{of patients}} on hemodialysis (HD) and {{to investigate the}} dialysis determinants of maximal voluntary handgrip strength (HGS). MethodsForty-three patients on HD (25 men, six diabetics, 54. 5 ± 12. 2 y of age, 62. 2 ± 51. 4 mo on dialysis) were studied. HGS was measured three times with a mechanical dynamometer (Jamar) before and after HD sessions on the non-fistula side and the highest value was used for analysis. HGS values lower than the 10 th percentile of an age-, gender-, and region-specific reference were considered MF loss. Biochemical and dialysis variables (ultrafiltration, interdialytic body weight gain, urea clearance, urea before and after HD, systolic and diastolic blood pressures before and after HD, and difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressures) were also examined. ResultsThe HGS values before and after HD values were significantly higher in men but were not statistically different {{before and after the}} HD sessions (29. 8 ± 10. 3 and 30. 2 ± 9. 9 kg for men, 14. 1  ± 7. 0 and 14. 5 ± 6. 3 kg for women). MF loss was observed in 24 patients (55. 8 %), 12 women and 12  men. Dialysis variables were not different between patients with and without MF loss and did not correlate with HGS measured before or after an HD session. ConclusionsPatients using HD presented a high prevalence of MF loss as assessed by HGS, and it was not influenced by dialysis variables. HGS may be used as a reliable <b>nutritional</b> <b>marker</b> in HD, measured before or after HD sessions...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE:The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to perform a nutritional assessment of acute kidney injury patients and to identify the relationship between <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> and outcomes. METHOD:This was a prospective and observational study. Patients who were hospitalized at the Hospital of Botucatu School of Medicine were evaluated between January 2009 and December 2011. We evaluated a total of 133 patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute kidney injury and a clinical presentation suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. We explored the associations between clinical, laboratory and <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding and selection bias. RESULTS:Non-survivor patients were older (67 ± 14 vs. 59 ± 16 years) and exhibited a higher prevalence of sepsis (57. 1 vs. 21. 4 %) and higher Acute Tubular Necrosis-Individual Severity Scores (0. 60 ± 0. 22 vs. 0. 41 ± 0. 21) than did survivor patients. Based on the multivariable analysis, laboratorial parameters such as blood urea nitrogen and C-reactive protein were associated with a higher risk of death (OR: 1. 013, p= 0. 0052; OR: 1. 050, p= 0. 01, respectively), and nutritional parameters such as low calorie intake, higher levels of edema, lower resistance based on bioelectrical impedance analysis and a more negative nitrogen balance were significantly associated with a higher risk of death (OR: 0. 950, p= 0. 01; OR: 1. 138, p= 0. 03; OR: 0. 995, p= 0. 03; OR: 0. 934, p= 0. 04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:In acute kidney injury patients, a nutritional assessment seems to identify <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> that are associated with outcome. In this study, a low caloric intake, higher C-reactive protein levels, the presence of edema, a lower resistance measured during a bioelectrical impedance analysis and a lower nitrogen balance were significantly associated with risk of death in acute kidney injury patients...|$|R
40|$|Residual renal {{function}} (RRF) is {{an important}} prognostic factor for peritoneal dialysis patients as it influences {{the quality of life}} and mortality. This study was conducted to explore the potential factors correlated with RRF. A cross-sectional study was conducted by recruiting 155 patients with residual GFR more than 1 mL/min per 1. 73 m 2 at the initiation of peritoneal dialysis. We collected the demographic characteristics, <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> and biochemical parameters of all participants, and analyzed the correlation between these variables and residual GFR as well. The odds ratio of RRF loss associated with each of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> and biochemical parameters were estimated by logistic regression model. The residual GFR was negatively correlated with serum phosphate (ORQ 3 = 2. 67, 95 %CI: 1. 03 - 6. 92; ORQ 4 = 3. 45, 95 %CI: 1. 35 - 9. 04), magnesium (ORQ 4 = 3. 77, 95 %CI: 1. 48 - 3. 63), and creatinine (ORQ 3 = 2. 93, 95 %CI: 1. 09 - 7. 88; ORQ 4 = 8. 64 95 %CI: 2. 79 - 26. 78), while positively associated with normalized protein catabolic rate (ORQ 3 = 0. 24, 95 %CI: 0. 09 - 0. 65; ORQ 4 = 0. 11, 95 %CI: 0. 03 - 0. 35), 24 hours urine volume(ORQ 1 = 22. 87, 95 %CI: 2. 76 - 189. 24; ORQ 3 = 0. 08, 95 %CI: 0. 02 - 0. 28) and serum chlorine concentrations (ORQ 1 = 5. 34, 95 %CI: 1. 94 - 14. 68; ORQ 4 = 0. 28, 95 %CI: 0. 09 - 0. 85), respectively. Our study suggested that the <b>nutritional</b> <b>markers</b> and biochemical parameters, though not all, but at least in part were closely correlated with RRF in peritoneal dialysis patients...|$|R
