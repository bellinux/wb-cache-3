40|$|High heat {{transfer}} coefficients and large interfacial areas make bubble columns ideal for dehumidification. However, {{the effect of}} geometry on the {{heat transfer}} coefficients outside cooling coils in shallow bubble columns, such as those used in multi-stage bubble column dehumidifiers, is poorly understood. The generally-overlooked entry and coalescing regions become important in shallow bubble columns, and there is disagree-ment {{on the effects of}} the coil and column diameters. In this paper, a method is presented for measuring the heat transfer coefficient between coil and liquid in a shallow bubble column. Horizontal cylindrical probes are used to measure the heat transfer coefficient over a range of gas velocities. The liquid depth and the diame-ter, height, and horizontal position <b>of</b> the <b>cylinder</b> are also varied. Existing correlations for tall columns tend to underpredict the heat transfer coefficient and do not account for all effects of geometry. The highest heat transfer coefficients (above 8000 W/m 2 -K) are recorded on cylinders placed 4 cm high. <b>No</b> significant effect <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> diameter is observed. Based on the results, recommendations are made regarding bubble column dehumidifier design. KEY WORDS: Two-phase/multiphase flow, turbulent transport, dehumidification, bubble column 1...|$|R
30|$|Storage Simulator This module {{takes the}} I/O {{requests}} from the dispatch queue of the OS Block Simulator {{and based on}} the device type (HDD or SSD), return performance metrics like completion time depending on {{the current state of the}} block device. The module takes block device configuration parameters as inputs (device driver) such as drive capacity, block device type (HDD or SSD), etc. For HDDs, drive parameters include geometry, <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> disk heads, <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> tracks (<b>cylinders),</b> sectors/track, rotations per minute (RPM), command processing time, settle time, average seek time, rotational latency, cylinder switch time, track-to-adjacent switch time, and head switch time. For SCMs (SSDs), the drive parameters include the <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> pages per block, size of each page, seek time (read, writes, erase) etc. The Storage Simulator is CHS compliant for 48 -bit LBA. The Storage simulator calculates the I/O access time (per I/O request) by HDDs considering the current location of the disk arm and time needed to reach the desired new location and access data size. The access time also takes into account minute details such as command processing time, settle time, rotational latency, cylinder (track) switch time, head switch time and average seek time [17, 40, 41]. For SSDs, the access time depends on the SSD properties provided by the manufacturer. The configurable features gives us the ability to test the schemes with different devices as well as drive architectures.|$|R

The {{finite element method}} carries out the calculated analysis of traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> necks on tubular preforms in a spherical matrix. Finite shapes of products are defined at traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure.

Backpressure operation leads to heightening of intensity of strains and a reinforcement of metal after block pressing.
