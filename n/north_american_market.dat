5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market</b> in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market</b> as a permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe {{is exactly the same}} as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold in many of the company's international markets in several forms.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market</b> {{accounted}} for over 10% of the company's net sales. Nokian Tyres has a tyre subsidiary based in LaVergne, Tennessee (USA). In that market, Nokian Tyres sell only to independent dealers, {{some of whom}} use the tyre products to fill in gaps in their product lines instead of an exclusive or majority share. This results in some dealers being knowledgeable about specific tyres but not Nokian Tyre's full tyre product range.|$|E

5|$|P.N.03 was {{the first}} of the Capcom Five to be released. Before the game's debut in Japan, Capcom {{distributed}} playable demos to stores and released screenshots to the media. Upon P.N.03s release, Capcom shipped 25,000 copies to Japanese retailers. Under 11,000 units were sold, which made the game Japan's 26th best-selling title during the last week of March 2003. These low sales failed to help Capcom meet its yearly sales goals. The North American localization was announced in July 2003. Few aspects of the game were changed for the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b> Capcom advertised a free T-shirt as a pre-order incentive in North America. Promotional sunglasses modeled after Vanessa's were also released.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively high productivity, {{which would make}} its population more resilient to fishing pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b> The extent of this trade {{has not yet been}} quantified. Another potential threat is habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{the latest in a}} series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b> Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's {{president}} at the time, assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is a {{video game}} series created by game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto. It is published by Nintendo, with entries in the series developed by Nintendo, Rare, Namco, Retro Studios, and Paon. The series debuted in 1981 with the arcade game Donkey Kong, which was a sales success that brought Nintendo into the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b> Most Donkey Kong games have either been arcade games or released for Nintendo consoles and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to {{the current generation of}} video game consoles. However, some of the original arcade games were ported into versions on third-party home consoles and developed by several companies. Donkey Kong is among the best-selling video game franchises, with more than 48 million games sold worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Her {{paintings}} were a profitable source of income. According to her daughter-in-law, Olga preferred to exhibit in Denmark {{to avoid the}} commercialism of the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b> The Russian Relief Programme, which was founded by Tikhon and his third wife Olga in honour of the Grand Duchess, exhibited a selection of her work at the residence of the Russian ambassador in Washington in 2001, in Moscow in 2002, in Ekaterinburg in 2004, in Saint Petersburg and Moscow in 2005, in Tyumen and Surgut in 2006, at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and Saint Michael's Castle in Saint Petersburg in 2007, and at the Vladimir Arsenyev Museum in Vladivostok in 2013.

5|$|The manga {{was well}} {{received}} by Japanese-language readers; several volumes {{have appeared in}} the top manga sales charts. The North American English translations were less popular, but still ranked several times in the top 100 as well as ranking 145th for overall manga series sales in 2008. Critics of the English-language translation have been positive overall, praising Kobayashi for his art style and overall use of humor. However, the manga has received some criticism, mostly centered on some of the jokes and repetitive plot. The anime adaptation also sold well in Japan and was praised by Kobayashi and—for the English-language translation—critics. The decision by Media Factory to aggressively pursue its intellectual property rights for School Rumble is believed by proponents of fansubs to have had a negative impact on the franchise's release and sales in the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{game in the}} series, renamed Dragon Warrior outside Japan, {{was released}} in 1986 in Japan and 1989 in North America. Dragon Quest games are released in Japan and, until 2004's , were later localized for the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market</b> under the Dragon Warrior title. That game {{was also the first}} main series game to be released outside Japan and North America. In addition to the 10games released as part of the main (numbered) series and their many spin-offs and related titles, the Dragon Quest series has spawned many works in other media including anime, movies, novels and manga, and radio dramas. Many games, particularly the main series, have soundtrack album releases featuring their music in different arrangements. Square Enix has also consistently released companion books for its games, which provide additional backstory and plot information, as well as detailed walkthroughs. The majority of the games and media related to the series have only been released in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Revolver marked {{the last time}} that Capitol issued an altered UK Beatles album for the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b> When the Beatles re-signed with EMI in January 1967, their {{contract}} stipulated that Capitol could no longer alter the track listings of their albums. The April 1987 CD release of Revolver standardised the track listing to the original UK version. In January 2014, the Capitol version of Revolver was issued on CD for the first time, both as part of the Beatles' U.S. Albums box set and as an individual release. As of that year, Revolver had been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry altered its sales award protocol, the album was certified Platinum based on UK sales since 1994.|$|E

5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{debuted in}} Japan in September 1996 for the CP System II arcade board, and was {{released}} worldwide later on in 1996. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn in Japan on November 27, 1997. The port utilized the Saturn's 4MB RAM cartridge peripheral, which was packaged alongside the game, to deliver an arcade-perfect conversion. It was not officially released in North America due to the Saturn's low sales numbers in the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market.</b> An imported version was sold at certain Electronics Boutique locations. Sega had initially intended to release the game in Europe bundled with the expansion cartridge; however, these plans were eventually shelved. The game was then ported to the PlayStation on February 26, 1998 in Japan, where it was renamed X-Men vs. Street Fighter: EX Edition. The PlayStation port was also released in North America on June 11, 1998, and Europe in November 1998.|$|E

According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 2,102,000 copies as of December 2016. This figure does not include sales from clubs, such as BMG Music Club where the album sold an additional 179,000 copies.

The album held the top ten position for eight consecutive weeks before descending to number 12 on January 29, 1996. It stayed on the chart for 26 weeks, and was certified double platinum by the Music Canada (MC) for shipments of 200,000 copies. The album also performed well in other <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market</b> such as Mexico, where it was certified platinum by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON) for shipments of 250,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|On July 2007, Konami re-released all the {{mainline}} Metal Gear Solid {{games on}} the PS and PS2, along with the PSP game Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, individually {{and as part of}} a limited edition box set in Japan commemorating the 20th anniversary of the original Metal Gear. This edition of Metal Gear Solid 3 features the first disc from the Subsistence version and a new second disc containing only the MSX2 Metal Gear games, lacking Metal Gear Online (due to the discontinuation of its servers), as well as all the other content that was present in Subsistences original second disc (Snake vs. Monkey, Duel Mode and Secret Theater). A similar box set was released for the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>market</b> on March 2008, titled Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection, which includes the first disc of Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence along with the original Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, but lacks the second disc with the MSX2 games from the Japanese 20th Anniversary edition.|$|E
