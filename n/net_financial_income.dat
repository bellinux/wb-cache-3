40|$|The <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>income</b> of {{households}} plays {{a crucial role}} in assessing their living standard. It determines of which social class they are members and, thus, their social status as well. In order to monitor their income situation, this paper uses survey data of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC). An abundance of identification data, such as economic activity, industrial classification or sector of economic activity, level of education, age, number of household members, place of residence, household type and others, makes it possible to identify factors that demonstrably influence the household income level. On this basis, it is possible not only to determine the commonly available social class definitions using income intervals, but also to identify specific causes affecting household income and, thus, link a particular household to a given social class. The goal {{of this article is to}} establish which factors influence the income level {{of households}}. The authors of this paper focused on four factors: social group membership, occupation classified according to the national economy sectors, the highest level of education attained by the household leader and their age. To analyse the influence of selected factors including their interaction and impact on the income situation of households, the authors applied the method of analysing variance between groups (ANOVA) using STATA statistical software. The Scheffe’s method of contrasts was used to determine specific differences between factor levels...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} account of recent work on the measurement, {{statistical}} analysis, and theoretical analysis of macroeconomic profitability. Measurement issues include the treatment of holding gains on physical assets and <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> liabilities, national <b>income</b> accounting practices and recent revisions, {{and the use of}} accounting rates of return. Statistical work has focused on the identification of trends and shifts in profit rates not caused by cyclical fluctuations, and various theoretical explanations have been offered for the generally low rates of return that appeared in the 1970 s. These include capital deepening stimulated by a reduction in the cost of capital funds; profit squeezes caused by some combination of slower productivity growth, real wage push, and raw material price inflation; declining capital productivity; and changes i...|$|R

40|$|We {{document}} that the net factor income smoothing channel in OECD countries is primarily driven by <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> asset <b>income,</b> {{while the other}} two sub[hyphen (true graphic) ]components (net compensation of employees and net taxes on imports) {{turn out to be}} ineffective. Once factor income inflows are distinguished from outflows, empirical evidence suggests a non-significant effect of inflows in terms of income smoothing as opposed to a positive and significant role of factor income outflows. Factor income outflows also appear to be robust with respect to positive output shocks, while neither factor inflows nor factor outflows provide insurance against negative output shocks. In terms of the determinants of income smoothing, results indicate that an increase in foreign equity and debt liabilities positively affect the extent of smoothing via factor income outflows. Whereas, contrary to the current literature, an increase in foreign asset holding does not {{have a positive impact on}} smoothing via factor income inflows. European investors' tendency of allocating a sizeable portion of their assets within the Euro zone is shown to undermine income smoothing.

40|$|In {{this study}} we tested {{the effect of the}} {{mandatory}} adoption of IFRS upon the value relevance of earnings and book values using data from the Athens Stock Exchange that covered a period of two years before and two years after the mandatory adoption of IFRS. Greece is a code-law country with strong tax conformity, bank orientation and conservative accounting rules which {{have a negative effect on}} the value relevance of financial statements. As IFRS adoption promotes fair value accounting and weakens the link between taxation and accounting rules we expect earnings and book value to become more value relevant ceteris paribus. We report that the adoption of IFRS positively affected the value relevance of consolidated net income and book value although it had no effect on their unconsolidated counterparts and that consolidated accounting numbers are by far more value relevant than unconsolidated ones in both periods and, unexpectedly, this superiority is more pronounced after IFRS adoption. We also report that disaggregating net income increases the explanatory power of the earnings – book value capitalization (EBVC) model. Finally, we report that although the overall explanatory power of the model increases, the incremental explanatory power of both <b>net</b> <b>income</b> and <b>financial</b> <b>income</b> decreases. These last findings question the expected benefits of specific IFRS rules concerning the measurement of these income components. Nevertheless, assuming that the total impact of IFRS adoption is captured by the overall explanatory power of the models which actually increased, we conclude that mandating IFRS may prove beneficial even in an unfavorable context. ...|$|R
40|$|The saving {{ratio of}} {{households}} in Germany {{has increased in}} the past few years when the income trend was weak. This could be due to precautionary saving. In this paper, the importance of precautionary saving against income uncertainty is analyzed empirically using micro data from the German Socio- Economic Panel Study (GSOEP). Wealth in 2002 is regressed on alternative measures of income uncertainty in a cross-section of households. In addition to the usual controls, risk aversion is also taken into account. When using <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth, precautionary saving is statistically significant and economically quite important. The share of precautionary <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth in total aggregate <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth is on average about 20 %. Compared with <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth, housing wealth is not used as a buffer stock against income uncertainty, confirming the hypothesis that this kind of asset is rather illiquid.

40|$|This paper uses {{microdata}} {{from the}} German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) to analyse {{the importance of}} precautionary saving under income uncertainty. In a cross-section of households, wealth in 2002 is regressed on alternative measures of income uncertainty. In addition to the usual controls, risk aversion is also taken into account. When using <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth, precautionary saving is statistically significant and economically quite important. Precautionary <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth is estimated to make up, on average, around 20 % of total aggregate <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth. Unlike <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> wealth, housing wealth is not used as a buffer stock against income uncertainty, the most likely reason being its illiquidity in Germany. Not controlling for risk aversion leads to an overestimation of precautionary wealth. This result contradicts the findings of Fuchs-Schündeln and Schündeln (2005) who suggest that, owing to self-selection, not controlling for risk aversion results in {{a significant reduction in}} aggregate precautionary wealth holdings.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the financial {{costs and benefits}} associated with teaching in private general practice. Design: Cost–benefit analysis of teaching in private general practice across three levels of training — undergraduate medical training, prevocational training and general practice vocational training — using data from a 2007 survey of general practitioners in South Australia. Setting and participants: GPs and practices teaching {{in association with the}} Adelaide to Outback GP Training Program or the Discipline of General Practice at the University of Adelaide. Main outcome measure: <b>Net</b> <b>financial</b> outcome per week. Results: The <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> outcome of teaching varied across the training levels. Practices incurred a <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> cost from teaching medical students that was statistically significantly different from zero. With respect to vocational training and teaching junior doctors, there were small <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> benefits to practices, although the mean estimates were not statistically significantly different from zero. Conclusions: This study shows a <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> cost for practices teaching medical students, while at the prevocational and vocational training levels, adequate levels of subsidies and income generated by the trainees help offset the costs of teaching. Our results suggest that a review of subsidies for undergraduate teaching is necessary, particularly as the demand for teaching practices will increase substantially over the next 5 years.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} financialization on physical investment in selected western European countries using panel data based on the balance-sheets of publicly listed non-financial companies (NFCs) supplied by Worldscope for the period 1995 - 2015. We find robust evidence of an adverse effect of both financial payments (interests and dividends) and <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> on {{investment in fixed assets}} by the NFCs. This finding is robust for both the pool of all Western European firms and single country estimations. The negative impacts of <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> are non-linear with respect to the companies’ size: <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> crowd-out investment in large companies, and {{have a positive effect on}} the investment of only small, relatively more credit-constrained companies. Moreover, we find that a higher degree of financial development is associated with a stronger negative effect of <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> on companies’ investment. This finding challenges the common wisdom on ‘finance-growth nexus’. Our findings support the ‘financialization thesis’ that the increasing orientation of the non-financial sector towards financial activities is ultimately leading to lower physical investment, hence to stagnant or fragile growth, as well as long term stagnation in productivity...|$|R
