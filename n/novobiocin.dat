25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and <b>novobiocin.</b> Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, {{irinotecan}} and topotecan, are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} camptothecin, which is {{obtained from the}} Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Drugs that target topoisomerase II {{can be divided into}} two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and transcription, causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). These agents include etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and teniposide. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes <b>novobiocin,</b> merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Novobiocin</b> is an amino{{coumarin}}. <b>Novobiocin</b> may {{be divided}} up into three entities; a benzoic acid derivative, a coumarin residue, and the sugar novobiose. X-ray crystallographic {{studies have found}} that the drug-receptor complex of <b>Novobiocin</b> and DNA Gyrase shows that ATP and <b>Novobiocin</b> have overlapping binding sites on the gyrase molecule. The overlap of the coumarin and ATP-binding sites is consistent with aminocoumarins being competitive inhibitors of the ATPase activity.|$|E
50|$|Clorobiocin is {{a natural}} {{antibiotic}} isolated from several Streptomyces strains and differs from <b>novobiocin</b> in that the methyl group at the 8 position in the coumarin ring of <b>novobiocin</b> {{is replaced by a}} chlorine atom, and the carbamoyl at the 3' position of the noviose sugar is substituted by a 5-methyl-2-pyrrolylcarbonyl group.|$|E
50|$|This aminocoumarin {{antibiotic}} {{consists of}} three major substituents. The 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid moiety, known as ring A, is derived from prephenate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The aminocoumarin moiety, known as ring B, is derived from L-tyrosine. The final component of <b>novobiocin</b> is the sugar derivative L-noviose, known as ring C, which is derived from glucose-1-phosphate. The biosynthetic gene cluster for <b>novobiocin</b> was identified by Heide and coworkers in 1999 (published 2000) from Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891. They identified 23 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and more than 11 other ORFs that {{may play a role}} in <b>novobiocin</b> biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} basis of action of <b>novobiocin,</b> {{and other related}} drugs clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 has been examined. Aminocoumarins are very potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase and work by targeting the GyrB subunit of the enzyme involved in energy transduction. <b>Novobiocin</b> {{as well as the}} other aminocoumarin antibiotics act as competitive inhibitors of the ATPase reaction catalysed by GyrB. The potency of <b>novobiocin</b> is considerably higher than that of the fluoroquinolones that also target DNA gyrase, but at a different site on the enzyme. The GyrA subunit is involved in the DNA nicking and ligation activity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Novobiocin</b> was {{licensed}} {{for clinical}} use under the tradename Albamycin (Pharmacia And Upjohn) in the 1960s. Its efficacy has been demonstrated inpreclinical and clinical trials. The oral form of the drug has since been withdrawn from the market {{due to lack of}} efficacy. <b>Novobiocin</b> is effective antistaphylococcal agent used in the treatment of MRSA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Novobiocin,</b> {{also known}} as albamycin or cathomycin, is an aminocoumarin {{antibiotic}} that is produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces niveus, which has recently {{been identified as a}} subjective synonym for S. spheroides a member of the order Actinobacteria. Other aminocoumarin antibiotics include clorobiocin and coumermycin A1. <b>Novobiocin</b> was first reported in the mid-1950s (then called streptonivicin).|$|E

50|$|Staphylococcus arlettae is a gram-positive, coagulase-negative {{member of}} the {{bacterial}} genus Staphylococcus consisting of clustered cocci. It has been isolated from the skin of mammals and birds and is <b>novobiocin</b> resistant.|$|E
5000|$|Resistance to {{this class}} of {{antibiotics}} usually results from genetic mutation in the gyrB subunit. Other mechanisms include de novo synthesis of a coumarin-resistant gyrase B subunit by the <b>novobiocin</b> producer S. sphaeroides [...]|$|E
50|$|The subunit A is {{selectively}} inactivated by antibiotics such as oxolinic and nalidixic acids. The subunit B is selectively inactivated by antibiotics such as coumermycin A1 and <b>novobiocin.</b> Inhibition {{of either}} subunit blocks supertwisting activity.|$|E
5000|$|Poisons of type II topoisomerases include etoposide, <b>novobiocin,</b> {{quinolones}} (including ciprofloxacin), and teniposide. These {{small molecules}} target the DNA-protein complex.

50|$|Streptomyces niveus is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from soil in the United States. Streptomyces niveus produces the aminocoumarin antibiotic <b>novobiocin</b> and the compounds nivetetracyclate A and nivetetracyclate B.|$|E
50|$|Based on a {{total of}} 240 strains, all were {{resistant}} to lysozyme, some were slightly resistant to lysostaphin, 77% were susceptible to penicillin G, 97% to streptomycin, 93% to erythromycin, 64% to tetracycline, and 99% to <b>novobiocin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The G+C {{content is}} 35 mol%. The species is PGR-positive, indoxyl-phosphate positive, Voges-Proskauer negative, {{phosphatase}} positive but {{is unable to}} reduce nitrate to nitrite. It is resistant to <b>novobiocin.</b> Acid and gas are produced from lactose, mannose and trehalose.|$|E
50|$|Colonies of S. hominis are small, usually 1-2 mm in {{diameter}} after 24 hours' incubation at 35Â°C, and white or tan in colour. Occasionally, strains {{are resistant to}} <b>novobiocin</b> and may be confused with other resistant species (e.g. S. saprophyticus).|$|E
50|$|Rings A, B, and C are coupled {{together}} and modified {{to give the}} finished <b>novobiocin</b> molecule. Rings A and B are coupled together by the enzyme NovL using ATP to diphosphorylate the carboxylate group of ring A so that the carbonyl can be attacked by the amine group on ring B. The resulting compound is methylated by NovO and SAM prior to glycosylation. NovM adds ring C (L-noviose) to the hydroxyl group derived from tyrosine {{with the loss of}} dTDP. Another methylation is accomplished by NovP and SAM at the 4 position of the L-noviose sugar. This methylation allows NovN to carbamylate the 3 position of the sugar as shown in Fig. 4 completing the biosynthesis of <b>novobiocin.</b>|$|E

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is prephenate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating).

5000|$|S. hominis is {{normally}} found on human skin {{and is usually}} harmless, but can sometimes cause infections in people with abnormally weak immune systems. Most, if not all, strains are susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, and <b>novobiocin,</b> but a divergent strain, S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus (SHN), was isolated between 1989 and 1996. [...] This strain was named so because of its unique resistance to <b>novobiocin</b> and its failure to produce acid aerobically from trehalose and glucosamine. In addition, the 26 isolated strains of this new subspecies are resistant to nalidixic acid, penicillin G, oxacillin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. They were also somewhat resistant to methicillin and gentamicin, and most strains were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin, as well. In addition, S. hominis hominis is commonly found isolated from human skin, but as of 1998, no SHN isolate from human skin had been reported.|$|E
