This is in addition to whatever public investment takes place in infrastructure, education, research, and the like.

However, settlements in the autumn wage round broadly protect real wage gains against the impact of rising inflation and households may be ready to reduce their saving in view of the still encouraging prospects for income and employment. With output close to capacity limits and profits at record levels there are strong incentives for firms to step up capital spending. Yet, the danger of a recession abroad, the Gulf crisis and spreading fragility in financial markets have recently deteriorated the investment climate.

40|$|One {{important}} aspect of the resulting indebtedness in full-fledged market economies is the mutual influence between different economic sectors. Therefore, alongside the government indebtedness, one must take into account also the debts of private agents, especially of households and non-financial corporations. In this paper our effort is concentrated on the household sector, especially the impacts on economic growth. We have gathered data for the time period 1995 - 2010 for the sample of 17 European OECD countries. The main descriptive statistics reveal high and still increasing indebtedness (ratio on the <b>net</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income)</b> especially in Denmark, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden and still low indebtedness in postsocialist countries. In panel regressions (fixed effects) we add loans as another explanatory variable into growth equation and examine the impacts on the growth rate of real GDP.

40|$|This {{report has}} two main objectives. The {{first is to}} outline the {{development}} of the methodology for the measurement of economic security in the Index of Economic Well-being (IEWB) and to provide updated estimates of the Index of Economic Security over the 1980 - 2007 period for seven developed countries: Canada, Australia, Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The four components of the economic security domain of the IEWB – security from unemployment, illness, single-parent poverty, and old-age poverty – are discussed. The second objective is to consider the adequacy of our framework for the discussion and measurement of economic security during times as tumultuous as the present. Since 2008, the global economy has fallen into recession and anxiety about the economic future has dramatically increased. In this context, how should one measure trends in economic security? Projections of the Index to 2010, computed on the basis of OECD unemployment forecasts, indicate that the global recession will lead to a substantial decrease in economic security as the recession continues.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} how the {{economic}} crisis has unfolded in Canada and {{what will be the}} impacts on economic wellbeing. The shortfall is estimated to be approximately $ 12, 000 ($ 2007) per capita. In other words, given no economic crisis, GDP per capita in Canada would have likely been $ 1, 736 higher on average each year over the 2008 - 2014 period. Between October 2008 – the month at which employment peaked in Canada – and May 2009, net employment fell by 362, 500 persons. The negative effects of unemployment go well beyond loss of income. Roughly 60 per cent of the newly unemployed, compared to about 40 per cent in recent years, receive regular EI benefits, reflecting the concentration of employment losses among long term full-time employees (e. g. auto workers). Based on the experience of the recession of the early 1990 s, we should expect an increase of about 4 percentage points in the after-tax poverty rate, which would reach 13. 2 per cent in 2010.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{characterize}} the evolution of inequality in hourly wages, hours of work, labor earnings, household disposable income and household consumption for Spain between 1985 and 2000. We look at both the Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Familiares and the European Household Community Panel. Our analysis shows that inequality in individual net labor earnings and household <b>net</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> has decreased substantially. The decreases in the tertiary education premium and in the unemployment rate have been key ingredients to understand this falling trend. However, the inequality reduction has not been monotonic over the period: while it fell in years of economic expansion, there was an inequality surge in the recession of the early nineties. Public transfers have {{played a crucial role}} in smoothing out the inequality arising in the labor market, but instead the Spanish family does not seem to have been an important insurance mechanism. Regarding household consumption, inequality has fallen much less than inequality in household <b>net</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> with the decrease mostly concentrated in the second half of the eighties.

5000|$|The {{affordability}} {{of water}} charges {{can be measured}} by macro- and micro-affordability. Macro-affordability" [...] indicators relate national average household water and wastewater bills to average <b>net</b> <b>disposable</b> household <b>income.</b> In OECD countries it varies from 0.2% (Italy and Mexico) to 1.4% (Slovak Republic, Poland and Hungary). In the largest OECD countries the share is 0.3% in the United States and Japan, 0.7% in France and 0.9% in Germany. However, micro-affordability is quite different. It measures the share of bills in the income of the poor, defined in an OECD affordability study as the lowest decile of the population. This share varies between 1.1% (Sweden, Netherlands, Italy) and 5.3% in the Slovak Republic, 9.0% in Poland and 10.3% in Turkey. The OECD concludes that in half its member countries (15 out of 30), affordability of water charges for low-income households [...] "is either a significant issue now or might become one in the future, if appropriate policy measures are not put in place." [...] In developing countries the situation is more serious, {{not only because of}} lower incomes, but also because the poor are often not connected to the network. They usually pay a higher share of their meager incomes for lower quantities of water at often lower quality supplied by water vendors through trucks. On the other hand, utility bills paid by those fortunate enough to be connected to the network are often relatively low, especially in South Asia. Because of this situation the OECD does not recommend to use uniform [...] "thresholds" [...] for the affordability of water and wastewater bills. These [...] "thresholds" [...] are often quoted in the range of 3-5% of household income.|$|R
30|$|The main {{macroeconomic}} {{variables are}} presented in Table  5. In simulation S 1, it can be observed there are no significant variations in the unemployment rate that changes from 9.16 to 9.13 %, as could be expected after checking the short fall of the unemployment benefits. Employment and real GDP growth rates are almost zero and the low change in household <b>net</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> keeps the initial figures for private consumption, without improving utility. However, the effects on the unemployment are more significant in simulation S 2. The unemployment rate falls from 9.16 to 8 % due to the funds, and employment increases in 1.2 %. The lower production prices lead CPI to fall in 0.64 %. This variation in wages and prices reduces household <b>net</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> − 0.37 %, and nominal GDP, − 0.05 %, while household welfare and real GDP rise in 0.28 and 0.68 %. In this case, the effects on private investment are only due to price changes since investment is exogenous {{and there is not}} any negative impact. The number of jobs created according to these results is around 361, 000. In 2013, there were 2, 061, 000 less jobs than in 2005 (INE 2014), but according to the figures obtained in simulation S 2, this number would had been almost 18 % higher without cohesion and structural funds.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Individual Income Series provides estimates of the individual income {{of women and men}} in Great Britain and changes in income over time. These provide a means of comparing the income accruing to women with that accruing to men, either directly or in their own right. Individual income estimates cover all adult women and men, whether living as couples or as single persons. The data are derived directly from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) (available at the UK Data Archive under GN 33283) and the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) (available at the Archive under SN 5828). The Individual Income Series is distinct in that they seek to compare the incomes that accrue to women with those that accrue to men. This information complements data in other official statistics publications, which address different issues: HM Revenue and Customs' statistics cover only taxable income; certain other statistics cover only earned income; and other series such as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) HBAI analyse household income. The Individual Income Series does not provide a means of comparing the living standards of women and men, nor of different groups of women: the analyses take no account {{of the extent to which}} members of a household share their incomes or resources with other household members. The National Equality Panel, set up by the Minister for Women and Equality in October 2008, was asked to look at the best available evidence on the relationship between inequality in economic outcomes and differences related to people's characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity and disability. One of the economic outcomes analysed by the Panel was individual income, received by each adult in their own right from all sources in total, before and after deducting direct taxes. The final report of the National Equality Panel, specifically chapter six, contains the analyses of the Individual Income Series, and are available as part of the study documentation (see below).
