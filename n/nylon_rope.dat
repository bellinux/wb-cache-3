Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the robbery after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the driveway.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 October {{the weather}} was good but on 13 October it deteriorated, with strong squalls {{making it harder for}} the tug crews to see the hulk. The hulk sank lower in the water and the tugs {{struggled}} to maintain any headway. At about 0130 hrs on 14 October Captain Negro of the Genua radioed his concerns to Captain Gatti of the Torregrande. Gatti asked the Dutch party to authorise the tugs to recover as much as possible of the towing cables and then cast the hulk loose before it sank. At about 0230 hrs Torregrande hauled in its [...] steel cable and began to recover its [...] nylon towing rope. Gatti then cut the <b>nylon</b> <b>rope</b> and cast the hulk adrift.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{small boat}} (e.g. 22' / 6.7 m sailing yacht), this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12mm or 14mm rising chain {{attached}} to the [...] "anchor", and a bridle made from 20mm <b>nylon</b> <b>rope,</b> steel cable, or a 16mm combination steel wire material. [...] The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material. [...] Old rail wagon wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose. [...] In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may {{be placed in a}} grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings. [...] Ropes (particularly for marker buoys and messenger lines) should be [...] "non floating" [...] to reduce likelihood of a boat's prop being fouled by one.|$|E

2500|$|The Vigili del Fuoco di Genova ("Genovese Fire Service") ashore fired a {{breeches}} buoy from the mole to the midships accommodation block. This was made fast on the ship, and the firemen hauled three Indian crewmen to safety. Captain Muir persuaded his wife Dorothy to go next, but the buoy jammed and flung Mrs Muir from the harness {{to her death}} on the rocks below. Some sources suggest that {{the breaking of the}} ship into two coincided with the fire service's attempt to winch Mrs Muir to safety, that this caused the {{breeches buoy}}'s [...] <b>nylon</b> <b>rope</b> to flex and this was what caused it first to jam and then to fling Mrs Muir onto the rocks. A fireman, Giuliano Macchi, tried several times to reach her but without success. Captain Muir leapt after his wife into the sea. He was later seen in the water with one leg seriously injured, and then was not seen again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{defines a}} {{methodology}} to compare different {{offshore renewable energy}} (ORE) mooring configurations {{in terms of the}} risk of entanglement they present to marine megafauna. Currently, the entanglement of large marine animals is not explicitly considered in environmental impact studies. Recommendations need to be developed, assessing the risk of entanglement of ORE mooring configurations {{at the beginning of their}} design process. Physical parameters of the mooring system affecting the relative risk of entanglement have been identified as tension characteristics, swept volume ratio and mooring line curvature. These have been investigated further through six different mooring configurations: catenary with chains only, catenary with chains and <b>nylon</b> <b>ropes,</b> catenary with chains and polyester ropes, taut, catenary with accessory buoys, taut with accessory buoys. Results indicate that the taut configuration has the lowest relative risk of entanglement, while the highest relative risk occurs with catenary moorings with chains and <b>nylon</b> <b>ropes</b> or with catenary moorings with accessory buoys. However, the absolute risk of entanglement is found to be low, regardless of the mooring configuration. This methodology can also be applied to other mooring configurations, arrays or power cables.

50|$|Sometimes {{the safety}} of playgrounds is disputed in school or among regulators. Over at least the last twenty years, the kinds of {{equipment}} {{to be found in}} playgrounds has changed, often towards safer equipment built with plastic. For example, an older jungle gym might be constructed entirely from steel bars, while newer ones tend to have a minimal steel framework while providing a web of <b>nylon</b> <b>ropes</b> for children to climb on. Playgrounds with equipment that children may fall off often use rubber mulch on the ground to help cushion the impact.|$|R

50|$|During this period, {{when there}} were no {{manufacturers}} of specialized caving equipment, cavers adapted equipment from other sources, or made their own. After 1933 Petzl began making rope ladders for his own use, developed a scaling-pole in 1940, and began testing the first <b>nylon</b> <b>ropes</b> in 1942. In 1968 Bruno Dressler asked Petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool he had developed, and in the 1970s Petzl started a small caving equipment manufacturing company that bore his name. In subsequent years the Petzl brand was expanded to include climbing and ski-mountaineering gear, and continues today as one of the world’s best-known manufacturers of mountaineering equipment.|$|R

The lack of available technical equipment during the war forced Chevalier and his team to innovate and develop their own. The scaling-pole (1940), <b>nylon</b> <b>ropes</b> (1942), use of explosives in caves (1947) and mechanical rope-ascenders (Henri Brenot's [...] "monkeys", first used by Chevalier and Brenot in a cave in 1934) can be traced historically to {{the exploration of the}} Dent de Crolles cave system.|$|R

40|$|Culture {{experiments}} in the field were performed on western Mediterranean populations of Ircinia variabilis and Agelas oroides. To evaluate culture and filtering performances among polluted and unpolluted sites in shallow waters, farming experiments were carried out in a harbour, a small tourist nautical base and a pristine biotope. Sponge explants were cultured onto <b>nylon</b> <b>ropes,</b> and in situ clearance rate tests were performed on farmed sponges to assess filtering ability under diverse farming conditions. At the harbour site, sponge survival and growth were similar to that observed in the two unpolluted sites until early summer, when a rapid increase in explant mortality occurred in response to extreme variations in environmental conditions. Filtering experiments revealed high retention and clearance rates of I. variabilis and A. oroides at all sites. The highest rates were observed at the polluted site, reflecting the optimal metabolic performance of explants {{in the first phase}} of culture under stressful conditions. Our results highlight the feasibility of sponge microcosms and the ability of I. variabilis and A. oroides to clear large volumes of water of organic and bacterial loads in polluted sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} wave energy mooring systems is challenging: overdesign incurs a {{significant}} cost penalty, underdesign {{may lead to}} a premature failure and incorrect design could reduce the power production. Consequently, compliant mooring systems are being developed for wave energy applications. This paper presents tank test results for a scale model of the buoy and mooring used at the SouthWest Mooring Test Facility (SWMTF), an offshore facility developed to conduct long-term sea trials for wave energy device moorings. A compliant three leg catenary mooring system using <b>Nylon</b> <b>ropes</b> in the water column is investigated. Preliminary static, quasi-static, decay, regular and irregular wave tests were conducted on the 1 : 5 scale model, using the Ifremer basin in Brest. A corresponding numerical model was developed with a time-domain mooring modelling tool, inputting hydrodynamic data from a radiation/diffraction potential modelling program. After the calibration of several hydrodynamic parameters, the numerical model demonstrated good agreement with the experiment. However, numerical results show large differences with the field test results, mainly because of unknowns in the anchor position. The methods and procedures presented will allow the effective validation of numerical models to enable the development of appropriate mooring systems in wave energy applications...|$|R
