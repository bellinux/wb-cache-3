Nonetheless, the school loses the game. Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch. Helen arrives to inform them {{that they did not}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the game after all; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures.

5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very unfavourable conditions, notably that {{he would need to}} finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match, and he would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E

Reading lost 2–1 and Birmingham went up. Reading <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> {{to go up to}} the Premier League at the first attempt, and Sheffield United didn't win against Crystal Palace. United drew 0–0. If the Royals had won they would have gone up on Goal-Difference.|$|E

Sixteen absentee ballots from the Minden City Hall precinct which were not available for counting {{on the night of}} the election were tossed aside. A recount increased Batton's total to 4,222; Gilbert, 4,065, and McGinty, 148. Batton was four votes, instead of three, ahead of the 4,218 <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the position outright.|$|E

The actual number of votes required in the second round might be the same as in the first round, but as in 2008, it can be a little less, due to the absence of a few parliamentarians. Nevertheless, in this second round, a single candidate would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a majority in both the Chamber and the Senate.|$|E
25|$|As an actor, Lee {{came into}} contact with many of the leading {{progressive}} figures in the country. Langston Hughes, for instance, wrote two brief plays for Lee; these were submitted to the Theater Project, but their criticism of racism in America was deemed too controversial, and neither was staged. Lee spoke to schools, sponsored various humanitarian events, and began speaking directly against the existing segregation in America's armed forces, while simultaneously acknowledging the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> World War II. To this latter end, he appeared at numerous USO events; he won an award from the United States Recruiting Office and another from the Treasury Department for his help in selling war bonds. These sentiments would carry on throughout his life, culminating in his early firsthand account of apartheid in South Africa.|$|E

After qualifying 8th in Japan, Räikkönen finished 2nd while Michael Schumacher just slipped into the points to win his 6th World Championship. Montoya's retirement during the race also meant that Räikkönen finished 2nd in the championship, just two points behind Schumacher. The team also narrowly lost {{second place in the}} Constructors' Championship, finishing third, two points behind runners-up Williams, and 12 points behind Ferrari. Mathematically, Williams or McLaren could have won the championship at the very last race. The 2003 season was one of the closest in recent years.|$|E

25|$|Cook scored {{his third}} double-century and 28th Test ton (263) against Pakistan in first Test at Abu Dhabi in October 2015 in 836 minutes: the longest innings by an Englishman and 3rd longest of all time, facing 528 balls. In doing so he also became the all-time highest non-Asian run scorer in Asia, {{overtaking}} Jacques Kallis' 2,039 runs. Despite Cook’s brilliant innings, England {{were unable to}} force a victory, {{running out of time}} after bad light stopped play. In the second Test Cook scored 65 in the first innings as England posted 242. With England chasing down a big target to win in the second innings, Cook could only manage 10 and Pakistan won the match by 127 runs. England <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the third Test to have any chance of winning the series and despite taking a first innings lead which Cook contributed 49 to, Pakistan batted well in the second innings and England were dismissed for 256 in their second innings, meaning the lost the series 2–0, despite Cook scoring 63.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April, Blackburn Rovers welcomed Manchester United to Ewood Park, {{where the}} Red Devils had only managed to win once {{in their last}} eight visits. With Chelsea having beaten Everton two days earlier, United went into the game only two points of ahead of the Blues, which meant that defeat against Blackburn would give Chelsea the {{opportunity}} to leapfrog United in the teams' meeting the following weekend. Despite a promising start, United fell behind in the 21st minute thanks to a Roque Santa Cruz goal – his 16th of the season. United had dominated {{large parts of the}} match, but were unable to make a breakthrough. Finally, with just two minutes left in normal time, Carlos Tevez headed home from Paul Scholes' flick-on to salvage a crucial point for United in the championship race. If United were to beat Chelsea in their next match, they would then require just one point from their remaining two games to secure the title. If they failed to win at Stamford Bridge, however, they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> both of their remaining games.|$|E
25|$|In the 2002–03 season, Basel {{were the}} second Swiss team to ever {{play in the}} modern UEFA Champions League. Their first game was in the second {{qualifying}} round against MŠK Žilina of Slovakia. They won 4–1 on aggregate. In the next round, they faced Scottish giants Celtic. In the first leg at Celtic Park, the home side won 3–1, but in the second leg at St. Jakob-Park, Basel came away with a famous 2–0 victory. This meant Basel progressed on the away goals rule after a 3–3 aggregate draw. In the first group stage, Basel were drawn into Group B with Valencia, Liverpool and Spartak Moscow. On Matchday 1, Basel defeated Spartak 2–0 at home, then on Matchday 2, they travelled to Anfield where they managed to draw 1–1 against Liverpool. After a great start to the group stage, Basel were brought back down to earth when they were defeated 6–2 by Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium. They bounced back, however, and held Valencia to a 2–2 draw in the next fixture. Basel were now sitting in {{second place in the}} group but they would still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> at least one of their last two games and hope that Liverpool would not pick up more than two points to secure that place. In Matchday 5, Liverpool lost 1–0 to Valencia and FCB won 2–0 against Spartak at the Luzhniki Stadium.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} round of the Division 1 home-and-away season, Camberwell Football Club {{officials}} caused controversy by intentionally displaying incorrect scores on their scoreboard. Camberwell hosted Dandenong at the Camberwell Sports Ground in {{the final round}}, and both teams <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> and see other results fall favourably to achieve their goals: for Dandenong, it <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> and see Prahran lose to Preston to finish fourth; for Camberwell, it <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> and see Frankston lose to Caulfield to avoid relegation. The Camberwell-Dandenong match was close, and Dandenong led by three points at three-quarter time, but the around-the-grounds scores showed Prahran comfortably ahead of Preston, ostensibly ending Dandenong's chances of reaching the finals. Camberwell 17.14 (116) went on to defeat Dandenong 16.15 (111) by five points.|$|R

500|$|LeMond's first {{professional}} victory came three months into his 1981 debut {{when he won}} a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic road champion. The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race where LeMond placed third. The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later Simon was assessed a 10-minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race {{to have been a}} [...] "major steppingstone" [...] in his career. Said LeMond: [...] "It showed me that I had the kind of climbing ability that you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the top European stage races."
