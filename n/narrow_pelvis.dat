40|$|Introduction: Men of African descent {{are known}} to have a <b>narrower</b> and steeper <b>pelvis</b> that is {{associated}} with a higher risk of positive surgical margins after radical retropubic prostatectomy. We describe the additional challenge posed when a very prominent posterior pubic symphyseal protuberance is present in the pelvis of a Black man during this operation and how to overcome it. Presentation of case: A 61 -year old man of African-descent with organ-confined prostate cancer underwent a radical retropubic prostatectomy. He had a very prominent posterior pubic symphyseal protuberance on a background of a phenotypically <b>narrow</b> and steep <b>pelvis,</b> precluding adequate surgical access to the prostate. Using a combination of resection of the protuberance, modification of patient position and lighting, coordinated retraction and long instruments, surgical access was achieved. Discussion: The coexistence of a very prominent posterior pubic symphyseal protuberance in a Black male with a <b>narrow</b> and steep <b>pelvis</b> poses a surgical challenge in accessing the prostate, particularly the apex. This can be overcome by surgical resection of the protuberance, patient waist extension by operating table flexion, use of head lamps or intracavitary lighting, adequate retraction and use of appropriately long instruments. Conclusion: Surgical access to the prostate, particularly its apex, when performing radical retropubic prostatectomy in a Black man with a very prominent posterior pubic symphyseal protuberance may be achieved by a combination of manoeuvres and adjuncts described herein...|$|R

We have introduced transanal-total mesorectal excision (Ta-TME) in our department to potentially overcome this problem due to more direct access to the lower pelvis in patients undergoing TME for rectal cancer and this article presents our initial experience with the new procedure. Materials and Methods: Patients with a T 1 -T 3 mid or low rectal cancer eligible for TME or intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision were selected for a combined transanal and transabdominal laparoscopic resection. The primary aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the method with a special focus on the quality of the specimen. Results: During a 9 -month period, 11 patients were operated with this technique. All procedures resulted in complete or nearly complete specimen.

Data of this study was obtained from the records of pregnant women and women in postpartum period charts, married women belonging to 15 - 49 age group charts,children charts and household charts. RESULTS Average age of women was 27, 8 &# 177; 4, 9 years. Most of them (57, 8 %) were graduated from primary school and 4, 0 % of them was illiterated. The ratio of the pregnant women who had at least one risk during their pregnancy was 83, 5 %. The most common risks were primiparity 41, 6 %), previously having a gestation problem (24, 6 %) and women who had given birth less than in 2 years time (15, 1 %). The cesarean ratio was 43, 8 %.

40|$|The ureter is {{a muscular}} tube that transmits urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder, a {{distance}} of about 25 cm. It runs through the retroperitoneum along the psoas muscle, at the tips of the lumbar transverse processes. It lies on the levator ani muscle before swinging medially into the base of the bladder {{at the level of the}} ischial spine. There are three anatomical points of narrowing of the ureter: at the ureteropelvic junction, the site where it crosses the iliac vessels, and at the ureterovesical junction. The pelvic segment of the ureter has three parts: behind the broad ligament, under the broad ligament (near the uterus) and the juxtavesical portion (anterior to the broad ligament). The ureter crosses the pelvic rim at the bifurcation of the common iliac artery (“Luschka’s law”); anterior the ureter is adherent to the peritoneum and it can easily be injured during pelvic and abdominal surgery; it has also external relationship with the lombo-ovarian pedicle and genito-crural nerve. Behind the broad ligament, the ureter comes in relation, on the anterior surface, with the ovary (fosa of Krause and fosa of Claudius), while the posterior surface is in contact with the internal iliac artery. Laterally its relation is with the anterior branches of the internal iliac artery. Under the broad ligament, the pelvic ureter is closely related to the uterine artery. There are two uterine venous plexuses localized anterior and posterior to the ureter. These venous rings explain the movement of the ureter with uterus during the Wiartz’s maneuver. In the juxtavesical portion the ureter is closely related to the vagina and it can be injured during the abdominal or vaginal hysterectomies. D. Alesandrescu describes four important surgical points in the anatomy of the ureter: first, at the superior <b>narrow</b> of the <b>pelvis,</b> were the ureter can be confused with the utero-ovarian pedicle; second, behind the broad ligament, were the ureter is closely attached to the peritoneum and can be sutured during the peritoneal closure; third, under the broad ligament, were the ureter is related to the uterine artery; and fourth, in the juxtavesical portion, due to a close relation with the vagina. The ureter receives blood from the aorta, and from the renal, gonadal, common iliac, vesical, and uterine arteries. The lymphatics drain along each of these vessels. The somatic sensory nerves innervate the ureter in a segmental fashion, which explains why ureteric obstruction can give rise to referred ipsilateral testicular pain...|$|R

50|$|Culture {{has driven}} {{changes to the}} human {{digestive}} systems making many digestive organs, like our teeth or stomach, smaller than expected for primates of a similar size, and {{has been attributed to}} {{one of the reasons why}} humans have such large brains compared to other great apes. This is due to food processing. Early examples of food processing include pounding, marinating and most notably cooking. Pounding meat breaks down the muscle fibres, hence taking away some of the job from the mouth, teeth and jaw. Marinating emulates the action of the stomach with high acid levels. Cooking correctly breaks down food and makes it more easily digestible. Food enters the body effectively partly digested, and as such food processing reduces the work that the digestive system has to do. This means that there is selection for smaller digestive organs as the tissue is energetically expensive, those with smaller digestive organs can process their food but at a lower energetic cost than those with larger organs. Cooking is notable because the energy available from food increases when cooked and this also means less time is spent looking for food. Humans living on cooked diets spend only a fraction of their day chewing compared to other extant primates living on raw diets. American girls and boys spent on average 8 and 7 percent of their day chewing respectively, compared to chimpanzees who spend more than 6 hours a day chewing. This frees up time which can be used for hunting. A raw diet means hunting is constrained since time spent hunting is time not spent eating and chewing plant material, but cooking reduces the time required to get the day's energy requirements, allowing for more subsistence activities. Digestibility of cooked carbohydrates is approximately on average 30% higher than digestibility of non cooked carbohydrates. This increased energy intake, more free time and savings made on tissue used in the digestive system allowed for the selection of genes for larger brain size. Despite its benefits, brain tissue requires a large amount of calories, hence a main constraint in selection for larger brains is calorie intake. A greater calorie intake can support greater quantities of brain tissue. This is argued to explain why human brains can be much larger than other apes, since humans are the only ape to engage in food processing. The cooking of food has influenced genes to the extent that, research suggests, humans cannot live without cooking. A study on 513 individuals consuming long term raw diets found that as the percentage of their diet which was made up of raw food and/or the length they had been on a diet of raw food increased, their BMI decreased. This is despite access to many non thermal processing, like grinding, pounding or heating to 48 degrees. With approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain and 60-70 kg body mass, an exclusively raw diet close to that of what extant primates have would be not viable as, when modelled, it is argued that it would require an infeasible level of more than nine hours of feeding everyday. However, this is contested, with alternative modelling showing enough calories could be obtained within 5-6 hours per day. Some scientists and anthropologists point to evidence that brain size in the Homo lineage started to increase well before the advent of cooking due to increased consumption of meat and that basic food processing (slicing) accounts for the size reduction in organs related to chewing. Cornélio et al. argues that improving cooperative abilities and a varying of diet to more meat and seeds improved foraging and hunting efficiency. It is this that allowed for the brain expansion, independent of cooking which they argue came much later, a consequence from the complex cognition that developed. Yet this is still an example of a cultural shift in diet and the resulting genetic evolution. Further criticism comes from the controversy of the archaeological evidence available. Some claim there is a lack of evidence of fire control when brain sizes first started expanding. Wrangham argues that anatomical evidence around the time of the origin of Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago), indicates that the control of fire and hence cooking occurred. At this time, the largest reductions in tooth size in the entirety of human evolution occurred, indicating that softer foods became prevalent in the diet. Also at this time was a <b>narrowing</b> of the <b>pelvis</b> indicating a smaller gut and also there is evidence that there was a loss of the ability to climb which Wrangham argues indicates the control of fire, since sleeping on the ground needs fire to ward off predators. The proposed increases in brain size from food processing will have led to a greater mental capacity for further cultural innovation in food processing which will have increased digestive efficiency further providing more energy for further gains in brain size. This positive feedback loop is argued to have led to the rapid brain size increases seen in the Homo lineage.|$|R

The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion.
