40|$|Determining <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> patient ratios in {{haemodialysis}} units {{has been}} debated in many forums. Ratios to ensure safe and quality care vary globally, nationally, statewide, servicewide, clinic-wide and from <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> <b>nurse.</b> Given the research complexities, this editorial asks, “How {{do we go}} about exploring ratios?”, “What is the optimal ratio?” and “Is <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> patient ratio research a worthy pursuit?&rdquo...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> population ratio and population density. A secondary analysis was conducted, correlating <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> population data with county-based population density data. The sample consisted of all 17 counties in the state of Nevada (3 urban, 4 rural and 10 frontier). County <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> population ratios ranged from 178 to 861 per 100, 000 population and population density ranged from 0. 3 to 173. 9 people per square mile (mean of 39. 3). Correlational analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> population ratio and population density (r =. 65 (p 3 ̆c. 005). Mean <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> population ratios were found to be significantly different between frontier (356 / 100, 000), rural (682 / 100, 000), and urban (587 / 100, 000) counties (F = 7. 53, p =. 006). Not surprisingly, the results indicated that the lowest <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> population ratios occur in areas with the lowest population density. These findings provide rural and frontier nurses with support in advocating for aggressive strategies <b>to</b> address the <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> population disparity affecting rural and frontier communities...|$|R
5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of <b>nurses</b> <b>to</b> be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Pearl Corkhill, MM (11 March 1887 – 4 December 1985) was an Australian {{military}} nurse of the First World War. Trained as a {{nurse in}} Sydney, Corkhill enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 June 1915. After serving in France at the 1st and 3rd Australian General Hospitals, Corkhill {{was assigned to the}} 38th British Casualty Clearing Station near Abbeville on 21 August 1918. On 23 August, while the camp was being heavily bombed by enemy aircraft, Corkhill remained calm and continued to tend to her patients, despite the danger. For her bravery, she was awarded the Military Medal, one of only seven Australian <b>nurses</b> <b>to</b> be so decorated in the First World War. Following the Armistice, she went on to work {{as a nurse}} at various public hospitals, and donated a large collection of her father's photographs to the National Library of Australia.|$|E

25|$|Other ways of {{assisting}} to {{fill the}} shortage in the United States would include giving nurses the opportunity to pick their own overtime and schedules.

25|$|The Philippine {{government}} has recently opened up their public policy to promote women working abroad since the world's demand for domestic workers and healthcare workers has increased. This {{has led to}} the government reporting a recent increase in women emigrating from the Philippines. A healthcare problem arises as migrating women from the Philippines and other developing countries often create a nursing shortage in the home country. <b>Nurse</b> <b>to</b> patient ratio is down <b>to</b> 1 <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> between 40 and 60 patients, in the 1990s the ratio was 1 <b>nurse</b> <b>to</b> between 15 and 20 patients.

25|$|By {{the time}} of the Renaissance, décolletage became very fashionable. There was some status to firm breasts in upper class women, who did not breast feed. Infants were given to wet <b>nurses</b> <b>to</b> breast feed, since nursing was {{considered}} bad if a woman wanted to maintain an ideal form. Among the wealthier classes, the corset was beginning to appear by the mid-15th century.|$|E
