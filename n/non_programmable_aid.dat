40|$|Technological advancements {{in small}} sized {{electronic}} circuitry {{has led to}} the development of <b>programmable</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> In some systems, a patient's hearing thresholds are entered into a computer and the computer calculates the gain of the hearing aid for each of the test frequencies. The computer then programs the patient's hearing aid to produce the desired gain at the respective frequencies. It is currently possible to use a probe tube placed in a patient's ear canal to measure the amount of gain a patient receives from a hearing aid. Such measures have been found valid and reliable (Mueller and Bryant, 1991) and have generally become the preferred method of evaluating hearing aid performance (Grahl, 1993). The term real-ear is the label usually used to refer to such measurements. As hearing aid technology changes, clinicians are faced with the task of determining how that new technology can be used to better serve the needs of their hearing-impaired client. <b>Programmable</b> hearing <b>aids</b> may make it possible to provide amplification better matched to patients' hearing losses and ear characteristics. It is important, however, to evaluate whether the results achieved with such hearing aids do in fact provide the anticipated results. It was the purpose of the present investigation to evaluate the gain achieved by a <b>programmable</b> hearing <b>aid</b> system (Ensoniq Sound Selector) with real-ear methods. Specifically, real-ear measures obtained with the Rastronics CCI- 10 / 3 were compared to those of the Ensoniq Sound Selector System.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which aid disbursement delays could be used as an indicator of the aid unpredictability and absorptive capacity in recipient countries. Since many recipient countries are dependent on aid, disbursement delays might matter for its effectiveness. The emphasis is put on the so-called pipeline approach, according to which, in the short run, disbursement constraints may lead to huge delays and weak rates of aid disbursement relative to commitments. After the literature review on disbursement delays, we use the framework of <b>programmable</b> <b>aid</b> to run some econometric estimations through a dynamic model, an ARDL, for a panel of 48 African countries during the period of 1975 – 2008. We find disbursement constraints mainly at the short-run level, while the main donor's specific factors seem to be the selectivity and the degree of aid fragmentation. Disbursement rates and rhythms are also influenced by the economic performance and governance quality of the recipient countries and the share of grants in aid modalities. Bilateral donors are found to under-perform in comparison with multilateral donors in terms of the rhythm of aid disbursement. Foreign aid, absorptive capacity, disbursement delays, panel ARDL...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEmbedded systems often {{implement}} {{safety critical}} applications making security a {{more and more}} important aspect in their design. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) attacks are used to modify program behavior {{and can lead to}} learn valuable information directly or indirectly by perturbing a system and creating failures. Although CFI attacks are well-known in computer systems, they have been recently shown to be practical and feasible on embedded systems as well. In this context, CFI checks are mainly used to detect unintended software behaviors while very few works address <b>non</b> <b>programmable</b> hardware component monitoring. In this paper, we present a hardware-assisted paradigm to enhance embedded system security by detecting and preventing unintended hardware behavior. We propose a design approach that designs on-chip monitors (OCM) during High-Level Synthesis (HLS) of hardware accelerators (HWacc). Synthesis of OCM is introduced as a set of steps realized concurrently to the HLS flow of HWacc. Automatically generated OCM checks at runtime both the input/output timing behavior and the control flow of the monitored HWacc. Experimental results show the interest of the proposed approach: the error coverage on the control flow ranges from 99. 75 % to 100 % while in average the OCM area overhead is less than 10 %, the clock period overhead is at worst less than 5 % and impact on the synthesis time is negligible...|$|R

40|$|Epistemologists have debated {{at length}} whether {{scientific}} discovery is a rational and logical process. If it is, {{according to the}} Artificial Intelligence hypothesis, {{it should be possible}} to write computer programs able to discover laws or theories; and if such programs were written, this would definitely prove the existence of a logic of discovery. This far, however, all attempts in this direction have been unsuccessful: the programs written by Herbert Simon’s group, indeed, infer famous laws of physics and chemistry; but having found no new law, they cannot properly be considered discovery machines. The programs written in the “Turing tradition”, instead, produced new and useful empirical generalization, but no theoretical discovery, thus failing to prove the logical character of the most significant kind of discoveries. A new cognitivist and connectionist approach by Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett and Thagard, looks more promising. They picture scientific discovery as the construction of mental models of natural systems through analogical and abductive inferences, activated and constrained by an undetermined number of inputs and feedbacks from the environment. The connectionist architecture of mind accounts for the open-ended and intrinsically complex character which makes scientific discovery <b>non</b> <b>programmable</b> and unpredictable. At the same time, the assumption that by analogy and induction we can achieve faithful representations of nature explains the rationality and success of theorization. Reflection on this meta-research program, therefore, shows that a scientific-realist interpretation of scientific practice is required to account for both the rationality of discovery processes and the failure of past attempts to mechanize them. In fact, it might be argued that the Baconian and Millian belief in a logic of discovery was abandoned by logical positivists precisely because they lacked on the one hand a fully realist and cognitivist approach, and on the other hand a sufficiently wide conception of “logic”: they couldn’t foresee procedures which are rule-governed but complex and holistic because influenced but numberless factors escaping human control...|$|R
40|$|Aid has a {{significant}} impact on governance and public spending in sub-Saharan Africa. In Mozambique (amongst others) aid accounts for more public spending than domestic revenues do. Even in countries less dependent on aid, international donors influence policy making by investing in a technical competitive advantage over domestic policy makers in sectors ranging from climate financing to resilience and public financial management. This doubly affects South Africa both because South Africa is a large recipient of international donor aid and because South Africa is an international donor in its own right in sub-Saharan Africa. The problem is that how international donors set their priorities and allocate their aid at country level is not sufficiently answered in the literature. International donors are seen by many as unpredictable even though they have an outsized influence on domestic policy and spending and are not accountable to the sub-Saharan voters. This research project contributes to the literature on the political economy of donor allocations of aid in sub-Saharan Africa. The research approach focuses on country <b>programmable</b> <b>aid,</b> EU joint programming and donor country strategy papers. The foundation is comparing and contrasting international donors stated policies on 'country programmable aid' with what transpires in practice. Key entry points were the relationship between donor country strategies and the beneficiary country's national development plan, {{and the extent to which}} donors made use of political economy and or context analysis and analysis of sector strategies. The key findings are that there are (and what might even be predictable) patterns in how donors programme their aid at country level, not explained by the particular context nor accounted for in the beneficiary country's national development plan. These patterns relate to a tendency to decontextualize aid programming accompanied with a narrative of donor moral and technological superiority and unrealistic programming objectives. The finding is important because it implies that these patterns result from implicit rules governing how international donors allocate aid, thus making them predictable features of an aid relationship, wanted or unwanted consequences of giving aid...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to design a {{programmable}} Address Lookup unit {{for use in the}} forwarding engine in a network device such as a switch or a router. A solution with a special designed processor core with a optimized Instruction Set, an I/O processor for accesses to external memory and a sample of a network software was designed and mapped to a multiprocessor architecture. The multiprocessor architecture implements the same features as in the current <b>non</b> <b>programmable</b> hardware Address Lookup unit, and adds the possibility to upgrade the implementation to meet new features due to the new property of programmability. Three multiprocessor architectures, the Parallel multithreaded multiprocessor architecture, the Macro pipeline RISC multiprocessor architecture and the Superpipeline VLIW multiprocessor architecture, was selected out as the most suitable implementation architectures. An estimated implementation area for the multiprocessor architectures when meeting the current Address Lookup units performance requirements were calculated. The multiprocessor architectures were compared against each other on the issues of performance and area scalability, where the Superpipeline VLIW multiprocessor architecture was found to be the best implementation platform for the programmable Address Lookup unit. The Superpipeline multiprocessor architecture implementation was built on two basic units, a VLIW processor and an I/O processor. These two basic units was designed, implemented, verified and synthesized. The result of this synthesis was compared with the calculated values made during the target architecture evaluation. For the VLIW processor the estimated implementation area was calculated to 0. 141405 mm 2 and the final synthesis to 0. 156647 mm 2, a difference of 11 %. The difference was analyzed to depend on the control logic added to {{the final version of the}} VLIW processor. For the I/O processor the estimated implementation area was 0. 80800 mm 2 and the final synthesis 0. 106653 2, a difference of 32 %. The difference was analyzed to depend on multiplexers added to the final version of the I/O processor. Finally a small Superpipeline, holding eight VLIW processors and two I/O processors, was implemented and synthesized. The implementation area for this synthesis was 0. 822874 mm 2 compared to 1. 466482 mm 2 when built and synthesized on separate units. This difference of 78 %, was analyzed to depend on the synthesis tools ability to effectively optimize the design. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Programmable {{components}} (like {{personal computers}} or smart devices) can offer considerable benefits {{in terms of}} usability and functionality in a safety-related system. However {{there is a problem}} in justifying the use of programmable components if the components have not been safety justified to an appropriate integrity (e. g. to SIL 1 of IEC 61508). This paper outlines an approach (called LowSIL) developed in the UK CINIF nuclear industry research programme to justify the use of <b>non</b> safety-assured <b>programmable</b> components in modest integrity systems. This is a seven step approach that can be applied to new systems from an early design stage, or retrospectively to existing systems. The stages comprise: system characterisation, component suitability assessment, failure analysis, failure mitigation, identification of additional defences, identification of safety evidence requirements, and collation and evaluation of evidence. In the case of personal computers, there is supporting guidance on usage constraints, claim limits on reliability, and advice on “locking down ” the component to maximise reliability. The approach is demonstrated for an example system. The approach has been applied successfully to a range of safetyrelated systems used in the nuclear industry...|$|R

Subjects reported using hearing aids in excess of 90 % of the time when in listening situations that cause difficulty. The median residual disability measure from the GHABP remained low (10 - 20 %) over the duration of the study. The median scores for additional benefit and satisfaction showed a small but statistically significant improvement over the first 3 months of hearing aid use but only for the subjects who referenced this to their perceived performance 3 weeks earlier.

So, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare self-reported benefit of analog, digitally controlled programmable and digital hearing aids for reducing disability caused by hearing impairment in mild to severe sensorineural hearing impaired persons. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 90 persons with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss dividing into three groups: 43 subjects were fitted with digital, 15 with programmable, 32 with analog hearing aids. After pure tone audiometry, Abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit (APHAB) was completed before and one month after using hearing aids to determine the benefit of them. Results: Global APHAB mean scores for digital, programmable and analog hearing aids were 49. 05, 33. 19 and 39. 53, respectively.

The problem of interest naturally surfaces in broad classes of physical and chemical systems whose dynamic behavior needs to be controlled and favorably shaped by external driving forces. In particular, the formulation of the problem under consideration is mathematically realized through a system of first-order quasi-linear singular invariance partial differential equations (PDEs), and a rather general set of conditions is derived that ensures the existence and uniqueness of a solution. The solution to the above system of singular PDEs is proven to be locally analytic, thus allowing {{the development of a}} series solution method that is easily <b>programmable</b> with the <b>aid</b> of a symbolic software package. Furthermore, through the solution to the above system of singular PDEs, an analytic manifold and a nonlinear control law are computed that render the manifold invariant for the nonlinear dynamical system considered.

Management science (MS) techniques and management information systems (MIS) approaches have been used successfully in organizations for <b>aiding</b> <b>programmable</b> decisions. ^ On the other hand, the decision making processes used for unprogrammable decisions are more difficult to model because of the ill-structured nature of the problems in terms of complexity, lack of knowledge about the problems, need for nonquantifiable data, etc. To help managers deal with nonprogrammable (unstructured) decisions, a group of information systems researchers have advocated the decision support system (DSS) approach. ^ A very promising aspect of a DSS is its ability to integrate data access and a decision model which can incorporate multiple and frequently conflicting goals and the subsequent subjective judgement that are characteristic of unstructured decision making. It does so by imbedding the decision model in an information system which uses databases as the integration and communication mechanism between models, data, and user. ^ The first objective {{of this study is to}} design and develop a goal programming imbedded decision support system (GPDSS) with emphasis on system flexibility and user friendliness.
