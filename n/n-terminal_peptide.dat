TAILS isolates the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> by identifying and removing the internal tryptic peptides. This negative selection allows the TAILS method to detect all N-termini in the given samples.

40|$|We {{previously}} described a proteome-wide, peptide-centric procedure for sorting protein <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> and used these peptides as readouts for protease degradome and xenoproteome studies. This procedure {{is part of}} a repertoire of gel-free techniques known as COmbined FRActional DIagonal Chromatography (COFRADIC) and highly enriches for alpha-amino-blocked peptides, including alpha-amino-acetylated protein <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides.</b> Here, we introduce two additional steps that significantly increase the fraction of such proteome-informative, N-terminal peptides: strong cation exchange (SCX) segregation of alpha-amino-blocked and alpha-amino-free peptides and an enzymatic step liberating pyroglutamyl peptides for 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) modification and thus COFRADIC sorting. The SCX step reduces the complexity of the analyte mixture by enriching <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> and depleting alpha-amino-free internal peptides as well as proline-starting peptides prior to COFRADIC. The action of pyroglutamyl aminopeptidases prior to the first COFRADIC peptide separation results in greatly diminishing numbers of contaminating pyroglutamyl peptides in peptide maps. We further show that now close to 95 % of all COFRADIC-sorted peptides are alpha-amino-acetylated and, using the same amount of starting material, our novel procedure leads to an increased number of protein identifications...|$|R

5000|$|... hIntL-1 is a {{disulfide}}-linked trimer {{as shown}} by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and X-ray crystallography. Despite lacking the intermolecular disulfide bonds, XEEL-CRD is trimeric in solution. The <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> of the full length XEEL is responsible for dimerizing the trimeric XEEL-CRD into a disulfide-linked hexameric full-length XEEL. Therefore, the N-termini of intelectins are often responsible for forming disulfide-linked oligomer. In intelectin homologs where the N-terminal cysteines are absent, the CRD itself may still capable of forming non-covalent oligomer in solution.|$|E
5000|$|Trypsinogen is {{activated}} by enteropeptidase (also called enterokinase). Enteropeptidase {{is produced by}} the mucosa of duodenum and it cleaves the peptide bond of trypsinogen after residue 15, which is a lysine. The <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> is discarded, and a slight rearrangement of the folded protein occurs. The newly formed N-terminal residue (residue 16) inserts into a cleft, where its α-amino group forms an ion pair with the aspartate near the active site serine, and results in the conformational rearrangement of other residues. The amino group of Gly 193 orientates itself into the correct position, which completes the oxyanion hole in active site, thereby activating the protein. [...] Since trypsin also cleaves the peptide bond after an arginine or a lysine, it can cleave other trypsinogen, and the activation process therefore becomes autocatalytic.|$|E
50|$|Expressed protein {{ligation}} {{allows for}} the biotechnological installation of a C-terminal thioester using intein biochemistry, thereby allowing the appendage of a synthetic <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> to the recombinantly produced C-terminal portion. This technique allows for access to much larger proteins, as only the N-terminal portion of the resulting protein has to be chemically synthesized. Both sulfurization/desulfurization techniques {{and the use of}} removable thiol auxiliaries involve the installation of a synthetic thiol moiety to carry out the standard native chemical ligation chemistry, followed by removal of the auxiliary/thiol. These techniques help to overcome the requirement of an N-terminal cysteine needed for standard native chemical ligation, although the steric requirements for the C-terminal residue are still limiting. A final category of peptide ligation strategies include those methods not based on native chemical ligation type chemistry. Methods that fall in this category include the traceless Staudinger ligation, azide-alkyne dipolar cycloadditions, and imine ligations.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} the specific isolation of representative <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> of proteins and their proteolytic fragments. Their isolation {{is based on a}} gel-free, peptidecentric proteomics approach using the principle of diagonal chromatography. We will indicate that the introduction of an altered chemical property to internal peptides holding a free α-N-terminus results in altered column retention of these peptides, thereby enabling the isolation and further characterization by mass spectrometry of <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides.</b> Besides pointing to changes in protein expression levels when performing such proteome surveys in a differential modus, protease specificity and substrate repertoires can be allocated since both are specified by neo-N-termini generated after a protease cleavage event. As such, our gel-free proteomics technology is widely applicable and amenable for a variety of proteome-driven protease degradomics research...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Cardiac {{peptides}} have {{diagnostic and}} prognostic value in heart failure. Their plasma concentrations, however, {{are sensitive to}} rapid changes in haemodynamics. As blood sampling under standard conditions is not feasible in clinical practice, {{it is important to}} know which peptides are most resistant to change. Therefore, the present study investigated the differences in response to exercise between atrial natriuretic <b>peptide,</b> <b>N-terminal</b> proatrial natriuretic <b>peptide,</b> brain natriuretic peptide and the recently identified <b>N-terminal</b> probrain natriuretic <b>peptide.</b> METHODS and RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with chronic heart failure performed a symptom-limited graded bicycle exercise. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of cardiac peptides were drawn at rest and at peak exercise. There was a significant difference in percentage increase in response to exercise between the four peptides (P< 0. 0001). <b>N-terminal</b> proatrial natriuretic <b>peptide</b> increased less than atrial natriuretic peptide (5 +/- 18 % vs 59 +/- 58 %;P< 0. 0001). The difference in increase between <b>N-terminal</b> probrain natriuretic <b>peptide</b> and brain natriuretic peptide was less distinct but still significant (24 +/- 24 % vs 38 +/- 52 %, P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Both <b>N-terminal</b> proatrial natriuretic <b>peptide</b> and <b>N-terminal</b> probrain natriuretic <b>peptide</b> increased less in response to exercise than their C-terminal counterparts. This implies that the circumstances under which blood sampling for measurements of <b>N-terminal</b> proatrial natriuretic <b>peptide</b> and <b>N-terminal</b> probrain natriuretic <b>peptide</b> should be performed are more favourable than the blood sampling conditions for atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide...|$|R

50|$|Many {{secreted}} proteins have an <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> {{sequence that}} signals for the translated protein {{to move into}} the endoplasmic reticulum where the processing occurs that will ultimately lead to secretion. The presence of these signal peptides can be used to predict the secretome of a cell. Software such as SignalP can identify signal sequences (and their cleavage sites) to predict proteins that are secreted. Since transmembrane proteins are also processed in the ER, but not secreted, software like the TMHMM server is used to predict transmembrane domains and therefore eliminate false positives. Some secretory proteins do not have classical signal peptide sequences. These 'leaderless secretory proteins' (LSPs) will be missed by SignalP. SecretomeP is a software that has been developed to try to predict these non-classical secretory proteins from their sequences. Genome-wide secretomes have been predicted {{for a wide range of}} organisms, including human, mouse, zebrafish, and hundreds of bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Affinity tags {{have been}} widely used to purify {{recombinant}} proteins, as they allow the accumulation of recombinant protein with little impurities. However, the affinity tag must be removed by proteases in the final purification step. The extra proteolysis step raises the problems of protease specificity in removing affinity tags from recombinant protein, and the removal of the digestion product. This problem can be avoided by fusing an affinity tag to self-cleavable inteins in a controlled environment. The first generation of expression vectors of this kind used modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA (Sce VMA) intein. Chong et al. used a chitin binding domain (CBD) from Bacillus circulans as an affinity tag, and fused this tag with a modified Sce VMA intein. The modified intein undergoes a self-cleavage reaction at its <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> linkage with 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), or cystine at low temperatures over a broad pH range. After expressing the recombinant protein, the cell homogenate is passed through the column containing chitin. This allows the CBD of the chimeric protein to bind to the column. Furthermore, when the temperature is lowered and the molecules described above pass through the column, the chimeric protein undergoes self-splicing and only the target protein is eluted. This novel technique eliminates the need for a proteolysis step, and modified Sce VMA stays in column attached to chitin through CBD.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{analyzing}} native complexes of INhibitor of Growth (ING) PHD finger {{family of}} proteins revealed that ING4 and ING5 proteins {{are associated with}} JADE1S and HAT HBO1, while ING3 is associated with EPC1 (JADE1 homolog), TIP60 (HBO1 homolog) and several other partners. Both complexes also included a small Eaf6 protein. The biochemical and in silico analysis of complexes formed by HBO1 and TIP60 suggested common architecture and supported the role for JADE1 in bulk histone H4 acetylation. Characterization of JADE1 and HBO1 functional interactions show structural and functional similarities between the complexes(16, 19). Similarly to TIP60, JADE1 and HBO1 mutually stabilize each other. JADE1 binds to and enables HBO1 to enhance global histone H4 acetylation, which requires intact PHD2 finger.Similarly to HBO1, JADE1 is responsible for bulk histone H4 acetylation in cultured cells. H4K5, H4K12, and most likely H4K8 are targets of JADE1-dependent acetylation in cultured cells and in vivo.Several potential transcription targets of JADE1 have been suggested from experiments using screening approaches. According to screening genomic analysis done by ChIP-chip assay JADE1L complex is found mainly along the coding regions of many genes and JADE1L abundance correlates mostly with H3K36me3 histone mark. JADE1L over expression correlates with increased quantities of H4acK8 in the coding region of many genes. The two PHD zinc fingers of JADE1 appear to bind preferentially non-methylated <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> of histone.JADE1 isoforms assemble at least two different complexes, JADE1L-HBO1-ING4/5 and JADE1S-HBO1 complex. Due {{to the lack of}} the C-terminal fragment, JADE1S is incapable of binding ING4/5 partners. A small less characterized protein Eaf6 is also another component of JADE1 complexes.|$|E
25|$|TAILS, or “N-Terminomics,” was {{designed}} and developed by the Overall Lab to overcome the functional limitations of conventional proteomics by enriching both mature <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> and newly generated <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> of proteins produced by protease activity. Formaldehyde or isobaric tags including Isotope-coded Affinity Tags (ICAT), 4 to 8 plex Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), or 10plex Tandem mass tags (TMT) block primary amines prior to trypsin digestion of proteome samples. The main step of the process is the negative selection of newly generated trypsin peptides using a specialized polymer. The polymer ignores the unreactive primary amines blocked by their tags, allowing them {{to be separated from}} trypsin generated peptides by ultrafiltration for Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. These mature and neo-N-termini will differ in ratios between the protease treated versus untreated samples and make up the proteolytic fingerprint of a protease.

40|$|Peptide {{deformylase}} (PDF) is {{an essential}} enzyme in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It hydrolyzes formylated <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> to generate free <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> {{during the process of}} protein maturation. Inhibition of this enzyme results in cessation of bacterial growth. We have examined the effect of a potent PDF inhibitor, LBM- 415 (also known as VIC- 104959), on the proteomes of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Both S. aureus and S. pneumoniae showed accumulation of many N-terminal formylated peptides/proteins upon PDF inhibition. In S. pneumoniae, formylated peptide/protein accumulation was time dependent. Following inhibition, subsequent removal of the inhibitor resulted in deformylation of formylated peptides/proteins; this recovery process was also time dependent. If instead the inhibited cells were maintained in the presence of sub-MIC levels of the PDF inhibitor, the formylated peptides/proteins remained for a much longer time, which correlated with a prolonged postantibiotic effect in vitro. These observations may have broader implications for the application of this class of antibiotics in vivo...|$|R

The lytic activity of the N-terminal domains does not require calcium, is independent of the lipid headgroup composition, and can be inhibited by heparin. Tumor cells incubated with the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> undergo the same morphological changes as those induced by native perforin. None of the peptides corresponding to the putative membrane-spanning domains from the central region of perforin is cytolytic.

5000|$|SNARE {{proteins}} must assemble into trans-SNARE complexes so {{that they}} can provide the force that is necessary for vesicle fusion. The four α-helix domains (1 each from synaptobrevin and syntaxin, and 2 from SNAP-25) come together to form a coiled-coil motif. The rate-limiting step in the assembly process is the association of the syntaxin SNARE domain, since it is usually found in a [...] "closed" [...] state where it is incapable of interacting with other SNARE proteins. [...] When syntaxin is in an open state, trans-SNARE complex formation begins with the association of the four SNARE domains at their N-termini. The SNARE domains proceed in forming a coiled-coil motif {{in the direction of the}} C-termini of their respective domains. The SM protein Munc18 is thought to play a role in assembly of the SNARE complex, although the exact mechanism by which it acts is still under debate. It is known that the clasp of Munc18 locks syntaxin in a closed conformation by binding to its α-helical SNARE domains, which inhibits syntaxin from entering SNARE complexes (thereby inhibiting fusion). [...] The clasp is also capable, however, of binding the entire four-helix bundle of the trans-SNARE complex. One hypothesis suggests that, during SNARE-complex assembly, the Munc18 clasp releases closed syntaxin, remains associated with the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> of syntaxin (allowing association of the syntaxin SNARE domain with other SNARE proteins), and then reattaches to the newly formed four-helix SNARE complex. [...] This possible mechanism of dissociation and subsequent re-association with the SNARE domains could be calcium-dependent. This supports the idea that Munc18 plays a key regulatory role in vesicle fusion; under normal conditions the SNARE complex will be prevented from forming by Munc18, but when triggered the Munc18 will actually assist in SNARE-complex assembly and thereby act as a fusion catalyst.|$|E
50|$|Many plant {{pathogens}} produce virulence factors (i.e., effectors) that modulate or {{interfere with}} normal host processes {{to the benefit}} of the pathogens. In 2009, a secreted protein, termed “tengu-su inducer” (TENGU), was identified from a phytoplasma causing yellowing of onions; this was the first phytoplasmal virulence factor to be described. TENGU induces characteristic symptoms (termed “tengu-su”), including witches’ broom and dwarfism. Transgenic expression of TENGU in Arabidopsis plants induced sterility in male and female flowers. TENGU contains a signal peptide at its N-terminus; after cleavage, the mature protein is only 38 amino acids in length. Although phytoplasmas are restricted to phloem, TENGU is transported from phloem to other cells, including those of the apical and axillary meristems. TENGU was suggested to inhibit both auxin- and jasmonic acid-related pathways, thereby affecting plant development. Surprisingly, the N-terminal 11 amino acid region of the mature protein triggers symptom development in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. TENGU undergoes proteolytic processing by a plant serine protease in vivo, suggesting that the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> (i.e., the 11 amino acid fragment) alone induces the observed symptoms. TENGU homologs have been identified in AY-group phytoplasmas. All such homologs undergo processing and can induce symptoms, suggesting that the symptom-inducing mechanism is conserved among TENGU homologs. TCP transcription factors normally regulate plant development, controlling the expression of lipoxygenase genes required for jasmonate biosynthesis. Jasmonate levels are decreased in phytoplasma-infected Arabidopsis plants and plants that transgenically express SAP11, an effector of AY-WB phytoplasmas. The downregulation of jasmonate production is beneficial to phytoplasmas because jasmonate is involved in plant defenses against herbivorous insects such as leafhoppers. Leafhoppers lay increased numbers of eggs on AY-WB-infected plants, at least in part because of SAP11 production. For example, the leafhopper Macrosteles quadrilineatus laid 30% more eggs on plants that expressing SAP11 transgenically than control plants, and 60% more eggs on plants infected with AY-WB. Phytoplasmas cannot survive in the external environment and are dependent upon insects such as leafhoppers for transmission to new (healthy) plants. Thus, by compromising jasmonate production, SAP11 'encourages' leafhoppers to lay more eggs on phytoplasma-infected plants, thereby ensuring that newly hatched leafhopper nymphs feed upon infected plants to become phytoplasma vectors.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Renalase is a {{recently}} discovered flavoprotein involved in regulation of blood pressure. Altered renalase levels {{have been found}} in blood of patients with end stage renal disease. The antihypertensive effect of circulating renalase is attributed to putative FAD-dependent monoamine oxidase activity demonstrated by some authors. Being synthesized as an intracellular flavoprotein renalase requires the presence of its <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> for FAD accommodation. However, conventional routes of export of secretory proteins outside the cell usually include cleavage of their <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether renalase is secreted by &#x 041 D;&#x 0415;K 293 T cells as a full length protein (via proposed nonconventional pathway) or its export is accompanied by the loss of its <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide.</b> Methods: We have expressed human recombinant renalase- 1 in human kidney &#x 041 D;&#x 0415;K 293 T cells and analyzed this protein inside the cells and in the extracellular medium for the presence of the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> by using high resolution targeted MS/MS. Results: Intracellular renalase contained clearly detectable <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide,</b> which was absent in extracellular renalase.

40|$|SummaryAll Hedgehog (Hh) {{proteins}} {{are released}} from producing cells despite being synthesized as N- and C-terminally lipidated, membrane-tethered molecules. Thus, a cellular mechanism {{is needed for}} Hh solubilization. We previously suggested that a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) -mediated shedding of Sonic hedgehog (ShhNp) from its lipidated N and C termini results in protein solubilization. This finding, however, seemed {{at odds with the}} established role of N-terminal palmitoylation for ShhNp signaling activity. We now resolve this paradox by showing that N-palmitoylation of ShhNp <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> is required for their proteolytic removal during solubilization. These peptides otherwise block ShhNp zinc coordination sites required for ShhNp binding to its receptor Patched (Ptc), explaining the essential yet indirect role of N-palmitoylation for ShhNp function. We suggest a functional model in which membrane-tethered multimeric ShhNp is at least partially autoinhibited in trans but is processed into fully active, soluble multimers upon palmitoylation-dependent cleavage of inhibitory <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{structures}} of four peptides corresponding {{to parts of}} the coeliac-activating protein A-gliadin were studied by structure prediction and c. d. spectroscopy. Three of the peptides corresponded to parts of the coeliac-activating N-terminal region (residues 3 - 55, 3 - 19 and 39 - 45) and contained two tetrapeptide motifs common to all coeliac-active regions (Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln and Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro). The Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln sequence was also present in the fourth peptide, {{on the basis of}} the C-terminal part of the molecule (211 - 217). These studies showed that beta-reverse turns were the predominant structural feature in all peptides and were predominantly of type I/III in two of the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> and type II in the C-terminal peptide. These turns form when the peptide is dissolved in solvents of low dielectric constant (trifluoroethanol) and high dielectric constant (water and iso-osmotic saline), although their presence in the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> may be masked in the latter solvents due to equilibrium with a poly-L-proline II structure favoured at lower temperatures...|$|R

Nevertheless, each lipases group possesses its characteristic 3 -D structure and catalytic properties. The purified N-terminal truncated forms of a pancreatic (from ostrich) and a fungal (from Rhizopus oryzae, ROL 32) (sayari et al., 2005) lipases displayed much lower activities {{as compared to}} the native proteins. The aim {{of this study is to}} explain this common functional feature on a structural basis. The molecular modelling showed that the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> of the fungal lipase displays an extended "V" shaped structure motif (sayari et al., 2005). We observed that the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> of a pancreatic lipase shares the same extended structure with that of the ROL 32, despite the low sequence homology between the two peptides. Upon superimposition of the 3 -D structure of the N-terminal catalytic domain of the pancreatic lipase with the model of the ROL 32, we have shown that the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> and the open lid domain, of each lipase, are located distally within the putative interfacial binding surface. In particular, two hydrophobic residues, Leu and Ile belonging to the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> of each lipase are well placed to interact with the lipidic substrate. Furthermore, the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptide</b> of each lipase seems to be well placed to interact with the loop bearing the catalytic aspartic acid.

Plasma <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> levels were measured preoperatively and at 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgical intervention and were assessed for their predictive value of postoperative outcomes. Plasma <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> levels were also measured in 34 similarly aged healthy children. ResultsPatient preoperative <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> levels were significantly higher than those of healthy control subjects (3085 ± 4046 vs 105 ± 78 pg/mL). Preoperative <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> levels correlated with the complexity of surgical repair, as measured by cardiopulmonary bypass time (r = 0. 529, P <. 001), and with postoperative measures, including fractional inhaled oxygen requirements registered at 12 hours (r = 0. 443, P =. 005) and duration of mechanical ventilation (r = 0. 445, P =. 005). Plasma <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> levels increased 5 -fold within 12 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass (14, 685 ± 14, 317 pg/mL). Multivariable regression analysis showed that the preoperative <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> level {{was a significant predictor of}} duration of intensive care unit stay (P =. 02) and that the peak postoperative <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> level was a significant predictor of the intensity of overall medical management, as assessed by using the therapeutic intervention scoring system (P =. 01). ConclusionPlasma <b>N-terminal</b> B-type natriuretic <b>peptide</b> levels measured preoperatively and postoperatively can be a prognostic indicator in the management of the pediatric patient after surgical intervention for congenital heart repair...|$|R

The interaction of HIV- 1 viral protein R (Vpr) with the human peptidyl prolyl isomerase CypA is known to occur in vitro and in vivo. However, {{the nature of the}} interaction of CypA with Pro- 35 of N-terminal Vpr has remained undefined. Results Characterization of the interactions of human CypA with <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> of HIV- 1 Vpr has been achieved using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonace (NMR) exchange spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR). NMR data at atomic resolution indicate prolyl cis / trans isomerisation of the highly conserved proline residues Pro- 5, - 10, - 14 and - 35 of Vpr are catalyzed by human CypA and require only very low concentrations of the isomerase relative to that of the peptide substrates. Of the <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> of Vpr only those containing Pro- 35 bind to CypA in a biosensor assay. SPR studies of specific <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> with decreasing numbers of residues revealed that a seven-residue motif centred at Pro- 35 consisting of RHFPRIW, which under membrane-like solution conditions comprises the loop region connecting helix 1 and 2 of Vpr and the two terminal residues of helix 1, is sufficient to maintain strong specific binding. Conclusions Only <b>N-terminal</b> <b>peptides</b> of Vpr containing Pro- 35, which appears to be vital for manifold functions of Vpr, bind to CypA in a biosensor assay. This indicates that Pro- 35 is essential for a specific CypA-Vpr binding interaction, in contrast to the general prolyl cis / trans isomerisation observed for all proline residues of Vpr, which only involve transient enzyme-substrate interactions. Previously suggested models depicting CypA as a chaperone that plays a role in HIV- 1 virulence are now supported by our data. In detail the SPR data of this interaction were compatible with a two-state binding interaction model that involves a conformational change during binding. This is in accord with the structural changes observed by NMR suggesting CypA catalyzes the prolyl cis/trans interconversion during binding to the RHFP 35 RIW motif of N-terminal Vpr. </p...|$|R
