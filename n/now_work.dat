5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but <b>now</b> <b>work</b> with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} small fodder enemies attempt to hinder Crash in his journey, much of them {{appearing}} in the previous Crash of the Titans. The Ratnicians, who previously worked for Doctor Neo Cortex, have since gone feral and vegetarian, and <b>now</b> <b>work</b> for the minor antagonist Doctor N. Gin. The Brat Girls, who previously worked for Nina Cortex, have betrayed her and now run the Evil Public School and supervise the Ratcicles in the Ratcicle Kingdom. The Doom Monkeys make a return appearance as employees of Nitrus Brio in the Sludge Junkyard. Two new fodder enemies make their debut in the game: the Znu, a group of small, warty creatures that inhabit Mount Grimly, and the Slap-E's, hand-shaped robots that share Doctor Cortex's memories and personal problems.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May 1702 (O.S.) England {{formally}} {{declared war}} on France. Marlborough was given command of the English, Dutch, and hired German forces, {{but he had not}} as yet commanded a large army in the field, and had far less experience than a dozen Dutch and German generals who must <b>now</b> <b>work</b> under him. His command had its limitations, however. As commander of Anglo-Dutch forces he had the power to give orders to Dutch generals only when their troops were in action with his own; at all other times he had to rely on his powers of tact and persuasion, and gain the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies or political representatives of the States General. Nevertheless, despite his Allies' initial lassitude the campaign in the Low Countries (the war's principal theatre) began well for Marlborough. After outmanoeuvring Marshal Boufflers, he captured Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert and Liège, for which in December a grateful Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a duke.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{suburban}} infrastructure evolved {{during an}} age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, {{which has led to}} transportation-dependent systems of living. Zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation. The use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many Americans <b>now</b> <b>work</b> in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.|$|E

25|$|The Mexican army, which pervaded the Zapatista region, {{had little}} effect on river crime, and may have abetted it. In Guatemala, the absence of the {{expelled}} CPR communities, which had helped keep the selva safe and secure, now left it open to invasion, illegal logging, smuggling of immigrants, arms, artifacts, and drugs. (Many members of those communities <b>now</b> <b>work</b> as Defensores, but their numbers are few, and they are poorly paid.) The region continued in a state of low-grade terror and occupation for ten years.|$|E
25|$|Lyttelton {{remains a}} busy rail freight yard that {{continues}} to serve the Lyttelton Port of Christchurch. Major sources of traffic for the port include export dairy products, coal, timber, vehicles, and other general container freight. New Zealand Railways Corporation staff were based at Lyttelton station through the 1980s {{for the management of}} container traffic, but have since been relocated; all Lyttelton-based railways-related staff <b>now</b> <b>work</b> out of the station building. Railway operations staff have maintained a continuous presence in the station building where they make use of some of the rooms for staff facilities.

25|$|While the Allied Nations {{were still}} {{recovering}} {{from the war in}} Cosmo Land, the Black Hole Army had already recovered and has decided to launch a large-scale invasion on Macro Land. Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must <b>now</b> <b>work</b> together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ineffectiveness}} of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and restorative justice processes. In addition to moving towards a more wholistic style of punishment, Nordic Countries in particular are focusing their efforts on prevention. In Sweden local police <b>now</b> <b>work</b> with county government to target at-risk youths. Swedish children from dysfunctional homes are provided more education and after-school activities to try and keep them out of trouble. In addition, police in Nordic countries are less likely to arrest youth for minor violations of the law. If a teenager steals food from a grocery store, they are often given community service time.|$|E
25|$|Though {{companies}} were hired {{for work on}} the pilot episode—such as Entity FX for the visual effects—effects departments <b>now</b> <b>work</b> exclusively for the series. Ivan Hayden is the visual effects supervisor, and works with many levels of the production staff. During pre-production, Hayden must go through the scripts, looking for possible visual effects. He then has a concept meeting with the writers, and after settling on the effect designs to use, coordinates with the special effects and stunt departments. Hayden is also present during filming to help the director {{make sure that the}} scenes are being filmed in the best way for the visual effects, such as by ensuring that the actors are looking at the correct location where an effect will later be added. Afterward, he then meets with the editors. Another aspect of the visual effects department is coming up with rules and physics for each supernatural creature, though the rules are often bent if it benefits the story. In 2012, it was announced that Hayden will be working at the new Vancouver location of Encore for its VFX division.|$|E
25|$|Like many cities, traffic {{congestion}} {{is a significant}} problem in and around Edinburgh, with 160,000 vehicles entering the city every day which is forecast to rise to 180,000 by 2016. This is especially problematic in the rush hour periods from 7.30am to 9.30am and 4pm to 6pm. Increasing levels of {{traffic congestion}} in Edinburgh are generally attributed to the city's strong population growth {{as well as an}} expanding economy. Areas in the future which are expected to suffer acutely from traffic congestion in Edinburgh include the western outskirts of the city, the waterfront, and the residential areas of the South East where there is a large amount of housing development. Notorious traffic hotspots in Edinburgh include the Straiton and Dreghorn junctions on the Edinburgh City Bypass. The Newbridge Roundabout on the A8 western approach to the city and the Gogar Roundabout close to Edinburgh Park are other bottlenecks in the west of the city which suffer from congestion. The office and business developments at Edinburgh Park themselves generate a large amount of traffic {{in that part of the}} city, with the new Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters opening at Gogarburn ensuring that upwards of 20,000 people <b>now</b> <b>work</b> in this area. In the city centre itself, narrow, cobbled and winding streets in the Old Town as well as increasing restrictions on vehicles entering the city and strict parking regulations mean that traffic hotspots are common in the city centre itself. Queen Street, Charlotte Square and the western end of Princes Street are areas of significant traffic delay.|$|E
