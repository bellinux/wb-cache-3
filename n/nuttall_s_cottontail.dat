40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Descendants {{of eastern}} cottontails from Ohio (Sylvilagns floridanus) {{introduced}} in Benton County, Oregon and cottontails from Ohio were sampled and analyzed morphometrically and colorimetrically. In general, Oregon cottontails were smaller and lighter in color than Ohio rabbits. Introgression and interspecific {{competition with the}} smaller and darker colored native brush rabbit (S. bachmani) were considered unlikely explanations for observed small size and light color in introduced cottontails. Seasonal differences in rainfall between Ohio and Oregon were suggested as a possible selective force because of the apparent effect of rainfall on population dynamics of <b>Nuttall's</b> <b>cottontails</b> (<b>S.</b> nuttallii). Random processes (genetic drift and an unrepresentative founding population) could not be rejected as possible causes for both small body size and light pelage color. A combination of selective and random processes seems the likely explanation for observed morphological differences...|$|R

40|$|Strychnine-salt blocks were {{evaluated}} for effectiveness in killing porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) in pine forests in Oregon and California. Radio-collared porcupines {{were exposed to}} strychnine-salt bait located on trees {{and on the ground}} in covered bait stations called 2 ̆ 2 cubbies. 2 ̆ 2 Bait blocks placed in trees and in cubbies were poorly accepted by porcupines. Only 4 of 32 marked porcupines exposed to bait were poisoned. Two died at cubbies and two died at trees. Other wildlife found poisoned at cubbies were seven unmarked porcupines, seven yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), five Nuttall 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cottontails</b> (Sylvilagus nuttallii), four deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) three golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and one Douglas 2 ̆ 7 squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii). Fewer nontarget animals [...] two unmarked porcupines, two yellow-pine chipmunks, and one northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) [...] died at tree sets.

40|$|During {{study of}} American Chlorophotas (Kaastra 1972) Chlorophora brasiliensis (Martius) Standley (= Maclura brasiliensis (Martius) Endlicher) and Chlorophora scandens Standley et Williams {{seemed not to}} be closely related to Chlorophora tinctoria (L.) Bentham et Hooker. The taxonomic {{position}} of Maclura brasiliensis was already called dubious by Bentham & Hooker (1880) and more recently also by Macbride (1937); {{the same holds true}} for Chlorophora scandens (Standley & Williams 1950). Chlorophora brasiliensis and Chl. scandens show much resemblance to some other genera treated by Corner (1962) as sections of Maclura: Maclura <b>Nuttall</b> <b>s.</b> s. (= Maclura pomifera (Rafinesque) Schneider), Cardiogyne Bureau, and Cudrania Trécul. Corner, however, did not mention Chlorophora brasiliensis nor Chl. scandens. There is at least one other taxon that seems to be closely related to the group concerned here, the genus Plecospermum Trecul. Bentham & Hooker (1880) combined Plecospermum with Cardiogyne; Corner (l. c.) regarded it as a distinct but problematic genus. Richter (1895), on account of anatomical studies, pointed out that Plecospermum, Cardiogyne, and Cudrania could be regarded as a single genus...|$|R
50|$|In contrast, S. insonus {{differs from}} <b>S.</b> cunicularius (Mexican <b>cottontail)</b> with whom it shares its habitat by being smaller in size.

In colour, dorsally the Omilteme cottontail is a rufous-black colour whereas the Mexican cottontail is only grey dorsally.|$|R
40|$|The genus Sylvilagus, which {{comprises}} the New World cottontail rabbits, contains several commercially important {{as well as}} endangered (or threatened) species. Understanding the evolution of this group is pertinent to their management and conservation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the evolutionary history of the cottontails using sequence data from the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene. The 12 S data provide a robust phylogeny which was supported under a variety of phylogenetic approaches and transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) weighting schemes. Stem and loop regions of the gene were analyzed separately and two different methods of estimating Ti/Tv ratios were employed. The phylogeny obtained was consistent with available cytogenetic information. The 12 S data indicate that separate generic status for the pygmy rabbit, Brachylagus idahoensis, is warranted based on its phylogenetic position and sequence divergence values. Additionally, the taxa which are geographically adjacent are also phylogenetically closely related; for example, the marsh rabbit, S. palustris, and the swamp rabbit, S. aquaticus, are sister taxa, as are the mountain <b>cottontail,</b> <b>S.</b> nuttallii, and desert <b>cottontail,</b> <b>S.</b> audubonii. This finding suggests that recent vicariance events might explain the diversification of several cottontail lineages. r 1997 Academic Pres...|$|R
50|$|Sylvilagus insonus {{differs from}} S. brasiliensis (forest rabbit) and <b>S.</b> dicei (Dice's <b>cottontail)</b> {{in that it}} has a larger, skull, wider {{zygomatic}} bone, deeper rostrum, wider carotid foramina and dorsal extensions of the premaxillaries that extend posterior to the nasal instead. S. insonus also has a narrower basioccipital and narrower post-dental. In external appearance, the Omilteme cottontail has a longer bicoloured tail (rufous and black) instead of a uni-coloured tail (solely brown); hind feet with white and brown versus hind feet of only brown; and longer ears.|$|R
5000|$|The robust cottontail or Davis Mountains cottontail (Sylvilagus robustus) is {{a species}} of cottontail rabbit endemic to four {{mountain}} ranges in the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico. It was long {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the eastern <b>cottontail</b> (<b>S.</b> floridanus), but has recently been promoted to species level due to morphological analysis. [...] Genetic data have confirmed the uniqueness of S. robustus. [...] S. robustus and the subspecies of S. floridanus are distinguished primarily by size, dental, and cranial differences. These rabbits typically average a total length of 42 cm, and weigh between 1.3 and 1.8 kg. This species is restricted to dry, brushy, mountains at elevations above 1500 meters. Despite its rarity, currently no governmental agency provides protection or listing for this species.|$|R
50|$|As many as 37 {{subspecies}} of the tapeti {{have been}} described, but in 2005 Mammal Species of the World recognized 21, having placed the remaining in synonymy and considering the Dice's <b>cottontail</b> (<b>S.</b> dicei) {{as a separate}} species. Nevertheless, the tapeti as traditionally defined is a species complex and it was already recognized in 1990 that a taxonomic review was necessary. Consequently, recent authorities have recommended splitting off several taxa typically considered subspecies of the tapeti and recognizing them as separate species: S. andinus in the Andean highlands of Ecuador (perhaps also in the Andes of Colombia, Venezuela and northern Peru), S. gabbi (with subspecies truei) from Panama to Mexico, S. sanctaemartae in the lowlands of northern Colombia, and S. tapetillus from coastal southeastern Brazil. Additionally, cottontail rabbits from the Guianas have not been clearly assigned to a subspecies, but are traditionally included in the tapeti. In 2017, these were described as a new species, S. parentum, based on specimens from Suriname.|$|R
5000|$|The Appalachian cottontail, Sylvilagus obscurus, {{is a small}} rabbit inhabiting mostly mountainous {{regions in}} the eastern U.S. ranging from Pennsylvania to South Carolina and being most {{prominent}} in the Appalachians. [...] S. obscurus is better adapted to colder climates than its distant relative, S. floridanus, the eastern <b>cottontail.</b> <b>S.</b> obscurus is light-yellow brown, mixed with black on the dorsal side, having a brown and red patch mixed on the neck. The ventral side is mostly white. [...] The Appalachian <b>cottontail</b> and <b>S.</b> transitionalis, the New England cottontail, are not easily distinguished in the field, and are most easily identified geographically. Cottontails found south or west of the Hudson River are considered Appalachian cottontails, those found north and east are considered New England cottontails. The species can otherwise be identified by chromosome number and skull measurements. Female Appalachian cottontails are typically larger than males with reproductive needs being the most likely cause. The weight of the Appalachian Cottontail can range from as little as 756 g up {{to as much as}} 1153 g. The average length is 408 mm. The lifespan of S. obscurus is rather short, less than a year in some cases.|$|R
40|$|The New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) {{is a high}} {{conservation}} {{priority in}} the Northeastern United States and has been listed as a candidate species under the Endangered Species Act. Loss of early successional habitat {{is the most common}} explanation for the decline of the species, which is considered to require habitat with dense low vegetation and limited overstory tree canopy. Federal and state wildlife agencies actively encourage landowners to create this habitat type by clearcutting blocks of forest. However, there are recent indications that the species also occupies sites with moderate overstory tree canopy cover. This is important because many landowners have negative views about clearcutting and are more willing to adopt silvicultural approaches that retain some overstory trees. Furthermore, it is possible that clearcuts with no overstory canopy cover may attract the eastern <b>cottontail</b> (<b>S.</b> floridanus), an introduced species with an expanding range. The objective of our study was to provide guidance for future efforts to create habitat that would be more favorable for New England cottontail than eastern cottontail in areas where the two species are sympatric. We analyzed canopy cover at 336 cottontail locations in five states using maximum entropy modelling and other statistical methods. We found that New England cottontail occupied sites with a mean overstory tree canopy cover of 58 % (SE± 1. 36), and was less likely than eastern cottontail to occupy sites with lower overstory canopy cover and more likely to occupy sites with higher overstory canopy cover. Our findings suggest that silvicultural approaches that retain some overstory canopy cover may be appropriate for creating habitat for New England cottontail. We believe that our results will help inform critical management decisions for the conservation of New England cottontail, and that our methodology can be applied to analyses of habitat use of other critical wildlife species...|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} {{landscape in}} New England {{over the past}} century has {{had a profound effect on}} the abundance and distribution of native wildlife species that prefer early successional habitat. In the mid 20 th Century many of these species, including the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis, NEC), experienced an increase in population numbers as abandoned agricultural fields matured into early successional habitats (ESH). However, as these ESH further matured into forests, populations of early successional wildlife species declined. Possibly as the result of this habitat loss, NEC has so declined that only one habitat patch has been identified that contains NEC in Rhode Island since 2005. The species is now a candidate for listing as an endangered species by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. To identify sites currently occupied by NEC and eastern <b>cottontail</b> (<b>S.</b> floridanus, EC) in Rhode Island, I conducted an intensive statewide survey. I chose survey locations using three criteria: (1) the area is a known historic location for NEC; (2) the area revealed a high calculated habitat suitability index (HSI) value as determined by a model that was developed for NEC; and (3) the location was indicated by a model that generated a statewide cover map of early successional habitats. I also conducted intensive vegetation analyses at known locations of NEC and EC in Connecticut and Rhode Island to better describe their chosen habitat and identify any differences in preference between the two species. Sites in Rhode Island that were occupied by cottontails had more shrub cover, herbaceous cover, less canopy cover, and lower basal area than sites that were not occupied by cottontails. In Connecticut, sites that were occupied by NEC had more canopy cover, and greater basal area than sites occupied by EC. In a comparison of site selection models, the map of early successional habitats identified more sites with cottontails present than the habitat suitability index. ...|$|R
40|$|The New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis), New England’s endemic cottontail, {{has been}} {{experiencing}} dramatic population declines and {{is estimated to}} exist in only 14 % of its historical range. The New England cottontail is currently a candidate for endangered species listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. New England cottontails may be distinguished accurately from eastern <b>cottontails</b> (<b>S.</b> floridanus) {{with the use of}} non-invasive genetic techniques (e. g., fecal sample collection) that allow sampling of large geographical areas with minimal cost. A restriction enzyme technique has been published based on NlaIII (New England Biolabs Inc, Massachusetts) cut sites within the control region of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA); this technique assumes that variation among and between species does not interrupt cut patterns and relies on qualitative identification (visual interpretation of gel bands) with no positive control that true mtDNA has been amplified. Phylogenetic analyses of the New England cottontails, eastern cottontails and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in northeastern states may indicate the reason for New England cottontail decline. Because eastern cottontails were stocked from several locations they may have increased genetic variability, especially when compared to New England cottontails, which could be an indication of hybrid vigor. Furthermore, phylogeographic patterns may help infer introduction and spread patterns of eastern cottontails. I sequenced 1, 773 fecal and tissue samples from CT, MA, NH, NY, and RI. I identified 12 New England cottontail, 101 eastern cottontail, and eight snowshoe hare haplotypes. Eastern cottontails exhibited a larger number of haplotypes compared to New England cottontails; however, there was no geographic pattern to haplotype occurrences. I analyzed all haplotypes using the restriction enzyme technique to test digestion site reliability and found 19 instances of conflicting cut sites between haplotypes and previously published cut sites. I also found two haplotypes that appeared to be non-mitochondrial in origin and can be preferentially amplified in some samples when the mammalian reverse primer used in the restriction enzyme method was used for amplification. To provide an unambiguous and reliable identification method I created a “barcode” for the mitochondrial control region of these three species and developed a rabbit specific reverse primer. I found 13 diagnostic characters for New England cottontail, 18 diagnostic characters for eastern cottontail, and 36 diagnostic characters for snowshoe hare. I propose that the use of the barcode and the rabbit specific reverse primer described here provides a reliable and inexpensive method for species identification. Furthermore, sequencing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) product provides an opportunity to detect non-mitochondrial sequences and provides information for further analyses such as phylogeographic studies. ...|$|R
40|$|CALIFORNIA HOUSE FINCH Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis: Depredations. In California the linnet is an {{abundant}} resident throughout the State wherever {{food and water}} are available. It is most numerous on the valley floors and in the foothills where man 2 ̆ 7 s development has created an extensive favorable habitat. The linnet is primarily a seed eater and before the introduction of domestic fruits into California probably lived largely on weed seeds. Linnets attack the ripening fruit of the apricot, cherry, peach, pear, nectarine, plum, prune, avocado, grape, apple, fig, strawberry, blackberry, raspberry and many others. They disbud almond, apricot, pear, peach, plum, prune and nectarine. They also attack milo maize, sunflower, lettuce seed, broccoli seed, flax seed, miscellaneous vegetable and flower seeds, ornamental fruits and berries and tomato plantlets. HORNED IARKS Otocoris alpestris, subspecies: Depredations. In certain parts of California the horned lark is a serious crop destroyer. The damage occurs mostly in the interior valleys from Sacramento south to the Imperial Valley and along the coastal strip from San Francisco south to San Diego. Horned larks are given great opportunity for damage by the widespread abundance of cultivated products attractive to them. Among the crops severely damaged are plantlets of lettuce, carrots, beets, spinach, turnips, peas, beans, sugar beets, alfalfa, cantaloupes, watermelons, tomatoes and lettuce. Flower plantlets of any variety in commercial seed plantings are frequently devoured. Damage by horned larks usually begins after the first plants break through {{the surface of the}} soil and it may continue until the plants reach a height of several inches. CROWNED SEHRROWS Zonotrichia species and subspecies: Depredations. Direct opposites as to preference of habitat to the horned larks, crowned sparrows are birds of deep brush, river bottom jungles, dense weed fields, fence rows, brush piles or rubbish heaps. The dense hedges and thick plantings of shrubbery commonly found about many rural and suburban homes are much to their liking. Crop depredations in California by crowned sparrows can be laid to three subspecies—Gambel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>Nuttall</b> 2 ̆ 7 s and Golden Crown. Due to its very wide range in the State and to the immense numbers which concentrate here, Gambel 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow must be considered by far the most important. WOODPECKERS: Depredations. In addition to the pecking of holes in buildings and poles, the California woodpecker frequently becomes a serious pest about almond or walnut orchards. The Lewis woodpecker has occasionally caused some damage to apples in certain areas of California...|$|R
