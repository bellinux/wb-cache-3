40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) method was developed for the simultaneous separation and detection of six porphyrins, namely uroporphyrin (UP), heptacarboxylic acid porphyrin (HEPTAP), hexacarboxylic acid porphyrin (HEXAP), pentacarboxylic acid porphyrin (PENTAP), coproporphyrin (CP), and mesoporphyrin (MP), in human urine samples. The recoveries of the porphyrins in urine ranged from 84 to 108 %. The intra-and inter-day precisions at spiked porphyrin concentrations were 4. 0 - 9. 7 % and 5. 5 - 15 %, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0. 2 to 3 nM. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of endogenous porphyrins in human urine. UP, HEPTAP, and PENTAP were detected at levels of 42. 4, 21. 3, and 18. 0 nM, respectively.

50|$|Ozone in the {{stratosphere}} is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160 nm.

40|$|An {{efficient}} Erbium/Ytterbium doped fiber amplifier (EYDFA) {{is demonstrated}} using a 1058 <b>nm</b> pumping wavelength, <b>where</b> the amplification is assisted by energy transfer between Yb and Er ions. The energy transfer increases {{the limit of}} erbium doping concentration that is imposed by concentration quenching in Erbium-doped fiber (EDF). Therefore, the gain and noise figure are severely degraded with 1480 <b>nm</b> pumping, <b>where</b> the energy transfer cannot be achieved. The use of optical isolator improves the small signal gain and noise figure by about 4. 8 dB and 1. 6 dB, respectively. By employing a double-pass configuration, a higher gain can be obtained with an expense of a noise figure penalty. The gain improvement of 17. 0 dB is obtained at 20 mW and - 50 dBm of pump and input signal powers. This shows that the double-pass configuration is an important aspect to consider when designing an efficient EYDFA...|$|R
5000|$|... 4. Polymer fiber Bragg {{gratings}} - Prior to {{the commencement}} of PHOSFOS, gratings in polymer optical fibre (POF) only existed in the 1550 <b>nm</b> spectral region <b>where</b> the large fibre loss (1 dB/cm) only permitted very short (<10 cm) fibre lengths to be used and the devices had to be butt-coupled to a silica fiber pigtail on the optical bench. The PHOSFOS consortium has developed a means for reliably splicing POF to silica fibre and produced the first gratings in the 800 <b>nm</b> spectral region <b>where</b> losses are almost 2 orders of magnitude less than at 1550 nm. These developments have allowed POF grating sensors to be used outside the laboratory for the first time.|$|R
