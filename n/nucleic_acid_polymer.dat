Alongside with these advances in biosensor applications, receptor materials that make it possible to transduce biological phenomena have also been extensively investigated in many fields.

In addition, transducers normally do not have specificity against a target analyte [16]. For that reason, the development of a sensor that is able to selectively detect target analytes is required [1]. Moreover, target-specificity is also an essential factor in the novel sensor development.|$|E

Both REP 2139 and REP 2165 were well tolerated at clinically relevant doses, with no alterations in liver, kidney, or hematological function. In chronic duck HBV (DHBV) infection, REP 2165 displayed significantly reduced liver accumulation after repeated dosing but retained antiviral activity similar to REP 2139.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{a series}} of transition metal complexes that recognize the nucleic acid binding sites based on shape selection. By matching the shapes and symmetries of the metal complexes to particular variations in local nucleic acid conformation, a family of molecules that target different DNA sites have been developed. The recognition of a site depends on the local conformation, or shape, {{rather than on the}} sequence directly. Indeed, based purely on such considerations of shape and symmetry, a high level of specificity may be achieved. The molecules prepared serve as a novel series of conformation-selective probes, and these may be utilized to map the topological variations in structure along the <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymer.</b> The chapter also discusses the sequence-neutral cleavage complex, Rh(phi) ^ 2 bpy^(3 +) (where bpy is bipyridine), a useful reagent for high-resolution photofootprinting, as well as several conformation specific tools to examine nucleic acid structure. These various ruthenium and rhodium complexes may be applied to detect subtle variations in B-DNA conformations or to investigate global secondary structures of a polynucleotide such as DNA cruciforms, left-handed Z-DNA, and A-form DNA. The chapter describes the way the secondary and tertiary structure of RNA may be examined using this methodology. The different information that may be gained from these methods is also discussed. In general, studies with these complexes provide a unique and sensitive handle to probe elements of nucleic acid polymorphism in solution...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how {{a simple}} {{chemical}} system can accurately replicate combinatorial information, {{such as a}} sequence, is an important question for both the study {{of life in the}} universe and for the development of evolutionary molecular design techniques. During biological sequence replication, a <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymer</b> serves as a template for the enzyme-catalyzed assembly of a complementary sequence. Enzymes then separate the template and complement before the next round of replication. Attempts to understand how replication could occur more simply, such as without enzymes, have largely focused on developing minimal versions of this replication process. Here we describe how a different mechanism, crystal growth and scission, can accurately replicate chemical sequences without enzymes. Crystal growth propagates a sequence of bits while mechanically-induced scission creates new growth fronts. Together, these processes exponentially increase the number of crystal sequences. In the system we describe, sequences are arrangements of DNA tile monomers within ribbon-shaped crystals. 99. 98 % of bits are copied correctly and 78 % of 4 -bit sequences are correct after two generations; roughly 40 sequence copies are made per growth front per generation. In principle, this process is accurate enough for 1, 000 -fold replication of 4 -bit sequences with 50 % yield, replication of longer sequences, and Darwinian evolution. We thus demonstrate that neither enzymes nor covalent bond formation are required for robust chemical sequence replication. The form of the replicated information is also compatible with the replication and evolution of a wide class of materials with precise nanoscale geometry such as plasmonic nanostructures or heterogeneous protein assemblies...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} Darwinian {{evolution}} required {{the emergence of}} molecular mechanisms for the heritable variation of fitness. One model for such a system involves populations of competing protocells, each consisting of a replicating genetic polymer encapsulated within a replicating membrane vesicle. In this model, the encapsulated genetic polymer imparts enhanced fitness to its protocell by, for example, coding for a catalyst that generates a useful metabolite. Vesicles are the best known model for testing properties of the self-assembled protocell membranes, and a model of protocell encapsulation. (Luisi, Walde et al. 1999) It is generally agreed that at the earliest stage of the prebiotic bilayer membrane formation membranes consisted of simple, long chain carboxylic acids.

However, {{it is difficult to imagine}} how <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymers</b> first appeared, as the abiotic chemical formation of long <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymers</b> from mononucleotides or short oligonucleotides remains elusive, and barriers to achieving this goal are substantial. One specific obstacle to abiotic <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> polymerization is strand cyclization. Chemically activated short oligonucleotides cyclize efficiently, which severely impairs polymer growth. We show that intercalation, which stabilizes and rigidifies <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> duplexes, almost totally eliminates strand cyclization, allowing for chemical ligation of tetranucleotides into duplex polymers of up to 100 base pairs in length. In contrast, when these reactions are performed in the absence of intercalators, almost exclusively cyclic tetra- and octanucleotides are produced. Intercalator-free polymerization is not observed, even at tetranucleotide concentrations >  10, 000 -fold greater than those at which intercalators enable polymerization. We also demonstrate that intercalation-mediated polymerization is most favored if the size of the intercalator matches that of the base pair; intercalators that bind to Watson–Crick base pairs promote the polymerization of oligonucleotides that form these base pairs. Additionally, we demonstrate that intercalation-mediated polymerization is possible with an alternative, non-Watson–Crick-paired duplex that selectively binds a complementary intercalator. These results support the hypothesis that intercalators (acting as ‘molecular midwives’) could have facilitated the polymerization of the first <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> and possibly helped select the first base pairs, even if only trace amounts of suitable oligomers were available...|$|R

In contrast to a great deal of efforts in synthesizing novel cationic polymers and exploring their extracellular and intracellular delivery pathways, polyplex preparation methods of mixing <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> and cationic <b>polymers</b> are often overlooked. In this study, the mixing sequence, that is adding <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> to <b>polymers</b> or vice versa, was found to greatly affect complexation of both plasmid DNA and siRNA, polyple xes' size, and polyplexes' surface charge, which all collaboratively affected the transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity.

40|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of life suggests that life emerged in a hydrothermal mineral assemblage containing sulphides and hydroxides. The research reported in this thesis shows that these minerals interact with <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymers.</b> This has two consequences. Firstly, metal sulphides, particularly iron sulphides, cause the scission of DNA and thus the survival of DNA in this environment is improbable. On the other hand, the reactions at low concentrations could lead to rapid mutations of DNA-like molecules and thus would have affected its evolution. These reactions also have biochemical consequences. For DNA to retain its function as the hereditary molecule it needs to be separated from concentrations of FeS. This also suggests that the results of the molecular ecology of sulfide-rich environments might be affected by reaction with iron sulphides. The effect that these nanoparticulate sulphides have had on the emergence and survival of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymers</b> has been investigated through plasmid electrophoresis and UV-Vis spectrometry. Metal sulphides interact with DNA in two ways: scission of the DNA backbone and binding with sulphide particles. Treatment of pDNA with FeS, CuS, Fe(II), and Cu(II) breaks the ribo-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule. This occurs through sulphur-based free radicals produced through redox reactions between S 22 " and Fe(II) and Cu(I) ions. Migration of oligomeric DNA in electrophoresis is retarded by FeS, CuS and ZnS which is attributed to the binding of nanoparticulate sulphides to the DNA. DNA, RNA, adenine, deoxyadenosine and deoxyadenosine monophosphate bind to FeS, CuS, ZnS and Fe(II) /Fe(III) hydroxides. This occurs through the nucleobase rather than the phosphate. Longer DNA molecules adsorb more readily than oligomers, RNA or monomers. Thus the hypothesis that iron-sulphide minerals could adsorb and concentrate <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> constituents promoting <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> formation and then polymerisation is supported, although the hypothesis that the phosphate group emerged to allow this binding is not necessary In the absence of sulphide, Fe(II) causes similar effects. Scission of the DNA occurs through hydroxyl radicals produced through a reaction with trace amounts of Ot also DNA adsorbed onto precipitated green rusts (Fe(II) /(III) hydroxides). Sulphide, in the absence of metal ions, induced no effect on DNA. In the absence of redox, transition metals oxyhydroxides adsorb to DNA but do not act to break up the molecule. Therefore, non-redox active metal sulphides, such as zinc, could have provided some of the functionality of iron sulphide especially with regards to <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> formation, but without producing free radicals and therefore, simultaneous <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> destruction.

40|$|Multiple {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{support the hypothesis}} that the early evolution of life was dominated by RNA, which can both transfer information from generation to generation through replication directed by base-pairing, and carry out biochemical activities by folding into functional structures. To understand how life emerged from prebiotic chemistry we must therefore explain the steps that led to the emergence of the RNA world, and in particular, the synthesis of RNA. The generation of pools of highly pure ribonucleotides on the early Earth seems unlikely, but the presence of alternative nucleotides would support the assembly of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymers</b> containing nonheritable backbone heterogeneity. We suggest that homogeneous monomers might not have been necessary if populations of heterogeneous <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> molecules could evolve reproducible function.

A high-yielding synthetic route for the nonenzymatic polymerization of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> based on the aqueous self-assembly of their components, would provide a powerful tool in <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> chemistry, with potential utility in prebiotic and contemporary <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> systems alike – however, such a route remains elusive. In this thesis, I describe several steps towards such a synthetic route. In these systems, a nucleic-acid binding ligand drives the assembly of short DNA and RNA duplexes, promoting the production of long <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymers,</b> while suppressing the production of short, cyclic species. Additionally, the use of a reversible covalent linkage allows for the production of long polymers, as well as the incorporation of previously cyclized products into these polymers. I also report several explorations of novel base pairings, nucleic acid-ligand interactions, and nucleic acid-ion interactions that have informed our studies of self-assembling <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> systems.

Ribozymes tend to be compositionally unbiased, as is {{the vast majority of}} possible sequence space. However, ribonucleotides vary greatly in synthetic yield, reactivity and degradation rate, and their non-enzymatic polymerization results in compositionally biased sequences. While natural selection could lead to complex sequences, molecules with some activity are required to begin this process. Was the emergence of compositionally diverse sequences a matter of chance, or could prebiotically plausible reactions counter chemical biases to increase the probability of finding a ribozyme? Our in silico simulations using a two-letter alphabet show that template-directed ligation and high concatenation rates counter compositional bias and shift the pool toward longer sequences, permitting greater exploration of sequence space and stable folding. We verified experimentally that unbiased DNA sequences are more efficient templates for ligation, thus increasing the compositional diversity of the pool. Our work suggests that prebiotically plausible chemical mechanisms of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> polymerization and ligation could predispose toward a diverse pool of longer, potentially structured molecules. Such mechanisms could have {{set the stage for the}} appearance of functional activity very early in the emergence of life...|$|R
