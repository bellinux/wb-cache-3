5|$|Due to an archaic law in Erie County, {{the town}} of Tonawanda and {{the town of}} Amherst, who {{completed}} the road in 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2million (1935USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the <b>new</b> <b>road</b> a financial burden for the county. To make things worse, the <b>new</b> <b>road</b> did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E

5|$|The {{alignment}} of NY167 follows the Paine's Hollow Road, constructed between Little Falls and Paines Hollow. This <b>new</b> <b>road</b> would shorten {{time between the}} two communities through Herkimer County. The Paine's Hollow Road opened on October 4, 1921, opening a <b>new</b> <b>road</b> through the dairy country of the Mohawk Valley. The <b>new</b> <b>road</b> had branch alignments toward Oneonta, Cooperstown and Richfield Springs. At 1 p.m. (1800 UTC) that day, a convoy of vehicles drove the route south from Little Falls, with a band on a large truck and a coach with six horses. When the group reached Paines Hollow, a ceremony was held, led {{by the president of}} the Little Falls Chamber of Commerce and H.P. Snyder, the local legislator for Herkimer County.
