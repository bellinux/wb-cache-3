40|$|The {{detection}} of multi-resistant bacterial pathogens, particularly those to carbapenemases, in leukemic and stem cell transplant patients forces {{the use of}} old or <b>non-conventional</b> <b>agents</b> as the only remaining treatment options. These include colistin/polymyxin B, tigecycline, fosfomycin and various anti-gram-positive agents. Data {{on the use of}} these agents in leukemic patients are scanty, with only linezolid subjected to formal trials. The Expert Group of the 4 (th) European Conference on Infections in Leukemia has developed guidelines for their use in these patient populations. Targeted therapy should be based on (i) in vitro susceptibility data, (ii) knowledge of the best treatment option against the particular species or phenotype of bacteria, (iii) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, and (iv) careful assessment of the risk-benefit balance. For infections due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria, these agents should be preferably used in combination with other agents that remain active in vitro, because of suboptimal efficacy (e. g., tigecycline) and the risk of emergent resistance (e. g., fosfomycin). The paucity of new antibacterial drugs in the near future should lead us to limit the use of these drugs to situations where no alternative exists...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: Allogenic human fascia lata used in neurosurgery, as {{dura mater}} substitute, can be {{associated}} with a risk of viral and bacterial transmission. Chemical and physical procedures, developed to inactivate virus and bacteria, have been applied to fascia lata. The aim of this study consists in the evaluation of the biological properties of this treated graft. METHODS: Grafts were treated with solvent detergents, freeze-dried for conservation and gamma irradiated (25, 000 Gy) for sterilization. The indirect toxicity evaluation was performed by extraction method, according to the International Standard Organization (ISO). First, the cytotoxic effect of each extracts incubated in the presence of human fibroblasts (WI 38) was quantitatively assessed by measuring the cell growth, the viability (succinate dehydrogenase activity, MTT), the membrane integrity (uptake of the neutral red by viable cells, NR) as well as the release of lactate dehydrogenase in the culture medium. Second, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to assess the direct contact between human primary fibroblasts and graft. CLSM was performed at days 3 and 7 after cells loading. RESULTS: No acute cytotoxicity was observed for chemically processed allografts. Cells loaded on the graft have demonstrated a good growth and spreading. CONCLUSIONS: Human fascia lata secured against conventional and <b>non-conventional</b> <b>agents</b> is a fully biocompatible alternative to the available dural graft materials...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{pharmacological}} {{and psychological}} interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment in {{primary and secondary}} care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), {{is one of the}} antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclics, SSRIs and other newer antidepressive agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were electronically searched in August 2008. References of relevant trials and other reviews were also checked. Trial databases of the drug-approving agencies and ongoing clinical trial registers for all published and unpublished trials were hand-searched in 2007. All relevant authors were contacted for supplemental data. No language restriction was applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with any other active antidepressive <b>agents</b> (including <b>non-conventional</b> <b>agents</b> such as herbal products like hypericum) as monotherapy in the acute phase of major depression were selected. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently checked eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The number of participants who responded to treatment or those who achieved remission were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, combining data from the included trials. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n= 2277) were included in the meta-analysis. Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95 % confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressive agents. However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0. 55; 95 %CI 0. 35 to 0. 85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether milnacipran is superior, inferior or the same as other antidepressive agents in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, there is some evidence in favour of milnacipran over TCAs in terms of dropouts due to adverse events (acceptability) and the rates of experiencing adverse events (tolerability). Information about other clinically meaningful outcomes such as cost-effectiveness and social functioning, including the ability to return to work, is lacking. Further study is needed to answer whether milnacipran would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{pharmacological}} {{and psychological}} interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain {{the mainstay of}} treatment in primary and secondary care settings. During the last 20 years, antidepressant prescribing has risen dramatically in western countries, {{mainly because of the}} increasing consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and newer antidepressants, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with tricyclics, other SSRIs, heterocyclics and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases were searched up to July 2008. Trial databases of drug-approving agencies were hand-searched for published, unpublished and ongoing controlled trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials comparing escitalopram against any other antidepressant (including <b>non-conventional</b> <b>agents</b> such as hypericum) for patients with major depressive disorder (regardless of the diagnostic criteria used). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were entered by two review authors (double data entry). Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (with 95 % CI) using the random effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials compared escitalopram with another SSRI and eight compared escitalopram with a newer antidepressive agent (venlafaxine, bupropion and duloxetine). Escitalopram was shown to be significantly more effective than citalopram in achieving acute response (OR 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 50 to 0. 87). Escitalopram was also more effective than citalopram in terms of remission (OR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 30 to 0. 93). Significantly fewer patients allocated to escitalopram withdrew from trials compared with patients allocated to duloxetine, for discontinuation due to any cause (OR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 99). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Some statistically significant differences favouring escitalopram over other antidepressive agents for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found, in terms of efficacy (citalopram and fluoxetine) and acceptability (duloxetine). There is insufficient evidence to detect a difference between escitalopram and other antidepressants in early response to treatment (after two weeks of treatment). Cost-effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Furthermore, as with most standard systematic reviews, the findings rely on evidence from direct comparisons. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should also be borne in mind...|$|R

Resistance to conventional antibiotics by pathogenic bacteria has emerged {{in recent years as}} a major problem of public health. In order to overcome this problem, <b>non-conventional</b> antimicrobial <b>agents</b> have been under investigation. In this study, polyacrylate-based hydrogel thin coatings have been electrosynthesised on titanium substrates starting from poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate) –co– acrylic acid. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a narrow size distribution have been synthesized using a “green” procedure and immobilized on Ti implant surfaces exploiting hydrogel coatings’ swelling capabilities. The coatings have been characterized by XPS and SEM/EDX, while their silver release performances have been monitored by ICP–MS. The antibacterial activity of these AgNP-modified hydrogel coatings was tested evaluating in vitro inhibition growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, among the most common pathogens in orthopaedic infections. Moreover, a preliminary investigation of the biocompatibility of silver-loaded coatings versus MG 63 human osteoblast-like cells has been performed. An important point of strength of this paper, in fact, is the concern about the effect of silver species on the surrounding cell system in implanted medical devices. Silver ion release has been properly tuned in order to assure antibacterial activity while preserving osteoblasts’ respons...|$|R
30|$|Antibacterial surface {{modification}} of biomedical materials has evolved as a potentially effective method of preventing bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation on medical devices [11]. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation on implanted devices represent an important complication in, e.g., orthopedic surgery, dental surgery, or during replacement of skin cover after severe post-traumatic conditions (burns and abrasions), and {{may result in}} implant failure. Controlled release of antibacterial agents directly at the implant site may represent an effective approach to treat these chronic complications [9]. Recent advances {{in the field of}} nanotechnology led scientific opinion to consider metal nanoparticle recruitment a very promising tool to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria [10, 11]. Among the nanomaterials, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have shown good inhibitory and antimicrobial efficacy against a significant number of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, yeasts, and fungal species) [12], without provoking microbial resistance [13]. Moreover, silver ions have demonstrated the capability to inhibit biofilm formation [14]. Resistance to conventional antibiotics by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years as a major problem of public health. In order to overcome this problem, <b>non-conventional</b> antimicrobial <b>agents</b> have been under investigation. Silver-based medical products, ranging from bandages for wound healing to coated stents and catheters, have been proved effective in retarding and preventing infections of a broad spectrum of bacteria [15]. Surface proteins are probably the most Ag+-sensitive sites, and their alterations result in bacterial disruption due to structural and severe metabolic damage. Silver ions inhibit a number of enzymatic activities by reacting with electron donor groups, especially sulfhydryl groups [16]. In contrast to the antibacterial properties of silver (both as ions and as metallic nanoparticles), its potential cytotoxic effects on eukaryotes have not yet been satisfactorily elucidated [17]. However, {{it is clear that the}} potential adverse effects of AgNPs issued from their ability to penetrate the membrane and then interfere with various metabolic pathways of the cell [18]. Improvements in the development of non-cytotoxic, bactericidal silver-containing products are therefore being continuously sought. In particular, increasing interest is being shown towards the safe exploitation of silver nanotechnology in the fabrication of bioactive biomaterials.|$|R
40|$|Dopamine (DA) besides its {{action in}} the nervous system, plays an {{important}} role in immune cells interactions. Emerging role of DA as a regulator of CD 4 + T cells physiology is important since dysregulation of different T cell subsets, showing abnormal cell numbers, functions, expression of dopamine receptors (DR) and/or response to DA, could contribute to the onset and development of some immune-related disorders. Thus, directly and indirectly acting dopaminergic therapeutics, currently used in approved clinical indications, could represent an attractive source of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>agents</b> for the modulation of CD 4 + T cell functions. The aim of the present work was to develop in vitro methods to investigate the effects of dopaminergic agents, currently used in the pharmacotherapy, on the functional responses of CD 4 + T cells, namely: (i) CD 4 + T naïve (Tn), T central memory (TCM) and T effector memory (TEM) cells, and their responses to recall antigen (Ag); (ii) CD 4 + T regulatory cells (Treg), and their suppressive effects on T effector cells (Teff) and (iii) CD 4 + T naïve cells, and their ability to differentiate towards different T helper (Th) lineages (Th 1 /Th 2 /Th 17). In cultured CD 4 + T cells, our results have shown higher expression of DR in apoptotic cells in comparison to viable cells and stimulation-induced DR upregulation of all DR on viable cells. Addition of high concentrations of DA and L-DOPA (100 μM) have shown profound effect on survival of CD 4 + T cells. Interestingly, based on preliminary experiments, our ex vivo data have shown trend of proliferating cells expressing DR in higher percentages that still need to be validated in subsequent studies on more subjects. So far, in vitro tested concentrations of dopaminergic agonists have not shown any major effects on proliferation of CD 4 + T cells. In addition, through the use of flow cytometric analysis, expression of DR was examined on human: CD 4 + naïve T lymphocytes (CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 45 RA+CCR 7 +), TCM (CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 45 RA-CCR 7 +), TEM (CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 45 RA-CCR 7 -), Treg cells (CD 4 +CD 25 highCD 127 low), and also frequency of different Th subsets: Th 1 (CD 4 +CXCR 3 +CCR 4 -CCR 6 -), Th 2 (CD 4 +CXCR 3 -CCR 4 +CCR 6 -), Th 17 (CD 4 +CXCR 3 -CCR 4 -CCR 6 +) and Th 1 /Th 17 (CD 4 +CXCR 3 +CCR 4 -CCR 6 +) were analysed. DR expression of all five DR was confirmed on each subset, present in a different extension potentially represents an opportunity to develop targeted immunomodulating strategies. Validated and developed in vitro method to test functional response of memory CD 4 + T cells towards recall Ag have potential relevance for a wide range of different fields of T cell biology research in health and disease. Additionally, obtained preliminary results have confirmed in vitro experimental conditions likely appropriate to study commitment of naïve CD 4 + T cells and factors mimicking specific polarisation routes (Th 1 /Th 2 /Th 17), which are T subsets important in onset and development of some dopamine-related disorders. Further, in vitro methods have shown CD 4 +CD 25 high T cell-dependent inhibition of CD 4 + T effector lymphocyte proliferation. Treg cells also suppressed production of IFN-γ and TNF-α from Teff cells. In addition, effects of DA and L-DOPA treatments seems to suppress Treg suppressive capacity in healthy subjects and in the group of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients who had never been treated (PD-dn), but not in PD patients that were on dopaminergic therapy (PD-dt). Available evidence supports the possibility to repurpose dopaminergic agents as modulators of dopaminergic pathways, shifting the balance towards beneficial outcomes in some pathological conditions, such as PD. Over the last decades, an impressive number of studies in the animal model of immune diseases and in the clinical setting supported this evidence, and strongly required futher testing. The development of therapeutic protocols needs to take into account that DR exists in multiple subtypes and their patterns of expression, and that fuctional relevance differs among immune cells - and may even depend on the functional status (e. g. resting/activated) of specific cells. Proposed in vitro methods examined and characterised the various CD 4 + T cell lineages, providing both the conceptual as well as the experimental framework for more in-depth investigation of dopaminergic pathways modulating CD 4 + T cell function...|$|R
