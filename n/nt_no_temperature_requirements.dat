40|$|A {{spring wheat}} (Triticum aestivum) and an obligate winter wheat (Triticum compactum) variety were each grown for 5 weeks in {{controlled}} environments at 2 ° and 25 °. The threshold for flower induction {{in the winter}} wheat was 4 to 5 weeks at 2 °, whereas the spring wheat had <b>no</b> low <b>temperature</b> <b>requirement</b> for flowering. Changes in the levels of carbohydrate and nitrogen fractions in the wheat leaves were determined during their growth {{in the cold and}} warm environments. There was an enhanced accumulation of the 5 carbohydrate fractions in both wheat varieties grown at 2 ° compared to 25 °. Highly significant differences in the levels of sucrose, oligosaccharides, and starch were found between the spring and winter varieties grown at 2 °. The winter wheat seedlings grown at 2 ° accumulated much more of these carbohydrates than the corresponding spring wheat. The carbohydrate patterns in both varieties grown at 25 ° were nearly identical except for the final 2 weeks of growth...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: GA 8 {{magnesium}} alloy {{is a general}} purpose gravity sand casting alloy containing aluminum, zincand manganese. Typically, it is used in aerospace or commercial casting applications particularly where thereis <b>no</b> high <b>temperature</b> <b>requirement.</b> The aim {{of this paper is}} to present the results of investigations on themicrostructure of the GA 8 {{magnesium alloy}} after heat treatment. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted on GA 8 magnesium alloys in as-cast conditionand after heat treatment. The microstructure was characterized by optical microscopy (Olympus GX- 70) and ascanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S 3400) equipped with an electron dispersive detector EDS (VOYAGERof NORAN INSTRUMENTS). To measure the stereological parameters, an image analysis program“AnalysisPro®” was used. Findings: The microstructure of GA 8 magnesium alloy has a solid solution structure α with α + d iscontinuous ßareas and continuous ß (Mg 17 Al 12) phase at grain boundaries. After solution treatment a reduction of the number ofß precipitations was observed. Application of ageing treatment caused precipitation of discontinuous ß phase. Research limitations/implications: Future researches should involve investigations of the effect of heattreatment parameters on the mechanical properties of GA 8 magnesium alloy. Practical implications: The established heat treatment parameters can be useful for preparing heat treatmenttechnology of the GA 8 magnesium alloy. Originality/value: The relationship between the initial structure, heat treatment parameters and Mg 17 Al 12 phasemorphology in GA 8 magnesium alloy was specified...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: GA 8 {{magnesium}} alloy {{is a general}} purpose gravity sand casting alloy containing aluminum, zinc andmanganese. Typically, it is used in aerospace, automotive or commercial casting applications particularly wherthere is <b>no</b> high <b>temperature</b> <b>requirement.</b> Particularly for elements of the car interior, car body, chassis and drivinggears. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present the results of investigations on the microstructure of the GA 8 magnesiumalloy after precipitation hardening. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted on GA 8 {{magnesium alloy}}s in as-cast condition anafter heat treatment. The microstructure was characterized by optical microscopy (Olympus GX- 70) and a scanninelectron microscopy (Hitachi S 3400) equipped with an electron dispersive detector EDS (VOYAGER of NORANINSTRUMENTS). To measure the stereological parameters, an image analysis program “AnalysisPro®” was used. Findings: A cast of the GA 8 magnesium alloy shows the presence of continuous and discontinuous precipitateof β (Mg 17 Al 12) phase at the solid-solution grain boundaries, Moreover, the occurrence of Mg 2 Si and Mn 5 Al 8 phases has been provided. After solution treatment at 415 °C the area fraction of continuous and discontinuous βphase precipitates decreased. After ageing at 170 °C GA 8 alloy is characterized by discontinuous β phase along thsolid solution grain boundaries. Area fraction of this phase increased compared to supersaturated state. Research limitations/implications: Future researches should involve investigations of the influence oprecipitation hardening parameters on the mechanical properties of GA 8 magnesium alloy. Practical implications: The established precipitation hardening parameters can be useful for preparing heatreatment technology of the GA 8 magnesium alloy. Originality/value: The relationship between the as cast structure, precipitation hardening parameters anMg 17 Al 12 phase morphology in GA 8 magnesium alloy was specified...|$|R
