40|$|Soft gamma {{repeaters}} are high-energy transient sources {{associated with}} neutron stars in young supernova remnants 1. They emit sporadic, short (∼ 0. 1 s) bursts with soft energy spectra {{during periods of}} intense activity. The event of March 5, 1979 was the most intense and the only clearly periodic one to date 2, 7. Here we report on an even more intense burst on August 27, 1998, from a different soft gamma repeater, which displayed a hard energy spectrum at its peak, and {{was followed by a}} ∼ 300 s long tail with a soft energy spectrum and a dramatic 5. 16 s period. Its peak and time integrated energy fluxes at Earth are the largest yet observed from any cosmic source. This event was probably initiated by a massive disruption of the neutron star crust, followed by an outflow of energetic particles rotating with the period of the star. Comparison of these two bursts supports the idea that magnetic energy plays an important role, and that such giant flares, while rare, are not unique, and may occur {{at any time in the}} <b>neutron</b> star’s activity <b>cycle.</b> Four soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) are known.

40|$|In {{the core}} of the high {{temperature}} reactor the fuel element and the coated particles contained herein provide the safest enclosure for fission products. The complex process of fission product transport out of the particle kernel, through the particle coating and within the fuel element graphite is described in a simplified form by the Fick's diffusion. The effective diffusion coefficient is used for calculation. Starting from the existing ideas of fission product transport five burn-up and temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients for Cesium in (Th,U) O$_{ 2 }$ -kernels are derived in this study. The results have been gained from several fuel element radiation experiments in recent years, which showed extreme variation in regard to burn-up, temperature <b>cycle,</b> <b>neutron</b> flux and operation time. Cs 137 -release measurements from single particle kernels were present from all the experiments. Furthermore, annealing tests of AVR-fuel elements were analyzed. Heat-temperature and heating-time, the fuel element burn-up in the AVR-reactor, as well as the measured Cs 137 -inventory of thefuel elements before and after annealing, are included in the investigation as essential parameters. With the aid of the derived diffusion coefficients and already present data sets the Cs 137 -release of fuel elements into a small reactor core is investigated under unrestricted core heat-up. While the released Cs 137 is derived mainly from defective particles at accident temperatures up to 1600 ° C, the main part diffuses through the particle coating at higher accident temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{measurement}} techniques {{are important for}} early detection of illicit use of nuclear and radioactive material. Nuclear safeguards are an important tool to impede the illicit handling of fissionable material. But the scope of safeguards is only nuclear material within the fuel <b>cycle.</b> <b>Neutron</b> emitting radioactive material may have its origin from the fuel cycle {{as well as from}} an industrial neutron source. Terrorist attacks using neutron emitting material may have far reaching consequences not only if nuclear material is involved. Therefore it is of great importance that mobile measuring systems are available to detect and to respond to possible malicious acts involving this material. Fraunhofer INT has built up a mobile measuring system in a transportable container for the detection and identification of radioactive and nuclear material. The system is equipped with various types of detectors for neutron and gamma radiation, some of the detectors are similar to those used in safeguards. The measuring capabilities of the system have been extended by mobile, easy transportable neutron measuring devices. These devices not only count neutrons but are also able to give additional spectral, coincidence, or multiplicity information. Thereby different types of neutron sources, like SNM or industrial, can be distinguished. Various mobile neutron detection devices have been tested in different neutron fields of variable strength and with additional shielding of different types. Results of these measurements will be presented. The advantages and disadvantages of different concepts will be shown. This may help to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear material...|$|R
40|$|Performing {{nuclear reactor}} core physics {{analysis}} {{is a crucial}} {{step in the process}} of both designing and understanding nuclear power reactors. Advancements in the nuclear industry demand more accurate and detailed results from reactor analysis. Monte Carlo (MC) eigenvalue neutron transport methods are uniquely qualified to provide these results, due to their accurate treatment of space, angle, and energy dependencies of neutron distributions. Monte Carlo eigenvalue simulations are, however, challenging, because they must resolve the fission source distribution and accumulate sufficient tally statistics, resulting in prohibitive run times. This thesis proposes the Low Order Operator (LOO) acceleration method to reduce the run time challenge, and provides analyses to support its use for full-scale reactor simulations. LOO is implemented in the continuous energy Monte Carlo code, OpenMC, and tested in 2 D PWR benchmarks. The Low Order Operator (LOO) acceleration method is a deterministic transport method based on the Method of Characteristics. Similar to Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD), the other acceleration method evaluated in this thesis, LOO parameters are constructed from Monte Carlo tallies. The solutions to the LOO equations are then used to update Monte Carlo fission sources. This thesis deploys independent simulations to rigorously assess LOO, CMFD, and unaccelerated Monte Carlo, simulating up to a quarter of a trillion neutron histories for each simulation. Analysis and performance models are developed to address two aspects of the Monte Carlo run time challenge. First, this thesis demonstrates that acceleration methods can reduce the vast number of neutron histories required to converge the fission source distribution before tallies can be accumulated. Second, the slow convergence of tally statistics is improved with the acceleration methods for the earlier active cycles. A theoretical model is developed to explain the observed behaviors and predict convergence rates. Finally, numerical results and theoretical models shed light on the selection of optimal simulation parameters such that a desired statistical uncertainty can be achieved with minimum neutron histories. This thesis demonstrates that the conventional wisdom (e. g., maximizing the number of cycles rather than the number of <b>neutrons</b> per <b>cycle)</b> in performing unaccelerated MC simulations can be improved simply by using more optimal parameters. LOO acceleration provides reduction of a factor of at least 2. 2 in neutron histories, compared to the unaccelerated Monte Carlo scheme, and the CPU time and memory overhead associated with LOO are small. by Lulu Li.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of the {{spectral}} and timing analysis of the X-ray pulsar LMC X- 4 based on data from the NuSTAR observatory in the broad X-ray energy range 3 - 79 keV. Along with a detailed analysis of the source's averaged spectrum, high-precision spectra corresponding to different phases of the <b>neutron</b> star spin <b>cycle</b> have been obtained for the first time. The Comptonization model is shown to describe best the source's spectrum, and the evolution of its parameters {{as a function of the}} pulse phase has been traced. For all spectra (the averaged and phase-resolved ones) in the energy range 5 - 55 keV we have searched for the cyclotron absorption line. The derived upper limit on the optical depth of the cyclotron line τ 0. 15 (3 σ) points to the absence of this feature in the given energy range, which provides a constraint on the magnetic field of the neutron star: B 6. 5 × 10 ^(12) G. The latter constraint is consistent with the magnetic field estimate obtained by analyzing the pulsar's power spectrum, B ≅ 3 × 10 ^(13) G. Based on our analysis of the phase-resolved spectra, we have determined the delay between the emission peaks and the equivalent width of the fluorescent iron line. This delay depends on the orbital phase and is apparently associated with the travel time of photons between the emitting regions in the vicinity of the neutron star and the region where the flux is reflected (presumably in the inflowing stream or at the place of interaction between the stream and the outer edge of the accretion disk) ...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear power {{provides}} approximately 17 % of the world’s electricity, {{which is}} equivalent {{to a reduction in}} carbon emissions of ~ 0. 5 gigatonnes (Gt) of C/yr. This is a modest reduction as compared with global emissions of carbon, ~ 7 Gt C/yr. Most analyses suggest that {{in order to have a}} signifi cant and timely impact on carbon emissions, carbon-free sources, such as nuclear power, would have to expand total production of energy by factors of three to ten by 2050. A three-fold increase in nuclear power capacity would result in a projected reduction in carbon emissions of 1 to 2 Gt C/yr, depending on the type of carbon-based energy source that is displaced. This three-fold increase utilizing present nuclear technologies would result in 25, 000 metric tonnes (t) of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) per year, containing over 200 t of plutonium. This is compared to a present global inventory of approxi-mately 280, 000 t of SNF and> 1, 700 t of Pu. A nuclear weapon can be fashioned from as little as 5 kg of 239 Pu. However, there is considerable technological fl exibility in the nuclear fuel cycle. There are three types of nuclear fuel cycles that might be utilized for the increased production of energy: open, closed, or a symbiotic combination of different types of reactor (such as, thermal and fast neutron reactors).

40|$|Several system codes {{have been}} {{developed}} since the eighties, with different objectives and appropriate architecture and level of development, aiming to explore possible operating condition ranges of a fusion power reactor. In some “system codes” technology/engineering assumptions/models (e. g. thermodynamic efficiency of coolant <b>cycle,</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplication coefficient, Tritium Breeding Ratio, radial built) are treated as input data inserted by the user and integrated in a main module essentially describing “plasma physics” aspects. In a first stage, these values come from previous studies on equivalent reactor concepts. Subsequent and more complete analyses with detailed models allow to confirm/deny these values and modify, if needed, for a second run and most likely several run, up to convergence. Some other codes consist of different specific modules (calculation tools) each one treating a separate aspects (e. g. physics, engineering, costing [...] .) and integrated together in a common multiphysics calculation platform. Appropriate modules consistently calculate needed values using simplified models or surrogate models that enable an acceleration of the convergence of these systems codes. A system code based on this approach, SYCOMORE, is under development at CEA. The characteristics of the plasma and of the various reactor subsystems are addressed by various codes/models which are linked together via an integrated tokamak modelling platform. This platform allows creating a system design workflow by chaining {{the execution of the}} various modules. In this framework, this document describes a methodology developed to build the neutronic module of SYCOMORE: a surrogate model, based on neural network giving main neutronic parameters characterizing a fusion reactor (tokamak) : tritium breeding ration (TBR), multiplication factor, and nuclear heating {{as a function of the}} reactor main geometrical parameters (major radius, elongation…), of the radial built, Li enrichment, blanket and shield thickness, etc. (3) In order to obtain a reliable surrogate model, a consistent database is needed. Simplified 1 D and 2 D neutronic calculation carried out with APOLLO 2 (deterministic) and and TRIPOLI- 4 (Montecarlo) codes codes are therefore used to fill the database. The URANIE platform is used to build the surrogate model from neutronic results. The simplified 1 D and 2 D models are validated against more detailed 3 D Monte-Carlo model conducted with TRIPOLI- 4. This methodology is devoted to helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) blanket, but it could be applied to any breeder blanket concept provided that appropriate validation could be carried out...|$|R
