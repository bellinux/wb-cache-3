5|$|Around this time, the Achaean League sent an army {{under a new}} strategos—Aristomachos of Argos, who {{had been}} elected in May 228 BC—to meet Cleomenes in battle. The Achaean army of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,000 cavalry advanced on the 5,000-strong Spartan army at Pallantium. Aratus, who had accompanied Aristomachos, advised him to retreat because even 20,000 Achaeans were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> 5,000 Spartans. Aristomachos, listening to Aratus' advice, retreated with the Achaean army.|$|E
5|$|In the 1988–89 NBA season, Johnson's 22.5points, 12.8assists, and 7.9rebounds {{per game}} earned him his second MVP award, and the Lakers reached the 1989 NBA Finals, {{in which they}} again faced the Pistons. However, after Johnson went down with a {{hamstring}} injury in Game 2, the Lakers were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the Pistons, who swept them 4–0.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} that the demoralised and tired Greeks were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the Persians, and were {{completely}} routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece.|$|E
50|$|Trbojevic played <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the 2014 NRL {{season after}} {{suffering}} a broken leg and dislocated ankle in a New South Wales Cup match.|$|R
50|$|<b>No</b> {{placement}} <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> {{the places}} 9 to 12 are scheduled.|$|R

5|$|Japanese light tanks, {{which had}} good buoyancy, were towed across the straits to Lim Chu Kang Road where {{they joined the}} battle at dusk. With {{reinforced}} troops and tanks advancing down Choa Chua Kang Road, the Australian troops were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the tanks and fled to the hills of Bukit Panjang. The 5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) captured Bukit Timah village by the evening of 11 February.|$|E
5|$|The Persian strategy, on {{the other}} hand, was {{probably}} principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of Thermopylae and Plataea.) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.|$|E
5|$|The ZNDH's long {{obsolete}} Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 fighter aircraft also {{attempted to}} intercept the USAAF bomber formations, often stressing their old engines beyond the limit. They were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the escorting Mustang and Thunderbolt USAAF fighters and suffered heavy losses, {{both in the}} air and on the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} points {{result from the}} FIFA Women's World Rankings system being based on the Elo {{football}} rating system. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional {{and at the end}} of the list. Also any team that plays <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> 18 months becomes unranked.|$|R
50|$|Born in Avilés, Asturias, Iglesias {{spent most}} of his {{professional}} career in the second division, with two stints in La Liga: in the 2001-02 season he appeared in 16 games for CD Tenerife, which was relegated, and played second-fiddle to Albano Bizzarri in the following campaign, playing <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> Real Valladolid.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the severe}} winter weather - the {{so-called}} [...] "Big Freeze of 1963" [...] - Birmingham played <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> ten weeks, between 22 December and 2 March. Their opening third-round FA Cup-tie against Bury was postponed 14 times and abandoned once before finally being played {{two months after}} the originally scheduled date.|$|R
5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|Even then, Eberstein {{refused to}} ask Schack for {{assistance}} in the battle. Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt of the allied forces would not to let pride and vanity be {{the downfall of the}} attack and pleaded with Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted a forceful attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry was <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man. The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley was <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular}} vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the severe}} winter weather - the {{so-called}} [...] "Big Freeze of 1963" [...] - Birmingham played <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> ten weeks, between 22 December and 2 March. Their third-round FA Cup-tie was {{played in the}} first week of March, two months later than the usual date of the first weekend in January.|$|R
50|$|With <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> two weeks, Hughes {{took the}} {{opportunity}} to go a training camp in Dubai prior to the match against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. The Potters put in another abject display against Spurs, crashing to a third consecutive 4-0 defeat. All the goals came in the first half with Harry Kane scoring a hat-tick and Dele Alli completing the rout.|$|R

5|$|Before 1914, Southern Rhodesia's {{police force}} was the British South Africa Police (BSAP), first raised in 1889 and reconstituted {{into a more}} {{permanent}} form in 1896. This paramilitary, mounted infantry force was theoretically also the country's standing army. Organised along military lines, it served in the First and Second Matabele Wars of the 1890s, operated on Britain's side in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902 (alongside the specially-raised Rhodesia Regiment), and by 1914 comprised about 1,150 men (including officers). Reserves existed {{in the form of}} the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, an all-white amateur force with a paper strength of 2,000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings. Few doubted the Volunteers' enthusiasm, but they were not extensively trained or equipped; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish, most observers agreed they would be <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> professional soldiers in a conventional war. In any case, the Volunteers' enlistment contracts bound them for domestic service only.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its {{monopoly}} on the profitable and prosperous Baltic Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the Baltic Sea, controlled {{the entrance to the}} Baltic Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King {{have been}} killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has been ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E
50|$|At Delete WCPW Ray {{defeated}} {{his long}} time rival Matt Hardy in a <b>No</b> Disqualification <b>Match</b> {{with the help}} from Adam Pacitti. Ray was defeated by Drew Galloway in a <b>No</b> Disqualification <b>Match</b> <b>for</b> the WCPW Championship.|$|R

5|$|From there, the Flames {{went on to}} the Campbell Conference Finals, {{where they}} {{defeated}} the St. Louis Blues in another seven-game series. This time, Calgary had to survive a scare of its own, shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena. Trailing by a score of 5–2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Having vanquished this long-time bane, West {{entered his}} 13th NBA year. In the 1972–73 NBA season, the main scoring role {{was taken by}} Goodrich, and West was now a playmaker instead of a scorer. However, West {{averaged}} 22.8points, but also averaged 8.8assists per game, and again was a First Teamer in the All-Star, All-NBA, and All-Defense Teams. The Lakers won 60 games and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. In Game 1 West scored 24points before fouling out with three minutes left and L.A. won Game 1 with 115–112. However, the Knicks took Games 2 and 3, and West strained both of his hamstrings: in Game 4, the shorthanded Lakers were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> New York, and in Game 5, the valiant, but injured West and Hairston had miserable games, and despite Chamberlain scoring 23points and grabbing 21rebounds, the Lakers lost 102–93 and the series.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Australia in 1984 and after training in Brisbane, {{he was selected}} for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles despite winning neither backstroke event at the Australian Championships. Arriving in the United States, Kerry was scheduled {{to compete in the}} 100m backstroke and 4100m medley relay. Kerry swam quickly to win his heat in the 100m in a time of 57.15s, qualifying third fastest for the final. However, he was unable to improve his pace in the final, finishing fifth in a time of 57.18s, 0.69s from the bronze medal. In the medley relay, Kerry and Evans joined Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell, who swam the butterfly and freestyle respectively. They were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the Americans, who had three of the four gold medallists in the corresponding individual events and finished almost four seconds ahead. Kerry had Australia in third place at the first change, finishing his leg in a time of 57.12s, but by this point the Americans were already 1.71s ahead. Australia remained third at every change and were beaten by the second-placed Canadians by just 0.02s.|$|E
50|$|In June 2012, Amoah {{signed with}} Eredivisie side SC Heerenveen. However, after one {{season in which}} he played <b>no</b> single <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the club, he was {{released}} in June 2013.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{match on}} the card was Curt Hennig versus Ric Flair in a <b>no</b> disqualification <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Hennig won the match to retain the title.|$|R
6000|$|... "He need {{be under}} no violent apprehensions," [...] cried George, {{coloring}} highly with shame and pride, [...] "I am sure a Denbigh is <b>no</b> unworthy <b>match</b> <b>for</b> {{a daughter of}} Sir Peter Howell." ...|$|R
5|$|In contrast, Dhoni scored 148 in an ODI against Pakistan {{and kept}} his {{position}} as the ODI gloveman safe. Despite Dhoni’s heavy run-scoring in the ODIs, the selectors continued to persist with Karthik for the Tests {{in the face of}} his low scoring at both domestic and international level in the preceding 12 months. Karthik started the tour of Zimbabwe with 40 in a warm-up match against the Zimbabwe Board XI. The hosts, depleted due to political purges conducted by their government, were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> India and lost by an innings and ten wickets respectively. India scored heavily against their weakened opponents, amassing 554 and 366 in their completed innings, but Karthik failed on both occasions, twice making a single.|$|E
5|$|In {{search of}} fuel, highway patrol officer-turned-survivalist Max Rockatansky {{journeys}} to the Plains of Silence. His voyage takes an unexpected turn when he runs {{into a group}} of War Boys led by Scabrous Scrotus (Travis Willingham), psychotic son of Immortan Joe (Fred Tatasciore) and ruler of Gastown. Scrotus and the War Boys run Max {{off the road and}} steal his clothes, supplies, weapons and car, leaving him to die in the desert. Max chases them and challenges Scrotus to a duel on the Land Mover. Scrotus sicks his dog on Max but fails and is brutally kicked off the moving Land Mover by him. He stabs Scrotus in the head with his own chainsaw but is <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> Scrotus, who kicks Max and his dog out of the Land Mover.|$|E
5|$|Nor {{was this}} the only field in which the Royal Navy was lagging in the 1930s. In the 1920s, Colonel the Master of Sempill led the semi-official Sempill Mission to Japan to help the Imperial Japanese Navy {{establish}} an air arm. At the time the Royal Navy was the world leader in naval aviation. The Sempill mission taught advanced techniques such as carrier deck landing, conducted training with modern aircraft, and provided engines, ordnance and technical equipment. Within a decade, Japan had overtaken Britain. The Royal Navy pioneered the armoured flight deck, which enabled carriers to absorb damage, but resulted in {{limiting the number of}} aircraft that a carrier could operate. The Royal Navy had great faith in the ability of ships' antiaircraft batteries, and so saw little need for high performance fighters. To maximise the benefit of the small numbers of aircraft that could be carried, the Royal Navy developed multi-role aircraft such as the Blackburn Roc, Fairey Fulmar, Fairey Barracuda, Blackburn Skua and Fairey Swordfish. As a result, the Royal Navy's aircraft were <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> their Japanese counterparts.|$|E
50|$|After playing <b>no</b> league <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> RCD Espanyol in the 1996-97 campaign, Toril {{signed for}} CF Extremadura, {{featuring}} in 40 Segunda División games {{en route to}} a top flight promotion, followed by immediate relegation back.|$|R
50|$|Hamit Kaplan {{resigned}} {{after the}} 1964 Olympics, {{because he was}} <b>no</b> more <b>match</b> <b>for</b> his strong opponents like Hungarian István Kozma, Soviet Russians Aleksandr Ivanitsky and Aleksandr Medved. He was 175 times international for his country.|$|R
50|$|Ceylon won {{the first}} match. The match became a regular fixture in the {{calendar}} until Sri Lanka received Test status and the competition was stopped. It was revived in 2000 with a match between Tamil Nadu and a Colombo District Cricket Association. Two years later the fixture was dropped again but in 2007 the Sri Lankan and Tamil Nadu boards agreed to restart the competition. A match was played in September 2007 between Tamil Nadu and a Sri Lankan XI, won by the Sri Lankan team. <b>No</b> <b>matches</b> <b>for</b> the trophy have been played since.|$|R
