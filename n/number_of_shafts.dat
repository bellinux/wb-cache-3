60|$|Next morning, {{bright and}} early, Neale {{went down to}} the river to make his close {{inspection}} of what had been done toward building Number Ten. From Colohan he ascertained the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shafts</b> and coffer-dams sunk; from the masons he learned the amount of stone cut to patterns. And he was not only amazed and astounded, but overwhelmed, and incensed beyond expression. The labor had been prodigious.

40|$|Simple {{inspection}} and measurement technique makes possible to estimate wear of balls in ball bearing, without removing bearing from shaft on which installed. To perform measurement, one observes bearing cage while turning shaft by hand to obtain integral <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cage rotations and to measure, to nearest 2 degrees, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shaft</b> rotations producing cage rotations. Ratio between <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> cages and <b>shaft</b> rotations depends only on internal geometry of bearing and applied load. Changes in turns ratio reflect changes in internal geometry of bearing provided measurements made with similar bearing loads. By assuming all wear occurs on balls, one computes effective value for this wear from change in turns ratio...|$|R

50|$|The {{timing of}} the tests {{depended}} on the local weather conditions, with the wind being the critical factor. The tests were underground, but due to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shaft</b> seal failures that had occurred during tests conducted by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, the sealing <b>of</b> the <b>shaft</b> could not be guaranteed to be leak-proof. By early afternoon, the winds had died down and the test sequence was initiated. Dr. K. Santhanam of the DRDO, {{in charge of the}} test site preparations, gave the two keys that activated the test countdown to Dr. M. Vasudev, the range safety officer, who was responsible for verifying that all test indicators were normal. After checking the indicators, Vasudev handed one key each to a representative of BARC and the DRDO, who unlocked the countdown system together. At 3:45 pm the three devices were detonated.|$|R
5000|$|The PIGA {{was based}} on an {{accelerometer}} developed by Dr Fritz Mueller, then of the Kreiselgeraete Company, for the LEV-3 and experimental SG-66 guidance system of the Nazi era German V2 (EMW A4) ballistic missile and was known among the German rocket scientists as the MMIA [...] "Mueller Mechanical Integrating Accelerometer". This system used precision electrical contacts to actuate the torque motor and achieved an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 to 1 part per 10000 known in technical parlance as a scale error of 1000 to 100. This was equivalent to about 600m of accuracy over the V2 1500m/s speed and 320km flight. Since the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shaft</b> rotations represented speed, a cam switch was used to initiate missile control sequences such as engine throttle-down and shut-off.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the main}} part of Carrock Fell Mine is beneath Carrock Fell, there are some {{workings}} to the south of Grainsgill Beck at the base of Coomb Height. A trench runs northward down the slope to the beck, containing a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shafts</b> and levels. These surface workings follow the line of the Harding Vein, the most productive part of the mine. Carrock Fell Mine was the only British Tungsten mine outside Cornwall and was operated at various times between 1850 and 1982 when the price of Tungsten was sufficient. Although reserves of Wolframite and other tungsten ores are believed to remain, the Harding vein beneath Knott has long been worked out and the levels were used for dumping sludge from ore processing operations.|$|E
50|$|In 1860 Brisbane Forest Park was {{investigated}} for gold prospecting opportunities through the government funded Gold Exploration Expedition. The {{findings of the}} expedition was that, {{with one or two}} exceptions, there were no discoveries worthy of notice. Despite this, gold prospectors persisted and a number of small claims were established. It was 1894 before the first claim was recorded in Mount Coot-tha Forest and seemed to have been a tentative affair, not proceeding beyond the initial explorations. In 1933 it was cleaned out and retested. The remains of these attempts are still evident on the eastern bank of Ithaca Creek. Gold prospecting continued intermittently in Mount Coot-tha Forest until the early 1950s but no significant finds were recorded. Some remnants of these activities remain with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shafts,</b> open cuts and a trolley line dating from the early 1950s.|$|E

The area was named the Coalseam after the Gregory {{brothers}} discovered coal exposed within the sedimentary layers of {{the banks of the}} Irwin River in 1846. This marked the first discovery of coal in Western Australia, however, after a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shafts</b> were dug, only narrow seams of poor quality coal were found; thus the site was abandoned. The park is now a popular picnic place, where remnants of its mining history are still present as well as the many marine fossils embedded in the riverbank and the magnificent limestone cliffs from the Permian Ice Age, 250 million years ago - the oldest geological era.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} friction {{due to the}} shaft hysteresis or the shrink fitting release exerts a destabilizing effect on the overcritical rotor whirl, but may be counteracted by other external dissipative sources and/or by proper anisotropy of the support stiffness. The {{internal friction}} effect may be treated by either dry or viscous models, obtaining similar results in the hypothesis of small dissipation levels, provided that proper equivalence criteria are defined between the two approaches. The equivalence is here stated by imposing the same energy dissipation over a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shaft</b> revolutions. Approximate closed-form autonomous solutions for a symmetric rotor arrangement subject to Coulombian non-linear friction are derived by an averaging approach of the Krylov-Bogoliubov type, in order to ascertain the result similarity between the two dissipative assumptions. Summing up, the viscous equivalent linear assumption appears conservative in general and may be accepted for a straightforward analysis of the overall rotor dynamics in the whole speed range...|$|R

50|$|A map of 1833 showed Thanet Street and Clay Lane. The railway 'mania' of 1840s {{witnessed}} expansion northwards {{facilitated by}} the Clay Cross tunnel dug in 1837-38. Whilst tunnelling over a mile underground they discovered vast quantities of commercial grade coal. Clay Cross became a boom town. The 'Liverpool Party' of Stephenson engineers formed the Clay Cross Company in 1839 which they funded from their considerable resources. As well as sinking a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shafts</b> with colliery support, there were coke oven works, brickworks, limeworks, irons furnaces and foundry. The ductile pipe was developed into an internationally sold product, making Clay Cross renowned for its iron and coal industry worldwide. Although the company had been formed to mine coal and manufacture coke from the railway, the supplies from Durham were preferred, and the works turned to iron working and brick making. When Stephenson died in 1848 his son, Robert, took over, leaving the company in 1852 when it became formally known {{by the name of}} the Clay Cross Company. In 1871 the Jackson family acquired 100% of the stocks and shares. They continued as owners until 1974. For many years, the company was the town's major employer. In 1985 Biwater took it over. In December 2000 Biwater sold the site to French company, Saint-Gobain. Some months later, it was closed down with the loss of around 750 jobs. Demolition of the vast Biwater site began in late 2008, and new houses and shops are appearing in the town.|$|E
