5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> carry an {{armoured}} knight, it {{is held by}} some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase {{the power of a}} lance strike.

40|$|In {{this paper}} blind {{equalization}} algorithms based on digital watermarking are presented. Training sequence is sent {{along with the}} data {{in the form of}} watermark. Robust CDMA based watermarking algorithm is used to watermark the data. Watermark, which is spread over the data, does not consume extra bandwidth. So with the help of extracted watermark channel can be equalized just by using simple mean square algorithm. Two algorithms for equalization are proposed in this paper. In algorithm I the receiver does <b>not</b> <b>require</b> <b>to</b> know training sequence in advance. Using algorithm II, the sender does <b>not</b> <b>require</b> <b>to</b> send training sequence either, and data can still be equalized using simple LMS algorithm at low computational complexity...|$|R
