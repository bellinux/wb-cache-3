5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E

The song's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect, played during the song's introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics {{in response to the}} <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast.

500|$|Richard Wasson, {{professor}} of English, {{has said that}} The Green Child is [...] "defiant of classification", complicated by its division into [...] "three arbitrarily related sections". The {{first part of the}} novel adopts the style of a 19th-century Gothic fairy tale. The [...] "fluid, seemingly unbroken hand" [...] in which it is written has encouraged the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was produced in a single sitting, followed by a break before the second part was begun. Part two is written as a [...] "conventional political adventure", in which Olivero tells in flashback the story of his rise to power as the dictator of Roncador. The final part of the novel continues the narrative where the first left off, in the [...] "fantastical, subterranean world of the Green people". So different in style is the first part from what follows that some critics regard it as an entirely separate work, or [...] "the 'true' novel".|$|E
500|$|Entering the {{presidency}} in 1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed [...] "Reaganomics", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned on the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "Morning in America", winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire", and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to [...] "tear down this wall!". He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback, by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev, which culminated in the INF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency came during {{the decline of the}} Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reunified the following year, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Wrigley was an [...] "inveterate note-taker" [...] who {{compiled}} extensive documentation {{concerning the}} {{theory and practice of}} air power, on which he lectured among colleagues in the RAAF during the 1920s. The concepts that he propagated included air superiority, the need for an air force to be separate from the other branches of the armed services, control of the air as a means of carrying out offensive strikes, and the substitution of aerial forces for ground troops. While arguing for the independence of the air arm, Wrigley was quick to dispel any <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would simply [...] "arrive from God knows where, drop [...] bombs God knows where, and go off again God knows where"; rather it should act in concert with the army and navy in furtherance of government policy. He is thus credited with laying the foundations for the RAAF's modern air power doctrine, which would eventually be codified as the Air Power Manual in 1990. Wrigley's widow bequeathed twenty volumes of his writings, maps and photographs to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook after his death; they were edited and published by Air Commodore Brendan O'Loghlin and Wing Commander Alan Stephens in 1990 as The Decisive Factor: Air Power Doctrine by Air Vice-Marshal H.N. Wrigley. In 1996, Wrigley's former residence as commanding officer of RAAF Station Laverton prior to World WarII was christened Wrigley House in his honour. His name is also borne by Henry Wrigley Drive, approaching Darwin International Airport. In March 2010 the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, established the AVM H.N. Wrigley Prize for air power analysis, as part of the annual Chief of Air Force Essay Competition.|$|E
40|$|A brief {{review of}} the {{literature}} on retrograde amnesia in Korsakoff's syndrome is presented.

None of these hypotheses can satisfactorily account for the length and temporal gradient of alcoholic amnesics retrograde amnesia. Although some evidence points towards the hypothesis that anterograde and retrograde amnesia might result from separate and independent impairments, this view is presently unproven and leaves open what causes the form and duration of Korsakoffs retrograde amnesia...|$|R

The focus here is on one particular aspect of speech performance, namely the (dis) fluency of speech. I will present results from two eye-tracking experiments targeting the effect that disfluencies may have on the predictive mechanisms of the listener. I will demonstrate that disfluencies may lead listeners to predict a more complex referent (relative to fluent speech). However, when participants listened to a non-native speaker, no effect of disfluency could be established. These two experiments show that (i) listeners are sensitive to the fluency of speech, and (ii) listeners are flexible in modulating the use of disfluencies based on speaker knowledge...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} studies using methods of {{conversation}} analysis and discourse analysis have documented the systematic workings of laughter {{in a variety of}} interactions, from casual conversations to interviews,meetings, and therapy sessions.

These studies challenge several widely held assumptions about the nature of laughter. Contrary to <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is spontaneous and involuntary, research documents that laughter is sequentially-organized and precisely placed relative to surrounding talk. Far more than merely a response to humor, laughter often works to manage delicate and serious moments.
