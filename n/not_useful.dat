5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was <b>not</b> <b>useful</b> for homing on a target, so some system of direction indication was required.

5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer {{disconnected from the}} actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was <b>not</b> <b>useful</b> in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game {{would not be as}} entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.|$|E
5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once {{thought to have}} been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also <b>not</b> <b>useful</b> for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebees are {{important}} pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, {{they do not}} stockpile honey, and therefore are <b>not</b> <b>useful</b> as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed bumblebees, are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is <b>not</b> <b>useful.</b> The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E
5|$|For {{implementing}} associative arrays, hash tables, a {{data structure}} that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records; most implementations require only amortized constant time on average. However, hashing is <b>not</b> <b>useful</b> for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, {{as the only}} information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. In addition, all operations possible on a sorted array can be performed—such as finding the smallest and largest key and performing range searches.|$|E

5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is <b>not</b> <b>useful,</b> and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Outside of China, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} texts to mention gunpowder is Roger Bacon's Opus Majus (1267) and Opus Tertium in what has been interpreted as a reference to firecrackers. In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae, also known as Opus Minor, dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. These claims have been disputed by science historians. The formula itself, claimed to have been hidden within the text through encryption, is <b>not</b> <b>useful</b> for firearm or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.|$|E
