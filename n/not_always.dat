5|$|Actuaries do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{attempt to}} predict {{aggregate}} future events. Often, their work {{may relate to}} determining the cost of financial liabilities that have already occurred, called retrospective reinsurance, or the development or re-pricing of new products.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the restaurant locations are privately held by individual owners and its financial dependence on those owners, Burger King's relationship with its franchises has <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been harmonious. Occasional disagreements between the two have caused numerous issues, and in several instances the company's and its licensees' relations have degenerated into precedent-setting court cases.|$|E

5|$|Another {{manner in}} which the proofs might be {{undermined}} is if 1−0.999... simply does not exist, because subtraction is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> possible. Mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include commutative semigroups, commutative monoids and semirings.

5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{triggered by}} a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|Birds feature also in {{the mass}} media with iconic {{animated}} cartoon characters such as Walt Disney's Donald Duck, Warner Bros.'s Tweety Pie, and Walter Lantz's Woody Woodpecker.

5|$|Bolesław's expansionist {{policies}} were costly to the Polish state and were <b>not</b> <b>always</b> successful.
