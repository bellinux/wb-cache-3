30|$|In [7, 8], <b>null</b> <b>symbols</b> are {{transmitted}} {{at a constant}} interval for spectrum sensing. Though they are some overhead for systems, it is simple with respect to implementation. In [9], a prediction-error filter is employed to detect narrow-band interferences, and then, erasure insertion is performed over the detected superposed bands. Similarly, in [10], hidden Markov model-based filters and smoothers are employed for dynamic excision of narrow-band interferences from spread-spectrum systems. In [11], the interference power of each subcarrier is estimated based on previous decoded data in the same packet. In the scheme, {{it is necessary to}} insert more pilot signals for initial estimation of the interference power than those just required to estimate channel coefficients, which are large overhead for systems. To reduce this overhead, another scheme is proposed in [12], which applies EM (expectation maximization) algorithm for estimation of the interference power of each subcarrier. EM algorithm is a kind of the maximum likelihood estimation schemes that calculates local optimum parameters of a stochastic model based on given initial parameters. In addition, an approach using the EM algorithm is applied to address the frequency estimation problem in OFDM spectrum sharing systems [13] and to estimate channel coefficients [14]. Through simulations, it is shown that nearly the same BER performance as that in [11] is achieved with less amount of overhead, while computational complexity increases due to iterative Viterbi decoding in the loop of EM algorithm. In [15], estimation of an interference power and decoding of received signals are alternately performed. At the receiver side, at first, robust LLR is calculated for initial decoding. Exploiting LLR output from the decoder, soft-decision replica signals are generated to calculate residual powers. Comparing them with a threshold power, superposed bands and an interference power are estimated. Based on the estimated parameters, LLR calculation and decoding are performed again. Repeating the process, accuracy of the estimation increases. One drawback of the scheme is large computational complexity because of iterative decoding. In [16], EM algorithm is applied to reduce the computational complexity. At the receiver side, first, residual powers are calculated by exploiting hard-decision replica symbols. Based on the residual powers, an interference power and superposed rate are iteratively estimated in the EM algorithm. Superposed rate is defined as a ratio of the number of subcarriers on superposed bands to the number of those composing an OFDM symbol. This scheme can achieve the BER performance close to that in [15] with one decoding iteration.|$|R
30|$|In pilot-assisted transmissions, {{there exist}} various {{approaches}} {{to design the}} pilot pattern. We can distinguish between two broad categories: multiplexed training and superimposed training [24]. In the multiplexed training case, each element of the transmitted vector contains either a pilot symbol or a data symbol, while in the superimposed case both pilot and data symbols {{are located in the}} same positions, typically distributed over the whole transmitted vector. In this paper, we assume multiplexed training, which is also known as periodic training when the pilots are placed in the time domain, and as orthogonal training when the pilots are located in the frequency domain. In particular, we focus on the pilot placement schemes developed in [19, 20], which have been proved to be optimal in the MMSE sense under certain channel conditions. In these schemes, pilot symbols are interleaved with the data symbols to form the transmitted signal vector. For OFDM systems, we employ the frequency-domain Kronecker delta (FDKD) pilot structure [20], while, its dual scheme [19], identified as time-domain Kronecker delta (TDKD), is adopted for SC systems. In both cases, the pilot symbols are grouped into equidistant clusters, each having the same length. Within each cluster, a unique nonzero pilot symbol is located {{in the middle of the}} cluster, while <b>null</b> pilot <b>symbols</b> are placed on both sides. Therefore, the FDKD scheme coincides with equispaced pilot tones with guard frequency bands, while the TDKD scheme uses periodic training with guard time intervals.|$|R

Symbol timing is determined first by detecting an abrupt {{change in the}} phase angle of the complex product between {{the last quarter of}} a useful symbol and its cyclic extension in the guard interval. The detection of this abrupt change is based on the maximal likelihood (ML) principle. Frequency offset of fractional carrier spacing is estimated from the phase angle of the autocorrelation after symbol timing is estimated. Coarse frame synchronization and <b>null</b> <b>symbol</b> detection can also be achieved through this correlation information. Frequency offset of integral carrier spacing is determined from the convolution outputs between a received phase reference symbol and several locally generated but frequency-shifted phase reference symbols.
