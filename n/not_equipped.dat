5|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1941, Voroshilov was <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with any radars, but she {{received}} a number of British Lend-Lease radars by 1944. One Type 284 and two Type 285 radars were used for main battery fire control. One Type 291 was used for air search, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two Type 282 radars.|$|E

5|$|A {{glass screen}} {{separated}} {{the first class}} platform and circulating area from the platform and circulating area for third class passengers. The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, much shorter than the first class platform.|$|E

In case of technical problems, {{there is always a}} team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|MF Innherredsferja was the company's first vessel. She was a single-direction vessel {{built at}} Moen & Sønns Båtbyggeri in Risør. She arrived at Levanger on 31 December 1957 and cost NOK510,000, and was <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with radar. She was {{initially}} {{used for the}} cross-fjord route; from 1962 she {{was used as a}} reserve until put into service on the Skarnsund route in 1964. The ferry was sold for NOK50,000 in 1968 to Agder, and later became a restaurant at Aker Brygge in Oslo.|$|E

5|$|On 16 December 1982, B-52G 57-6482, {{assigned}} to 328th BS, 93rd BW, Castle AFB, California, was {{participating in a}} Minimum Interval Take-Off (MITO; 12 seconds between each aircraft on takeoff) from Mather AFB, CA. The incident aircraft was in the number two position of a three-ship group. The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional thrust for take-off, but the lead aircraft was <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the throttles rapidly, causing flameout of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed. Nine crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|Service on the Lake Shore Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach seating and Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a dining car service. As the Erie station is <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with a ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, equipped with a waiting room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown circulator, provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound Lake Shore Limited.|$|E

5|$|Though these {{theories}} of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with the neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings {{of learning in}} animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, {{at about the same}} time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.|$|E
5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore <b>not</b> <b>equipped,</b> nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E
5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is <b>not</b> <b>equipped,</b> Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{threatening}} features of the new North Vietnamese build-up was the air defence network that was established within South Vietnam, which by 1975 consisted of twenty-two regiments equipped with radar-controlled gun systems and formidable SA-2 Guideline and shoulder-launched SA-7 Grail anti-aircraft missiles. Such systems posed a major deterrent to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, since its aircraft were <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> {{to deal with such}} threats. As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical build-up became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum. This lack of active intelligence collection made estimation of North Vietnamese strength and intentions much more difficult.|$|E

50|$|A common {{feature of}} clerics across many games {{is that they}} may <b>not</b> <b>equip</b> pointed weapons such as swords or daggers, and must use blunt weapons such as maces, war-hammers, shields or wand instead. This {{is based on a}} popular, but erroneous, {{interpretation}} of the depiction of Odo of Bayeux and accompanying text. They are also often limited in what types of armor they can wear, though usually not as restricted as mages.|$|R
5|$|The Athenians now {{ended their}} {{alliance}} with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved {{to be anything but}} the easy prey that Aristagoras had described. However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians did not seem to follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.|$|E
5|$|The Ghetto also {{contains}} several high-density living areas, including the Garden Apartments, the Lawnview Apartments and the Campus South, a high-rise living complex for sophomores. In 2004, the ArtStreet complex opened, {{intended as a}} combined living-learning space. It includes housing for 56 students, {{as well as a}} cafe, an amphitheater, rehearsal rooms, several activity rooms and gallery spaces, and a new studio for the campus radio station, WUDR. The Ghetto is also home to the McGinnis school house, which was acquired in 1982 and renamed the McGinnis Center; it is used as a central point of contact for Ghetto residents. The McGinnis Center houses several meeting rooms, administrative offices and laundry facilities for houses that are <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with washers and dryers.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was <b>not</b> <b>equipped</b> with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E
