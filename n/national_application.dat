It is governed by one of two sets of regulations. For working age claimants it is governed by the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006, {{but for those who}} have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit, these are amended by The LHA and Information Sharing Regulations. The legislation to enable Local Housing Allowance was introduced under the Welfare Reform Act which received Royal Assent in May 2007.

50|$|The {{extent of}} UAS degree studies is {{generally}} 210−240 study points (ECTS), which means 3.5 - 4 years of full-time study. This education is arranged as degree programmes. The entry requirement is a certificate from an {{upper secondary school}} or the matriculation certificate, a vocational qualification or corresponding foreign studies. The requirement for Master's studies in UASs is a Bachelors' level UAS degree and {{at least three years}} of work experience. The UAS Master's, which is 60-90 study points and takes 1.5-2 years, is equivalent to a university Master's in the labour market. Each student has a personal study plan, which facilitates student guidance and the monitoring of progress in studies. Students apply for UAS studies in a <b>national</b> <b>application</b> system. The UASs determine the admission criteria and arrange student selection and entrance examination at their discretion. Nearly 90% of applications are submitted electronically. UASs also arrange adult education and open education geared to maintain and upgrade competencies. Some 20 percent of UAS students are mature students.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of maximum}} {{harmonization}} directives in EU private law {{in combination with}} open legal concepts is controversial. Due to differing legal cultures, {{it is likely that}} open legal concepts will be interpreted differently in the Member States. This seems to conflict with the aim of maximum harmonization as put forward by the European Commission: reducing legal fragmentation and increasing legal certainty among consumers and businesses. Although supporting the notion that national interpretations of open legal concepts are likely to differ, this article posits that this is not incompatible with the aim of maximum harmonization. It proposes a different understanding of the concept of maximum harmonization that allows for different <b>national</b> <b>applications</b> of the rules. This understanding is based on the distinction between harmonizing a legal framework (the written rules) and harmonizing the application of this legal framework. By acknowledging the importance of fully harmonizing the written rules without harmonizing the <b>national</b> <b>applications</b> of these rules, it demonstrates that maximum harmonization does not necessarily conflict with the use of open legal concepts...|$|R
