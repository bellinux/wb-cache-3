2500|$|Of the Zambaco affair, {{which would}} sputter {{on for some}} years, Georgiana wrote to her dear friend Rosalind Howard [...] "Dearest Rosalind, be hard on <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> matter, and exalt no one, and may we all come through it at last. I know one thing, {{and that is that}} there is enough love between Edward and me to last out a long life if it is given us".|$|E
2500|$|Associate Justice Pierce Butler filed a dissenting opinion, {{joined by}} Associate Justice James McReynolds, {{in which he}} argued the {{majority}} had engaged in judicial activism. He asserted the majority had completely rewritten the two questions presented in the petition for certiorari as a constitutional question, when there really was no constitutional issue. [...] He pointed out that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case had directly challenged the Swift regime, which the Court had adhered to for so long in so many cases.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were rumors}} {{leading up to}} the 2007 NFL Draft that the Raiders were eager to part ways with Randy Moss through a trade. First-year Raiders head coach Lane Kiffin {{went so far as to}} contact their {{division}} rival Denver Broncos to [...] "gauge interest", but the Patriots and Green Bay Packers were the two teams most interested in acquiring Moss. Packers QB Brett Favre, who once said, [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> league who puts fear in people more than Randy Moss," [...] tried to persuade team management to trade for him, but a deal that both sides could agree to did not get done.|$|E

2500|$|A {{few days}} later, Nixon's Press Secretary, Ron Ziegler, {{described}} the event as “a third-rate burglary attempt.” On August 29, {{at a news}} conference, Nixon stated Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the matter, when in fact Dean had not conducted any investigation at all. Nixon also said, “I can say categorically that ... {{no one in the}} White House staff, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident.” On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, “The way you've handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Greg Graffin's closing song [...] "One More Hill" [...] on his album Cold as the Clay {{opens with}} the line [...] "Rich man, poor man, beggar or thief, <b>no</b> matter which <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> life you lead".|$|R

25|$|During much of {{the seventeenth}} century, nearby Castine was the most {{southern}} settlement of Acadia. (Bristol, Maine, was the most northern New England settlement.) <b>No</b> <b>one</b> settled <b>in</b> <b>this</b> contested territory, {{and for the next}} 150years Mount Desert Island's importance was primarily its use as a landmark for seamen, as for example when John Winthrop, first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, sketched the island's mountains on his voyage to the New World.|$|R
50|$|Labina Mitevska {{stars as}} Senada, {{a young mother}} whose only {{daughter}} Aida was removed from Bosnia-Herzegovina during the worst years {{of the war and}} presumably adopted into a Western European family. Searching for her after the war, Senada enters illegally into Germany, where she discovers through a social worker the harsh truth of postwar adoption: Aida is alive and well and living happily with a German family. Dark secrets emerge, leaving <b>no</b> <b>one</b> unscathed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> expertly crafted, superbly performed drama.|$|R

60|$|It {{was very}} plain that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> house entertained {{the idea that}} it would be a good thing for me to rest here quietly until my bicycle could be sent away and repaired.

6000|$|... " [...] 'T was a tornado," [...] {{interrupted}} Mulford eagerly, [...] "but 't is over. 'T was one {{of those}} sudden and tremendous gusts that sometimes occur within the tropics, in which the danger is usually in the first shock.

"Well," [...] said Waldershare, [...] "all the same, I fear King Florestan {{will adopt}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> room, {{though he has}} several friends here, and I am one; and I believe that he will marry, and I cannot help fancying that the partner of this throne {{will not be as}} {{insignificant}} as Louis the Fourteenth's wife, or Catherine of Braganza." ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{another word}} or two of thanks the boys said good-bye to her, and Miss Sinclair at once went on her way with a final warning, [...] "Be sure and be leisurely in your movements.

60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> ever dies <b>in</b> <b>this</b> Valley, and {{the people}} are always young and beautiful. There is the King and a Queen, besides several princes and princesses.

60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> was deceived <b>in</b> <b>this</b> matter. The {{danger and}} {{the mode of}} {{operating}} were explained clearly, and then Captain Truck asked for volunteers.

In order that the whole procedure may be understood, however, it shall be explained more fully.|$|R
60|$|To {{this she}} replied, irrelevantly, {{that she thought}} they had better go back; but as Raymond took no notice of the {{recommendation}} she mentioned that the secretary was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> particular. At <b>this</b> moment Effie, looking very rosy and happy, pushed through the portière {{with the news that}} her sister must come and bid good-bye to the Marquise. She was taking her to the Duchess's--didn't Dora remember? To the bal blanc--the sauterie de jeunes filles.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood up}} {{trembling}} {{and was going}} to turn away from the valley, when he saw two dark and half-hidden forms standing as if in the air just beyond the rock, and one of them that had the sorrowful eyes of a beggar said to him in a woman's voice, 'Speak to me, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world or any other world has spoken to me for seven hundred years.' ...|$|E

40|$|Much of {{psychology}} focuses on universal principles {{of thought and}} action. Although an extremely productive pur-suit, this approach, by describing only the “average per-son, ” risks describing <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> particular. <b>This</b> article discusses an alternate approach that complements interests in universal principles with analyses of the unique psycho-logical meaning that individuals find in their experiences and interactions. Rooted in research on social cognition, this approach examines how people’s lay theories about the stability or malleability of human attributes alter the meaning they give to basic psychological processes such as self-regulation and social perception. Following a review of research on this lay theories perspective {{in the field of}} social psychology, the implications of analyzing psycho-logical meaning for other fields such as developmental, cultural, and personality psychology are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Police {{say that}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was injured <b>in</b> <b>this</b> action, but MTI (the {{official}} Hungarian News Agency) reported [...] "men with bloody heads". The peaceful demonstration ended for a while, with smaller (mainly verbal) incidents between police and protesters noted. The indignant crowd was {{not willing to}} end protesting; many of them wanted to go back when the security check was finished, but the police started to crowd them out. When this news spread, the crowd began to multiply.|$|R
