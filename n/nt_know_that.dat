In 1910 the Queensland {{government}} {{adopted a}} significant {{plan to build}} a railway on the Queensland section of the alignment proposed from Bourke in western NSW, to Darwin in the <b>NT,</b> <b>known</b> as the ‘Great Western Railway’. To connect to that alignment, construction began in 1911 from Westgate (21 km south of Charleville) in a westerly direction. The First World War hampered construction, which ceased in April 1917, making Quilpie the effective terminus. Despite suggestions after the war that construction be recommended, the GWR project was never re-activated. Quilpie (population 560) became the loading point for significant numbers of cattle from western areas. The line is still known as the Great Western line by QR.|$|R

The DNA sequence of the gene for this suppressor tRNA from Escherichia coli predicts unusual features of the gene product (4). We determined the sequence of this serine tRNA (tRNA(UCASer]. It is the longest tRNA (95 <b>nt)</b> <b>known</b> to date with an acceptor stem of 8 base pairs and lacks some of the 'invariant' nucleotides found in other tRNAs. It is the first E. coli tRNA that contains the hypermodified nucleotide i 6 A, adjacent to the UGA-recognizing anticodon UCA. The implications of the unusual structure and modification of this tRNA on recognition by seryl-tRNA synthetase, by tRNA modifying enzymes, and on codon recognition are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMy {{communication}} {{leans on}} the chapter 5 of « Of paediatrics in the psychoanalysis », difficult text of Winnicott which is called: « Mind and its reports with cheval glass-soma ». This article was {{read in the}} medical section of the British Society of Psychology on December 14 th, 1949 and seen again there I shall enunciate first the essential points which contains this text, then I shall try to articulate them with freudian concepts and lacaniens, from psychoanalytic point of view, and with a cognitive concept post-piagétien from psychological point of view. Winnicott leaves Jones's purpose which, leaning on hypothesis that the irreducible psychical elements have forcing a (neurological) somatic equivalent, thinks that mind indeed does not exist as entity. Winnicott opposes to it, noticing from his part, in the grown-up clinical psychopathologie, that mind works so much décrit by the patients as a located entity. If cheval glass-soma, hear the newborn baby, develop "normally ", mind, for him, do not exist as entity; {{it is only when}} développementales tendencies are "abnormal « that mind can institute as a wrong entity and a wrong location. Mind has, Winnicott compares the psyche an imaginary elaboration of parties, feelings or of somatic functions of which he makes. This last, the psyche, subject would not know how to locate it, not even in the cerebrum. The correlation of the psyche and the soma constitutes the primitive stage of individual development. Finally, later, the body living with its borders differentiating inside outside, will be felt by subject as core of its imaginary Self. Here is therefore some preprefatory considerations advice from Winnicott is going to build its « theory of mind ». It is going to lean for it on patients' grown-up private hospital having regressed under transfer up to a very primitive stadium until <b>nt.</b> We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> for Winnicott, mental health rests on the feeling of a continuity of existence. Condition so that this feeling becomes established, is recovering, he says to us in this text, of what he names « a perfect environment », that is an environment which fits actively to needs A not perfect environment empiètera on the infant then forced to react to the detriment of its continuity of existence. This perfect environment will be assured by the good ordinary, capable mother to fit actively to the needs of his infant and whose this aptitude rests on the devotion which it dedicates him. Besides, this adaptation will be made easier by its own narcissism, its imagination and its memories, who, via identificatoires processes, will allow him the access to a knowledge on the needs of the infant. Here are therefore purposes which we can articulate to the defined mother as baby other one serving, at this logical time of subjective building, big Other one...|$|R
40|$|Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{endogenous}} small non-coding RNAs {{of about}} 20 – 24 <b>nt,</b> <b>known</b> to play key roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, {{that can be}} coded either by intergenic or intragenic loci. Intragenic (exonic and intronic) miRNAs can exert {{a role in the}} transcriptional regulation and RNA processing of their host gene. Moreover, the possibility that the biogenesis of exonic miRNAs could destabilize the corresponding protein-coding transcript and reduce protein synthesis makes their characterization very intriguing and suggests a possible novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This work was designed to carry out the computational identification of putative exonic miRNAs in 30 plant species and the analysis of possible mechanisms involved in their regulation. The results obtained represent a useful starting point for future studies on the complex networks involved in microRNA-mediated gene regulation in plants. </p...|$|R
