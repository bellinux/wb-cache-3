Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this article}} I have {{attempted}} to highlight both the distinctive features of the concepts of corporate governance, internal control and the interferences that characterize them, {{taking into account the}} fact that we can <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> specific line that can separate practically the processes these concepts involve, processes conducted at the economic entity level, by default processes involving long-term value creation. Furthermore, this article is to highlight the causal connection between the success of internal control and corporate governance at the entity level, precisely because good corporate governance can not be provided based on an internal control system working with serious deficiencies, resulting from this the imperative need for establishing permanent regulatory frameworks to enable a real and procedural functioning of the internal control system...|$|R

5000|$|An ad {{campaign}} by the Louisiana Democratic Party launched in late August, 2007 which attacked Bobby Jindal {{on the basis}} of supposed inflammatory remarks made about Protestantism. The ad was solely aired in the largely Protestant central and northern districts of the state. The ad drew attention to essays Jindal had written over a decade previously discussing his Catholic faith and conversion. One such essay titled [...] "How Catholicism Is Different - The Catholic Church Isn't Just Another Denomination" [...] was published in 1996 in the New Oxford Review. [...] Jindal said about the ad, [...] "They're absolute lies. We're <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> exaggeration".

500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson doubted {{it would turn}} out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|R
40|$|When {{equality}} {{between the}} sexes is discussed, stereotypical ideas and double standards are often <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about.</b> <b>A</b> lot of qualities are seen to be natural {{to men and women}} and thus {{do not need to be}} addressed. In this thesis it will be shown that typically masculine or feminine qualities have different origins than is commonly believed. ‘Natural’ female or male behavior is mostly seen to derive from hunter-gatherers who have influenced us in our actions. We are still fitted with a hunter-gatherer brain and therefore women can’t park cars and men can’t multi-task. This traditional idea has fundamental flaws and has a lack of theoretical foundation. It should be dealt with if we ever want more equality between men and women. If we continue to teach women that they should be caring, thoughtful, nice and generous, we are holding them back and are locking them in a certain stereotype. The same applies to men and the masculine qualities it is believed they should possess...|$|R

40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} is {{an important}} influence factor on the autonomy of local government. To the extent in which a local government benefits from amounts and transfers from the central government, it depends on it and has a reduced capacity {{to make decisions about}} the services they provide to citizens, local autonomy being limited. Even if the legal framework for decentralization was created in Romania, we still can <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> high degree of financial autonomy of local governments. Further, significant amounts from the state budget are transferred to local budgets to cover local expenses. Moreover, despite consistent efforts to implement the decentralization process, there is a series of imbalances, especially in smaller territorial administrative units that are clearly disadvantaged both in terms of financial capacity to finance themselves through local taxes and duties, and especially in terms of the low absorption capacity of European funds. In general, in Romania, the degree of financial autonomy differs nationally from the city level and from the village level...|$|R

50|$|Coleridge's {{challenge}} was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity {{not because they are}} like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which {{lie at the heart of}} life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and Emergent evolution that results in increasing complexity and individuation. This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.|$|R
