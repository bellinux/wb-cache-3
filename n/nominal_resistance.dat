5000|$|In the {{following}} years he {{was still on the}} same service, and in September 1639 was lying in the Downs with a strong squadron, when the Spanish fleet for Dunkirk, with a large body of troops on board, was driven in by the Dutch fleet under the command of Tromp, which also came in and anchored in the Downs. Penington insisted that the two enemies should respect the neutrality of the roadstead; but he had a very insufficient force, and the orders he received from the king were confused and contradictory. Oquendo, the Spanish admiral, and Tromp had both, in fact, appealed to King Charles, who, hardly pressed for money by reason of the Scottish war, hoped to make some advantage out of one or the other, but was unable to decide which would pay the better; and before he could make up his mind, Tromp, probably on a hint from Richelieu, took the matter into his own hands, and on 11 October, having been joined by large reinforcements from Holland, attacked the Spanish fleet, drove many of their ships on shore, pursued those that fled, and captured or sank the greater part. Penington, meantime, was powerless; he had no instructions to take part with either, and was disinclined to risk the total loss of his fleet by defending the Spaniards. It may, indeed, be doubted if his fleet would have obeyed him had he attempted to do so, for the popular opinion was that the Spanish fleet was there on the invitation of Charles, and that the troops it carried were to be landed to help in crushing English liberties. For the deliverance from this fancied danger the nation was grateful to the Dutch; but that Penington had had no hand in it, and had appeared rather as a supporter of the Spaniards, was probably remembered against him when, in July 1642, the parliament, after vainly protesting against the king's appointment of Penington as Lord High Admiral, ordered the Earl of Warwick to take command of the fleet and not to allow Penington on board.

Using a single half-height mixer block, we have developed three different mixer chip configurations, offering <b>nominal</b> embedding <b>resistances</b> of 70, 35, and 15 Ohms. Both the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software and scaled model impedance measurements were employed in the design process.

The mixers were characterized through receiver noise temperature measurements and Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) scans. Briefly, a minimum receiver noise temperature of 440 K was measured at a local oscillator frequency 850 GHz for a mixer of normal state resistance 62 Ohms incorporated into a circuit offering a nominal embedding impedance of 70 Ohms.

30|$|Piezoresistor {{geometry}} {{is chosen}} {{based on the}} desired <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> value and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Lower limit of <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> is determined by joule heating-induced self-heating effects and electro-migration, whereas its upper limit is determined by specifications of driving current and interface circuitry. Thus, typically the value of <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> of piezoresistors is kept in kΩ range. In general, the piezoresistors {{are designed to be}} U-shaped to improve reliability by avoiding interconnects on the cantilever platform. Since the electrical resistivity of metals is low (in the range of µ Ω-cm), when metal piezoresistors are designed in U shape, their <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> is only a few ohms, which results in large joule heating. Thus, strategically the metal piezoresistors are designed lengthier to obtain large <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance.</b> Therefore, in few cases, rather than the conventional U-shaped design, the piezoresistors are meander-shaped. However, the coverage of the piezoresistor is limited by the cantilever lateral dimensions, since lengthier cantilever platforms result in reduced mechanical stability and electrical sensitivity. On the other hand, by tailoring the electrical resistivity of the piezoresistor material and careful design, it is possible to realize U-shaped metal piezoresistors. Similarly, the width and thickness of the piezoresistor are designed to obtain a desirable <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance.</b> Thickness of metal piezoresistors has an additional constraint on noise figure, since thinner metal piezoresistors show higher electrical noise level. The need for high <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> value to reduce the current density and therefore the joule heating effects is achieved by using lower supply voltages. In the case of doped polysilicon or doped SU- 8 piezoresistors, the electrical resistivity is controlled by varying the dopant concentration. Thus, by optimizing the dopant concentration and geometry of the piezoresistor, desired <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> is achieved. Typical magnitude of surface stress sensitivity and deflection sensitivity of SU- 8 piezoresistive cantilever sensors are in the range of a few ×  10 − 3 (N/m)− 1 and a few ×  10 − 6 to ×  10 − 9 (nm)− 1 which can detect miniscule forces of pN magnitude and lower.|$|E

These characteristics govern {{the performance of}} the sensor node. In this application, low power consumption, high signal to noise ratio (SNR), sensitivity and resolution in the sensor node are optimized for a distributed sensor network. In this low frequency application at < 100 Hz, it is found that electrical noise can limit the <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> of the strain gauge to be used. By reducing the <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> to lower the SNR, power consumption is increased. Optimization of the <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> for excess noise and other material parameters must take place. Typical values have been used to explore the SNR over a range of resistance values and against frequency. The trade-off is also optimized in the volume and sheet resistance of the piezo-resistive material. Irreversible phenomena such as ageing and material creep are responsible for very low frequency drift (approaching DC) with respect to time and temperature. It is found that this drift is material specific and can be numerically compensated in situ. Maximizing sensitivity of the transducer is desirable to reduce the overhead at the sensor front-end. This overhead is shown to be dependant on gauge factor and the configuration of the strain-sensing circuit. The configuration of the strain-sensing circuit impacts on cost, complexity and SNR.

30|$|Even though metal piezoresistor-based SU- 8 {{cantilevers}} {{are used}} as an alternative for solid-state semiconductor-based design, they suffer from a few limitations. It is preferred to design cantilevers with high value of <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> of the piezoresistor primarily to reduce the magnitude of current and therefore the resulting Joule heating. However, it may be noted that due to very low resistivity of metals, the maximum value of <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> of metal piezoresistors cannot be increased beyond a certain limit. Thus, when biased with a dc source compared to other piezoresistive materials, metal piezoresistors carry large volumetric current that results in significant Joule heating. The Joule heating of the metal piezoresistor combined with lower thermal conductivity of SU- 8 polymer matrix results {{not only in the}} difference in TCE-induced cantilever deflection, but also in an increase in Johnson noise floor and plastic deformation of the cantilever. Increasing the piezoresistor length is an option to increase the <b>nominal</b> <b>resistance</b> value. However, this adversely affects the electrical sensitivity of the device as a major portion of the resistor may be placed on the unstressed region of the cantilever. Other option is to design serpentine-shaped metal piezoresistors and biasing it with low dc voltage. Apart from the aforementioned factors, electro-migration is also closely related to the high magnitude of current density and, more importantly, the miniaturized size of the piezoresistor leading to instability in its resistance value [87]. Adhesion issue of metal with polymer is another issue that can lead to device failure. Designs such as the sensor reported in Ref.

[Full text {{of this article}} is not available in the UHRA]In this paper the modelling, analysis and compensation of current conveyor tracking non-idealities in signal-processing circuits employing the second-generation current conveyor (CCII) as a transconductance amplifier are generally investigated. The voltage- and current-following inaccuracies of the CCII are represented in the forms of absolute and relative errors. Analysis shows that the effects of absolute tracking errors in a non-ideal CCII-based transconductance amplifier can be represented by an ideal CCII transconductance amplifier with an external voltage or current offset source. With this model the circuit output signal shift due to tracking errors can be easily evaluated using any excitation-response circuit analysis method. For the relative error description the effects of CCII following inaccuracies are modelled as a change in the transconductance resistance for the CCII transconductance amplifier. The affected circuit parameters are therefore readily assessed by directly replacing the <b>nominal</b> transconductance <b>resistance</b> in the ideal expressions by the varied counterpart, and the impact of relative errors can thus be precisely compensated by simply adding a proper resistance in parallel or series with the transconductance resistance.

Device resistance stability R- 0 (T) was equal to 0. 27 - 0. 66 % K- 1 in zero field with a <b>nominal</b> device <b>resistance</b> R- 0 = 197 - 224 Omega for DC currents in the range I = 0. 01 - 1. 0 mA. The minimum detectable magnetic field is estimated from the reduced differential MR (partial derivativeR/partial derivativeB) /R = 2000 % T- 1 at B = 31 mT and normalised 1 /f current noise power spectral density measured at the same field. The resolution limit B-min = 2. 6 nT at 10 (2) Hz and B-min = 0. 82 nT at 10 (3) Hz. These resolution limits are seven times better than those recently reported for the same material n-InSb/i-GaAs and ferrite fabricated Hall sensors [Magnetotransport and Raman characterization of n-InSb/i-GaAs epilayers, for Hall sensors applications over extremely wide ranges of temperature and magnetic field, Proceedings NGS 10, IPAP Conference Series 2, IPAP, Tokyo, 2001, pp. 151 - 154].
