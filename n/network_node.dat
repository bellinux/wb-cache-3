25|$|The term throughput, {{essentially}} {{the same thing as}} digital bandwidth consumption, denotes the achieved average useful bit rate in a computer network over a logical or physical communication link or through a <b>network</b> <b>node,</b> typically measured at a reference point above the datalink layer. This implies that the throughput often excludes data link layer protocol overhead. The throughput is affected by the traffic load from the data source in question, as well as from other sources sharing the same network resources. See also measuring network throughput.|$|E

25|$|Zürich {{is a mixed}} hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Zürich Hauptbahnhof (Zürich HB) is {{the largest}} and busiest station in Switzerland and is an {{important}} railway hub in Europe. There are between 350,000 and 500,000 commuters daily making use of this central <b>network</b> <b>node</b> – a significant figure in comparison to Zürich's population. With regard {{to the number of}} trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Zürich HB is the world's most frequently served railway station, with 2915 trains every day. Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional train stops) within Zürich's city borders, there are five other major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the ten most frequented railway stations in Switzerland: Stadelhofen, Oerlikon, Altstetten, Hardbrücke, and Enge. The railway network is mainly operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBBCFFFFS), but Zürich is also served by major EuroCity trains from the neighbouring countries and is a destination for both French/Swiss (TGV Lyria) and German (ICE) high-speed trains, as well as by Austrian RailJet.|$|E

50|$|In data communication, a {{physical}} <b>network</b> <b>node</b> may either be data communication equipment (DCE) {{such as a}} modem, hub, bridge or switch; or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as a digital telephone handset, a printer or a host computer. If the network in question is a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), every LAN or WAN node (that are at least data link layer devices) must have a network address, typically one for each network interface controller it possesses. Examples are computers, packet switches, xDSL modems (with Ethernet interface) and wireless LAN access points. Note that a hub constitutes {{a physical}} <b>network</b> <b>node,</b> but does not constitute a LAN <b>network</b> <b>node,</b> since a hubbed network logically is a bus network. Analogously, a repeater or PSTN modem (with serial interface) is a physical <b>network</b> <b>node</b> but not a LAN node in this sense.|$|E

40|$|Under {{the hybrid}} {{background}} of both real-time and non-real-time traffics, this research studied the adaptive listening/sleeping mechanism of dynamic access of wireless sensor <b>network</b> <b>nodes.</b> The <b>network</b> <b>nodes</b> delivering non-real-time traffic, could switch status among transmitting state, listening state and sleeping state. On one hand, the energy consumption of <b>network</b> <b>nodes</b> {{is very low}} during sleeping state which could reduce the average energy consumption of <b>network</b> <b>nodes</b> effectively; on the other hand, overlong sleeping time might cause transmission opportunity missing. Therefore, according to the traffic condition of channels, setting reasonable sleeping overtime of Wireless Sensor <b>Network</b> (WSN) <b>nodes</b> could balance the tradeoff between energy consumption and transmission efficiency, so as to maximize WSN energy transmission efficiency. In this study, the problem is modeled by continuous-time Markov theory. Then, the system model is analyzed based on perturbation analysis technique. To find the optimal sleeping time that maximizes the energy efficiency, a gradient algorithm is presented. Last, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by the comparison of theoretical result and computer simulation...|$|R
