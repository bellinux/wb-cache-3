5|$|Gould made {{significant}} contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, especially in his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: <b>neoteny</b> and terminal additions. <b>Neoteny</b> is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E
5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral <b>neoteny.</b> The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E
5|$|While most {{types of}} temnospondyls are {{distinguished}} {{on the basis}} of features in mature specimens, several are known from juvenile and larval specimens. Metamorphosis is seen in dissorophoids, eryopids, and zatrachydids, with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land. Several types of dissorophoids do not fully metamorphose, but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as <b>neoteny.</b> Dvinosaurians and the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax were also neotenic because they retained gills, but they are only known from adult specimens.|$|E
25|$|In other species, {{environmental}} conditions cause <b>neoteny,</b> {{as in the}} northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile), where higher altitude is correlated with greater neotenic tendencies, perhaps to help conserve energy as mentioned above. Similarly, <b>neoteny</b> is found in a few species of the crustacean family Ischnomesidae, which live in deep ocean waters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neoteny</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other species. It {{is important to note}} the difference between partial and full <b>neoteny</b> when looking at other species in order to distinguish between juvenile traits that are only advantageous in the short term and traits that provide a benefit throughout the organism’s life; this might then provide some insight into the cause of <b>neoteny</b> in those species. Partial <b>neoteny</b> is the retention of the larval form beyond the usual age of maturation with the possibility of the development of sexual organs progenesis, but eventually the organism still matures into the adult form; this can be seen in Lithobates clamitans. Full <b>neoteny</b> is seen in Ambystoma mexicanum and some populations of Ambystoma tigrinum, which remain in their larval form for the duration of their life. Lithobates clamitans is partially neotenous: it delays its maturation through the winter season, because it is not advantageous for it to metamorphose into the adult form until there are more resources available: it can find those resources much more easily in the larval form. This would fall under both of the main causes of neoteny; the energy required to survive in the winter as a newly formed adult is too costly, so the organism exhibits neotenous characteristics until a time when it is capable of better survival as an adult. Ambystoma tigrinum retains its neotenous features for a similar reason, however the retention is permanent {{due to the lack of}} resources available throughout its lifetime. This is another example of an environmental cause of <b>neoteny</b> in that the species retains juvenile characteristics because the environment limits the ability of the organism to fully come into its adult form. A few species of birds show partial <b>neoteny.</b> A couple of examples of such species are the manakin birds Chiroxiphia linearis and Chiroxiphia caudata. The males of both species retain their juvenile plumage into adulthood, but they eventually lose it once they are fully mature. In certain species of birds the retention of juvenile plumage is often linked to the molting times within each species. In order to ensure there is no overlap between the molting and mating times, the birds may show partial <b>neoteny</b> in regards to their plumage so that the males do not attain their bright adult plumage before the females are prepared to mate. In this instance, <b>neoteny</b> is present because there is no need for the males to molt early and it would be a waste of energy for them to try to mate while the females are still immature.|$|E
25|$|Two common {{environments that}} tend to favor <b>neoteny</b> are high-altitude and cool environments because neotenous {{individuals}} have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor <b>neoteny</b> due {{to the ability of}} neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily. This trend {{can be seen in the}} comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher survivorship as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment. Insects in cooler environments tend to show <b>neoteny</b> in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects in that environment to metamorphose into adults.|$|E
25|$|In some species, {{energy costs}} result in <b>neoteny,</b> {{as in the}} insect {{families}} Gerridae, Delphacidae, and Carabidae. Many of the species in these families have smaller, neotenous wings or no wings at all. Similarly, some cricket species shed their wings in adulthood, while in beetles of the genus Ozopemon, the males (thought {{to be the first}} example of <b>neoteny</b> in the Coleoptera) are significantly smaller than the females, through inbreeding. In the termite Kalotermes flavicollis,neoteny is seen in females during molting.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>neoteny</b> and progenesis {{result in}} paedomorphism (or paedomorphosis), {{a type of}} heterochrony. Some authors define paedomorphism as the {{retention}} of larval traits, as seen in salamanders.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>neoteny</b> and progenesis {{cause the}} {{retention}} in adults of traits previously seen {{only in the}} young. Such retention is important in evolutionary biology, domestication, and evolutionary developmental biology.|$|E
25|$|These are {{the same}} {{features}} found in fish larvae, which suggests that during their evolution, bathypelagic fish have acquired these features through <b>neoteny.</b> As with larvae, these features allow the fish to remain suspended in the water with little expenditure of energy.|$|E
25|$|He also {{considered}} the axolotl, a mole salamander, which can breed whilst {{still in its}} gilled larval form without maturing into a terrestrial adult. Lankester noted that this process could take the subsequent evolution of the race into a totally different and otherwise improbable direction. This idea, which Lankester called super-larvation, is now called <b>neoteny.</b>|$|E
25|$|What {{little is}} known of barreleye {{reproduction}} indicates they are pelagic spawners; that is, eggs and sperm are released en masse directly into the water. The fertilized eggs are buoyant and planktonic; the larvae and juveniles drift with the currents—likely at much shallower depths than the adults—and upon metamorphosis into adult form, they descend to deeper waters. Dolichopteryx species are noted for their paedomorphic features, the result of <b>neoteny</b> (the retention of larval characteristics).|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} salamander, and {{amphibians}} in general, {{are known to}} have neotenized characteristics because of the environment they live in. The axolotl is a species of salamander that retains its juvenile aquatic form throughout adulthood, an excellent example of full <b>neoteny.</b> Gills are a common juvenile characteristic in amphibians that are kept after maturation; an example of this would be a comparison of the tiger salamander and the rough-skinned newt, both of which retain gills into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Human {{evolution}} {{is characterized by}} a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes that have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The most significant of these adaptations are 1. bipedalism, 2. increased brain size, 3. lengthened ontogeny (gestation and infancy), 4. decreased sexual dimorphism (<b>neoteny).</b> The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate. Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in H. erectus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neoteny</b> is {{commonly}} seen in flightless insects like the {{females in the}} order Strepsiptera. The flightless trait in insects has evolved many separate times; environments that {{may have contributed to}} the separate evolution of this trait are: high altitudes, isolation on islands, and insects that reside in colder climates. These environmental factors may be responsible for the flightless trait, because in these situations it would be disadvantageous to have a population that is more dispersed, so flightlessness would be favored due to the boundaries it poses to dispersal. Also, in cooler temperatures heat is lost more rapidly through wings, thus the circumstance favors flightlessness. Another couple of main points to note about insects are that the females in certain groups become sexually mature without metamorphosing into adulthood, and some insects which grow up in certain conditions do not ever develop wings. Flightlessness in some female insects has been linked to higher fecundity, this would increase the fitness of the individual because the female is producing more offspring and therefore passing on more of her genes. In those instances, <b>neoteny</b> occurs because it is more advantageous for the females to remain flightless in order to conserve energy which thereby increases their fecundity. Aphids are a great example of insects that may never develop wings due to their environmental setting. If resources are abundant there is no need to grow wings and disperse. When the nutrition of a host plant is abundant, aphids may not grow wings, remaining on the host plant for the duration of their lives; however, if the resources become diminished, their offspring may develop wings in order to disperse to other host plants.|$|E
25|$|People who are {{unfamiliar}} with horses may confuse an adult pony with a young, immature horse. While foals that {{will grow up}} to be horse-sized may be no taller than some ponies in their first months of life, their body proportions are very different. A pony can be ridden and put to work, while a foal is too young to be ridden or used as a working animal. Foals, whether they {{grow up to be}} horse or pony-sized, can be distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs and slim bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Furthermore, in most cases, nursing foals will be in very close proximity to a mare who is the mother (dam) of the foal. While ponies exhibit some <b>neoteny</b> with the wide foreheads and small size, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse.|$|E

500|$|At hatching, {{a typical}} {{salamander}} larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both {{upper and lower}} jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures {{on either side of}} the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as <b>neoteny,</b> or transforms into an adult. Both of these are able to breed. <b>Neoteny</b> occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine. Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics. The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out. There are fifteen species of [...] neotenic salamanders, including species of Necturus, Proteus and Amphiuma, and many examples of [...] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Past studies {{proposed}} {{that changes in}} dire wolf body size correlated with climate fluctuations. A later study compared dire wolf craniodental morphology from four LaBrea pits, each representing four different time periods. The results are evidence {{of a change in}} dire wolf size, dental wear and breakage, skull shape, and snout shape across time. Dire wolf body size had decreased between the start of the Last Glacial Maximum and near its ending at the warm Allerød oscillation. Evidence of food stress (food scarcity leading to lower nutrient intake) is seen in smaller body size, skulls with a larger cranial base and shorter snout (shape <b>neoteny</b> and size <b>neoteny),</b> and more tooth breakage and wear. Dire wolves dated 17,900YBP showed all of these features, which indicates food stress. Dire wolves dated 28,000YBP also showed to a degree many of these features but were the largest wolves studied, and it was {{proposed that}} these wolves were also suffering from food stress and that wolves earlier than this date were even bigger in size. Nutrient stress is likely to lead to stronger bite forces to more fully consume carcasses and to crack bones, and with changes to skull shape to improve mechanical advantage. North American climate records reveal cyclic fluctuations during the glacial period that included rapid warming followed by gradual cooling, called Dansgaard–Oeschger events. These cycles would have caused increased temperature and aridity, and at LaBrea would have caused ecological stress and therefore food stress. A similar trend was found with the gray wolf, which in the Santa Barbara basin was originally massive, robust, and possibly convergent with the dire wolf, but was replaced by more gracile forms by the start of the Holocene.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Neoteny</b> ( [...] or , (also called juvenilization) is the delaying or slowing of the {{physiological}} (or somatic) {{development of an}} organism, typically an animal. <b>Neoteny</b> is found in modern humans. In progenesis (also called paedogenesis), sexual development is accelerated.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Neoteny</b> {{in humans}} is the slowing or delaying of body development, {{compared}} to non-human primates, resulting in {{features such as}} a large head, a flat face, and relatively short arms and legs. These neotenic changes may have been brought about by sexual selection in human evolution. In turn, they may have permitted the development of human capacities such as emotional communication. However, humans also have relatively large noses and long legs, both peramorphic (not neotenic) traits. Some evolutionary theorists have proposed that <b>neoteny</b> was a key feature in human evolution. Gould argued that the [...] "evolutionary story" [...] of humans is one where we have been [...] "retaining to adulthood the originally juvenile features of our ancestors". J. B. S. Haldane mirrors Gould's hypothesis by stating a [...] "major evolutionary trend in human beings" [...] is [...] "greater prolongation of childhood and retardation of maturity." [...] Delbert D. Thiessen said that [...] "neoteny becomes more apparent as early primates evolved into later forms" [...] and that primates have been [...] "evolving toward flat face." [...] However, in light of some groups using arguments based around <b>neoteny</b> to support racism, Gould also argued [...] "that the whole enterprise of ranking groups by degree of <b>neoteny</b> is fundamentally unjustified" [...] (Gould, 1996, pg. 150). Doug Jones argued that human evolution's trend toward <b>neoteny</b> may {{have been caused by}} sexual selection in human evolution for neotenous facial traits in women by men with the resulting <b>neoteny</b> in male faces being a [...] "by-product" [...] of sexual selection for neotenous female faces.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Neoteny</b> {{is seen in}} domesticated animals such as {{dogs and}} mice. This is because there are more {{resources}} available, less competition for those resources, and with the lowered competition the animals expend less energy obtaining those resources. This allows them to mature and reproduce more quickly than their wild counterparts. The environment that domesticated animals are raised in determines whether or not <b>neoteny</b> is present in those animals. Evolutionary <b>neoteny</b> can arise in a species when those conditions occur, and a species becomes sexually mature ahead of its [...] "normal development". Another explanation for the <b>neoteny</b> in domesticated animals can be the selection for certain behavioral characteristics. Behavior is linked to genetics which therefore means that when a behavioral trait is selected for, a physical trait may also be selected for due to mechanisms like linkage disequilibrium. Often, juvenile behaviors are selected for in order to more easily domesticate a species; aggressiveness in certain species comes with adulthood {{when there is a}} need to compete for resources. If there is no need for competition, then there is no need for aggression. Selecting for juvenile behavioral characteristics can lead to <b>neoteny</b> in physical characteristics because, for example, with the reduced need for behaviors like aggression there is no need for developed traits that would help in that area. Traits that may become neotenized due to decreased aggression may be a shorter muzzle and smaller general size among the domesticated individuals. Some common neotenous physical traits in domesticated animals (mainly dogs, pigs, ferrets, cats, and even foxes) include: floppy ears, changes in reproductive cycle, curly tails, piebald coloration, fewer or shortened vertebra, large eyes, rounded forehead, large ears, and shortened muzzle.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Oppenheimer of the Institute of Cognitive & Evolutionary Anthropology at Oxford University said, [...] "An {{interesting}} hypothesis {{put forward}} by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould many years ago was that the package of the Mongoloid anatomical changes {{could be explained by}} the phenomenon of <b>neoteny,</b> whereby an infantile or childlike body form is preserved in adult life. <b>Neoteny</b> in hominids {{is still one of the}} simplest explanations of how we developed a disproportionately large brain so rapidly over the past few million years. The relatively large brain and the forward rotation of the skull on the spinal column, and body hair loss, both characteristic of humans, are found in foetal chimps. Gould suggested a mild intensification of <b>neoteny</b> in Mongoloids, in whom it has been given the name pedomorphy. Such a mechanism is likely to involve only a few controller genes and could therefore happen over a relatively short evolutionary period. It would also explain how the counterintuitive retrousse [...] nose and relative loss of facial hair got into the package". [...] "ecrease unnecessary muscle bulk, less tooth mass, thinner bones and smaller physical size; ...this follows the selective adaptive model of Mongoloid evolution".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the role}} of dogs {{expanded}} from just being working dogs to also being companions, humans started selective breeding dogs for morphological <b>neoteny,</b> and this selective breeding for [...] "neoteny or paedomorphism" [...] {{had the effect of}} enhancing the bond between humans and dogs. Humans bred dogs to have more [...] "juvenile physical traits" [...] as adults such as short snouts and wide-set eyes which are associated with puppies, because people usually consider these traits to be more attractive. Some breeds of dogs with short snouts and broad heads such as the Komondor, Saint Bernard and Maremma Sheepdog are more morphologically neotenous than other breeds of dogs.Cavalier King Charles spaniels are an example of selection for <b>neoteny,</b> because they exhibit large eyes, pendant-shaped ears and compact feet, giving them a morphology similar to puppies as adults.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, Louis Bolk {{described}} <b>neoteny</b> as {{the major}} process in humanization. In his 1977 book Ontogeny and Phylogeny, Steven Jay Gould noted that Bolk's account constituted an attempted justification for [...] "scientific" [...] racism and sexism, but acknowledged that Bolk had been right in the core idea that humans differ from other primates in becoming sexually mature in an infantile stage of body development.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, a {{study that}} used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls {{representing}} 100 breeds, concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as <b>neoteny</b> although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves. By 2011, the finding by the same researcher was simply [...] "Dogs are not paedomorphic wolves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the concept of <b>neoteny</b> have been traced to the Bible (as argued by Ashley Montagu) and to the poet William Wordsworth's [...] "The Child is the father of the Man" [...] (as argued by Barry Bogin).

2500|$|The word <b>neoteny</b> is {{borrowed}} from the German Neotenie, the latter constructed by Kollmann from the Greek νέος (neos, [...] "young") and τείνειν (teínein, [...] "to stretch, to extend").

Bogin points out that Kollmann had intended the meaning to be [...] "retaining youth", but had evidently confused the Greek teínein with the Latin tenere, which had the meaning he wanted, [...] "to retain", so that the new word would mean [...] "the retaining of youth (into adulthood)".|$|E
2500|$|Darlingtonia californica, the cobra plant, {{possesses}} {{an adaptation}} {{also found in}} Sarracenia psittacina and, to a lesser extent, in Sarracenia minor: the operculum is balloon-like and almost seals the opening to the tube. This balloon-like chamber is pitted with areolae, chlorophyll-free patches through which light can penetrate. Insects, mostly ants, enter the chamber via the opening underneath the balloon. Once inside, they tire themselves trying to escape from these false exits, until they eventually fall into the tube. Prey access is increased by the [...] "fish tails", outgrowths of the operculum that give the plant its name. Some seedling Sarracenia species also have long, overhanging opercular outgrowths; Darlingtonia may therefore represent an example of <b>neoteny.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mongoloid [...] is a {{term used}} for all or some peoples {{indigenous}} to East Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, North Asia, South Asia, the Arctic, the Americas, the Pacific Islands, and other lesser occurrences in other regions, but are the minority.

2500|$|While a {{distinct}} {{reason for the}} difference is unknown, a strong hypothesis is that the vocal communication of dogs developed due to their domestication.

[...] Adult dogs have, for example, large heads, floppy ears, and shortened snouts – all characteristics seen in wolf puppies. [...] The behavior, too, of adult dogs shows puppy-like characteristics: dogs are submissive, they whine, and they frequently bark. The experiment illustrates how selecting for one trait (in this case, tameness) can create profound by-products, both physical and behavioral.|$|E
