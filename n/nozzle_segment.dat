40|$|The {{development}} for t- 55 l 712 engine of high temperature for integral turbine nozzles with improved thermal fatigue resistance without sacrificing oxidation/corrosion protection is discussed. The program evaluated to coating systems which comprised one baseline plasma spray coating (12 % Al-NiCoCrALY), three aluminide coatings including the baseline aluminide (701), two CoNiCrAly (6 % Al) + aluminide systems and four NiCoCrY + aluminide coating were evaluated. The two-step coating processes were investigated since it offered {{the advantage of}} tailoring the composition as well as properly coating surfaces of an integral or <b>segmented</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Cyclic burner rig thermal fatigue and oxidation/corrosion tests were {{used to evaluate the}} candidate coating systems. The plasma sprayed 12 % Al-NiCoCrAlY was rated the best coating in thermal fatigue resistance and outperformed all coatings by a factor between 1. 4 to 2. 5 in cycles to crack initiation. However, this coatings is not applicable to integral or <b>segmented</b> <b>nozzles</b> due to the line of sight limitation of the plasma spray process.

40|$|Abstract Experimental and {{theoretical}} {{studies on the}} erosion of silica phenolic nozzles with graphite inserts in solid rocket motors were carried out. Two identical <b>segmented</b> <b>nozzles,</b> consisting of graphite inserts and silica phenolic insulation in the convergent and divergent sections, were tested at same operating condition. Due to the different thermal resistance ability, steps are formed at the interface of two materials. The erosion rates, following the distribution of Reynolds number, exhibit an upward trend in the convergent section and decrease in the divergent section for both silicon phenolic and graphite. At high temperature, the graphite erosion rate {{is limited by the}} diffusion rate of the oxidizing species,while the erosion rate is limited by the chemical kinetics at low temperature. For the graphite nozzle insert, a switch from kinetics mechanism to diffusion mechanism occurs in the convergent section during the firing test...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} to ablation of a ceramic nozzle {{made of a}} 50 vol% Carbon fiber- 50 vol% ZrB 2 composite was evaluated in a high velocity oxy-fuel torch (HVOF) in conditions simulating typical exhaust engine flows. The composite was prepared by hot pressing a mixture of ZrB 2 powders and C chopped fibers and characterized in terms of microstructural features, strength and toughness.

40|$|Thermo-acoustic {{combustion}} instability {{is a problem}} that has been researched for decades as it is a precursor to sudden catastrophic failure. Meanwhile, the demand for rocket engines that are able to maintain stable combustion over a wider range of thrust levels is increasing. One injector design utilized in Russia and Asia that has demonstrated stable throttling ability is the liquid-liquid co-axial swirl injector. Simultaneously, interest in alternative hydrocarbon rocket fuels has led to research {{on a wide range of}} fuel compositions that deviate from conventional kerosene-based rocket fuel. Hence, it is also necessary to determine how fuel properties will affect the performance of particular injector designs [...] The goal of the current work is to characterize the atomization and spray properties of a liquid-liquid co-axial swirl injector to evaluate feasibility for potential use in rocket engines. This work was accomplished through the use of non-invasive optical and X-ray techniques including high-speed imaging, phase Doppler interferometry, X-ray radiography, and three-dimensional computed tomography. These techniques provided information about break-up mechanisms, break-up lengths, droplet size distributions, and time-averaged liquid mass distributions. An injector with five different nozzle exit geometries was designed, constructed, and implemented for these experiments. The current work was able to demonstrate that geometrical factors such as design of the recessed <b>nozzle</b> exit <b>segments</b> can be optimized to increase breakup and promote more uniform particle distributions. Additionally, the study quantified flow characteristics of the injector over a large number flow parameters, including injection pressure and liquid properties, allowing for better estimates on the potential flow characteristics and breakup for use with conventional and alternative rocket fuels...|$|R
40|$|Viewgraphs are {{included}} on process development in aqueous cleaning which {{is taking place}} at the Aerojet Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) Division under a NASA Marshall Space and Flight Center contract for design, development, test, and evaluation of the ASRM including new production facilities. The ASRM will utilize aqueous cleaning in several manufacturing process steps to clean case <b>segments,</b> <b>nozzle</b> metal components, and igniter closures. ASRM manufacturing process development is underway, including agent selection, agent characterization, subscale process optimization, bonding verification, and scale-up validation. Process parameters are currently being tested for optimization utilizing a Taguci Matrix, including agent concentration, cleaning solution temperature, agitation and immersion time, rinse water amount and temperature, and use/non-use of drying air. Based on results of process development testing to date, several observations are offered: aqueous cleaning appears effective for steels and SermeTel-coated metals in ASRM processing; aqueous cleaning agents may stain and/or attack bare aluminum metals to various extents; aqueous cleaning appears unsuitable for thermal sprayed aluminum-coated steel; aqueous cleaning appears to adequately remove {{a wide range of}} contaminants from flat metal surfaces, but supplementary assistance may be needed to remove clumps of tenacious contaminants embedded in holes, etc.; and hot rinse water appears to be beneficial to aid in drying of bare steel and retarding oxidation rate...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} is an experimental and numerical study of aeroacoustic phenomena occurring in large solid rocket motors (SRM) as the Ariane 5 boosters. The emphasis {{is given to}} aeroacoustic instabilities {{that may lead to}} pressure and thrust oscillations which reduce the rocket motor performance and could damage the payload. The study is carried out within the framework of a CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) research program. Large SRM are composed of a submerged <b>nozzle</b> and <b>segmented</b> propellant grains separated by inhibitors. During propellant combustion, a cavity appears around the nozzle. Vortical flow structures may be formed from the inhibitor (Obstacle Vortex Shedding OVS) or from natural instability of the radial flow resulting from the propellant combustion (Surface Vortex Shedding SVS). Such hydrodynamic manifestations drive pressure oscillations in the confined flow established in the motor. When the vortex shedding frequency synchronizes acoustic modes of the motor chamber, resonance may occur and sound pressure can be amplified by vortex nozzle interaction. Original analytical models, in particular based on vortex sound theory, point out the parameters controlling the flow-acoustic coupling and the effect of the nozzle design on sound production. They allow the appropriate definition of experimental tests. The experiments are conducted on axisymmetric cold flow models respecting the Mach number similarity with the Ariane 5 SRM. The test section includes only one inhibitor and a submerged nozzle. The flow is either created by an axial air injection at the forward end or by a radial injection uniformly distributed along chamber porous walls. The internal Mach number can be varied continuously by means of a movable needle placed in the nozzle throat. Acoustic pressure measurements are taken by means of PCB piezoelectric transducers. A particle image velocimetry technique (PIV) is used to analyse the effect of the acoustic resonance on the mean flow field and vortex properties. An active control loop is exploited to obtain resonant and non resonant conditions for the same operating point. Finally, numerical simulations are performed using a time dependent Navier Stokes solver. The analysis of the unsteady simulations provides pressure spectra, sequence of vorticity fields and average flow field. Comparison to experimental data is conducted. The OVS and SVS instabilities are identified. The inhibitor parameters, the chamber Mach number and length, and the nozzle geometry are varied to analyse their effect on the flow acoustic coupling. The conclusions state that flow acoustic coupling is mainly observed for nozzles including cavity. The nozzle geometry has an effect on the pressure oscillations through a coupling between the acoustic fluctuations induced by the cavity volume and the vortices travelling in front of the cavity entrance. When resonance occurs, the sound pressure level increases linearly with the chamber Mach number, the frequency and the cavity volume. In absence of cavity, the pressure fluctuations are damped.

40|$|The {{intense heat}} flux to the {{electrode}} at the arc turminus dictates the design limitation of arc plasma devices. The energy flux {{due to the}} electron current {{is found to be}} the dominant mechanism. The net energy transfer to an anode is far noticeable to a cathode. Therefore a considerable effort has expended in attempt to achieve a good understanding of the anode-phenomena. The longitudinally <b>segmented</b> <b>nozzle</b> anode was used to examine the anode phenomena. This anode was composed of the mutually insulated four sections. Each segmented anode current was measured by the ammeter which was set in the individual anode circuit, and its waveform was observed by dual beam synchroscope. At the same time another synchroscope was used to examine the waveform of the arc voltage. In case of the total arc current being 10 amp., the arc current was concentrated at a downstream end of the anode throat. Its arc turminus fixed there steadily and its attachment area was small. It was shown that, increasing with the total arc current, the segmented anode current distribution shifts gradually its peak value to the upstream segments of the anode nozzle. For the arc current from 15 to 45 amp., the anode spot moved swiftly {{in the form of the}} restrike mode. The mean velocity of anode arc turminus which was determined from electrical measurement was of the order of 20 ? 150 m/sec. As the gas flow rate a increased, its velocity getting faster. Over 50 amp. the steady mode prevailed again, but the anode arc turminus expanded in its size and moved up to the adjacent upstream segments. In case the total current less than 45 amp. segmented anode current distribution was independent of the argon gas flow rate. When the total arc current increased over 50 amp., the influence of the gas flow rate became considerable, and with increasing the gas flow rate the segmented anode current distribution drifted to the downstream. The arc voltage was dependent on the anode attachment position. As the anode arc turminus shifted to downstream, the value of the arc voltage increased...|$|R
