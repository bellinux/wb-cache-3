Transistor amplifiers {{have been designed}} which will present high <b>input</b> <b>impedance,</b> but the frequency response is limited to low frequencies, hundreds of kilocycles. This thesis investigates both field effect transistors and positive feedback as applied to high <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> wide band amplifier design. The field effect transistor, in the source-follower configuration, is shown to offer high <b>input</b> <b>impedance,</b> wide-band amplification, and low output impedance.

[...] MOSFET-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive.
