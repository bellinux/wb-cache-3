40|$|Background Conserved <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> in {{the human}} genome are {{approximately}} tenfold more abundant than known genes, and have been hypothesized to mark the locations of cis-regulatory elements. However, the global contribution of conserved <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> to the transcriptional regulation of human genes is currently unknown. Deeply conserved elements shared between humans and teleost fish predominantly flank genes active during morphogenesis and are enriched for positive transcriptional regulatory elements. However, such deeply conserved elements account for < 1 % of the conserved <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> {{in the human}} genome, which are predominantly mammalian. Results We explored the regulatory potential of a large sample of these 'common' conserved <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> {{using a variety of}} classic assays, including chromatin remodeling, and enhancer/repressor and promoter activity. When tested across diverse human model cell types, we find that the fraction of experimentally active conserved <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> within any given cell type is low (approximately 5 %), and that this proportion increases only modestly when considered collectively across cell types. Conclusions The results suggest that classic assays of cis-regulatory potential are unlikely to expose the functional potential of the substantial majority of mammalian conserved <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> in the human genome...|$|R

There do exist some differences between coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences.</b> The cluster-size distribution of CG clusters P(S) for both coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> follows an exponential decay of P(S) proportional toe(-alphaS), and the value of a depends on the percentage of C-G content for coding sequences. It can fit into a linear line regularly but the case is contrary for noncoding sequences. We find that xi(m) = sigma(m) /rootm of CG clusters all obeys the good power-law decay of xi(m) proportional tom(-gamma) in both coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences,</b> and the value of gamma is 0. 949 +/- 0. 014 and 0. 826 +/- 0. 011 for coding and noncoding sequences, respectively. Therefore, we can distinguish between coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> {{on the basis of the}} value of gamma. At the meantime, we also discuss the power-law of xi(m) proportional tom(-gamma) for random sequence, and find that the value of gamma for random sequence is very close to 1. 00. So we can know that the value of gamma for coding sequences is more close to the random sequence, and obtain the conclusion that the behavior of coding sequence trends to random sequence more similarly. This investigation can provide some insights into DNA sequences. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

DNA symbol sequences exhibit a very complicated dynamical structure. There are long-range correlations [1 – 11] which are particularly strong for the <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> (DNA sequences which do not code for the production of proteins) whereas the coding sequences demonstrate characteristics similar to random-like processes [1 – 4].

50|$|Gene fusion plays a {{key role}} in the {{evolution}} of gene architecture. We can observe its effect if gene fusion occurs in coding sequences. Duplication, sequence divergence, and recombination are the major contributors at work in gene evolution. These events can probably produce new genes from already existing parts. When gene fusion happens in <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequence</b> region, it can lead to the misregulation of the expression of a gene now under the control of the cis-regulatory sequence of another gene. If it happens in coding sequences, gene fusion cause the assembly of a new gene, then it allows the appearance of new functions by adding peptide modules into multi domain protein. The detecting methods to inventory gene fusion events on a large biological scale can provide insights about the multi modular architecture of proteins.|$|E

40|$|In this {{presentation}} we introduce {{two methods}} to distinguish coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> {{in a complete}} genome. A numerical sequence representation of DNA sequences is introduced first. There exists a one-to-one correspondence between a DNA sequence and its numerical sequence representation. In the first method, three exponents from a multifractal analysis are selected to construct the parameter space. In the second method, {{which is based on}} a Fourier transform approach, three parameters from the power spectrum of the numerical sequence representation are selected to construct the parameter space. Each DNA may be represented by a point in these three-dimensional spaces. We found that the points corresponding to coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequences</b> in the complete genomes of prokaryotes are divided into different regions in both parameter spaces. If the point for a DNA sequence is situated in the region corresponding to coding sequences, the sequence is recognized as a coding sequence; otherwise, the sequence is classified as a non-coding one.

A case in point is the relationship between human gut and Clostridia, one of the most predominant bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract.

50|$|Rather than {{sequencing}} {{the entire}} genome (all DNA sequence) {{of the various}} plant species, the project will sequence only those regions of the genome that produce a protein product (coding genes); the transcriptome. This approach is justified by the focus on biochemical pathways where only the genes producing the involved proteins are required to understand the synthetic mechanism, and because these thousands of sequences would represent adequate sequence detail to construct very robust evolutionary relationships through sequence comparison. The numbers of coding genes in plant species can vary considerably, but all have tens of thousands or more making the transcriptome a large collection of information. However, <b>non-coding</b> <b>sequence</b> makes up the majority (>90%) of the genome content. Although this approach is similar conceptually to expressed sequence tags (ESTs), it is fundamentally different in that the entire sequence of each gene will be acquired with high coverage rather than just {{a small portion of}} the gene sequence with an EST. To distinguish the two, the non-EST method is known as “shotgun transcriptome sequencing”.|$|E

The success of comparative genomic studies relies on bioinformatics tools that aid the comparison and analysis of genome sequences.

Finally, we develop a probabilistic framework for multiple sequence alignment that finds an optimal alignment by incrementally building up alignment columns, based on a model for the evolution of three sequences and the joint probability of an alignment column as a substitute for the traditionally used sum-of-pairs score. We find that the new framework produces alignments of much greater specificity than state-of-the-art methods, without compromising too much in terms of sensitivity.
