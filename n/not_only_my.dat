500|$|Markham {{had agreed}} to Shackleton's {{appointment}} as Third Officer on the Discovery following a recommendation from the expedition's principal private donor. He had given sympathy and support after Shackleton's early return from the expedition on grounds of ill health, and had backed the latter's unsuccessful application for a Royal Navy commission. Later, after Shackleton had confided his intention to lead an expedition of his own, Markham supplied a generous testimonial, describing Shackleton as [...] "well-fitted to have charge of men in an enterprise involving hardship and peril", and [...] "admirably fitted for {{the leader of a}} Polar Expedition." [...] He expressed strong support for Shackleton's 1907–09 Nimrod Expedition: [...] "... <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>my</b> most cordial wishes for your success will accompany you, but also a well-founded hope." [...] When news of the expedition's achievement of a new Farthest South latitude of 88°23' reached him, Markham publicly signified his intention to propose Shackleton for the RGS Patron's Medal.|$|E
500|$|On Janet, Jackson began {{focusing}} on sexual themes. Shayne Lee, author of Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture (2010), wrote that her music {{over the following}} decade [...] "brand her {{as one of the}} most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s." [...] In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J. Goren observed [...] "Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." [...] The Washington Post declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted [...] "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust." [...] The song [...] "Free Xone" [...] from The Velvet Rope, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as [...] "a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics." [...] During promotion for Janet, she stated [...] "I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process." [...] Upon the release of Damita Jo, Jackon stated [...] "Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme," [...] adding [...] "As an artist, that's <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>my</b> passion, it's my obligation." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine has found Jackson's consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity, especially in comparisons to other artists such as Prince, stating [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything, it all depends on the artist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Glover {{originally}} {{worked in}} city administration working on community development before transitioning to theater. He has said:I didn't {{think it was}} a difficult transition. Acting is a platform that can become a conveyer for ideas. Art is a way of understanding, of confronting issues and confronting your own feelings—all within that realm of the capacity it represents. It may have been a leap of faith for me, given <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>my</b> learning disability (dyslexia) but also the fact that I felt awkward. I felt all the things that someone that's 6'3" [...] or 6'4" [...] feels and with my own diminished expectations of who I could be [...] would feel. Whether it's art, acting or theater that I've devoted myself to I put more passion and more energy into it.His first theater involvement was with the American Conservatory Theater, a regional training program in San Francisco. Glover also trained with Jean Shelton at the Shelton Actors Lab in San Francisco. In an interview on Inside the Actors Studio, Glover credited Jean Shelton for much of his development as an actor. Deciding {{that he wanted to be}} an actor, Glover resigned from his city administration job and soon began his career as a stage actor. Glover then moved to Los Angeles for more opportunities in acting, where he would later go on to co-found the Robey Theatre Company with actor Ben Guillory in honor of the actor and concert singer Paul Robeson in Los Angeles in 1994.|$|E
