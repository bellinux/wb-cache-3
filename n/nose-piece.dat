He will return, therefore, to the Knight of St. Valeri his horse, and, if the Lady Torfrida chooses, {{the favor}} which he has taken by mistake from its {{rightful}} owner." [...] And he set his teeth, and could not prevent stamping on the ground, in evident passion. There was a tone, too, of deep disappointment in his voice, which made Torfrida look keenly at him. Why should Hereward's nephew feel so deeply about that favor? And as she looked,--could that man be the youth Siward? Young he was, but surely thirty years old at least. His face could hardly be seen, hidden by helmet and <b>nose-piece</b> above, and mailed up to the mouth below. But his long mustache {{was that of a}} grown man; his vast breadth of shoulder, his hard hand, his sturdy limbs,--these surely belonged not to the slim youth whom she had seen from her lattice riding at Hereward's side. And, as she looked, she saw upon his hand the bear of which her nurse had told her.|$|E

By analysing {{the development of a}} laminar boundary layer on a two-parameter family of nose shapes, it is found that a cubic super-ellipse of axis ratio 6 or higher is a reasonable optimum shape for avoiding separation on or due to such <b>nose-pieces...</b>|$|R
50|$|Oxford {{spectacles}} (or Oxfords for short): The {{distinction between}} this style and pince-nez is not frequently drawn; {{often they are}} listed as a pince-nez {{when they are in}} fact a distinct style of spectacle. The style was developed in the 19th century when a professor at Oxford University accidentally broke off the handle from a pair of lorgnette spectacles. He reputedly affixed two small nose-pads to the frame and found that he could use the tension in the folding spring to perch them on his nose. Whether or not this story is apocryphal is unknown. Oxfords are undoubtedly descended from the lorgnette, as early examples of them often had handles in addition to nose-pads. In style Oxfords are much like the C-bridge as the tension is provided by a flexible, sprung piece of metal; however, they also resemble the spring bridge, as the spring connects the two lenses and is distinct from the <b>nose-pieces.</b> Oxfords were popular up until the 1930s, and were manufactured as both frames and as 4 piece mounts for frameless, although the latter are hard to find.|$|R
40|$|Using {{representative}} {{members of}} each of three homologous series of chemicals-ketones, acetates and alcohols-we measured nasal pungency thresholds in anosmics via two stimulus-delivery systems. The first system consists of the fairly commonly used 270 ml, plastic 'squeeze bottles'. The second system consists of 1900 ml, glass vessels with Teflon tubing and <b>nose-pieces.</b> Although bulkier and more susceptible to mechanical breakage, the glass vessels possess advantages that can allow them to provide 'environmentally realistic' chemosensory thresholds, i. e. thresholds closer in absolute values to those that might be obtained under whole-body exposures. Such advantages include a larger volume of the vapor-source to accommodate whole sniffs, and a tight nose-nose-piece connection to avoid stimulus dilution. The outcome revealed that, for every chemical, the glass vessels provided nasal pungency thresholds significantly lower than those provided by the squeeze bottles. The difference amounted, on average, to a factor of 4. 6, though the relative potency of the compounds remained the same under both systems. Additionally, when tested with the highest homologues used here, namely, octyl acetate and 1 -octanol, anosmics using the glass vessels {{had little or no}} difficulty achieving the criterion for threshold whereas they did have difficulty when using the squeeze bottles...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{paediatric}} dental patients are highly anxious about dental treatment and this {{prevents them from}} accepting dental treatment in the conventional manner. There {{are a number of}} techniques available to help subjects deal better with treatment and one of the more commonly used techniques is nitrous oxide inhalation sedation. This technique involves the administration of a titrated mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen through a <b>nose-piece</b> with the aim of sedating a patient to a point where s/he can cope with dental treatment. This technique is highly successful but it still requires a certain amount of cooperation {{on the part of the}} patient. Some patients find it hard to accept the <b>nose-piece</b> while others accept it initially but then still do not manage to relax enough for dental treatment to be carried out. Childrenâ€Ÿs coping strategies vary and are dependent on factors such as age, personal characteristics and cultural influences. Research shows that cognitively oriented coping strategies are more constructive in the dental setting and it is possible to teach children how to use such strategies. Preparation for surgery and anaesthesia is clearly important and many children consider the dental visit a stressful situation. Cognitive behaviour therapy has been used to help subjects cope with various medical conditions and also in preparation for surgery. The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate a cognitive pamphlet to help facilitate inhalation sedation treatment for anxious paediatric dental patients. The project was carried out in three parts. The first study, a retrospective case note review of the patients undergoing inhalation sedation at Glasgow Dental Hospital and School, ascertained the population sample. 13 The case notes of all the patients who attended for dental treatment with inhalation sedation at the Glasgow Dental Hospital in the year 2005 were pulled and demographic details of the patients were recorded from them. The results showed that the mean age of the patients attending was 10. 8 years with a range of 5 to 16 years and about 53 % of patients were female. Therefore, it was concluded that the pamphlet should target children aged between 7 and 16 years and it should be equally appealing to both genders. In the second study a cognitive pamphlet was designed, evaluated qualitatively and modified. The pamphlet was designed by the main researcher with the help of a psychologist. It consisted of a three-panel brochure with bold colourful images and text. It presented the subject with three sets of cognitive exercises to practice at home and perform during treatment. The pamphlet was qualitatively evaluated by a focus group of paediatric dentists using a structured interview questionnaire. The pamphlet was then amended according to the suggestions of the interviewees. The third study was a single blind randomised controlled clinical evaluation of this modified pamphlet. Subjects were assessed and recruited to the study from the sedation assessment clinics in the Glasgow Dental Hospital and the Community Dental Services. The subjects were randomly allocated to either a control or a study group. The subjects in the study group received a previously developed pamphlet consisting of cognitive behavioural therapy exercise. The children were instructed to read the pamphlet and practice the exercises at home and then use them at their first treatment visit. The preoperative anxiety levels of the subjects were assessed prior to assignment into the 14 respective groups. The blinded operators were asked to assess the overall behaviour of the subjects on a Global Rating Scale and a Visual Analog Scale. All the subjects had their first treatment visit videotaped and all the tapes were watched by two blinded observers at the end of the study and the subjectsâ€Ÿ acceptance of the <b>nose-piece</b> as well as their overall behaviour was scored. The scales used by the blinded observers were the Houpt Scale, the Visual Analog Scale and the Global Rating Scale. These scales were applied at specific time-points, namely: 1. introduction to the <b>nose-piece,</b> 2. fitting of the <b>nose-piece,</b> 3. breathing in and out of the <b>nose-piece</b> and 4. start of the operative procedure. The final number of subjects participating in the study was 35, of which 11 (31. 5 %) were recruited from the Community Dental Services. Eighteen (51. 4 %) were male and the mean age was 10. 2 years (7 - 14). Thirteen (34. 2 %) were in the highest level of social deprivation. The preoperative anxiety scores were very similar for both groups and the mean values (24. 6 and 24. 9) were higher than the normative value. The primary outcome measure of the study was whether the pamphlet improved subject acceptance of the <b>nose-piece.</b> Only one subject from the control group refused to wear the <b>nose-piece</b> while all the subjects in the study group accepted the <b>nose-piece.</b> The difference was not statistically significant (Chi square test, p= 0. 324). The secondary outcome measure was the overall behaviour of the subjects during treatment. Although, there was poor agreement between the observers, the individual results from each observer as well as the result at the time of best agreement show that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (Mann-Whitney and Fisherâ€Ÿs Exact test). The results show that the pamphlet was not 15 successful to either help subjects accept the <b>nose-piece</b> or improve their behaviour during treatment. There could be various reasons for the failure of the pamphlet to improve patient co-operation. These include an already highly successful technique (inhalation sedation), a small study sample, failure to comply with instructions to read the pamphlet, difficulty in processing cognitive exercises without the help of a psychologist and the Hawthorne effect. Although it is not possible to recommend the use a cognitive pamphlet prior to inhalation sedation at this stage, it may be possible to further investigate this idea in a future study taking into consideration the shortcomings of the present study and improving them...|$|E
