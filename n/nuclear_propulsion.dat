5|$|Albert G. Mumma (2 June 1906 – 15 July 1997) was a {{rear admiral}} in the United States Navy {{who played a}} pivotal role in the {{development}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> for warships. During World War II, he served in France and Germany with the Alsos Mission.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion.</b> Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E
40|$|With the {{announcement}} of the Vision for Space Exploration on January 14, 2004, there has been a renewed interest in <b>nuclear</b> thermal <b>propulsion.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> thermal <b>propulsion</b> is a leading candidate for in-space propulsion for human Mars missions; however, the cost to develop a nuclear thermal rocket engine system is uncertain. Key to determining the engine development cost will be the engine requirements, the technology used in the development and the development approach. The engine requirements and technology selection have not been defined and are awaiting definition of the Mars architecture and vehicle definitions. The paper discusses an engine development approach in light of top-level strategic questions and considerations for <b>nuclear</b> thermal <b>propulsion</b> and provides a suggested approach based on work conducted at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center to support planning and requirements for the Prometheus Power and Propulsion Office. This work is intended to help support the development of a comprehensive strategy for <b>nuclear</b> thermal <b>propulsion,</b> to help reduce the uncertainty in the development cost estimate, and to help assess the potential value of and need for <b>nuclear</b> thermal <b>propulsion</b> for a human Mars mission...|$|R

5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion.</b> It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be.|$|E

5|$|Mumma {{arrived back}} in the United States in December 1945, and {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war priority was to develop <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul F. Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear-powered ship.|$|E
5|$|Starting May 1946, the S-50 plant {{buildings}} were utilised, {{not as a}} production facility, but by the United States Army Air Forces' Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project. Fairchild Aircraft {{conducted a series of}} experiments there involving beryllium. Workers also fabricated blocks of enriched uranium and graphite. NEPA operated until May 1951, when it was superseded by the joint Atomic Energy Commission-United States Air Force Aircraft <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Propulsion</b> project. The S-50 plant was disassembled in the late 1940s. Equipment was taken to the K-25 powerhouse area, where it was stored before being salvaged or buried.|$|E
5|$|Nichols {{kept the}} {{national}} laboratories operating with $60 {{million worth of}} research grants for fiscal year 1947. He helped Captain Hyman G. Rickover train a team of naval engineers at Oak Ridge in <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion.</b> In June 1946, Nichols went to Bikini Atoll to represent the Manhattan Project at Operation Crossroads, a series of nuclear weapons tests conducted to investigate their effects on warships. Like many of his contemporaries in an Army that was dramatically reduced in size as it rapidly demobilized, Nichols was reduced in rank, reverting to his substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 30 June 1946. On return from Bikini, he found {{that he had been}} made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 {{white paper}} {{outlined}} the replacement submarine as a 4,000-ton vessel fitted with land-attack cruise missiles {{in addition to}} torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, capable of launching and recovering covert operatives while submerged, and carrying surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment. The project initially had four options: a Military-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) design without modification, a MOTS design modified for Australian conditions, an evolution of an existing submarine, or a newly designed submarine. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> was ruled out {{because of the lack}} of nuclear infrastructure and public opposition to nuclear technology. Designs initially considered for purchase or modification included the Spanish S-80 class, the French-designed Scorpène class, the German-designed Type 214, and Japan's Sōryū class, along with an evolution of the Collins.|$|E
5|$|Americium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion,</b> have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.|$|E

25|$|As {{deputy chief}} of naval {{operations}} for fleet operations and readiness from 1962 to 1963, Griffin supervised an influential Navy study that reversed the Navy's previous stance on its <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> program by accepting the view of Vice Admiral Hyman G.

25|$|Deciding {{the future}} submarines' {{propulsion}} system is {{closely tied to}} determining its operational range, endurance and stealthiness. Two basic options are presented in submarine propulsion: <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion,</b> and conventional, diesel-electric propulsion. The option of <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> effectively gives submarines an unlimited range and endurance, only restrained by maintenance and human crew requirements for resupply and rest, and removes the necessity for surfacing to recharge batteries, an unstealthy and risky process. Australian governments have repeatedly rejected the <b>nuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> option {{due to the lack}} of an Australian nuclear power industry (Australia would be the only non-nuclear nation to operate nuclear submarines), related issues of operational sovereignty were Australia to operate an American nuclear powered submarine such as the Virginia class, rendering it dependent on American technical support, and public opposition to nuclear technology.|$|E
