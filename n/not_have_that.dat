5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said it is amazing being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
5|$|Setting up an {{exchange}} gives a state partial discretion on standards and prices of insurance. For example, states approve plans for sale, and influence (through limits on and negotiations with private insurers) the prices on offer. They can impose higher or state-specific coverage requirements—including whether plans {{offered in the}} state can cover abortion. States without {{an exchange}} do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> discretion. The responsibility for operating their exchanges moves to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants who did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E

5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E
5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

25|$|Status {{in early}} Ireland {{was not entirely}} rigid and it was {{possible}} for a family to raise its status. If three consecutive generations—grandfather, father, and son—had the property qualifications of a lord, or the poetic qualifications of a higher level poet, etc., then the member of the third generation became a lord. On the other hand, the son or grandson of a lord, or a poet, etc., who did not have the proper qualifications, did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> status.

25|$|In 1996, Article 5A was {{inserted}} into the Constitution and Article 22H was amended; these changes clarified the situation by providing different procedures for circumventing or curtailing the President's discretionary power, {{depending on whether the}} Government seeks to do so by way of an ordinary bill or a bill seeking to amend the Constitution. Article 22H deals with attempts to alter the President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill.

25|$|Mayor Ed Koch too {{explored}} {{possibilities for}} {{a ban on}} private cars in 1979, only permitting mass transit, delivery, and emergency vehicles. The city's transportation commissioner said that limited bans on two streets in midtown Manhattan had been successful. The next year, Koch's office sought to ban single-occupancy cars from the East River bridges during weekday morning rush hour, but the State Supreme Court ruled that the City did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> authority. Other actions, such as bicycle and bus lanes, reduction in parking spaces, and automobile inspections, were left in place. In 1981, the national administration deemed New York City {{in compliance with the}} federal air pollution regulations after a decade of noncompliance. Carbon monoxide levels decreased over the decade with improvements in car emissions. The number of cars inbound to Manhattan continued to rise and vehicle exhaust remained the top source of pollution in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of major}} tourist {{destinations}} in Indonesia, especially Bali, Yogyakarta, Batam, Bandung and Jakarta, has a rather relaxed modern cosmopolitan social outlook, {{which is quite}} conducive for tourism industry. However, certain regional provinces might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> kind of luxury, and tends to be conservative. Next to national laws, several Indonesian provinces has applied regional autonomous law, which some of them based on Islamic sharia law, such as Aceh province, {{and the city of}} Palembang. Extra caution must be demonstrated by visitors to Aceh, since the province has a rather strict Islamic-based law, enforced by Islamic religious police, called Wilayatul Hisbah. Thus, some certain normally private matters, such as beach clothing (esp, bikini), modesty issue, party and the consumption of alcohol, to a display of affections between couple, are discouraged and frowned upon, and might led to a legal problem. Carefulness and discretion is highly required, especially for unmarried couple and LGBT travellers.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the F-82 pilots would exceed all expectations in aerial combat. On 28 June, orders came down for all F-82s {{to be used}} in heavy ground support against any North Korean activity found between the front lines and the 38th Parallel. Every F-82 which could be made ready for flight was pressed into combat service. Although Fifth Air Force needed every available aircraft to slow down the North Korean invasion force, it was hard to justify the release of all F-82s from their defensive responsibilities for the many key bases in Japan. It was decided to release all F-82s for combat except for a flight which was deployed from the 4th F(AW)S in Okinawa to Japan and a full squadron of F-80s for air defense. On 30 June, FEAF requested HQ USAF for an additional 21 F-82 aircraft, which was denied. In addition, the projected level of support which could be provided at the level of combat usage FEAF was experiencing was no more than 60 days due to a shortage of parts. The fact was that, when F-82 production ended in April 1948, no provision had been made for an adequate supply of spare parts, as the aircraft was not expected to remain in operational service once jet-powered aircraft were available. Further, the Air Force simply did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> many F-82s in the first place (182 total operational aircraft), {{and did not want to}} weaken the F-82 units committed to the Pacific Northwest or Atlantic coast, or to draw from the fourteen F-82Hs in Alaska.|$|E
