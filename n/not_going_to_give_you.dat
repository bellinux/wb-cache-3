500|$|Before {{the success}} of Thriller, many felt Jackson had {{struggled}} to get MTV airing because he was black. In an effort to attain air time for Jackson, CBS Records President Walter Yetnikoff pressured MTV and declared, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> any more videos and I'm going to go public and fucking {{tell them about the}} fact you don't want to play music by a black guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Bevin {{advocated}} {{shifting the}} state's tax code away from [...] "productivity" [...] taxes, such as income taxes, to [...] "consumption taxes" [...] such as sales taxes, {{a move that}} Conway called [...] "regressive". He repeated his call to eliminate the inheritance tax and added that the state should [...] "aim for" [...] the elimination of corporate taxes. Bevin also called {{for the elimination of}} many of Kentucky's $10 billion in [...] "tax expenditures", which he called [...] "Frankfort-speak for loopholes". Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> specifics at this point in time. There are many of these loopholes that frankly are not conducive to developing the economy. There are some that make sense, and those will continue. ...e have already identified what many of them will be. But at this point, we're {{going to have to look}} at them in totality. I'm not gonna give you specifics at this time. I'm just not." ...|$|E
500|$|Walter Yetnikoff, the {{president}} of Jackson's record company CBS Records, approached MTV about playing the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video, which MTV had not ever played in spite of Jackson's success as a musical artist. Yetnikoff became enraged when MTV refused to play the video, and he threatened {{to go public with}} MTV's stance on racial discrimination. [...] "I said to MTV, 'I'm pulling everything we have off the air, all our product. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> any more videos. And I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy.'" [...] MTV relented and played the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video in heavy rotation. After the video was aired, Thriller went on to sell an additional 10 million copies. The short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame in 1992. In a 2005 poll of 31 pop stars, video directors, agents, and journalists conducted by telecommunications company 3, the music video was ranked fifth in their [...] "Top 20 Music Videos Ever". The video was also ranked as the 35th greatest music video in a list compiled by MTV and TV Guide at the millennium.|$|E

"Little lady," [...] he said, gently {{forcing her}} back into her place, [...] "believe me, it's done all the world over, and there isn't any girl can come to any harm by being told that a man is fond of her when it's the truth, when he'd give his life for her willingly.

60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. [C.] I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{any details}} about her life. I tell you simply this--Mrs. Erlynne was once honoured, loved, respected.

You sail that ship, you see to breaking up that wreck and keeping the men upon the jump, and you'll find your hands about full.
