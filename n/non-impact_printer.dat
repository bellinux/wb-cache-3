50|$|The first {{commercial}} <b>non-impact</b> <b>printer</b> was the Xerox 1200, introduced in 1973, {{based on the}} 3600 copier. It had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer Phil Chen.|$|E
40|$|In digital printing, {{an image}} is sent {{directly}} to the printer using digital files such as PDFs from graphic software such as Illustrator and In Design. This {{eliminates the need for}} a printing plate, which is used in offset printing, which can save money and time. The digital printing can be classified in to mainly four categories 	Silver halide process 	Inkjet technology 	Thermal printing 	Electro photography <b>Non-impact</b> <b>printers</b> print characters and images without any physical contact between the Printing mechanism and the paper. <b>Non-impact</b> <b>printers</b> are generally much quieter than impact printers since they don't physically strike the page...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Centronics {{formed a}} {{relationship}} with Canon to develop <b>non-impact</b> <b>printers.</b> No products were ever produced, but Canon continued to work on laser printers, eventually developing a highly successful series of engines.|$|R
50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to <b>non-impact</b> <b>printers.</b> While they support fanfold paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|R
40|$|Use {{of color}} in the office and {{business}} environment is growing rapidly. In the 90 s, color is becoming easier and less expensive to use and its application is moving from isolated color pages toward integrated color documents. Moreover, in parallel with this trend, color in documents is driving a paradigm shift from a text orientation to a pictorial and graphic one. Business applications cover a range of quality requirements for both full and highlight color documents. <b>Non-impact</b> <b>printers</b> for these applications are being manufactured based on numerous technologies, including xerography, thermal transfer, ink jet, thermal dye diffusion and even photography. We compare and contrast these technologies in terms of characteristics such as registration, image structure, color gamut, and stability. We then consider the systems impact of customer requirements such as ease of use and consistency of results across printers, demonstrating a need to hide the printer technologies and their differences from the system users. A need for standards in both the description of color documents in device independent form and in other aspects such as viewing conditions is discussed in this context. 2...|$|R
