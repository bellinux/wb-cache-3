5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} storms was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center for February28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed {{early in the evening}} of February28 in Kansas as the dry line pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front. In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since September22, 2006. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> injured that evening. Farther south, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas did not take place as the atmospheric cap held up.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} {{had reached the}} Eastern Pacific from Africa was first spotted on July 23. The wave continued westward with little development occurring until August 3, when convection increased. After additional slow organization, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 near the tip of Baja California. The system did not strengthen much, and development was halted when wind shear destroyed the system on August 8. The depression never came near land and hence <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> killed or injured. Like Tropical Depression Three-E, this cyclone was forecast to reach tropical storm intensity, but it never did.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E
