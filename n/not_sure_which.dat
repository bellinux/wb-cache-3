5|$|By mid-October, Diệm and Nhu knew of {{the coup}} plans, but {{did not know that}} Đính was firmly among them, {{although}} they were wary of him. Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them, and <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> side he was really on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
25|$|Nhu {{then made}} a plan to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided {{that they had to}} {{counteract}} him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính and whether he would betray them to the palace. Having found out that Đính would be recruited for Nhu's plan, and <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> side he was really on, they promised to make him Interior Minister and other rewards if they helped to overthrow the Ngô family. Having gained a reassurance from Đính, the generals placated the younger officers, whose coup had been integrated into their plans.|$|E

25|$|In the Annales of Tacitus, it is {{mentioned}} {{that after the}} defeat of 9 BC Augustus divided the Germans by making a separate peace with the Sugambri and Suebi under their king Maroboduus. This is the first mention of any permanent king of the Suebi. However, Maroboduus' people was in most sources {{referred to as the}} king of the Marcomanni, a tribal name that had already been distinct from the Suebi in Caesar's time. (As discussed above, it is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> Suebi were the Suebi of Caesar, but at least they were distinguished from the Marcomanni.) However, Maroboduus was also described as Suebian, and his association with the Marcomanni more specifically comes after the Langobards and Semnones were specifically said to have left his kingdom, having previously been under his rule. At some point in this period the Marcomanni had come to be settled in the forested regions once inhabited by the Boii, in and around Bohemia, under his rule.|$|E
500|$|On {{her social}} media website Littlemonsters.com, Gaga later {{corrected}} the song title, {{saying that it}} is actually [...] "G.U.Y.", an acronym for [...] "Girl Under You". She also revealed that the song was written and produced with musician Zedd, who had been touring with Gaga for her Born This Way Ball. Zedd had previously done a remix of her single [...] "Marry the Night" [...] for her remix album, , and Gaga had contributed vocals on an alternate version of Zedd's track, [...] "Stache". The musician told MTV News that they [...] "both love nothing more than making music, so it was just kind of natural for us to just work on music". He also confirmed that around ten songs were composed with Gaga and was almost finished, although he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> would be available on the final track list for Artpop.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{a general}} {{economic}} upturn in the early 2000s, commercial war literature publishing became popular again. Pavel Aptekar wrote Tainy finskoi voiny in 2000 and Sovetsko-finskiye voiny in 2004, in which he emphasized the Finnish side and describes the Soviet assault as [...] "immoral". In 2003, Pavel Petrov and Viktor Stepakov wrote a 542-page long book called Sovetsko-finlandsjaya voina 1939–1940, in which they negate the myth of a major Nazi-German influence on Finnish foreign policy, and demonstrate that the United Kingdom had a bigger role. However, more [...] "traditional" [...] literature has also been published, such as Rozdeniye i krah by Nikolai Baryshnikov and Vladimir Baryshikov in 2000. The authors revive Soviet views, and for example are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> party started the Shelling of Mainila. The book was also published in Finnish by the Johan Beckman Institute.|$|E
2500|$|News footage {{showed a}} GIGN man knocked {{down the front}} right airstair when a bullet struck his gun and detonated the cartridges. The {{remaining}} hijacker kept the GIGN at bay for 20 minutes, but he eventually ran out of ammunition and died from a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, the GIGN operatives were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> men were the hijackers and how many were still alive, so they considered all male passengers as potentially being hijackers. The flight engineer, Alain Bossuat, radioed the tower stating that the hijackers were dead {{and that there were}} no more left. This signaled to GIGN forces that a final clearing of the A300 could begin. Delhemme said that when the forces entered the aircraft, they ordered him to put his hands on his head. Delhemme said that, after the hijacking ordeal had run its course, he refused to leave with his hands on his head and be [...] "punished like a child." [...] Burgniard said that when she saw Bossuat handcuffed, the cabin crew told the forces to let him go as the individual was the flight engineer. At 5:35pm, Favier radioed to the tower that the incident was over; the incident unfolded in 54 hours.|$|E

2500|$|Other episodes such as [...] "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood", set in 1913, {{depict the}} racism {{of an earlier}} era (Edwardian era). For Orthia, the few Doctor Who serials that {{explicitly}} depict racism [...] "are remarkable by their presence: they carry rhetorical power {{because they are so}} rare in Doctor Who." [...] In [...] "Human Nature", in addition to the racist jibes of private school boys, [...] "we bear witness to how things have changed, when a white nurse refuses to believe that Martha is a medical student in the future, saying, [...] "Women might train to be doctors, but hardly a skivvy and hardly one of your colour."" [...] When the TARDIS crew are nationally branded as terrorists in [...] "The Sound of Drums", the Master (Simm) says that the Doctor's current companions [...] "tick every demographic box"– referring to Martha's gender and ethnicity and Jack's sexual orientation. He later refers to Jack (Barrowman) and Martha as [...] "the girlie and the freak", adding to the insult by claiming he is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> is which. Episodes set in the future, Orthia notes, are more often than not inclusive and [...] "cosmopolitan" [...] projections of societies which are as multi-racial (though not multi-ethnic) and sexually liberal as the present, if not more so. In 2009, Martha was listed among the top 20 Black Sci-Fi Icons by Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes {{it is good}} {{strategy}} to play a low card when facing an empty board if you are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>which</b> cards have been played.

50|$|When {{the subject}} is {{presented}} with the first scene, in Figure A, they become confused. We see this by the many eye movements of the subjects who are <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>which</b> items to manipulate. In the second scene the subject clearly understands the sentence more easily. In this scene the pencil is replaced by another apple on a napkin. This disambiguates the phrase because the subject understands that on the towel is modifying the apple, and is not referring to a destination.|$|R

60|$|Another verse, 'Could {{my tears}} for ever flow,' and after it, in rapid succession, spoke {{a man who}} had been a {{schoolmaster}} and fallen through drink and gambling; a man who, or whose brother, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>which,</b> had been a Wesleyan preacher, and who is now employed in a Life Assurance Company; {{a man who had}} been a prisoner; {{a man who had been}} a confirmed drunkard, and others.|$|E
