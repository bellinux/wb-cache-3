5|$|There is {{continuing}} critical {{debate about the}} status of the poem as it is <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> us. While some scholars accept the texts of the Hymn as more or less accurate transmissions of Cædmon's original, others argue that they originated as a back-translation from Bede's Latin, and that there is no surviving witness to the original text.|$|E
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E
5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense {{for the use of}} the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.|$|E

5|$|In November 1995 the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust {{purchased}} the locomotive for £200,000 (through a third party) {{and the following}} February it {{was transferred to the}} Trust's premises at the Midland Railway in Butterley,Derbyshire. In 1998, funded by public donation and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the third party purchaser was paid off and the money was <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> restore the locomotive. The work was carried out at the railway workshops at Swanwick Junction and in July 2001 the restored locomotive was allowed a trial run on the national rail network, where it promptly broke down and had to be towed home. With the fault fixed, No. 46233 now started to generate income by hauling enthusiasts' trains, as well as the Royal Train on two occasions. Following another overhaul commencing in 2010, the locomotive resumed its steaming duties in 2012. As at October 2016, it is still owned by the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust and still pulling enthusiasts' specials.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign {{and the success of}} the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E
5|$|Middleton {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of raid and harrying. Although successful in distracting the Commonwealth forces and causing disruption, it soon began to prove counter-productive, as growing unpopularity led to a drying up of recruitment. With his return to Scotland after his brief naval command against the Dutch, Monck began a campaign against the rising, making forced marches of between 12 and 20 miles a day in difficult terrain. On 19 July 1654 a force from Monck's command under Thomas Morgan caught Middleton's army at Dalnaspidal. In the resulting battle the royalists were scattered and a wounded Middleton was forced to escape to the Highlands. The end of the Dutch War meant there was no possibility of foreign aid and government reinforcements were <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> combat the rising. As a result, the Royalist military effort petered out. Eventually, Glencairn surrendered to Monck and Middleton escaped to the continent to join the court in exile.|$|E

25|$|Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) {{is a rare}} but serious {{disease that}} is limited to show Border Collies. NCL results in severe {{neurological}} impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The mutation causing {{the form of the}} disease found in Border Collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales.

Mrs. Gropius also deeded the Gropius House in Lincoln to Historic New England in 1980.

Digital switchover has been completed throughout Germany as of 2 December 2008 and services are <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> 100% of the population following the update of infill for the remaining 10% of transmitters by Media Broadcast who set up broadcast antennas at 79 transmission sites and installed 283 new transmitter stations.

25|$|Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a {{hereditary}} disease {{in which the}} bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS {{has been found in}} Border Collies in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> detect carriers as well as affected dogs.|$|E
25|$|Hypokalaemia, {{a genetic}} disease which is {{characterized}} by low serum potassium levels, has also {{been seen in the}} British Burmese and can similarly be traced to certain bloodlines. The gene is recessive, and both parents must carry it for the kittens to develop the problem. A carrier mated to a non-carrier may pass the problem on unnoticed for several generations. Clinical signs include skeletal muscle weakness, which is often episodic in nature and either affects the whole cat or is localised to the neck muscles. As a consequence the cat can have difficulty in walking and holding their head correctly. In extreme cases, the clinical symptoms can result in death if unattended medically. Hypokalaemic cats can usually lead a normal life if they get the correct potassium supplement. Onset of symptoms often occurs around puberty and many may never experience another attack. A DNA test is <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> identify cats affected by or carrying this recessive gene.|$|E
