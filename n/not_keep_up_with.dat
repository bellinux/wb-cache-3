5|$|Ryan Williams capped a {{brilliant}} {{first season with}} a record-setting game, running for two touchdowns and 117 yards to become Virginia Tech’s single-season rushing leader with 1,655 yards. Williams had long runs of 21 and 32 yards in the drive before setting the record on a 6-yard run to the 3. Williams also set Atlantic Coast Conference records with 21 rushing touchdowns and 22 total touchdowns this season breaking North Carolina’s Don McCauley ACC marks of 19 rushing touchdowns and 21 total in 1970. Tennessee’s star running back, Montario Hardesty, could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Williams as the Volunteers’ senior had 18 carries for 39 yards and a touchdown. The Hokies outrushed Tennessee 229-5. Taylor completed 10 of 17 passes for 201 yards with an interception. Crompton completed 15 of 26 passes for 235 yards with a touchdown and an interception.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year the band recorded their last album with Richie, Halfway to Sanity. Richie left in August 1987, upset that {{after being in}} the band for five years, the other members would still not give him {{a share of the}} money they made selling T-shirts. Richie was replaced by Clem Burke from Blondie, which was disbanded at the time. According to Johnny, the performances with Burke—who adopted the name Elvis Ramone—were a disaster. He was fired after two performances (August 28 & 29, 1987) because his drumming could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the band. In September, Marky, now clean and sober, returned to the band.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the GameCube {{failed to}} reinvigorate {{flagging}} support from third parties, a trend continued from the Nintendo 64 through its successor, the Wii. The Wii had mostly relied on first-party titles to sell systems until 2009 when in-house development could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> demand for new material. This caused sales to drop and prompted a shift toward more aggressive courting of third-party developers. Despite this, the Wii {{would go on}} {{to become one of the}} most commercially successful home video game consoles of all time. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo has attempted to recruit outside developers early on to avoid a repeat of what happened to the Wii and reclaim the third-party support it enjoyed in the NES and SNES eras, though its success in this regard has been mixed.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the last}} several years, Coliseum existed, though did <b>not</b> really <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{changing}} times. The Nachman's became Hess's, then Proffitt's, then Dillard's, which also opened an auxiliary store in the former Children's Palace. Thalhimers became Hecht's in 1991 and Macy's in 2006.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{he began}} to walk along {{at the foot of}} the precipice, {{examining}} every recess among the rocks, and all the nooks and corners which seemed to promise well, as places of encampment. Malleville could <b>not</b> quite <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him on account of the roughnesses and inequalities of the way.|$|R
5|$|Despite their advances, the Bone Wars {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact {{not only on the}} two scientists but also on their peers and the entire field. The public animosity between Cope and Marsh harmed the reputation of American paleontology in Europe for decades. Furthermore, the reported use of dynamite and sabotage by employees of both men may have destroyed or buried hundreds of potentially critical fossil remains. Joseph Leidy abandoned his more methodical excavations in the West, finding he could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Cope's and Marsh's reckless searching for bones. Leidy also grew tired of the constant squabbling between the two men, with the result that his withdrawal from the field marginalized his own legacy; after his death, Osborn found not a single mention of the man in either of the rivals' works. In their haste to outdo each other, Cope and Marsh haphazardly assembled the bones of their own discoveries. Their descriptions of new species, based on their reconstructions, led to confusion and misconceptions that lasted for decades after their deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservatism}} of the Liberal and Country League did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the expectations}} of a modern-day society. There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more 'green' practices; police powers stood strong, 'no loitering' legislation remained in place; gambling was almost completely restricted. The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly immigrants and their offspring, used to more libertine conditions in their countries of origin. Their homes, usually built by the Housing Trust, sprawled into 'rural' electoral districts that were controlled by the League. Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands; Playford, who did not drink, smoke or gamble, {{had no interest in}} doing so. His own candidates knew that the 1965 election would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge. The economy was still going strong and incomes were still increasing, so the Premier did not change his position on social reform.|$|E
5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover {{rate of more than}} 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E
50|$|Spelling may {{otherwise}} {{represent a}} historical pronunciation; orthography does <b>not</b> necessarily <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> sound {{changes in the}} spoken language. For example, both the k and the digraph gh of English knight were once pronounced, but after {{the loss of their}} sounds, they no longer represent the word's phonemic structure or its pronunciation.|$|R
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will <b>not</b> likely <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|R
60|$|While they spoke, {{they saw}} Leicester and Tressilian {{separate}} {{themselves from the}} crowd, dogged them until they mounted their horses, when the boy, whose speed of foot has been before mentioned, though he could <b>not</b> possibly <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them, yet arrived, as we have seen, soon enough to save Tressilian's life. The boy had just finished his tale {{when they arrived at}} the Gallery-tower.|$|R
5|$|Windle's {{performances}} qualified {{him for the}} 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, {{where he}} was slated to swim four events: the 400m and 1500m freestyle and the 4×100m and 4×200m freestyle relays. Windle's first event was the 4×100m freestyle relay, where he combined with Dickson, Peter Doak, and John Ryan to win Australia's heat {{in a time of}} 3min 40.6s, which lagged behind the United States' winning heat time by 1.8s. Windle anchored the team as Australia came from second at the halfway point to win their heat. The Australians were the second fastest qualifier for the finals. However, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6s in the final, but Australia could only improve their time to 3min 39.1s, leaving them third behind the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second place for the first two legs, until Germany moved into the silver medal position at the last change by 0.1s. A distance swimmer, Windle could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his German anchorman counterpart, and Australia fell 1.9s behind the silver medalists {{by the end of the}} race.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{troops had}} the {{advantage}} of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a pre-set logistics network, but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently. Their largest disadvantage was the successful large-scale UN interdiction effort, as North Korean supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids. This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies, and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for {{the way in which they}} were able to maintain a supply network in the face of a massive bombing campaign. However, the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this, and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads' advantage. North Korean forces, though initially successful, were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense, and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own. This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake; logistics could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> units on the offensive, and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements, reducing their ability to fight effectively. North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon. This landing, coming behind North Korean lines, had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E

25|$|The {{liquidation}} of debt could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the fall}} of prices which it caused.

The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed. This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.|$|E
