5|$|Legendary {{stories of}} pig-faced women {{originated}} roughly simultaneously in Holland, England and France {{in the late}} 1630s. The stories told of a wealthy woman whose body was of <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> appearance, but whose face {{was that of a}} pig.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.|$|E
5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are gone, {{so he has}} to fight as a <b>normal</b> <b>human,</b> using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E

5|$|Gadadevi may be {{depicted}} as a dwarf or as a <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> as in the Sheshashayi Vishnu panel of the Gupta Deogarh temple. She is depicted holding the gada. The motif of Kaumodaki holding the gada is mostly found in Uttar Pradesh and Bengal art. In another variation, Kaumodaki stands besides Vishnu with folded hands (in anjali mudra posture) with the gada depicted on the head {{as part of the}} crown or the weapon mark on her forehead, as in Chola era bronzes of the gada.|$|E
5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E
5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> experiences. He says {{the theory is}} an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests {{there would be no}} need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E

50|$|Wasting Away (which {{has also}} been {{released}} with the title Aaah! Zombies!!) is a 2007 zombie comedy. The events of the plot take place from the zombies' point of view. The film uses color footage to show the action from the zombies {{point of view in}} which they see themselves as <b>normal</b> <b>humans</b> and occasionally switches to black-and-white footage to show the zombies {{from the point of view}} of <b>normal</b> <b>humans.</b>|$|R
5|$|The film, {{independently}} {{produced and}} financed by Hitchcock, {{was shot at}} Revue Studios, the same location as his television show. Psycho was shot on a tight budget of $807,000, beginning on November 11, 1959, and ending on February 1, 1960. Filming started {{in the morning and}} finished by sixp.m. or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at Chasen's). Nearly the whole film was shot with 50mm lenses on 35mm cameras. This trick closely mimicked <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> vision, which helped to further involve the audience.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|E
40|$|Because the cranial {{capacity}} of LB 1 (Homo floresiensis) is only 417 cm 3, some workers propose {{that it represents}} a microcephalic Homo sapiens rather than a new species. This hypothesis is difficult to assess, however, without {{a clear understanding of}} how brain shape of microcephalics compares with that of <b>normal</b> <b>humans.</b> We compare three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstructions of the internal braincases (virtual endocasts that reproduce details of external brain morphology, including cranial capacities and shape) from a sample of 9 microcephalic <b>humans</b> and 10 <b>normal</b> <b>humans.</b> Discriminant and canonical analyses are used to identify two variables that classify <b>normal</b> and microcephalic <b>humans</b> with 100 % success. The classification functions classify the virtual endocast from LB 1 with <b>normal</b> <b>humans</b> rather than microcephalics. On the other hand, our classification functions classify a pathological H. sapiens specimen that, like LB 1, represents an ≈ 3 -foot-tall adult female and an adult Basuto microcephalic woman that is alleged to have an endocast similar to LB 1 's with the microcephalic humans. Although microcephaly is genetically and clinically variable, virtual endocasts from our highly heterogeneous sample share similarities in protruding and proportionately large cerebella and relatively narrow, flattened orbital surfaces compared with <b>normal</b> <b>humans.</b> These findings have relevance for hypotheses regarding the genetic substrates of hominin brain evolution and may have medical diagnostic value. Despite LB 1 's having brain shape features that sort it with <b>normal</b> <b>humans</b> rather than microcephalics, other shape features and its small brain size are consistent with its assignment to a separate species...|$|R

5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|In the novels, Dexter {{initially}} considers Rita {{little more}} than part of his disguise as a <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> being, and the perfect cover for his secret life as a serial killer. He later admits to growing quite fond of Rita, whom he married in the third book, Dexter in the Dark. In the television series, Rita is portrayed as a loving and caring mother who is emotionally damaged due to physical abuse by her former husband, Paul Bennett. Rita {{is the mother of}} Astor Bennett (Christina Robinson) and Cody Bennett (Preston Bailey), and later in the television series, gives birth to Dexter's son, Harrison. In the book series, she and Dexter have a daughter, Lily Anne.|$|E
5|$|In the series, Clark Kent {{attempts}} {{to live the}} life of a <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them {{at the start of the}} show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2002, Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's book, Smallville: Dragon, {{which had}} Clark being hypnotized {{into believing that}} he was a <b>normal,</b> <b>human</b> teenager, with no abilities. Little's Flight featured Clark trying to lend emotional support to a young girl who has full-sized wings. The next Aspect novel, Hauntings, followed Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in one of Smallville's haunted houses. Animal Rage followed Clark as he tries to stop an animal rights activist when she tries to hurt the people harming animals in Smallville. Aspect brought in Dean Wesley Smith for their next novel, Whodunit, which involved Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigating the murder of a boy and his sister.|$|E

5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} {{in a state of}} shock. Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt sorry for him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake chase The Lich through a {{dimensional}} portal where they meet Prismo, a wish granter, who tells them that the Lich wished for the extinction of all life. This leads Finn to wish that the Lich had never existed. Finn is then transported to an alternate timeline, {{where he is a}} <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> living with his family and his dog, Jake, on a farm. In the alternate reality, Finn discovers a magical ice crown, which he attempts to use to repay his family's debt. After placing it on his head, he is magically imbued with power over ice and snow. Prismo tells Jake that if he can change The Lich's original wish, everything will go back to normal. Jake—with help from Prismo—eventually wishes that the Lich had actually desired for Finn and Jake to return home. Thus, the world is righted again.|$|E
