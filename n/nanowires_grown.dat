50|$|The vapor-liquid-solid method (VLS) is a {{mechanism}} {{for the growth of}} one-dimensional structures, such as nanowires, from chemical vapor deposition. The growth of a crystal through direct adsorption of a gas phase on to a solid surface is generally very slow. The VLS mechanism circumvents this by introducing a catalytic liquid alloy phase which can rapidly adsorb a vapor to supersaturation levels, and from which crystal growth can subsequently occur from nucleated seeds at the liquid-solid interface. The physical characteristics of <b>nanowires</b> <b>grown</b> in this manner depend, in a controllable way, upon the size and physical properties of the liquid alloy.|$|E
30|$|In addition, when {{comparing}} the size distributions of GaSb <b>nanowires</b> <b>grown</b> at 500 and 520  °C, the GaSb <b>nanowires</b> <b>grown</b> at 500  °C (blue dots in Fig.  3; average diameter and length ∼ 206 and ~ 330 nm) are observed {{to have both}} a larger diameter and length than the GaSb <b>nanowires</b> <b>grown</b> at 520 °C (red dots in Fig. 3; average diameter and length ∼ 168 and ~ 275 nm). The thinner <b>nanowires</b> <b>grown</b> at 520 °C {{can be attributed to}} the slower radial growth rate of GaSb at higher growth temperature. However, for the axial growth, other than the Gibbs-Thomson effect, the increase in the growth temperature can also reduce the droplet supersaturation and further reduce the axial growth rate of the GaSb nanowires [29, 37]. Thus, the GaSb <b>nanowires</b> <b>grown</b> at 500  °C are larger in both diameter and length than the GaSb <b>nanowires</b> <b>grown</b> at 520  °C.|$|E

30|$|In conclusions, {{growth of}} β-Ga 2 O 3 {{nanowires}} with different diameters has been explored under various experimental conditions using CVD technique. Diameter of β-Ga 2 O 3 <b>nanowire</b> <b>grown</b> by catalyst alloy-mediated root growth can be tuned by adjusting growth conditions. The separation distance between metal source and substrate controls the nanowire diameter {{on the basis}} of boundary layer thickness and reactant vapor species. Nanowire diameter decreases with increase in the separation distance. Higher gas flow rate induces larger diameter; however, nanowire morphology gets deteriorated. Diameter of nanowires depends on growth temperature and catalyst nanoparticles size. Diameter of <b>nanowire</b> <b>grown</b> at higher temperature (850 – 900  °C) does not depend on catalyst nanoparticle size. The smaller diameter of nanowire (< 50  nm) can be obtained using lower growth temperature (800  °C) and smaller catalyst nanoparticles size (20  nm). Ga 2 O 3 nanowires exhibit β-phase with monoclinic crystal structure. XRD and Raman measurements indicate the changes in structural strain with nanowire diameter. Band-gap of these nanowires depends on its diameter, and it increases from 4.70 to 4.80  eV with decrease in nanowire diameter from several hundreds of nanometers to few hundreds of nanometers.|$|R
