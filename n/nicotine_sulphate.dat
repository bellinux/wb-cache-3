40|$|Losses of bees by {{poisoning}} {{have been}} greatly increased {{in recent years}} by the growing practice of applying insecticidal and fungicidal sprays to fruit trees. Preliminary laboratory tests showed that, of the common constituents of spray mixtures, only lead arsenate and flowers of sulphur were likely to cause serious honeybee poisoning, though Derris emulsion may cause slight poisoning. Syrup containing lime sulphur, <b>nicotine</b> <b>sulphate,</b> or copper sulphate was strongly repellent to the bees. It seemed possible that spray mixtures might be made repellent to the honeybee by the addition of suitable substances. Further trials showed that lead arsenate solution, at least in the concentrations normally used, was no more attractive to the bee than distilled water. Concentrations of 1 / 500 lime sulphur or 1 / 2000 <b>nicotine</b> <b>sulphate</b> were sufficient to reduce the uptake of M/ 1 sucrose to less than 10 % of that of unadulterated sucrose solution, and very much lower concentrations appreciably affected the uptake. The presence of lead arsenate in these solutions seemed to make them even more repellent. The repellent effect was reduced, though not entirely destroyed, when the solutions were evaporated to dryness and taken up in distilled water again. Creosote (0. 13 %), which has been suggested as a possible repellent, gave erratic results under laboratory conditions, and, in view of the danger of phytocidal action it is probably unwise to attempt to use its repellent property. Open flowers of apple trees were sprayed with various spray mixtures in an orchard experiment, and counts of bees showed both lime sulphur (1 %) and <b>nicotine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (0. 05 % nicotine) to have retained their repellent value for at least 7 days, in spite of heavy rain. If bees can thus be deterred from visiting the open blossom, {{it should be possible to}} deter them even more thoroughly from collection of water contaminated by sprays applied at the correct time. Data collected throughout the country during the last 3 years show calcium or lead arsenate to be the constituent of orchard sprays causing honeybee poisoning. Bees may collect arsenic when visiting fruit trees, or plants growing beneath or near the trees, for pollen or water, contaminated water apparently being the chief cause of poisoning; about 0. 00005 mg. internal arsenic per bee has been found to be a lethal dose. When arsenical sprays alone are applied to trees, particularly if to the open blossom as is sometimes the case with gooseberries and cherries, severe poisoning from the pollen may be expected. On the other hand, much of the danger from contaminated water should be removed by the incorporation of lime sulphur (1 % or more) or <b>nicotine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (0. 05 % nicotine) into sprays intended for application either before flowering or after petal fall, provided that alternative sources of water are available for foraging bees. Provision of water within the hive is suggested as a further safeguard...|$|E

There was no clearly demonstrated superiority of one method over the other. An analysis of variance performed on observed mortalities expressed as angles of equal information indicated that increasing age of flies, increasing numbers of flies per cage, longer delays between filling of the cages and spraying, and increased proportions of males in the samples, raised observed mortalities significantly. The type of cloth used to cover the cages must be standardized. Data on fly ages and numbers of flies per cage were also put through the probit analysis of Bliss which indicated flies aged 5 days to be most susceptible and fly numbers to affect equally the mortalities due to all concentrations...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the potential use of nicotine in controlling water polluted by leeches. The <b>nicotine</b> and copper <b>sulphate</b> LC 50 values were also determined following 30 min exposure. The anti parasitic effect of nicotine was also {{compared with that}} of copper sulphate as positive control. The anti-leech effect of nicotine was evaluated against Limnatis nilotica in which the number of dead and alive leeches in each utensil was counted for 30 min. The positive control group was copper sulphate and the negative control was distilled water. Our data showed that the LD 50 value for nicotine was 6 / 10 (3) ppm with mean death time of 1. 25 +/- 0. 45 min while the LD 50 value for copper sulphate was 637 / 10 (2) ppm with a mean death time of 12. 00 +/- 3. 69 min. Based on the obtained results nicotine is highly effective on leeches and might be used for disinfection purposes...|$|R
60|$|The several {{substances}} {{mentioned in}} this chapter affect the colour of the glands very differently. These often become dark at first, and then very pale or white, as was conspicuously the case with glands subjected to the poison of the cobra and citrate of strychnine. In other cases they are from the first rendered white, as with leaves placed in hot water and several acids; and this, I presume, {{is the result of}} the coagulation of the albumen. On the same leaf some glands become white and others dark-coloured, as occurred with leaves in a solution of the sulphate of quinine, and in the vapour of alcohol. Prolonged immersion in nicotine, curare, and even water, blackens the glands; and this, I believe, is due to the aggregation of the protoplasm within their cells. Yet curare caused very little aggregation in the cells of the tentacles, whereas <b>nicotine</b> and <b>sulphate</b> of quinine induced strongly marked aggregation down their bases. The aggregated masses in leaves which had been immersed for 3 hrs. 15 m. in a saturated solution of sulphate of quinine exhibited incessant [page 226] changes of form, but after 24 hrs. were motionless; the leaf being flaccid and apparently dead. On the other hand, with leaves subjected for 48 hrs. to a strong solution of the poison of the cobra, the protoplasmic masses were unusually active, whilst with the higher animals the vibratile cilia and white corpuscles of the blood seem to be quickly paralysed by this substance.|$|R

40|$|Any {{material}} used {{in combination}} with nicotine to produce a more effective kill than would be otherwise obtained by using nicotine alone, may be termed an adjuvant of the nicotine. The adjuvant {{may or may not}} have toxic qualities in itself, depending on such factors as the species of insect concerned and the meteorological conditions at the time of application. The effect which an adjuvant has upon nicotine may be due to either physical or chemical factors but more probably to a combination of both. Physically, the adjuvant may bring about more effective spreading and sticking, with greater ability to withstand cranging climatic conditions. The adjuvant may also produce a smothering effect. Chemically, as an "activator", it may hasten the evolution of free nicotine by the reaction of the basic and acidic radicals of the soap and <b>nicotine</b> <b>sulphate.</b> An adjuvant may also act chemically by producing an affinity between itself and the surface of the solid, through chemical combination with contaminants on the surface or by dissolving protective coatings, such as wax.

40|$|For several decades, {{control of}} fruit fly pests in Australia has {{depended}} {{to a large}} degree on dimethoate, a broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide that has been widely used on many different crops as well as on ornamental plants. However, many dimethoate use patterns were withdrawn in 2011 following a review by regulatory authorities. This manuscript places dimethoate in context as {{the latest in a long}} line of pre-harvest pesticides such as the arsenics, tartar emetic, sodium fluosilicate, <b>nicotine</b> <b>sulphate,</b> the organochlorines, and organophosphates, that have been lost from the fruit fly control toolkit over the past century. The succession of postharvest treatments such as fumigants, dips and sprays is also examined. Dimethoate and fenthion have offered relatively easy and cost effective pest control solutions since the 1960 s, but in the absence of equivalent alternatives it is now necessary to develop "systems approaches" based on multiple control strategies and risk assessment. Such approaches represent a fundamental shift in pest management strategy, and will require improved understanding of fruit fly biology to prevent infestation in the field, combined with postharvest surveillance and non-chemical treatments. Some options are briefly discussed. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nicotine}} on {{the activity of}} different dehydrogenases in frontoparietal regions and subcortical nuclei of the rat brain have been studied using histochemical methods. <b>Nicotine</b> <b>sulphate</b> was intraperitoneally administered in acute (4 mg/kg/day × 3 days) or chronic (ALZET osmotic pump providing 2 mg/kg/day × 15 days) doses. The enzymes analyzed were glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate, lactate, malate and succinate dehydrogenases (gly 3 PDH, LDH, MDH, and SDH, respectively). The results demonstrate that chronic as well as acute administration of nicotine produced strong increases in all these enzymatic activities in the superior layers (I, II and III) of the frontoparietal cortex (cingulate, motor and somatosensory regions); but high increases were not seen in the deeper layers of the cortex or in the subcortical nuclei (substantia nigra, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens or nucleus basalis magnocellularis). These hyperactivities were produced in brain regions with normally low enzymatic activity (cortex), but not in those with great intensity (subcortical nuclei). The results are in rough agreement with previous reports on nicotine-induced increases in glucose utilization, gly 3 PDH genic expression and neuronal hyperactivity in the brain cortex; but significant discrepancies between the cortical enzymatic maps and those obtained both in these studies and others on nicotine(N) -receptor localization have been appreciated. The results {{support the hypothesis that}} nicotinic cholinergic drugs can have metabolic, long-lasting stimulant effects on cortical neurons at specific points (probably layer III pyramidal cells and structures with α 7 -N-receptors) of the cortical circuits that could be of great interest in improving altered cognitive functions that are present in Alzheimer disease, as well as in other less severe mental disturbances. Mitochondrial hyperfunction should also be evaluated as a possible side-effect (as an oxidative stress inductor) of these kinds of drugs. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Since my {{discovery}} of a Kyushu race of Anicetus ceroplastis in 1946, {{a large number of}} this parasite have been liberated in various orchards of Japan, especially in Honshu and Shikoku, for the control of Ceroplastes rubens Maskell, a serious pest of Citrus, persimmon and tea plant, during the period from 1948 to 1952. My field observations covering four years in nine districts reveal that in all districts the parasite has becoming numerous year after year and definite commercial control of the scale was achieved in some orchards, {{in the vicinity of the}} colonization points, within three or four host generations after release. Thus Anicetus ceroplastis may be regarded as belonging to the so-called 2 ̆ 2 effective parasite 2 ̆ 2 of Clausen 2 ̆ 7 s thesis (1951). The thesis developed by Clausen is well summarized in Thompson 2 ̆ 7 s work (1951) on the same problem, ? 2 ̆ 2 Any introduced parasite or predator that is destined to produce full commercial control will do so within three generations or at most within three years. If it does not produce full commercial control within this period, it is safe to say that it will never do so. Species that prove ineffective after three generations or three years from the period of introduction should therefore be dropped and efforts directed toward the introduction of other species. 2 ̆ 2 As criticised by Thompson, there remain some difficulties in accepting Clausen 2 ̆ 7 s view in toto, although it contains much food for thought for workers in the field of biological control. The time factor in controlling Ceroplastes rubens by Anicetus ceroplastis was considered in my previous paper (1953). As indicated in my time table, full commercial control will occur much earlier by colonizing as many parasites as possible. In other word the greater the initial proportions of hosts, the more time will be required in producing definite commercial control by the use of parasites. For example, it would require 4. 5 generations for a colony of 10 female parasites to overtake and exterminate 10, 000, 000, 000 hosts, when the reproduction rate of the parasite is 100 times that of the host, while hosts would be exterminated within three years by the initial liberation of 10, 000 parasites. Nevertheless, it is highly interesting that the case of Anicetus ceroplastis coincides the view advanced by Clausen. During the period from 1948 to 1950 total of about 500 adult females of this parasite have been liberated against the scales in three different orchards of Tsukumi City, Oita Prefecture (See the accompanying map, A, B, C). The populations of the scale has decreased year after year making a remarkable contrast to the excessive increase of the populations of its parasite. By the middle of August, 1951, it had become evident that the parasites were far more numerous and effective than they had been in preceding years. By the middle of April, 1952, the destruction by this parasite had attained such proportions that in many location s of Tsukumi one had to search carefully to find a live scale. In this connection it is interesting to note that the cost. of resin wash used for the control of the scales in the city has also been decreased year after year, viz. 900, 000 yen in 1949, 420, 000 yen in 1950, 300, 000 yen in 1951 and finally 30, 000 yen in 1952. In the vicinity of the colonization points definite commercial control was achieved within three host generations after release, and in 1952 only a small quantity of resin wash was sprayed in several restricted orchards around Tsukumi City. In some orchards of Shizuoka, Aichi, Hiroshima and Yamaguchi Prefectures nearly full commercial control was achieved within three years after release. My field research in 1952 in various orchards confirmed our previous observation (1949) that the plants having much denser branches and foliage in a unit space and densely covered by the sooty mold fungus seemed to have afforded an unfavourable environment to this parasite. In some locations where this parasite released the degree of parasitization was very low. This phenomenon may be attributed to the unfavourable environment mentioned above. My three years 2 ̆ 7 observation in Tsukutni district shows that the application of such chemicals as resin wash, <b>nicotine</b> <b>sulphate</b> or lime sulphur does not affect the populations of the parasite so heavily as having been considered. On the basis of such experiences given above, it is recommended to spray the plants in order to reduce the scale populations as many as possible and to wash off the sooty mold fungus from the surface of the plants and further to perform adequate thinning of much denser branches (wide planting is favourable) previous to the liberation of this parasite. Thus it is my opinion that the liberation of this parasite together with an adequate application of common chemicals which have been sprayed by growers may accelerate the complete commercial control of this scale. The female of this parasite seemes to be somewhat sluggish in behaviour, but observations in 1952 in Oshima district, Yamaguchi Prefecture, indicate that populations of this parasite may disperse a distance of 2, 000 meters within two years. Field observations covering four years reveal that in no case the liberated parasites failed to establish themselves in new habitat in Honshu and Shikoku. At the liberation of the parasite of the first generation such treatment as the acceleration of the emergence of the parasite by stimulating its pupae by higher temperature or the retardation of the emergence by preserving its pupae in cold place is entirely unnecessary except some special cases. From my observations and experiments carried on since 1946, it has become safe to announce that Anicetus ceroplastis Ishii is an effective parasite of Ceroplastes rubens Maskell and an attempt to colonize this parasite in orchards where the damage by this scale is very severe is not only desirable but also an urgent need. 1. ルビーアカヤドリコバチはルビーロウムシ駆除用の天敵として極めて有力なものであることが確められた. 2. 私が調査した 9 地方の放飼例は, 何れも放飼後 3 年以内に顕薯な効果を示しているので, 本寄生蜂はClausenの言う所謂有力天敵の範疇に入れられる. 3. 従つてルビーアカヤドリコバチを本州及び四国のルビーロウムシ猖蹶地帯に移入し放飼することが望ましい. 4. 本寄生蜂を放飼する前に, 予め松脂合剤を使つて園のルビーロウムシの棲息密度を減少させ, 煤を清め, 更に枝葉の繁茂状態を適当に保つておくことは, 本寄生蜂利用上に好結果を齎すものと思われる. 5. 従来相橘園に使用されて来た各種農薬は柑橘園では本寄生蜂にあまり悪い影響を与えない. 寧ろ適当に薬剤と天敵とを共用することによつて, より早くルビーロウムシが駆除され, 薬剤不要の時代が来るであろう. 6. 第 1 化期の蜂の放飼に当つては, 特別な場合を除いて, 蜂の蛹の高温又は低温処理による羽化の促進叉は遅延の必要を認めない...|$|E
