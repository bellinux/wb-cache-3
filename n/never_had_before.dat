Television columnist Ray Richmond {{wrote that the}} episode was a cultural milestone for The Simpsons and that the [...] "issue [...] was mainstream to some degree, but now that [...] deigned it worthy of the show it is interwoven into the popular culture. The Simpsons bestowed upon something a pop culture status it <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>before,</b> simply by being ripe for a joke."

500|$|Wilson's [...] "penchant for festivities" [...] is {{also well}} documented. Biographer Clifton Blue Parker {{described}} him as [...] "... the Roaring '20s epitome of a baseball player, primed for an age of American excess ... {{at a time when}} baseball was America's favorite sport." [...] His love of drinking and partying did not endear him to Cubs owner William Wrigley, who abhorred alcohol consumption. (Wilson always insisted that he never played drunk; [...] "hung over, yes; drunk, no.") [...] Manager Joe McCarthy worked hard to shield Wilson from Wrigley, and to keep him on an even keel. [...] "Better than any other manager", wrote sportswriter Frank Graham, [...] "Joe understood Hack, made allowances for him when he failed, and rewarded him with praise when he did well. Joe could be strict and stern with his players ... but he never was with Hack, and Hack repaid him by playing as he <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>before,</b> nor would again." ...|$|E

When she threatens {{to go back to}} Spain he realises it's not what he wants and he stops her. He decides to man up and be a dad to his kids". A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>before.</b> Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne accepts the money and leaves, taking Francine and Jack with her and leaving Darren heartbroken.|$|E
500|$|According to his mother, {{during the}} summer prior to his 1997 junior year, Streets {{dedicated}} himself to weight training like he <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>before</b> {{in an effort to}} end a Rose Bowl draught that made the 1997 Wolverines the first since the 1969 team to have no Rose Bowl veterans. [...] Although Streets and Russell Shaw were the starting receivers, it was understood that Charles Woodson, who was {{regarded as one of the}} most versatile athletes in college football, was expected to play on offense that season. However, it was not clear whether Dreisbach, Brady or Griese would quarterback the team. Griese was named starter shortly before the season opener. [...] It was believed that a solid season by any of the quarterbacks could lead to a productive season by Streets and the receivers. Streets' first touchdown of the season was a 41-yard game-tying catch from Griese in a 21–14 September 27 victory in the rivalry game against Notre Dame. [...] During the season, Streets dislocated both thumbs, with the second injury occurring in the November 1 Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota. [...] Streets caught no passes against either Minnesota or Penn State the following week. [...] His production drought was notable and he recovered on November 15 with five catches for 108yards including a 38-yard touchdown from Griese on November 15 against Wisconsin. [...] Although the injury-hampered Streets went without a catch in three of the last four regular season games he caught touchdown passes of 53 and 58 yards and drew a key pass interference penalty in the 1998 Rose Bowl. [...] The Rose Bowl performance was Streets' season-high with 127 receiving yards and two touchdowns. [...] It helped solidify Michigan's case as the Bowl Alliance national champion.|$|E

[...] The Tribune singled out Magidsohn for particular attention:"Michigan's remarkable offense was built about a half back who earned a place in football's hall of fame by his work today. [...] His name is Magidsohn, and it long will be remembered at Penn. [...] Magidsohn was irresistible on the offense, tearing great holes in the Quaker defense and scoring both touchdowns. [...] In addition, he tackled fiercely and spoiled Penn's best efforts at the forward pass." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Union troops {{securing}} the northern counties of western Virginia against Confederate defenders a Unionist government in Wheeling, called The Restored Government of Virginia, passed an ordinance {{for the creation}} of a new state from the western counties of Virginia. The voters who approved the ordinance on October 24, 1861 also elected members to a convention to write the constitution for the new state. The Constitutional Convention met in Wheeling on November 26, 1861 with 61 members. One of the issues facing them was slavery. Most were hoping that the Federal government would grant statehood without an emancipation clause to the constitution. Although some native Virginians, such as Methodist minister Robert Hagar, favored gradual emancipation, much of the agitation for it came from the non-native delegates such as Gordon Battelle, William E. Stevenson, and Granville Parker. When Gordon Battelle proposed his emancipation clause Granville Parker recalled [...] " [...] I discovered on that occasion as I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>before,</b> the mysterious and over-powering influence 'the peculiar institution' had on men otherwise sane and reliable. Why, when Mr. Battelle submitted his resolutions, a kind of tremor—a holy horror, was visible throughout the house." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Constitutional Convention on December 14, 1861, {{the issue}} of slavery was raised by Rev. Gordon Battelle, an Ohio native who sought to {{introduce}} a resolution for gradual emancipation. Granville Parker, originally from Massachusetts {{and a member of}} the convention, described the scene – [...] "I discovered on that occasion as I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>before,</b> the mysterious and over-powering influence 'the peculiar institution' had on men otherwise sane and reliable. Why, when Mr. Battelle submitted his resolutions, a kind of tremor – a holy horror, was visible throughout the house!" [...] Instead of Rev. Battelle's resolution a policy of [...] "Negro exclusion" [...] for the new state was adopted to keep any new slaves, or freemen, from taking up residence, in the hope that this would satisfy abolitionist sentiment in Congress. When the statehood bill reached Congress, however, the lack of an emancipation clause prompted opposition from Senator Charles Sumner and Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio. A compromise was reached known as the Willey Amendment which was approved by Unionist voters in the state on March 26, 1863. It called for the gradual emancipation of slaves based on age after July 4, 1863. Slavery was officially abolished by West Virginia on February 3, 1865. To note, it took the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution accomplished on December 6, 1865, to abolish slavery nationwide.|$|E
