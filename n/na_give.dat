40|$|Purpose of the Study: Middle-aged {{adults are}} {{often called upon}} to support aging parents. However, {{providing}} support to an aging parent with health problems and disability may be a stressful experience. This study asked whether giving everyday support to parents in the context of health problems and disability has implications for middle-aged children’s diurnal cortisol and daily mood. Design and Methods: During four consecutive days, 148 middle-aged adults (mean age = 55) reported the support they gave to their parents and provided saliva 4 times a day (wake, 30 min post-wake, lunchtime, and bedtime). Multilevel models estimated within-person differences in positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), cortisol awakening response and area under the curve with respect to ground (AUC-G) as a function of giving same-day and previous-day support. We examined whether these associations are exacerbated when a parent has health problems or activities of daily living (ADL) needs. Results: Middle-aged children had significantly higher next-day AUC-G on days after they gave support to parents with ADL needs. When participants gave support to parents with ADL needs, they had significantly greater same-day PA and lower next-day <b>NA.</b> <b>Giving</b> support to parents with health problems was associated with significantly higher next-day <b>NA.</b> Implications: <b>Giving</b> support to parents is an ambiguous experience with implications for biological stress and daily mood. A biopsychosocial approach reveals under what conditions giving support to parents may become detrimental to health and well-being; this knowledge is essential for {{the development and implementation of}} interventions...|$|R

40|$|A {{familiar}} construction for a Boolean algebra A is {{its normal}} completion <b>NA,</b> <b>given</b> by its normal ideals or, equivalently, the intersections of its principal ideals, {{together with the}} embedding A → NA taking each element of A to its principal ideal. In the classical setting of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with Choice, NA is characterized in various ways; thus, it is the unique complete extension of A in which the image of A is join-dense, the unique essential completion of A, and the injective hull of A. Here, {{we are interested in}} characterizing the normal completion in the constructive context of an arbitrary topos. We show among other things that it is, even at this level, the unique join-dense, or alternatively, essential completion. En route, we investigate the functorial properties of NA and establish that it is the re 8 ection of A, in the category of Boolean homomorphisms which preserve all existing joins, to the complete Boolean algebras. In this context, we make crucial use of the notion of a skeletal frame homomorphism...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{alloying}} elements in aluminum on diffusion behavior was investigated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) under {{the effect of}} electromigration wind force. The electromigration wind force was computed based on a theory using the pseudopotential formalism of the elements, where {{it depends on the}} type and distribution of the imperfections in the lattice. It was found that the electromigration force on the impurity depends on the scattering power of the atom, which is related to the chemical valence. Elements like Cu, Li and <b>Na</b> <b>gave</b> low values, but the incorporation of such forces into molecular dynamics simulations underline the importance of the electromigration force distribution on the host aluminum atoms. In this regard, in NEMD formalism, we calculated the atomic jump frequency of aluminum atoms in alloys containing different impurity elements like Cu, Mg, Mn, Na, Sn and Ti. It was found that the electromigra-tion diffusion process slowed down considerably, compared to pure Al, in alloys containing elements having a softer Al-M pair potential, namely Cu, Mn and Sn...|$|R

In-depth interviews focusing on the NAs experiences of caring for older people in pain were conducted. This study provided an understanding of the care needs of older residents in pain and illuminated the role of NAs in the pain management process. The central role that NAs play in RACFs was highlighted, as were the responsibilities associated with pain management. Nursing assistants may be responsible for initiating and implementing pain management treatments for older residents.

40|$|Aggregates {{of heart}} cells from chicken embryos beat spontaneously. We used {{intracellular}} microelectrodes {{to record the}} periodic behavior of the membrane potential that triggers the contractions. Every 5 - 12 beats, a short current pulse was applied at various points in the cycle to study the phase-dependent resetting of the rhythm. Pulses stronger than 2. 5 nA caused the final rhythm to be reset to almost the same point in the cycle regardless of the phase at which the pulse was applied (type zero resetting). Pulses of {{less than or equal}} to 1 nA only caused a slight change of the phase. Increasing current intensities to between 1 and 2. 5 <b>nA</b> <b>gave</b> rise to an increasing steepness in a small part of the phase-response curve. The observation of type zero resetting implies the existence of a critical stimulation that might annihilate the rhythm. Although we did find a phase at which more or less random responses occurred, the longest pause in the rhythm was 758 ms, 2. 4 times the spontaneous interval. This suggests that the resting membrane potential was unstable, at least against the internal noise of the system.

Such an exposition of the problem seems interesting from at least one point of view: a possibility of analysing the effect of various historical events, related closely to the defined time span, on the length of real birth intervals. Such historical events are war, economic crisis, epidemic of pest, new regulation of abortion. All those events can prolong or shorten the type 1 and 2 intervals in the succeeding calendar years. Currently, frome one year to another, only the type 1 intervals can be traced, while the calculation of the type 2 intervals takes theoretically approximately 30 years, untili the youngest of generations will complete its period of fertility. In practice that period can be substantially shortened. Those problems are not encountered in relation to the deceased populations reconstructed on the grounds of parish registers.
