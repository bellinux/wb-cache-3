No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on {{missions to}} the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1974, the Army decided to {{implement}} one of {{the recommendations of the}} Howze Board and created an air cavalry combat brigade. The assets of the 2d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division were used to create the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat). The new brigade was assigned to the III Corps as a corps asset. 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, was transferred to the new brigade on 21 February 1975. The brigade served as a test bed for <b>new</b> <b>concepts</b> involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield. In 1985-85, the brigade consisted of 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry; 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (4-9 CAV); and 5th and 7th Squadrons, 17th Cavalry Regiment (5-17 CAV and 7-17 CAV), all flying attack helicopters.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{staff from}} previous Metroid games – including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Super Metroid {{over the course}} of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features <b>new</b> <b>concepts</b> to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions.|$|E

The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because {{of a number of}} sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now {{among the highest in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2 is {{a science}} fiction first-person shooter game and the sequel to Half-Life. While {{remaining}} similar in style to the original, Half-Life 2 introduces <b>new</b> <b>concepts</b> to the series such as physics-based puzzles and vehicle sections. The game {{takes place in the}} fictional City 17 and surrounding areas as the player takes on the role of scientist Gordon Freeman. Freeman is thrust into a dystopian environment in which the aftermath of the events of Half-Life have come to bear fully upon human society, and he is forced to fight against increasingly unfavorable odds in order to survive. In his struggle, he is joined by various acquaintances, including former Black Mesa colleagues, oppressed citizens of City 17, and the Vortigaunts, all of whom later prove to be valuable allies. Half-Life 2 received critical acclaim, including 35 Game of the Year awards, when it was originally released for Windows in 2004. As of December 3, 2008, over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 have been sold at retail. Although Steam sales figures are unknown, their rate surpassed retail's in mid-2008 and they are significantly more profitable per-unit.|$|E

Linguistic purism is strongly supported in Iceland {{in an attempt}} to prevent loanwords from entering the language. Instead, neologisms are coined from Icelandic roots, creating a compound word to describe <b>new</b> <b>concepts.</b> It is often the case that old words which are no longer used are recycled with a new meaning. It should be noted, however, that some loanwords persist in Icelandic, and many more, the majority anglicisms, are used in everyday speech.|$|E
