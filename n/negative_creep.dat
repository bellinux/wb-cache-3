40|$|In {{the present}} study a simple model is {{proposed}} to assess creep behavior. The model is applied to experimental results performed on austenitic steel X 8 CrNiMoNb 16 16. The model {{is based on a}} modification of the Levy-Mises equation for plasticity to consider creep time effects, introducing as a parameter the intrinsic creep resistance. The assessment of creep behavior applied for monotonic and two stages loading data is good. The model could assess <b>negative</b> <b>creep</b> strain rates as well as damage accumulation observed as an increase of the minimum creep rate after each reloading at the same stress level in two stages tests...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} a decade now, Nigeria has been {{witnessing}} a continuous improvement and boom in the application of Information and Communications Technology in all the vital sectors of her economy. There is an increasing dependency on computer programs for critical infrastructures, business processes and operations. This boom is not abating, and is resulting in a corresponding {{increase in the number of}} companies and individuals who join an increasing population of software engineers, enterprise application developers and programmers. But regrettably, the boom has given rise to a host of ethical issues. The ability to make sound ethical judgement and decision is becoming very important as “half-baked ” software developers produce critical software that are supposed to run critical business functions and operations. To compound this problem the few technical schools or colleges that produce the very needed programmers and web designers do not have a clue that there is something <b>negative</b> <b>creeping</b> in from another angle; they do not have qualified or versed instructors to arm their graduates with the basic foundation knowledge in software professional ethics which is needed to effectively practise the art of software engineering in the society at large. This paper investigates the state of software engineering ethics in the face of Nigeria’s upwelling Information and Communications Technology and intention to produce and use locally designed and implemented software. The paper calls attention to the nonchalance, dispassion and mass negligence attendant to this issue. It further highlights and calls for adherence to sound ethics at all levels of software production in the Nigerian society at large. The paper uses a case-study and scenario to illustrate how to start doing so...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} filler loading and {{immersion}} in {{water on the}} creep/ recovery behavior of composites made fromMDF (medium density fiberboard) flour (as natural fiber) and recycled HDPE (high density polyethylene) (as resin) were studied (at 60, 70, and 80 % by weight fiber loadings). Nominal density and dimensions of the manufactured panels were 1 g/cm 3 and 35 35 1 cm 3, respectively. Maximum values of flexural modulus and strength of panels were obtained at 70 and 60 % fiber content, respectively. The creep strain decreased as the lignocellulosic flour level increased. Water absorption has <b>negative</b> effect on <b>creep</b> behavior of MDF flour/HDPE composites. For all filler contents, {{it can be seen}} that the creep strain increases when the immersion time increases. This is believed to occur as a result of the cumulative effect of absorbed water on fiber matrix debonding and easier relaxation of the molecules at higher moisture contents leading to larger deformations at longer times...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{clarify the}} wood {{properties}} and chemical composition of branches of Viburnum odoratissimum produced by unusual eccentric growth, we investigated growth strain (GS), basic density (Db), microfibril angle (MFA), elastic moduli (EL and EL/Db), creep deformation, cellulose crystalline features, and lignin structure in {{upper and lower}} sides of the branches, and considered the correlations among these factors. In most measuring positions, the distribution of GS showed that higher tensile GS was in the upper side and compressive GS was in the lower side of the branch, which combines GS features of reaction wood. However, the generation of GS in the lower side was different from that in compression wood, because EL/Db and MFA had a <b>negative</b> correlation. The <b>creep</b> compliance curves show that the upper-side wood had low rigidity and high viscosity, whereas the lower-side wood had large rigidity and low viscosity. Relative <b>creep</b> had a <b>negative</b> relation with MFA in the upper side, which is unusual. The cellulose crystalline features showed no obvious difference between {{both sides of the}} branch; however, the lignin with less b-O- 4 proportion and less S units but more G units seemed to exist in the lower side because of a decreased syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) molar ratio. This suggests that cell wall could be reinforced by lignin resulting in lower viscosity in the lower side of the branch. Additionally, the S/G ratio showed a relatively high correlation with GS in the lower side. These results suggest that lignin structure {{plays an important role in}} adapting to environmental changes during eccentric growth for V. odoratissimum...|$|R
40|$|Compression creep {{tests were}} {{performed}} on the ternary 91. 84 Sn- 3. 33 Ag- 4. 83 Bi (wt. %, abbreviated Sn-Ag-Bi) Pb-free alloy. The test temperatures were: &# 8722; 25 &# 176;C, 25 &# 176;C, 75 &# 176;C, 125 &# 176;C, and 160 &# 176;C (&# 177; 0. 5 &# 176;C). Four loads were used at the two lowest temperatures and five at the higher temperatures. The specimens were tested in the as-fabricated condition or after having been subjected {{to one of two}} air aging conditions: 24 hours at either 125 &# 176;C or 150 &# 176;C. The strain-time curves exhibited frequent occurrences of <b>negative</b> <b>creep</b> and small-scale fluctuations, particularly at the slower strain rates, that were indicative of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) activity. The source of tertiary creep behavior at faster strain rates was likely to also be DRX rather than a damage accumulation mechanism. Overall, the strain-time curves did not display a consistent trend that could be directly attributed to the aging condition. The sinh law equation satisfactorily represented the minimum strain rate as a function of stress and temperature so as to investigate the deformation rate kinetics: d&# 949;/dtmin = Asinhn (&# 945;&# 963;) exp (&# 8722;&# 916;H/RT). The values of &# 945;, n, and &# 160;&# 916;H were in the following ranges (&# 177; 95 % confidence interval) : &# 945;, 0. 010 &# 8211; 0. 015 (&# 177; 0. 005 1 /MPa); n, 2. 2 &# 8211; 3. 1 (&# 177; 0. 5); and &# 916;H, 54 &# 8211; 66 (&# 177; 8 kJ/mol). The rate kinetics analysis indicated that short-circuit diffusion was a contributing mechanism to dislocation motion during creep. The rate kinetics analysis also determined that a minimum creep rate trend could not be developed between the as-fabricated versus aged conditions. This study showed that the elevated temperature aging treatments introduced multiple changes to the Sn-Ag-Bi microstructure that did not result in a simple loss (&# 8220;softening&# 8221;) of its mechanical strength...|$|E
40|$|Miniature {{specimens}} made of {{a single}} crystalline (SX) Ni-base superalloy with the nominal chemical composition of CMSX- 4 ® have been tested in low cycle fatigue (LCF) at 950 °C. The specimens were 20 mm long dog bone shaped and cut from SX slabs with their length axis parallel to different defined crystallographic orientations. The SX was solidified with dendritic microstructure showing interdendritic solidification pores aligned parallel to the growth direction, which was also {{the direction of the}} cubic SX. For achieving high creep resistance a precipitation hardening treatment was performed, which generated a typical γ-/γ’-microstructure with cubic ’-precipitates separated by channels. Creep resistance was further improved via solid solution strengthening of the channels by enrichment of the alloying elements Co, Cr, Re, and W. Specimens having different orientations with respect to the crystallographic system and the growth direction were tested in LCF until fracture under load control with triangular load pattern and a load ratio of about 0. 62 to 0. 65 in tension. Fractography revealed that cracks initiated at interdendritic pores, either in the volume or at the surface. On length sections two crack propagation paths were identified (1) perpendicular to the load direction within the γ-channels (see Figure 1) or (2) along { 111 }-slip planes (see Figure 2). In both cases intermetallic phases containing refractory alloying elements occurred, decorating the crack paths and slip planes, respectively. Such intermetallic phases, presumably topologically closed packed (TCP) phases, were further only observed close to the surface within a thin seam of 20 µm. Since in the specimen’s remaining volume no such phases appeared, it is assumed that their localized formation is linked to local stress-/strain-concentrations at pores, crack tips, and shear bands. While TCP formation is associated with depletion of solid solution hardening elements of the γ-phase, having <b>negative</b> influence on <b>creep</b> properties if occurring dispersed in the volume, its influence on fatigue properties appears to be ambiguous. It seems that localized formation of TCP-phases may reduce the crack propagation velocity either of cracks along γ-channels by causing crack tip unloading and crack path deviations or of cracks along slip planes by inhibiting further shear deformation. The effects of the observed microstructural mechanisms will be discussed with respect to LCF life...|$|R
