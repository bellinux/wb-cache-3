25|$|Normally, as Earth gets colder due to <b>natural</b> <b>climatic</b> {{fluctuations}} and <b>changes</b> in incoming solar radiation, {{the cooling}} slows these weathering reactions. As a result, less {{carbon dioxide is}} removed from the atmosphere and Earth warms as this greenhouse gas accumulates — this 'negative feedback' process limits the magnitude of cooling. During the Cryogenian period, however, Earth's continents were all at tropical latitudes, which made this moderating process less effective, as high weathering rates continued on land even as Earth cooled. This let ice advance beyond the polar regions. Once ice advanced to within 30° of the equator, a positive feedback could ensue such that the increased reflectiveness (albedo) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the whole Earth is ice-covered.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to first examine the factors {{affecting}} the intra-household perception of climate change. Second, the study investigates the impact of the perception of climatic stress on the operators’ and spouses’ intra-household adaptation strategies (farm and household financial strategies). Design/methodology/approach – The study uses household survey data from Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. The study uses probit and negative binomial count data approaches to evaluate the empirical model. Findings – Results confirm the existence of intra-household gender differences in the adaptation strategies. The authors found that although spouses perceive climatic stress, they are less likely to adapt to such stresses when it comes farming enterprise, but more likely to adapt to household financial strategies. In contrast, farm operators, in the presence of climatic stresses, undertake both farm and household finance adaptation strategies. Practical implications – Investment in climate smart agriculture can help households in managing climatic stresses. Originality/value – A farmer in Asia, and Vietnam in particular, faces significant risks from <b>climatic</b> <b>changes.</b> In Vietnam, agriculture is easily affected by <b>natural</b> disasters and <b>climatic</b> <b>changes.</b> This study provides insights into the perception of <b>climatic</b> <b>changes</b> by operators and spouses in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta.

40|$|Floods are {{a global}} problem and are {{considered}} the most frequent natural disaster world-wide. Many {{studies show that the}} severity and frequency of floods have increased in recent years and underline the difficulty to separate the effects of <b>natural</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>changes</b> and human influences as land management practices, urbanization etc. Flood risk analysis and assessment is required to provide information on current or future flood hazard and risks in order to accomplish flood risk mitigation, to propose, evaluate and select measures to reduce it. Both components of risk can be mapped individually and are affected by multiple uncertainties as well as the joint estimate of flood risk. Major sources of uncertainty include statistical analysis of extremes events, definition of hydrological input, channel and floodplain topography representation, the choice of effective hydraulic roughness coefficients. The classical procedure to estimate flood discharge for a chosen probability of exceedance is to deal with a rainfallrunoff model associating to risk the same return period of original rainfall, in accordance with the iso-frequency criterion. Alternatively, a flood frequency analysis to a given record of discharge data is applied, but again the same probability is associated to flood discharges and respective risk. Moreover, since flood peaks and corresponding flood volumes are variables of the same phenomenon, they should be, directly, correlated and, consequently, multivariate statistical analyses must be applied. This study presents an innovative approach to obtain flood hazard maps where hydrological input (synthetic flood design event) to a 2 D hydraulic model has been defined by generating flood peak discharges and volumes from: a) a classical univariate approach, b) a bivariate statistical analysis, through the use of copulas. The univariate approach considers flood hydrographs generation by an indirect approach (rainfall-runoff transformation using input rainfall hydrographs derived from IDF curves) and a direct approach (statistical inference on measured flood peaks). In the bivariate approach synthetic hydrographs were generated by means two different approaches: an indirect one, where rainfall were generated by a stochastic bivariate rainfall generator to be entered a distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model that consisted of a soil moisture routine and a flow routing routine; and a direct one, where stochastic generation of flood peaks and flow volumes have been obtained via copulas, which are capable to describe and model the correlation between these two variables. Finally, to highlight the advantages of the presented approach, probabilistic flood hazard maps (including uncertainty) derived by bivariate models are compared to maps from univariate analysis. The procedure is applied to a real case study located {{in the southern part of}} Sicily, Italy, where flood hazard and risk maps have been obtained and compared...|$|R
40|$|Desertification in the Chihuahuan Desert {{has been}} the source of {{increased}} attention during the past 30 years. Desertification has resulted in the gradual change of grassland into shrubland. Explanations for these changes range from <b>natural</b> environmental <b>climatic</b> <b>changes</b> to anthropogenic perturbations. ^ The objectives of this study are: (1) to determine the impact of environmental disturbances on soil mite populations, and (2) to determine if soil mites can be used as bioindicators of disturbance and recovery in desert ecosystems. ^ The study was conducted at the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico, and was set up to investigate the effects of environmental stressors on desert ecosystems. The recovery of the impacted areas was evaluated based on family richness, abundance and diversity of soil mite populations. It was hypothesized that (1) multiple environmental disturbances would have a greater impact on soil mite populations than a single disturbance and that (2) most disturbances reduce mite populations and the interactions between these disturbances would reduce these populations even further. ^ The results also show that most of the disturbances reduced soil mite populations, but multiple interactions only have a minimal negative effect. Based on the results of this study, soil mite populations are affected by natural as well as anthropogenic disturbances; thus soil mites, specifically prostigmatid mites, can be used as bioindicators of the disturbance and recovery of natural and anthropogenic environmental stressors in the northern Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. ...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{consequences}} present {{one of the most}} important threats to biodiversity and the functions of ecosystems. The stress on biodiversity is far beyond the levels imposed by the <b>natural</b> global <b>climatic</b> <b>changes</b> occurring in the recent evolutionary past. It includes temperature increases, shifts of climate zones, melting of snow and ice, sea level rise, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. Natural systems are vulnerable to such changes due to their limited adaptive capacity. Based on an analysis using the DPSIR framework, this paper discusses some of the important socio-economic driving forces of climate change, with a focus on energy use and transportation. The paper also analyses observed and potential changes of climate and the pressures they exert on biodiversity, the changes in biodiversity, the resulting impacts on ecosystem functions, and possible policy responses. The latter can be divided into mitigation and adaptation measures. Both strategies are needed, mitigation in order to stabilise the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and adaptation in order to adjust to changes that have already occurred or cannot be avoided. One mitigation option, increased biofuel production, which is also a response to oil depletion, would change land use patterns and increase human appropriation of net primary production of biomass, thereby threatening biodiversity. By considering the first order and second order impacts of climate change on biodiversity when developing policy measures, it will be possible to integrate ecosystem and biodiversity protection into decision-making processes.

40|$|Abstract. Differential {{temperature}} {{changes with}} altitude can {{shed light on}} the relative importance of <b>natural</b> versus anthropogenic <b>climatic</b> <b>change.</b> There has been heightened interest in this subject recently due to the finding that high-elevation tropical glaciers have been retreating and that significant melting from even the highest alpine regions has occurred in some areas during the past 20 years or so, as recorded in ice core records, which do not reveal any similar period during previous centuries to millennia. In this paper we find evidence for appreciable differences in mean temperature changes with elevation during the last several decades of instrumental records. The signal appears to be more closely related to increases in daily minimum temperature than changes in the daily maximum. The changes in surface temperature vary spatially, with Europe (particularly western Europe), and parts of Asia displaying the strongest high altitude warming during the period of record. High-elevation climate records of long standing taken at a number of mountain tops throughout the world, but primarily in Europe, are available from a number of countries. In some cases, meteorological observations at these unique mountain sites have been discontinued for a variety of reasons, usually budgetary. It is hoped that the papers published in this special issue of <b>Climatic</b> <b>Change</b> can contribute to a reassessment of the value of continuing climate measurements at these mountain observatories by the appropriate entities, so that we may continue to have access to climate information from the ‘tops of the world’. 1...|$|R

40|$|Determination of past {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} (SST) is of primary {{importance for the}} reconstruction of <b>natural</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>changes,</b> modelling of climate and reconstruction of ocean circulation. Recently, a new SST proxy was introduced, the TetraEther indeX of lipids with 86 carbons (TEX 86), {{which is based on}} temperature-related changes that occur in the composition of creanarchaeotal membrane lipids. An empirical correlation between TEX 86 values of sediment core tops {{from a wide variety of}} geographical locations and annual mean SST has been used to calibrate the TEX 86 proxy. The main objective of the work described in this thesis was to improve, validate and apply the TEX 86 proxy. To do this we focused on a) the analytical aspects of the TEX 86, b) the transport of GDGTs to the sediment and the influence of diagenesis and c) the application of the proxy in various settings. Regarding the analytical aspects, the detection limit of the GDGTs was established at 0. 05 ng GDGTs injected on-column. Furthermore application of SIM improved the analytical reproducibility to 0. 3 C, and a new synthetic internal GDGT standard was used which improved the accuracy of GDGT abundance measurements increasing the potential of GDGTs in (paleo) ecological studies substantially. The transport and diagenesis of GDGTs were also subject of study as they are essential in understanding and applying the TEX 86 as palaeothermometer. This study revealed the presence of GDGTs in both stomachs and, in lower amounts, in the intestines showing uptake of GDGTs by decapods, but TEX 86 -derived temperatures are not significantly different between stomachs and intestines (1 C), suggesting that TEX 86 values are not altered during gut transit. To investigate the effect of degradation by long term exposure to oxygen we analyzed GDGTs abundance, TEX 86 and Branched versus Isoprenoid Tetraether index (BIT) in several Madeira Abyssal Plain turbidites across an oxidation front. A decrease by several orders of magnitude in the concentrations of GDGTs was found and also substantial shifts in the BIT and TEX 86. The shifts are interpreted to be caused by a strong relative increase in soil-derived GDGTs relative to the marine-derived GDGTs. This selective preservation of soil-derived lipids which are chemically nearly identical to that of their marine counterpart strongly suggests that the mineral matrix to which soil organic matter is attached enhanced its preservation. Finally the application of the TEX 86 to a range of environments and time resolutions in combination with other SST proxies allowed the validation of the TEX 86 proxy as a paleothermometer. While in most studies TEX 86 showed a good correlation with SST, work using sediment traps and a sediment core covering the last 150 years in the Santa Barbara Basin revealed that TEX 86 values were always substantially lower than sea surface temperatures (SST), indicating a sub-surface origin, likely between 100 - 150 m. This result highlights the importance of performing calibration studies using sediment traps and core tops before applying the TEX 86 temperature proxy in a given study area...|$|R

A radiative transfer model was used to estimate daily UV-B irradiance levels using remotely sensed ozone and cloud cover data for 1274 meteorological stations.
