40|$|Dabble is a {{tool for}} {{building}} membrane protein systems. The ultimate goal of the project {{is to create an}} easy to use, one stop tool for system construction and parameterization. Some uses for Dabble: 	Prepare membrane protein systems by inserting them into a membrane 	Prepare solvated proteins by adding water 	Add ions to neutralize and/or to desired concentration 	Parameterize with CHARMM or AMBER parameter sets 	Outputs files for simulation with AMBER or CHARMM 	Automatic detection of post-translational modifications 	Modified amino acids made easy 	Ligands made easy! <b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>messing</b> with atom names. Dabble can use CHARMM or AMBER parameters, and generate input files for simulating in NAMD, CHARMM, Anton, or Desmond. While Dabble can be run from the command-line, it also provides a powerful API for building and parameterizing systems. Dabble's full documentation is available at [URL]...|$|R
