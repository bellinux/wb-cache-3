This left the local British forces with <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> {{to wait for the}} Americans to make the first move and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Troude's {{squadron}} {{to escape the}} British pursuit highlights {{the dominance of the}} Royal Navy in the Atlantic by 1809. With Martinique gone, and French Guiana and San Domingo falling the same year, Guadeloupe was the only remaining French possession in the West Indies. Despite the supplies carried by Troude's ships, the situation there was desperate: food shortages and financial crisis causing a collapse in the island's morale. When a further effort to resupply the island was defeated in December 1809, the French losing two more frigates, the inhabitants had <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to wait for the inevitable British invasion. In January 1810, Cochrane ordered an amphibious landing on Guadeloupe, which rapidly overwhelmed the weakened defenders and eliminated the last remaining French colony in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Montrose's Scottish {{campaign}} and his victory at Battle of Kilsyth forced Leslie {{to lead his}} cavalry north to bolster the Covenanter militia in Scotland. Without their cavalry to find supplies, Leven's Scottish infantry were more occupied with plundering Worcestershire for food than with the siege works. With his cavalry support on the march to meet Montrose, Leven had <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to withdraw without fighting as the Royalists approached Worcester. Worcester was relieved on 1 September.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} background and erudition {{of her family}} members served to ignite the imaginative faculties of Schiaparelli’s impressionable childhood years. She became enraptured with the lore of ancient cultures and religious rites. These sources inspired her to pen a volume of poems titled Arethusa based on the ancient Greek myth of the hunt. The content of her writing so alarmed the conservative sensibilities of her parents they sought to tame her fantasy life by sending her to a convent boarding school in Switzerland. Once within the school’s confines, Schiaparelli rebelled against its strict authority by going on a hunger strike, leaving her parents to see <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to bring her home again.|$|E
25|$|By May it {{had become}} {{apparent}} that there was <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to revise fares to meet the increased cost of operation and particularly that of labour. The availability of workmen’s fares was altered to cease after 7 a.m., but the time had to be amended shortly afterwards to 7.30 a.m. All transfer facilities were abolished after 20 May; the half-fare limit for children was altered from under 15 to under 12, and other half-fare concessions were abolished, except those for wounded soldiers. Shortly afterwards, workmen’s return fares were also withdrawn. In September, lost property charges were introduced of 2d. for articles claimed within the month, plus 1d. for each additional month thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The English {{therefore}} had <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to tow their vessels {{into the}} nearest friendly harbor, that being Tétouan on the Barbary coast.

After around four days and with the wind now in their favor, the English sailed off without incident; the Spanish in the harbor of Algeciras unable to intercept them because of their severe damage or the rough sea. The English soon arrived off the coast of England without further hindrance.|$|E

25|$|The attack {{commenced}} at 23:00 on 14 July. The two New Zealand brigades {{shortly before}} dawn on 15 July took their objectives, but minefields and pockets of resistance created disarray among the attackers. A number of pockets of resistance {{were left behind}} the forward troops' advance which impeded the move forward of reserves, artillery, and support arms. As a result, the New Zealand brigades occupied exposed positions on the ridge without support weapons {{except for a few}} anti-tank guns. More significantly, communications with the two British armoured brigades failed, and the British armour did not move forwards to protect the infantry. At first light, a detachment from 15th Panzer division's 8th Panzer Regiment launched a counter-attack against New Zealand 4th Brigade's 22nd Battalion. A sharp exchange knocked out their anti-tank guns and the infantry found themselves exposed in the open with <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to surrender. About 350 New Zealanders were taken prisoner.|$|E
25|$|Cripps's mission failed as Gandhi {{would accept}} {{nothing less than}} independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter's refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled. On 15 January 1941, Gandhi had stated: Some say Pandit Nehru and I were estranged. It will require much more than {{difference}} of opinion to estrange us. We had differences {{from the time we}} became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal will be my successor.Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from this—his ninth and last detention—only on 15 June 1945.|$|E
25|$|In August 1709 Eugene's chief {{political}} opponent and critic in Vienna, Prince Salm, retired as court chamberlain. Eugene and Wratislaw were now the undisputed {{leaders of the}} Austrian government: all major departments of state were in their hands or those of their political allies. However, another attempt at a negotiated settlement at Geertruidenberg in April 1710 failed, largely because the English Whigs still felt strong enough to refuse concessions, while Louis XIV saw little reason to accept what he had refused the previous year. Eugene and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at {{the breakdown of the}} talks. There was <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured Douai. This success was followed by a series of minor sieges, and by the close of 1710 the Allies had cleared much of France's protective ring of fortresses. Yet there had been no final, decisive breakthrough, and this was to be the last year that Eugene and Marlborough would work together.|$|E

25|$|Louisa, {{along with}} the wives and {{families}} of other Union officers chose to remain behind. They soon had misgivings, not for fear of the approaching rebel army so much as because the evacuation of territorial authorities had encouraged looters and other criminal elements. The Confederates who entered Santa Fe on March 10, 1862 were thus surprised to find a welcoming committee consisting of the wives of Union officers led by the wife of Colonel Canby. As expected, the Confederates established martial law and then conducted a mostly fruitlessly search for hidden supplies. On March 29, 1862 Confederate forces returned to Santa Fe from a Pyrrhic victory at Glorieta Pass. On their way to attack Fort Union, the Confederates had met a force made up predominantly of inexperienced Colorado volunteers. While the Confederates had won a technical victory, a unit of about 500 Coloradans had gone behind Confederate lines and destroyed more than 70 wagons loaded with Confederate food and gear. Without sufficient provisions to lay siege to Fort Union, the rebels had <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to retreat.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally an aristocrat of {{the first}} rank did find himself in dire {{financial}} troubles. The severely impoverished Duke of Marlborough saved Blenheim Palace by marrying an heiress, tempted from the USA by the lure of an old title in return for vast riches. Not all were so fortunate or seemingly eligible. When 2nd Duke of Buckingham found himself bankrupt in 1848, he sold the contents of Stowe House, one of Britain's grandest houses. It {{proved to be a}} temporary solution; his heirs, the 3rd and final Duke of Buckingham and his heirs, the Earls Temple, inherited huge financial problems until finally in 1922 anything left that was moveable, both internal and external, was auctioned off and the house sold, narrowly escaping demolition. It was saved by being transformed into a school. Less fortunate was Clumber Park, the principal home of the Dukes of Newcastle. Selling the Hope diamond and other properties failed to solve the family problems, leaving <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> demolition of the huge, expensive-to-maintain house, which was razed to the ground in 1938, leaving the Duke without a ducal seat. Plans to rebuild a smaller house on the site were never executed. Other high-ranking members of the peerage were also forced to off-load minor estates and seats; the Duke of Northumberland retained Alnwick Castle, but sold Stanwick Park to be demolished, leaving him with four other country seats remaining. Likewise the Duke of Bedford kept Woburn Abbey, considerably reduced in size, after World War II, while selling other family estates and houses. Whatever the personal choices and reasons for the sales and demolitions, the underlying and unifying factor was almost always financial. The root of the problem began long before the 20th century with the gradual introduction and increase of taxes on income and further tax on inherited wealth, death duties.|$|E
25|$|Bieber {{suffered}} a serious loss at industrial equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc., however. The UAW struck Caterpillar in 1982, a strike that (by 1993) {{was the longest}} in UAW history and which had severely drained the union's strike fund. But by 1989, the UAW was praising the Caterpillar contract. But Caterpillar began a restructuring program that reduced its workforce by 30 percent while building new plants in the non-union Deep South. By 1991, only 25 percent of its workforce belonged to the UAW. The UAW had negotiated a new contract with John Deere, the giant agricultural machinery manufacturer, and it asked Caterpillar for the same terms. Caterpillar refused, instead demanding major concessions such as a two-tier wage system, the right to subcontract work out to non-union companies, the imposition of 12-hour work shifts, weaker safety rules, a weaker grievance system, greatly scaled back health benefits, {{and the right to}} impose flexible work schedules on workers. About 1,870 workers in Decatur, Illinois, struck on November 3, and Caterpillar instituted a nationwide lockout (even in those plants not on strike). Soon more than 13,400 Caterpillar workers were walking the picket line. Caterpillar ended the lockout on March 16, 1992, but few employees went back to work. Caterpillar tendered what it called its last, best offer to Bieber three days later, but he rejected the proposal. Caterpillar announced an impasse on March 5, and on April 1 sent all workers a letter demanding that they return to work by April 6 or the company would permanently replace them. Between 400 and 1,200 workers crossed the picket line to return to work (estimates very widely). At the urging of federal mediators, Bieber met one-on-one with Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Donald V. Fites. Bieber left the meeting convinced that the UAW had <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to accept Caterpillar's offer. UAW members back to work on the company's terms.|$|E
