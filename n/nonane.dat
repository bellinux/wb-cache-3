25|$|Alkanes from <b>nonane</b> to, for instance, {{hexadecane}} (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids {{of higher}} viscosity, {{less and less}} suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel. Diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number, cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} names {{were derived from}} methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, {{respectively}} (hexadecane is also {{sometimes referred to as}} cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel (-a or -o) from the basic numerical term. Hence, pentane, C5H12; hexane, C6H14; heptane, C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example <b>nonane,</b> use the Latin prefix non-.

25|$|The alkanes from pentane (C5H12) to octane (C8H18) are refined into gasoline, {{the ones}} from <b>nonane</b> (C9H20) to {{hexadecane}} (C16H34) into diesel fuel, kerosene and jet fuel. Alkanes {{with more than}} 16 carbon atoms can be refined into fuel oil and lubricating oil. At the heavier end of the range, paraffin wax is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while asphalt has 35 and up, although these are usually cracked by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand {{and the cost of}} recovery, these gases are either flared off, sold as liquefied petroleum gas under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C4H10), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapor pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, {{but it is also a}} main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this pen-and-paper study is to witness the emergence of stereoisomeric properties when comparing lower to higher families of homologs. Specifically, the study compares all acyclic hexanes (five constitutional isomers, a. k. a. regioisomers), all nine heptanes, all 18 octanes, all 35 <b>nonanes,</b> and all 75 decanes. The {{first part of the}} work examines the nature and number of stereoisomeric properties seen to emerge in chemical structures featuring one chiral center (i. e., enantiomerism) or two such centers, in which case more complex stereoisomeric features emerge (enantiomerism, diastereoisomerism, pseudoasymmetry, and meso-isomers). The first emergence of chirality (i. e., enantiomerism) occurred in some heptanes. Diastereoisomerism and meso-isomers appear with some octanes, while a pseudoasymmetric center exists in a decane regioisomer. The second part of the work is an attempt to rationalize the numbers of regioisomers, chiral centers, and stereoisomers as these numbers grow from one family of regioisomers to the higher ones.

40|$|Condensed {{phosphates}} {{were first}} used in cooling water {{applications in the}} early 190302 ̆ 7 s. Extensive use was found for these polyphosphates because {{of their ability to}} control calcium carbonate scaling at threshold or substoichiometric dosages. Later, their ability to control the corrosion of steel in open recirculating cooling water systems and once through cooling water systems demonstrated the versatility of this class of compounds. ^ The use of polyphosphates began to give way to the acid chromate programs as the primary corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in open recirculating systems in the early 19602 ̆ 7 s. This preference for chromate and chromate-zinc programs was still quite prevalent in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s. The cause for this change stems from the one major disadvantage of polyphosphate treatments -hydrolytic instability which produces orthophosphate. The orthophosphate anion forms insoluble scales with all bivalent cations, the most important of which are calcium, magnesium and iron. These scales can foul heat transfer surfaces and reduce dramatically heat transfer efficiency of process heat exchangers. In addition to providing fouling problems, the orthophosphate anion fails to provide the positive effects of condensed phosphates. Orthophosphate does not show a threshold effect and is not as effective in corrosion prevention of steel as condensed phosphates. ^ The Clean Water Act of 1972 began a level of environmental awareness that was not seen before. One of the outcalls of this movement was the identification of hexavalent chromium (chromates) as toxicity to aquatic life because of its low LD 50. Chromates were also identified as potential carcinogens. Efforts to remove the chromate ion from cooling tower blowdown were hampered by the need to label any sludge from the waste treatment facility as hazardous. The need for a non chromate cooling water treatment that could provide the same or better performance as the acid-chromate-zinc treatments became a top priority for industry. ^ This dissertation in the form of US Patent 4, 172, 032 describes the development of such a cooling water treatment. It also describes the discovery of an optimum molecular weight of polyphosphate as the most critical factor in determining the performance of these programs. ^ The synthesis of spire (4, 4) <b>nonanes</b> was done in the period of 1966 to 1970. This work was completed but not defended before a Dissertation Defense Committee. It is included in Appendix A of this document in the interest of completeness. ...|$|R
