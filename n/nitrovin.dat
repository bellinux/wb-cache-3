40|$|ABSTRACT Day-old cockerels {{were used}} to examine the growth {{responses}} obtained when 50 ppm procaine penicillin, 25 ppm zinc bacitracin, or 20 ppm <b>nitrovin</b> were administered in a wheat-based diet. The birds were fed ad libitum from one day of age a plain or supplemented diet in a series of 10, 21, and 56 -day tests conducted between 1971 and 1974. Growth responses, measured by improvement in the live weight gain and feed conversion, were obtained with each treatment, consistently over each annual period. The penicillin and zinc bacitracin gave maximal differences in live weight gain compared with the controls before 14 days of age and, possibly, before 7 days of age, whereas the maximal response to treatment with <b>nitrovin</b> occurred after 14 days of age. 1980 Poultry Science 59 : 412 - 41...|$|E
40|$|Groups of 45 {{chickens}} {{were fed}} continuously on diets containing 10 or 100 mg. /kg. of different 'growth-promoting' antibiotics and infected orally with a nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of Salmonella typhimurium. The amount of S. typhimurium organisms excreted in their faeces was estimated by culturing them at weekly intervals {{and in a}} standard manner on plates of brilliant green agar containing sodium nalidixate, both direct and after enrichment in selenite broth. All of four groups fed diets containing 100 mg. /kg. of <b>nitrovin</b> in three different experiments excreted much larger amounts of S. typhimurium than did groups fed antibiotic-free diets. In some, but not all, experiments, larger amounts were also excreted by groups fed diets containing 10 mg. /kg. of <b>nitrovin</b> or 10 or 100 mg. /kg. of flavomycin or tylosin. Feeding diets containing 10 or 100 mg. /kg. of virginiamycin or bacitracin either did not influence or slightly increased the amount of S. typhimiurium excreted. Two groups fed continuously on diets containing 100 or 500 mg. /kg. of sulphaquinoxaline for 44 days excreted smaller amounts of the S. typhimurium organisms that did groups fed antibiotic-free diets; no sulphonamide-resistant organisms of the S. typhimurium strain were isolated from the faeces...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two {{different}} types of anaerobic bacteria isolated from chickens have been tested for anti-salmonella activity in vitro. Under {{the conditions of the}} test only Bacteroides hypermegas and a Bifidobacterium sp. were shown to inhibit the salmonellas and this was attributed to the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA's) coupled with a low pH. When these organisms were tested in newly hatched chicks no inhibition of S. typhimurium occurred. Possible explanations for this observation are considered. The pH value and concentration of VFA's in the caecal material were determined in chicks from 0 - 84 days. In vitro tests with S. typhimurium indicated that, whilst the organism would be able to multiply at the pH and concentration of VFA's found during the first few days after hatching, the rapid increase in VFA concentration during the first 21 days would make this increasingly difficult. The significance of the developing caecal flora in relation to VFA production and pH is discussed. Because certain feed additives are known to influence the carriage of salmonellas, the sensitivity of various caecal anaerobes to these compounds was determined in vitro, generally at 1, 10 and 100 microgram/ml. The additives tested included flavomycin, furazolidone, <b>nitrovin,</b> tetracyline, tylosin, sulphaquinoxaline, virginiamycin and zinc bacitracin. All the organisms tested were inhibited by 100 microgram/ml furazolidone; none were inhibited by 500 microgram/ml sulphaquinoxaline. Changes occurring in the VFA concentration, pH value and microflora of the caeca of chicks fed for 49 days or longer on a normal starter diet or the same diet containing 10 or 100 mg/kg <b>nitrovin</b> have been compared. When the chicks were fed on the diet containing 100 mg/kg <b>nitrovin,</b> the Gram-negative non-sporing anaerobes were eliminated as {{a significant part of the}} caecal flora. However, the VFA concentration combined with a low pH in chicks from 2 weeks onwards was still sufficient to inhibit salmonella multiplication. Other possibly interrelated factors which might lead to an increased salmonella carrier rate in the nitrovin-treated chickens are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The minimal {{inhibitory}} {{concentrations of}} nine growth-promoting agents {{were determined by}} an agar-dilution method against 66 bile-tolerant streptococcal (8 Streptococcus faecalis, 23 Streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens, 15 Streptococcus faecium, and 20 carboxyphilic streptococci) strains isolated from the ceca of 52 chickens on 19 farms. Avoparcin was equally active on all groups. The natural susceptibilities against the other substances differed among the groups studied. Bacitracin and virginiamycin were more active on S. faecium and S. faecalis than on S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens; lincomycin and the macrolide antibiotics were more active on S. faecium than on the other groups; and flavomycin was active on all groups except S. faecium. High percentages of acquired resistance were noted in all groups against bacitracin, lincomycin, and the macrolide antibiotics, oleandomycin, spiramycin, and tylosin. Resistance to <b>nitrovin</b> was found only among the S. faecalis and S. faecium groups...|$|E
40|$|Para avaliar o efeito do uso de antibiótico, de probiótico e de homeopatia em frangos de corte, inoculados ou não com Escherichia coli, foram distribuídos 672 frangos machos, Avian Farm, em delineamento inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial com oito tratamentos (quatro aditivos x com ou sem inoculação) e seis repetições, tendo 14, 12 e 7 aves por unidade experimental, respectivamente, de acordo com os períodos 1 a 11, 12 a 21 e 22 a 42 dias de idade. As aves foram alojadas em salas climatizadas em ambiente de conforto, de acordo com o manual da linhagem. Os tratamentos foram constituídos de: controle negativo (sem aditivo), antibiótico (virginiamicina + <b>nitrovin),</b> probiótico (meio de cultura de Lactobacilus acidophillus, Enterococcus faecium e Saccharomices cerevisiae) e homeopatia (nosódio de Escherichia coli). Observou-se que as aves tratadas com antibiótico e probiótico apresentaram maior ganho de peso no período de 1 a 21 dias, com melhor conversão alimentar para aquelas tratadas com antibiótico, embora no período total de 1 a 42 dias não tenha havido diferença entre os tratamentos. A inoculação da Escherichia coli piorou o desempenho das aves, aumentando o peso relativo do coração, do fígado e dos intestinos, enquanto o uso de antibiótico e de probiótico melhorou o desempenho das aves no período de 1 a 21 dias. The {{effect of}} antibiotic, {{probiotic}} and homeopathy in broilers inoculated or not with Escherichia coli was evaluated. Six hundred and seventy two male broilers of Avian Farm strain {{were assigned to}} a completely randomized design, in a factorial scheme, with eight treatments (four additives x inoculation or not) and six replicates, with 14, 12 and 7 birds by experimental box, respectively, according to the periods from 1 to 11, from 12 to 21 and from 22 to 42 days of age. The birds were allotted to acclimatized chambers, under comfort environment, according to the strain recommendations. The treatments were constituted of: negative control (no additive), antibiotic (virginiamicine + <b>nitrovin),</b> probiotic (culture medium of Lactobacilus acidophillus, Enterococcus faecium and Saccharomices cerevisiae) and homeopathy (nosody of Escherichia coli). It was observed that birds fed antibiotic and probiotic showed higher weight gain from 1 to 21 days, and the birds fed antibiotic showed the best feed:gain ratio, although in the total period (from 1 to 42 days of age) {{there was no difference}} among treatments. The inoculation with Escherichia coli decreased the birds performance; the bacteria increased the relative weight of heart, liver and intestines. It was concluded that the use of antibiotic and probiotic improved the birds performance from 1 to 21 days of age...|$|E
40|$|Colonization of the caeca {{of newly}} hatched chicks by Salmonella typhimurium was {{prevented}} by oral administration of {{a mixture of}} cultures comprising 48 different bacterial strains originating from an adult bird known {{to be free from}} salmonellas. The treatment conferred protection to the same degree as that obtained previously with a suspension of adult caecal contents or an undefined anaerobic culture from the same source and was demonstrated in four separate laboratory trials. Examination of the caecal microflora of chicks one day after being given the protective treatment showed that the presence of high levels of lactobacilli and Bacteroides spp. which are not found usually at two days of age in chicks produced under commercial conditions was indicative of the successful establishment of an adult-type microflora. Although the usual method of administering the protective organisms was to dose the chicks directly into the crop, it was also found possible to incorporate the organisms in the drinking water given to the birds at dilutions up to one in five, the maximum tested. When chicks were given the bacterial mixture via the crop and fed on a diet containing 10 mg kg- 1 <b>nitrovin</b> and 100 mg kg- 1 monensin, the bacteroides failed to establish in the caeca and the birds were not protected against salmonella colonization. However, when the bacterial cultures were incorporated in the drinking water and the chicks given the same feed, normal protection was obtained; possible reasons for these observations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Foi investigado o efeito da substituição de antibióticos por prebiótico, probiótico e simbiótico em dietas para frangos de corte de 1 a 45 dias de idade. Foram utilizados 750 pintos de 1 dia de idade, distribuídos em cinco tratamentos, sendo: T 1 -sem aditivos, T 2 -antibiótico (Olaquindox â e <b>Nitrovin</b> â), T 3 -prebiótico (0, 2 % de parede celular de S. cerevisiae), T 4 -probiótico (300 ppm de B. subtilis) e T 5 -simbiótico (T 3 + T 4). O desempenho dos frangos de 1 - 45 dias de idade foi influenciado pelos diferentes tratamentos, sendo o melhor ganho de peso observado em aves que receberam o simbiótico, seguido daquelas com antibiótico, prebiótico e probiótico. O pior ganho de peso foi observado nas aves que não receberam qualquer tipo de aditivo na dieta. A conversão alimentar, no período de 1 a 45 dias de idade, também foi influenciada pelo tipo de aditivo. As aves que não receberam suplementação apresentaram pior conversão alimentar quando comparadas com as aves dos demais tratamentos. Os resultados deste experimento permitem concluir que a substituição de antibióticos por simbióticos na ração de frangos é uma alternativa viável, pois não compromete o desempenho das aves, contudo a ausência de aditivos na dieta piora o desempenho das mesmas. This {{study was}} carried out with the {{objective}} to test the substitution of antibiotics by prebiotics, probiotics or symbiotics in broiler chickens diet up to 45 days of age. Day-old chicks (n= 750) were divided in five treatments, as follow: T 1 -no additives, T 2 -antibiotics (Olaquindoxâ e Nitrovinâ), T 3 -prebiotic (0. 2 % de S. cerevisiae cell wall), T 4 -probiotics (300 ppm B. subtilis) and T 5 -symbiotic (T 3 + T 4). The performance of broilers up to 45 days of age was influenced by treatments, with better weight gain observed in the birds fed with symbiotics, followed by antibiotcs, prebiotics and probiotics. The worse body weight gain was obtained by the broilers whose diet was not supplemented by any additive. During this period, feed conversion was also affected depending on the additive used, since the birds not supplemented showed the worse results {{when compared to the}} birds of the other treatments. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the substitution of antibiotics by symbiotics in broiler chicken diets is an alternative to poultry industry, since no negative effect was found on performance. However, the total absence of additives in the diets worsened the broiler chicken performance...|$|E
