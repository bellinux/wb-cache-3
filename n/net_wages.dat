However, the estimator for the coefficient is only significant at the 10 % level. The coefficient for the net replacement income has a value of 1.546, but is insignificant according to the calculated standard errors. One explanation for the low significance levels of both, the <b>net</b> <b>wage</b> and the <b>net</b> replacement income effect, might be a multi-collinearity phenomenon since the replacement income is per construction highly correlated with the nominal <b>net</b> <b>wage.</b>|$|R

From 1950 to the mid-1980s, the average <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> increased more than eightfold.

50|$|In 1998, Fullerton and Gilbert E. Metcalf {{explain this}} theory more thoroughly. They begin by {{defining}} terms. The gross wage reflects the pre-tax wage a laborer receives. The simplest {{form of the}} <b>net</b> <b>wage</b> is the pre-tax wage minus the income tax. In reality, however, the <b>net</b> <b>wage</b> is the gross wage times one minus the tax rate, all divided by the price of consumption goods. With the status quo income tax, deadweight loss exists. Any addition {{to the price of}} consumption goods or an increase in the income tax extends the deadweight loss further. Either of these scenarios lowers the <b>net</b> <b>wage,</b> reducing the supply of labor offered. Supply of labor decreases because of the labor/leisure interchange. If someone gets paid very little, he or she may decide it is no longer worth his or her time to continue in that job. Thus, employment decreases. If the Pigovian tax, which increases the price of consumption goods, replaces the income tax, Fullerton argues that the <b>net</b> <b>wage</b> is not affected.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that retail trade {{is one of the most}} {{important}} parts of any economy. Retail trade is also a very important component of GDP, whereby rising retail trade means a growth in consumption and a fall in unemployment. Therefore, policy makers must be able to recognise how changes in economic variables affect changes in retail trade. The main goal of this paper is to analyse the effects of changes in retail prices, <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> and short-term interest rate on nominal retail trade in Croatia using the bounds testing (ARDL) approach for cointegration. The results indicate the existence of a stable cointegration relationship between the variables. In the long-run, an increase in retail prices and short-term interest rate leads to a reduction in nominal retail trade while an increase in <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> boosts an increase in nominal retail trade. In the short-run, a positive change in retail prices has a positive effect on the change in nominal retail trade while positive changes in <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> and short-term interest rate have negative effects on nominal retail trade...|$|E

30|$|Our second {{data set}} is the 2001 / 2002 German Time Use Survey (GTUS) {{provided}} by the German Federal Statistical Office. In addition to information on individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics, <b>net</b> <b>wages,</b> and working hours, it contains detailed time diaries with precise information on individuals’ time allocation (distinguishing 272 possible activities) over a typical working day in ten minutes intervals. 8 Thus, the main advantage of the GTUS over the GSOEP is the more precise and detailed information on individuals’ time spent on different housework activities. That said, its main disadvantages compared to the GSOEP are two: Firstly, {{it is only a}} cross-sectional data set and thus does not allow us to run FE wage regressions and, secondly, monthly <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> included are interval-censored with intervals’ width being € 100, thereby adding noise to our dependent variable.|$|E
40|$|Introduction] This data {{documentation}} describes selected ways {{of how to}} analyze <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> in the weakly anonymous Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies 1975 - 2010 (SIAB) or other administrative data sets provided by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Among other things, these data sets provide information about dependently employed persons in Germany and their gross wages over time. Due to {{the large number of}} included observations, the data sets are often used in empirical studies of the German labor market. However, <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> are not reported in the data sets and important income tax-relevant characteristics which would allow for a simulation of individual tax burdens are not included. Therefore, labor market studies based on IAB data that want to take effects of (income) taxation into account must impute the tax burdens as a first step of their analyses. This {{data documentation}} discusses different ways to perform this imputation and compares their ability to produce reliable predictions...|$|E

In the case of employer social contributions, they can be borne by the employers (ultimately reducing the firm’s profits), they can be shifted backwards to employees (reducing <b>net</b> <b>wages),</b> or they can be shifted forward to consumers (increasing the price level).

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of a widely-used French {{training}} programme for youth on earnings. This programme is designed to increase labour market experience and education, validated by a formal diploma. It is not sure, however, whether this diploma and a similar diploma acquired through initial training have the same effect on post-training wages. To answer this question, we contrast the 2003 <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> of a group of participants enrolled in 1998 (the “treatment” group) to the 2003 <b>net</b> <b>wages</b> of a control group. The controls are individuals who completed their initial training in 1998 with diplomas similar to those obtained by the treated {{at the end of the}} programme. Using propensity score matching, we find a significantly positive effect of the treatment on the treated: participants in the programme benefit, five years after participation, from a positive wage premium. This suggests that firms do not simply value education: they value it more if it is coupled with some degree of labour market experience. active labour market policies; training programmes for youth; propensity score matching. ...|$|E
30|$|As {{result of}} the comparison, the {{following}} findings should be emphasized. First, the <b>net</b> <b>wage</b> in a destination country exerts a much larger {{positive effect on the}} migrant inflows than the public social expenditures. The coefficients in specification (5) indicate an effect of the <b>net</b> <b>wage</b> which is about 14 times as large as the effect of the welfare state variable. In addition, the standard error of the welfare state coefficient points to a statistical insignificance of the effect. Under the assumption that the findings in specification (4) most accurately describe the reality, the effect of the <b>net</b> <b>wage</b> is still three times as large as the effect of the social expenditure variable. In the case of the net replacement rate and the annual replacement income, the gap lies between those two extremes 23. Secondly, restricting the freedom of movement almost completely offsets the migration incentives of the pull factors, but does not seem to counterbalance the effects from changing push factor variables in the source countries.|$|R

50|$|Bovenberg and Mooij {{establish}} that households consume a dirty good (D) and a clean good (C). If the government taxes D, it {{can use the}} earned revenue to lower the labor income tax. At the same time, the tax levied on the firm will increase the price of D. The lowered income tax and the higher consumer prices even each other out, stabilizing the real <b>net</b> <b>wage.</b> But because C’s price has not changed and it can substitute for D, consumers will buy C instead of D. Suddenly the government’s environmental tax base has eroded and its revenue with it. The government then cannot afford to keep the labor income tax down.
