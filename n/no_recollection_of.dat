5|$|President Reagan {{appeared}} before the Tower Commission on December 2, 1986, to answer questions regarding {{his involvement in the}} affair. When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals, he first stated that he had; later, he appeared to contradict himself by stating that he had <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> doing so. In his 1990 autobiography, An American Life, Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, {{and the two}} chat in a hot tub. While {{reaching}} for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{discussed}} the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine, {{during which he}} recalls that his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months. After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her; author Peter Doggett comments that, because {{of the severity of}} this news, Harrison would later have <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> how he heard of John Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with his}} new EP “微光”, a music film was also {{produced}} by the same music company featuring his EP tracks in the film. Starring Yida Huang and Tang Yan, the film centers around Yida Huang's various mystery encounters with Tang Yan although he has <b>no</b> <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> her.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} season, the Haitian works for Mr. Bennet and Primatech Paper, though he ignores {{the order to}} mind-wipe Claire. Even though he takes the {{memories}} of Matt Parkman and Ted Sprague, they still remember the Haitian himself, just not the event; victims without powers, like Sandra Bennet, Lyle Bennet, and Zach, exhibit <b>no</b> <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> the Haitian, however.|$|R

5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca). Katherine had known Susan before moving away under mysterious circumstances. Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane. Later, in a cryptic conversation, Adam asks Katherine if {{they made a mistake}} in moving back, and Katherine reminds him {{that they did not have}} a choice.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hillenburg {{was born}} on August21, 1961, at Fort Sill, a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, KellyN. HillenburgJr. (July16, 1936 August30, 2006), {{was working for the}} U.S. military. His mother, Nancy (née Dufour), taught visually-impaired students. When he was a year old, the family moved to Orange County, California where his father began a career as a {{draftsman}} and designer in the aerospace industry. His younger brother, Bryan, followed in their father's footsteps, becoming a draftsman and designer. Hillenburg has <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> life in Oklahoma, having grown up in Anaheim, California.|$|E
50|$|The {{identity}} of Mizuki's ghost {{when she was}} in a coma. Eve had <b>no</b> <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> who she was but remembered that Adam was her lover, and that she must find him. She eventually started to remember little memories of being Sayaka Kamijou which confuses the four children as they knew that Eve was actually Mizuki. It is Sayaka who in a way possessed Mizuki's body. Only Hotaru could see her.|$|R

5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{was born}} on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he {{was three years old}} seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he {{mentioned}} in his letters that he had <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E

5|$|Scully cuts {{her hand}} on the thorn of a twig left in her car. When she drives off, a veve is seen on the ground under her car. Mulder has a meeting with X, who tells him that he and Scully will soon be called back to Washington and that the camp will be {{restricted}} to military personnel only. Mulder believes Wharton is persecuting the refugees after the suicide of some of his men during a previous trip to Haiti. Scully finds Dunham dead in a bathtub, and Mulder catches McAlpin with a knife nearby. Although he has <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the event, McAlpin confesses to the murder under the influence of Wharton, who tells the agents that Bauvais committed suicide and that their investigation is over.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E

50|$|A strange human, Nohiro has healing {{powers that}} far surpass {{that of any}} known faerie or elf. He has <b>no</b> <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> his past apart from a vague memory of the Spirit Tribe. This has set off his quest {{to find out about}} the {{disappearance}} of the faeries and to save them from total destruction (and, of course, to wed a pretty elfin girl). He is also mysteriously connected to Rath and, therefore, to Zoma, although, when asked, Rath denied ever hearing of him. Very kindhearted, Nohiro is just learning how to use his powers and is currently traveling the land and working odd jobs in an attempt to earn money for his voyage. He also seems rather fond of Rune.|$|R

50|$|Norfolk was {{historically}} {{part of the}} slave-holding South, and {{was later}} segregated along racial lines until the 1960s. This has led to racial tensions within the highly diversified city that {{have been slow to}} heal. Nevertheless, racial tensions have been slowly subsiding overtime as younger generations who have <b>no</b> first-hand <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> segregation have reached adulthood and started families of their own.|$|R
50|$|A {{few days}} later Regan, who is now back to her normal self, prepares to leave for Los Angeles with her mother. Although Regan has <b>no</b> {{apparent}} <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> her possession, she gives Father Dyer a kiss, a likely hint at posthumous thanks to Father Merrin and Father Karras. Kinderman, who narrowly misses their departure, befriends Father Dyer as he investigates Karras's death.|$|R
25|$|Ronald W. Clark, in his 1984 {{biography}} of Darwin, commented that Only the transparent honesty of Darwin's character... {{makes it possible}} to believe that by the 1850s he had <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> Matthew's work. This begs the question, for it assumes he did read Matthew's book. Clark continues by suggesting: If Darwin had any previous knowledge of Arboriculture, it had slipped down into the unconscious.|$|E

On 24 October 1973 Pintarić shot her dead {{through the window of}} his brother's house and fled into the night. Again, Pintarić was drunk when he committed the crime, and had <b>no</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the event on the following day.

40|$|Adult {{questionnaire}} respondents reported, {{for each}} {{of a number of}} events, if they had experienced that event during childhood and, if so, if they remembered the experience or merely knew it had happened. Respondents also rated the emotion of each event and judged whether they would remember more about each reportedly experienced event if they spent more time trying to do so. Study 1 respondents were 96 undergraduates, whereas Study 2 tested 93 community members ranging widely in age. Respondents often reported <b>no</b> <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> reportedly experienced events. Reportedly experienced events rated as emotional were more often recollected than those rated as neutral, and those rated as positive were more often recollected than those rated as negative. Predicted ability to remember more was related to current memory. Claims of remembering reportedly experienced events increased with age, but predicted ability to remember more about them declined with age. ...|$|R
