50|$|From 1948 to 1950, Hurst {{worked with}} Ritchie {{to develop a}} fast neutron survey meter and fast <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> The fast <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimetry</b> work {{continued}} throughout the 1950s with the added interest in tissue dose. In 1952, the team of Hurst, D.J. Knowles and C. Yochem worked to develop a thermal neutron survey instrument. Hurst and F.M. Glass developed a method of pulse integration by utilizing the binary scaling unit. Hurst explored fast <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimetry</b> and tissue-equivalent phantoms. His team that included J.A.

In 1956 and again in 1980, Hurst utilized threshold detectors to measure neutron spectra in order to determine tissue dose.In 1961, Hurst led a group that performed measurements of the absorbed dose of neutrons, and of mixed radiation field of neutrons and gamma rays. This resulted in the publication of Handbook 75 for the National Bureau of Standards.|$|E

50|$|In the {{radiation}} detection application, CR-39 {{is used as}} a Solid-State Nuclear Track Detector to detect the presence of ionising radiation. Energetic particles colliding with the polymer structure leave a trail of broken chemical bonds within the CR-39. When immersed in a concentrated alkali solution (typically sodium hydroxide) hydroxide ions attack and break the polymer structure, etching away the bulk of the plastic at a nominally fixed rate. However, along the paths of damage left by charged particle interaction the concentration of radiation damage allows the chemical agent to attack the polymer more rapidly than it does in the bulk, revealing the paths of the charged particle ion tracks. The resulting etched plastic therefore contains a permanent record of not only the location of {{the radiation}} on the plastic but also gives spectroscopic information about the source. Principally used for the detection of alpha radiation emitting radionuclides (especially radon gas), the radiation-sensitivity properties of CR39 are also used for proton and <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimetry</b> and historically cosmic ray investigations.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Chang'E 4 is {{the next}} Chinese mission to the Moon and is planned {{to land on the}} far side of the Moon in the South Pole Aitken Basin. The mission {{consists}} of a lander, a rover, and a communication relay. Here we describe the Lunar Lander <b>Neutrons</b> & <b>Dosimetry</b> experiment (LND) which will be placed on the lander. It consists of a stack of 10 segmented Si solid-state detectors (SSDs) which forms a particle telescope to measure charged particles (electrons 150 - 500 keV, protons 12 - 30 MeV, and heavier nuclei 15 - 30 MeV/nuc). A special geometrical arrangement allows observations of fast neutrons (and γ-rays) which are also important for dosimetry and cosmic-ray exposure of lunar soils. Thermal neutrons are measured using a very thin Gd conversion foil which is sandwiched between two SSDs. Thermal neutrons are sensitive to subsurface water and important to understand lunar surface mixing processes...|$|R
40|$|Polymer gel {{dosimeters}} are fabricated from radiation sensitive chemicals which, upon irradiation, polymerize as {{a function}} of the absorbed radiation dose. These gel dosimeters, with the capacity to uniquely record the radiation dose distribution in three-dimensions (3 D), have specific advantages when compared to one-dimensional dosimeters, such as ion chambers, and two-dimensional dosimeters, such as film. These advantages are particularly significant in dosimetry situations where steep dose gradients exist such as in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery. Polymer gel dosimeters also have specific advantages for brachytherapy dosimetry. Potential dosimetry applications include those for low-energy x-rays, high-linear energy transfer (LET) and proton therapy, radionuclide and boron capture <b>neutron</b> therapy <b>dosimetries.</b> These 3 D dosimeters are radiologically soft-tissue equivalent with properties that may be modified depending on the application.

The fundamental science underpinning polymer gel dosimetry is reviewed along with the various evaluation techniques. Clinical dosimetry applications of polymer gel dosimetry are also presented. 63 page(s...|$|R
