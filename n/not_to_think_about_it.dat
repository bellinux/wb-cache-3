5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{think about}} it? Why am I <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> What else have I {{got to think}} of? Tell me at once, Clara, what she has done. You ought to have written to me {{directly}} the will was made known." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I said that," [...] he {{answered}} slowly; [...] "I was feelin' a bit low. You can't help it sometimes; it's the thing comin' on you, {{and no way}} out of it--that's what gets over you. We try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> as a rule." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ironic process {{theory is}} also {{the basis for the}} mind game known as [...] "The Game", which {{constitutes}} trying <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the Game.|$|R
2500|$|Juliana Hatfield's song [...] "Trying <b>Not</b> <b>To</b> <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> It" [...] {{from the}} album Please Do Not Disturb was {{written about the}} death of Jeff Buckley.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the Colonel interrupted, [...] "that {{was to be}} {{our lunch}} hour. I {{remember}} saying that when I came back I would have----Oh, Lord, it's best <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't grieve {{too deeply}} about yesterday! Try and forget that horrible parting, {{and all that}} brought it about. He has not spoken of it since, except {{to tell me that}} I must never know more of your fault and your misfortune, than the little--the very little--I know already. And I have {{resolved}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> as well as not to ask about it, for the future. I have a hope already, Basil--very, very far off fulfilment--but still a hope. Can you not think what it is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She made {{no direct}} {{rejoinder}} to this, but {{she asked him}} about his mother and sisters, what news he received from the South. [...] "Have they any happiness?" [...] she inquired, rather as if she warned him to {{take care not to}} pretend they had. He neglected her warning to the point of saying that there was one happiness they always had--that of having learned <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> too much, and {{to make the best of}} their circumstances. She listened to this with an air of great reserve, and apparently thought he had wished to give her a lesson; for she suddenly broke out, [...] "You mean that you have traced a certain line for them, and that that's all you know about it!" ...|$|E
60|$|He saw {{the pain}} come into Lawson's eyes, {{he could not}} help it, he was sorry, but he had to think of himself; he could not bear the thought of {{discussing}} his situation, he could endure it only by determining resolutely <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He was afraid of his weakness if once he began to open his heart. Moreover, he took irresistible dislikes to the places where he had been miserable: he remembered the humiliation he had endured when he had waited in that studio, ravenous with hunger, for Lawson to offer him a meal, and the last occasion when he had taken the five shillings off him. He hated the sight of Lawson, because he recalled those days of utter abasement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Senor teniente,' he said thickly, {{and as if}} {{very much}} cast down, 'do not ask me about the senorita, for I prefer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her at all when I am amongst you.' ...|$|R
50|$|Reflecting back on {{his career}} and its three knee surgeries, Sampson {{admitted}} that he had attempted to come back too quickly from them, and said that he tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what could have been.|$|R
2500|$|Grace {{told the}} Observer {{she had not}} looked into the case in many years and [...] "tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] She said she made her {{previous}} statements about the case [...] "with the knowledge I had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is what puzzles me. Alexis thinks Mr. White has a {{right to}} expect me to improve myself, and not go on for ever making white jessamines with {{malachite}} leaves, and that he can look after Maura and Petros. I see, too, that I ought to try to recover, or I might be a burthen on Alexis for ever, and hinder all his better hopes. Then, there's the not liking to accept a favour after Mr. White said such things, though I ought <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> since he made that apology; but it is a horrid feeling that I ought not to affront him {{for the sake of the}} others. Altogether I do feel so tossed. I can't get back the feeling I had when I was ill that I need not worry, for that God will decide.' ...|$|E
60|$|Marjorie {{would have}} {{preferred}} that Mr. Magnet should not have decided with such relentless determination to make his second proposal on the church tower. His purpose was luminously clear {{to her from the}} beginning of lunch onward, and she could feel her nerves going under the strain of that long expectation. She tried to pull herself together, tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> tried to be amused by the high spirits and nonsense of Mr. Wintersloan and Syd and Rom and Theodore; but Mr. Magnet was very pervasive, and her mother didn't ever look at her, looked past her and away from her and all round her, in a profoundly observant manner. Marjorie felt chiefly anxious {{to get to the top}} of that predestinate tower and have the whole thing over, and it was with a start that she was just able to prevent one of the assiduous waiters filling her glass with champagne for the third time.|$|E
60|$|Poor Oliver was fretful and restless, {{insisting on}} being brought {{down to his}} study to watch over the packing of his papers, and miserable at being unable to arrange them himself. Even the tenderest pity for him could not prevent him from being an {{exceeding}} trial; and James could hardly yet have endured it, but for pleasure and interest in watching his sister's lively good-humour, saucy and determined when {{the old man was}} unreasonable, and caressing and affectionate, when he was violent in his impotence; never seeming to hear, see, or regard anything unkind or unpleasant; and absolutely pleased and gratified when her uncle, in his petulance, sometimes ungraciously rejected her services in favour of those of 'Roland,' who, he took it for granted, must, as a man, have more sense. It would sometimes cross James, how would Isabel and the children fare with this ill-humour; but he had much confidence in his wife's sweet calm temper, and more in the obvious duty; and, on the whole, he believed it was better <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't he recover?" [...] asked Gertrude. [...] "It's {{all in a}} person's mind. If he'd {{only make}} up his mind <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her the thing would be done, and there would be nothing the matter with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> those guns," [...] said Clarissa, {{seeing that}} his eye, passing over the waves, still sought the land meditatively, [...] "or about navies, or empires, or anything." [...] So saying {{she opened the}} book and began to read: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The only plan is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{ourselves}} at all," [...] said Mrs. May. [...] "Affection {{is round}} us like sunshine, {{and there is}} no use in measuring and comparing. We must give it out freely ourselves, hoping for nothing again." ...|$|R
60|$|Electricity, {{though it}} was perhaps the earlier of the two to be studied, invaded the common life of men a few decades after the {{exploitation}} of steam. To electricity also, {{in spite of its}} provocative nearness all about him, mankind had been utterly blind for incalculable ages. Could anything be more emphatic than the appeal of electricity for attention? It thundered at man's ears, it signalled to him in blinding flashes, occasionally it killed him, and he could not see it as a thing that concerned him enough to merit study. It came into the house with the cat on any dry day and crackled insinuatingly whenever he stroked her fur. It rotted his metals when he put them together.... There is no single record that any one questioned why the cat's fur crackles or why hair is so unruly to brush on a frosty day, before the sixteenth century. For endless years man seems to have done his very successful best <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all; until this new spirit of the Seeker turned itself to these things.|$|E
50|$|Dan tells Blair he's {{tired of}} lying to people about them hanging out but Blair convinces him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Chuck sees them enter a nondescript building.|$|E
5000|$|The young actors portraying Mew and Tong {{both had}} {{difficulties}} with the kissing scene. Mario Maurer, who portrayed Tong, {{was nervous about}} the role. [...] "I've never kissed a man and kissing {{is not something you}} do every day," [...] he said in an interview. [...] "My father said it was just a job and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'She {{never made}} {{one in her}} life and I never saw one,' says Uncle Emsley, soothing. 'Calm down now, Jud--calm down. You've got excited, and that wound in your head is contaminating your sense of intelligence. Try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> pancakes.' ...|$|R
30|$|The third {{attitude}} is {{the avoidance of}} future thinking (i.e., ‘I prefer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> future’). Although recent evidence has shown that avoidance—in both cognitive and behavioural processes—and depression are significantly correlated [29]. The avoidant attitude seems to be completely independent from temperament.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Release the {{distraction}} by <b>not</b> continuing <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|Another time he {{appeared}} as a patient. He told Lucy about how Beethoven wrote his great Ninth Symphony, but as he was deaf, he never got to hear it {{and every time he}} thinks about it, it makes him sad. Lucy simply replies with, [...] "Try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> five cents, please!" [...] After he leaves, she remarks, [...] "Some cases are relatively simple".|$|E
5000|$|Katherine Waterston as Janet [...] "Danny" [...] Daniels, {{the chief}} of {{terraforming}} for the Covenant mission and the wife/widow of the ships captain, Jacob Branson. Shes the third in command after Branson and Oram. Waterston said she {{was well aware of}} the comparisons that were going to be made between her and Sigourney Weavers Ellen Ripley, but that she tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> too much while filming for fear of being intimidated.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2009 World Championship MacKenzie {{announced}} {{that if he}} did not qualify for the event he would hang up his cue and retire from the game for good:"I'll try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and I'll approach it the way I would any normal tournament. ... But I imagine if I'm sitting in the chair one frame away from getting beat and knowing it is my last ever tournament, there will be a few things swirling around my head." [...] Mackenzie lost in the first qualifying round, 10-9 to Wayne Cooper.|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. I shall <b>not</b> have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{that when}} we are married.|$|R
60|$|He {{had done}} his best <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her at all, but the {{situation}} and his sister had become altogether too urgent. He had finally put aside The Lilac Sunbonnet, gone into his study, lit the gas fire, and written the letter that had brought these unsatisfactory relations to a head.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{the letter}} as {{touching}} on matters that he preferred <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> stung {{him into a}} fit of frenzy that lasted {{for a day and}} night. When his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more, body and soul together seemed to be dropping without check through the darkness.|$|R
5000|$|He added, [...] "After A {{wrote the}} post drunk, she checked it again {{a few hours}} later and said that she thought she made a mistake. Since she wrote it in a {{personal}} space, I didn't think there would be any problems. I told her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and hung up. I don't want to sue an old friend. If the writings are true, I'd be embarrassed, but I didn't live my life like that. But it's true that MR.MR's image was hurt by this. So I decided to leave MR.MR." ...|$|E
5000|$|On September 14, 1966, she {{suffered}} a terrible accident in her apartment. After taking a sleeping pill, {{she fell asleep}} in her bed with a lit cigarette. She was badly wounded and her right hand almost had to be amputated. [...] The fire I suffered a while back partially destroyed my right hand. My legs were marked forever. What happened was very sad and I prefer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> All I {{can say is that}} I spent three days in hell, where—so they say—bad people go after death. I don't consider myself bad and I experienced it while still alive.|$|E

6000|$|... 'She {{could not}} know he did not deserve it,' said the young bride, ready to resent it for her husband, since his brother did not, then again excusing her mother. 'It was all her care for me, dear mamma! She told me <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it; but I could not help it! Indeed I could not!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At this {{friendly}} {{question his}} aspect changed. He {{looked at me}} from under his eyebrows with the heavy, dull glance of a guasso--of a peasant. 'Senor teniente,' he said, thickly, and as if very much cast down, 'do not ask me about the senorita, for I prefer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her at all when I am amongst you." ...|$|R
60|$|One was {{her almost}} affianced lover, Will Magnet, the humorous writer. She {{had been doing}} her best <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> him all day, but now he became an {{unavoidable}} central fact. She regarded him with an almost perplexed scrutiny, and wondered vividly why {{she had been so}} excited and pleased by his attentions during the previous summer.|$|R
