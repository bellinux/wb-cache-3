25|$|Eyes: The eye can be {{directly}} affected {{in the form of}} episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct blockage is important.|$|E
25|$|In the midline of the nose, the septum is a {{composite}} (osseo-cartilaginous) structure that divides the nose into two (2) similar halves. The lateral nasal wall and the paranasal sinuses, the superior concha, the middle concha, and the inferior concha, form the corresponding passages, the superior meatus, the middle meatus, and the inferior meatus, on the lateral nasal wall. The superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid bone cells and the sphenoid sinus; the middle meatus provides drainage for the anterior ethmoid sinuses and for the maxillary and frontal sinuses; and the inferior meatus provides drainage for the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct.|$|E
25|$|Dilophosaurus sinensis {{was shown}} to be a junior synonym of Sinosaurus in 2003. It is {{possibly}} closer to the Antarctic theropod Cryolophosaurus, {{based on the fact that}} the anterior end of the jugal does not participate in the internal antorbital fenestra and that the maxillary tooth row is completely in front of the eye socket. D. sinensis was exhibited in 1998 at Dinofest in Philadelphia. Although the skull of D. sinensis sports large <b>nasolacrimal</b> crests superficially like those reconstructed in D. wetherilli, features elsewhere in the skeleton suggest it is closer to tetanuran theropods. Rauhut (2003) regarded D. sinensis as a basal tetanuran most closely related to Sinosaurus and Cryolophosaurus. Lamanna et al. (1998b) examined the material ascribed to D. sinensis and found it to be synonymous with Sinosaurus triassicus. This cladistic finding was confirmed in 2003 by Dong.|$|E
500|$|Their long floppy ears {{can mean}} that the inner ear does not receive a {{substantial}} air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and {{this can lead to}} ear infections. Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in beagles are glaucoma and corneal dystrophy. [...] "Cherry eye", a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid, and distichiasis, a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery. They can suffer from several types of retinal atrophy. Failure of the <b>nasolacrimal</b> drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rauhut (2000), Dilophosaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: a lacrimal bone with a thickened dorso-posterior rim; cervical vertebrae that have neural spines with a distinct central [...] "cap" [...] and an anterior and posterior [...] "shoulder"; a scapular blade with a squared distal expansion; the presence of thin, paired <b>nasolacrimal</b> crests extending vertically from skull roof, each with a fingerlike posterior projection (according to Carrano, 2012) ...|$|E
2500|$|FHV-1 {{also has}} a predilection for corneal epithelium, {{resulting}} in corneal ulcers, often pinpoint or dendritic in shape. [...] Other ocular signs of FHV-1 infection include conjunctivitis, keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (decreased tear production), and corneal sequestra. [...] Infection of the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct can result in chronic epiphora (excess tearing). [...] Ulcerative skin disease can also result from FHV-1 infection. [...] FHV-1 can also cause abortion in pregnant queens, usually at the sixth week of gestation, although {{this may be due}} to systemic effects of the infection rather than the virus directly.|$|E
2500|$|Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome, or EEC, {{and also}} {{referred}} to as EEC syndrome (also known as [...] "Split hand–split foot–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome") is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as an genetic trait. EEC is characterized by the triad of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. Other features noted in association with EEC include vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, obstruction of the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct, decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, photophobia, occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
2500|$|The horse's {{respiratory}} system {{consists of the}} nostrils, pharynx, larynx, trachea, diaphragm, and lungs. Additionally, the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct and sinuses {{are connected to the}} nasal passage. The horse's {{respiratory system}} not only allows the animal to breathe, but also is important in the horse's sense of smell (olfactory ability) as well as in communicating. [...] The soft palate blocks off the pharynx from the mouth (oral cavity) of the horse, except when swallowing. This helps prevent the horse from inhaling food, but also means that a horse cannot use its mouth to breathe when in respiratory distress—a horse can only breathe through its nostrils, also called obligate nasal breathing. [...] For this same reason, horses also cannot pant as a method of thermoregulation. [...] The genus Equus also has a unique part of the respiratory system called the guttural pouch, which is thought to equalize air pressure on the tympanic membrane. Located between the mandibles but below the occiput, it fills with air when the horse swallows or exhales.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nasolacrimal</b> duct {{obstruction}} (NLDO) is the {{obstruction of}} <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct {{and may be}} either congenital or acquired. Obstruction of the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct leads to the excess overflow of tears called epiphora.|$|E

50|$|Obstruction of the punctum, <b>nasolacrimal</b> canal, or <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct {{can cause}} even normal levels of basal tear to {{overflow}} onto the face (epiphora), giving {{the appearance of}} constant psychic tearing. This can have significant social consequences.|$|E
50|$|The <b>naso{{lacrimal}}</b> duct (sometimes {{called the}} tear duct) carries tears from the lacrimal sac {{of the eye}} into the nasal cavity. The duct begins in the eye socket between the maxillary and lacrimal bones, from where it passes downwards and backwards. The opening of the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct into the inferior nasal meatus of the nasal cavity is partially covered by a mucosal fold (valve of Hasner or plica lacrimalis). Excess tears flow through <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct which drains into the inferior nasal meatus.|$|E
5000|$|Other related {{conditions}} on the eyelids include chalazion ( [...] a granulomatous reaction to sebaceous glands on the eyelid), lacrimal duct cysts (cysts related to tear ducts) and <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct cysts (the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct drains tears into the nose via a punctum on the lower eyelid).|$|E

50|$|On {{the nasal}} {{surface of the}} body of the maxilla, in front of the opening of the sinus is a deep groove, the {{lacrimal}} groove (or lacrimal sulcus), which is converted into the <b>nasolacrimal</b> canal, by the lacrimal bone and inferior nasal concha; this canal opens into the inferior meatus of the nose and transmits the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct.|$|E
50|$|The {{lacrimal}} sac or lachrymal sac is the upper dilated {{end of the}} <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct, and is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lacrimal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. It connects the lacrimal canaliculi, which drain tears from the eye's surface, and the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct, which conveys this fluid into the nasal cavity.|$|E
50|$|Dacryocystitis is an {{infection}} of the lacrimal sac, secondary to obstruction of the <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct at the junction of lacrimal sac. The term derives from the Greek dákryon (tear), cysta (sac), and -itis (inflammation). It causes pain, redness, and swelling over the inner aspect of the lower eyelid and epiphora. When <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct obstruction is secondary to a congenital barrier it {{is referred to as}} dacrocystocele. It is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common complication is corneal ulceration, frequently in association with S. pneumoniae. The mainstays of treatment are oral antibiotics, warm compresses, and relief of <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct obstruction by dacryocystorhinostomy.|$|E

In infants with <b>nasolacrimal</b> defects, a <b>nasolacrimal</b> duct probe is used and a tube replacement, either temporary (Crawford) or permanent (Jones), is carried out. A surgical procedure called a dacryocystorhinostomy is done to join the lacrimal sac to the nasal mucosa in order to restore lacrimal drainage.|$|E
