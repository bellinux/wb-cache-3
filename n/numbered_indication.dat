As is customary in European countries, all signs are partly or fully reflectorized or are provided with their own night-time illumination.|$|R
30|$|Surprisingly, {{none of the}} indexes {{presented}} {{strong correlation}} with the <b>number</b> of <b>indications.</b> This result was not expected because it is generally accepted {{that the number of}} citations is a good predictor to the quality of research work and, thus, prominent researchers might be those with a strong number of citations. On the other hand, correlations with eigenvector scores are higher and more significant than correlations based on the <b>number</b> of <b>indications.</b> We observe strong correlation between the centrality score and citations indexes, especially those collected from 2009 to 2013. Therefore, eigenvector score seems to be a better predictor of researcher influence than the <b>number</b> of <b>indications</b> itself.|$|R

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to notice that the seven most cited researchers compose alone a fully connected graph (all vertices can be reached from any given one), denoting mutual recognition of the other researcher’s contribution to the field. These researchers alone received 85 indications (59  % of the total <b>number</b> of <b>indications).</b>|$|R
30|$|We also {{calculated}} the correlation (Spearman) between {{the percentage of}} papers with the previous supervisor and the <b>number</b> of <b>indications</b> received by the researcher. Data presented a very small negative correlation (− 0.02), which was once again surprising since we would expect more indications to people that are independent of their previous supervisor.|$|R

40|$|IVIG is {{essential}} therapy for a rapidly expanding number of debilitating and life-threatening conditions. The evidence-based use of IVIG from an American perspective was reviewed in 2006 by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) [1], {{and has been}} simi-larly considered elsewhere [2 – 4]. The <b>number</b> of clinical <b>indications</b> supported by at least some experimental evi-dence, however, is increasing. Future evidence-based lists of diseases advantageously modified by IVIG {{are likely to continue}} increasing in scope and may eventually include subsets of patients affected by common debilitating illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease [5, 6]. Given the <b>number</b> of <b>indications</b> for therapeutic immunoglobulin and the diversity of related clinical fields, careful consideration of the useful-ness of IVIG in each condition is warranted.

500|$|In a {{prominently}} placed TV interview , Andreas von Bülow {{said it was}} a [...] "Medienmasche" [...] (media scam) {{to accuse}} him of anti-Semitism. He denied that he ever said or believed anything about [...] "Jews" [...] being warned of the attacks (one of the urban legends). He said such claims were nonsense. He confirmed, however, that in his opinion a <b>number</b> of <b>indications</b> exist which point to some sort of connection between the Israeli Mossad and the act and perpetrators of 9/11.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the years}} we have {{accumulated}} a large <b>number</b> of <b>indications</b> for physics beyond the standard model. This new physics is often sought-after at high masses and energies. Here collider experiments can bring decisive insights. However, over recent years {{it has become increasingly}} clear that new physics can also appear at low energy, but extremely weak coupling. Experiments and observations at this `low energy frontier' therefore provide a powerful tool to gain insight into fundamental physics, which is complementary to accelerators...|$|R
40|$|The <b>number</b> of <b>indications</b> for {{the medical}} use of {{melatonin}} is slowly increasing. Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and is a key signal in the circadian rhythm of the body. Melatonin plays an obvious role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sleep disorders and jetlag. Recent research has also demonstrated its favourable effect on blood-pressure regulation. By analogy, melatonin {{may play a role}} in a variety of other circadian processes.

The gel-to-liquid-crystal transition occurs near 35 -degrees-C, the melting temperature T(m). The dependences of heat capacity on temperature near T(m) are analysed to yield related enthalpies of transition and patch numbers which record the number of DDP monomers which melt co-operatively.

50|$|The {{genealogy}} of Phèdre gives a <b>number</b> of <b>indications</b> as to her character's destiny. Descended from Helios, {{god of the}} Sun, and Pasiphaë, she nevertheless avoids {{being in}} the judgmental presence of the sun throughout the play. The simultaneous absence of a god-figure combined with the continual presence of one has been extensively explored in Lucien Goldmann's Le Dieu caché. This sense of patriarchal judgment is extended to Phèdre's father, Minos, {{who is responsible for}} weighing the souls of the dead upon their arrival in Hades.|$|R
