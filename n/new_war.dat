5|$|In late 1401, the <b>new</b> <b>war</b> {{against the}} Order {{overstretched}} {{the resources of}} the Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław's brothers, the malcontent Švitrigaila, chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.|$|E
40|$|Münkler 2005). Although many {{scholars}} {{use it in}} various ways, there are several common characteristics. According to Mary Kaldor, the <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> can be contrasted with earlier wars {{in terms of their}} goals, the methods of warfare and how they are financed (Kaldor, 2006 : 7). The first characteristic of the <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> is its goals. While old wars were about the geo-political or ideological goals, <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> are about the identity. Other scholars point out that <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> are waged because of greed rather than grievance and that the war itself becomes the purpose (Berdal and Malone, 2000) (F 0 a). The second characteristic of the <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> is the changed mode of warfare. As a breakdown of public authority blurs the distinction between public and private combatants, and between combatants and civilians, civilian casualties are increasing and civilians are sometimes deliberately targeted as an object of wars(F 0 b). The third one is the relation between <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> and global economy. The state failures and the civil wars are usually driven by global war economy. It seems plausible that the <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> are emerging. However if we look at wars in detail, we can find out some facts that refute the <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> hypothesis. First...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to review}} the state of art of the <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> debate from 1999 till today. In a {{critical}} reflection it analyses Mary Kaldor’s approach and identifies three core elements that guide the follow-up case study on the Bosnian war. It does so to critically reflect on the political naivety, which welcomed the concept of <b>New</b> <b>Wars</b> {{as a tool to}} justify policies and the lack of scientific accuracy and nobility by several study programmes. The study concludes that, firstly, identity politics are not a unique feature of <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> as Kaldor argues. Rather identity must be considered the main ingredient in each Conflict. Secondly it must be questioned in how far wars today can be compared to their predecessors since the quality those wars are analysed increased tremendously. Peace and Conflict Research are one of these features that came up within the 1960 s as well as a globalised moralisation of war. Thirdly, Kaldor argument of a brutalisation of <b>new</b> <b>wars</b> is falsified. <b>New</b> studies clearly falsify this argument empirically for the Bosnian war. The study infers that ten years after Kaldor introduced the conception of <b>New</b> <b>Wars,</b> there are loads of theoretical and empirical doubts that question the theory as a helpful tool in Peace and Conflict Research...|$|R

He was sent to conclude the treaty that Scipio was arranging. However, he was not content with the task given to him and he started to plan a <b>new</b> <b>war.</b> He addressed the soldiers and congratulated them on their victory and then proposed a <b>new</b> <b>war,</b> against the Galatian Gauls of Asia Minor. The pretext he used for the invasion was that the Galatians had supplied soldiers to the Seleucid army at the Battle of Magnesia. The principal reason for the invasion was Manlius' desire to seize the wealth of the Galatians, who had become rich from plundering their neighbours, and to gain glory for himself.|$|E

5|$|Alboin came to {{the throne}} {{after the death of}} his father, {{sometime}} between 560 and 565. As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign's clan. Shortly afterwards, in 565, a <b>new</b> <b>war</b> erupted with the Gepids, now led by Cunimund, Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian Menander Protector places the blame on Alboin, an interpretation favoured by historian Walter Pohl.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, {{for political and economic}} reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a <b>new</b> <b>war</b> against the French.|$|E
5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance.

Though new projects such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E

5|$|Domitian {{probably}} {{wanted a}} <b>new</b> <b>war</b> against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia {{with two more}} cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. Trajan continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars. Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, importantly, annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.|$|E
5|$|In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in {{accordance}} with a <b>new</b> <b>war</b> establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and one unit in the 'Dutch' type landing ship. The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 hundredweight (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the <b>new</b> <b>war</b> memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|The central {{question}} that this thesis asks {{is what is}} critical about contemporary security theory? This thesis expands upon Beate Jahn's methodological critique of critical international theory (1998) by making {{a case study of}} critical security theory as it has been applied to the post-Cold War world. The case study will focus on the <b>New</b> <b>Wars</b> thesis, which is a widely read and accepted aspect of critical security theory. The <b>New</b> <b>Wars</b> thesis focuses on the Yugoslav break-up and wars, which are held to show why the Cold War security framework is no longer relevant and why security policy needs to be re-conceptualised in terms of an emancipatory and cosmopolitan framework. I argue that the supposedly 'new' nature of some post-Cold War conflicts, which theorists working within the <b>New</b> <b>Wars</b> discourse argue that they have identified in the Yugoslav conflicts, seems rather to reflect {{the way in which the}} discourse is constructed and the particular focus of the theorists instead of the Yugoslav wars and international policy towards it. Rather than the Yugoslav wars offering us a new paradigm for post-Cold War conflict, it seems to be that the <b>New</b> <b>Wars</b> discourse has focused on specific aspects of the conflict to the exclusion of other aspects which would pose a challenge to the discourse. The initial examination of the <b>New</b> <b>Wars</b> discourse seems to suggest that theorists working with the <b>New</b> <b>Wars</b> discourse are not very critical, rather they seem to be closer to problem-solving theorists. Following from the questions raised by the case study of the <b>New</b> <b>Wars,</b> the final chapter expands the scope of enquiry more generally to critical security theory. I will argue that the way in which major international institutions and powers justify and present security policy seems to be similar rather than distinct from much critical security theory. In this context, the question to be asked would seem to be why is it that the most powerful international institutions and states are taking up an emancipatory and cosmopolitan framework and what the implications are. In conclusion it will be argued that the critical theorists engaged with this thesis are not critical theorists,rather it appears that many contemporary critical security theorists are engaging in a problem-solving exercise.
