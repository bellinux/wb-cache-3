5|$|In Pune, {{where the}} {{construction}} industry was badly hit, some local organisations, working for porters, construction workers and casual labourers, {{tried to stop the}} exodus. These organisations set up a National Integration Committee (NIC) and charted out confidence-building measures among the migrants in the city. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage participation of the North Indians in all festivities in the near future. In fact, <b>ninety</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labour force in Pune consists of migrants; 60percent of these come from Bihar and UP. It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in the city.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 22 February 2011 in Hyderabad; <b>ninety</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film {{was shot at}} Ramanaidu Studios in the city. A sequence was filmed at Sri Sita Ramachandra Swamy Temple in Ammapally near Shamshabad, in early March 2011. Scenes with Nani, Samantha, and Sudeep were filmed during the first shooting schedule, which was completed on 16 March. Shooting was disrupted in April by an ongoing labour dispute between film workers and producers. Rajamouli considered moving Eega out of Hyderabad if the strike continued. Filming continued in Kokapet in early September 2011, and principal photography was completed in late February 2012 as post-production began.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the fires}} of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately <b>ninety</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately <b>ninety</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E
5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over <b>ninety</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prey caught.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ninety</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animation-related {{work was}} done in Hyderabad; the {{remaining}} ten percent was completed in the United States. In an Indo-Asian News Service interview, Draper said he collaborated with thirteen experts and a large team of animators to design the fly. Because the film's fly's eyes comprise 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli felt they could make it expressive; he used the 1986 Pixar American short film Luxo Jr. for inspiration. The output of the first team of animators, using the reference material prepared, was unsatisfactory and Rajamouli reworked the fly's detailing. Using a powerful lens, the film team conducted an arduous photographic shoot of unconscious flies in a bottle stored in a refrigerator. After enlarging the details, Rajamouli made cosmetic changes to the fly's face {{to make it look}} appealing onscreen. A new team including Draper, three concept artists, three modellers, two shader designers, two hair and fur designers, three riggers and several animators, designed the animated fly in two months. Its head and fur were designed after shaping its body and wings. The fly was refined daily using clay models to expedite the process. The animators found the sequences between Sudeep and the fly much more difficult to execute because the latter had to express emotions only though its slender arms rather than its face.|$|E
5|$|One of Girdap's notable {{enterprises}} was {{the international}} transport company Transbalkania {{which had a}} capital of 100,000 leva. Of the company's 500 shares, 200 were owned by Girdap and another 170 were owned by three of the bank's managers or employees. Liquidated after World War I, Transbalkania was active as a carrier from Bulgaria to Edirne, Alexandroupoli, Thessaloniki and Niš and along the Danube. During the wars, Girdap was involved in tobacco trade and had warehouses in modern Dupnitsa, Blagoevgrad and Xanthi. This led {{to the establishment of}} another Girdap venture, the Bulgarian Macedonian Bank (Balgarska makedonska banka), on 21 May 1916. The Bulgarian Macedonian Bank was mostly active as a commercial bank, which is indicated by its capital of 46.95 million leva as opposed to only 13.31 million leva of deposits. Other banks more or less related to Girdap included the Sofia Bank (Sofiyska banka, established in 1906), the Bulgarian Forest Commercial Bank (Balgarska gorsko-targovska banka, established in 1917), and the Bulgarian Surety Bank (Balgarska garantsionna banka, established in 1912). The Pleven-based Lev cement factory was founded in 1917 with Girdap board of managers member Ivan Kovachev as chief shareholder. <b>Ninety</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital of the Kurilo mine in the Iskar Gorge was controlled by Girdap or its head figures Ivan Kovachev and Boncho Boev. Despite Girdap's active involvement in assistance to national industry, it failed to make a significant contribution and gradually minimized its participation due to insufficient profits.|$|E
