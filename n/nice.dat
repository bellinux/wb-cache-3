5|$|Ben Arfa {{would be}} ineligible {{to play for}} the club, due to a rule that a player can only play for two clubs in a single season, having already played for both Newcastle United and Hull City. On 3 February, Ben Arfa told a press conference his deal with <b>Nice</b> had been terminated, however, on 9 June, <b>Nice</b> would re-sign Ben Arfa {{at the start of the}} 2015–16 Ligue 1 season.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} in {{the short-term}} management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall. According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (<b>NICE),</b> benzodiazepines {{can be used in}} the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications <b>NICE</b> recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from <b>Nice</b> is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of the <b>Nice</b> specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the <b>Nice</b> specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E

She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call {{in the middle of}} the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for <b>Nice</b> immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.|$|E

The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in <b>Nice,</b> {{and in front of}} the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to be caused by a fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{a revised}} version of the <b>Nice</b> model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In {{this version of the}} <b>Nice</b> model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original <b>Nice</b> model.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1938, van Meegeren moved to <b>Nice,</b> using the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} The Supper at Emmaus to buy a 12-bedroom estate at Les Arènes de Cimiez.

In the nine month between arrival in <b>Nice</b> and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E
