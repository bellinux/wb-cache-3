5|$|In December 1939, Centaur {{underwent}} a minor refit in Hong Kong, with a supercharger and a <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> fitted to the engine. The supercharger {{broke down in}} April 1942, {{and could not be}} repaired because of equipment shortages and restricted dockyard access caused by World War II.|$|E
5|$|K5054 {{was fitted}} with a <b>new</b> <b>propeller,</b> and Summers flew the {{aircraft}} on 10 March 1936; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight, a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire {{was a very good}} aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just 330mph (528km/h), little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hurricane. A new and better-shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348mph (557km/h) in level flight in mid-May, when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). Here, Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes-Jones took over the prototype for the RAF. He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing. Edwardes-Jones' report was positive; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage position indicator. A week later, on 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires, before any formal report had been issued by the A&AEE. Interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis.|$|E
25|$|Variant of 114A {{built by}} Commander Aircraft with <b>new</b> <b>propeller,</b> revised engine cowling and a Lycoming IO-540-T45BD engine.|$|E
5|$|The Patrie {{was then}} {{deflated}} for alterations {{that included the}} addition of a 500cubic metre (17,660ftÂ³) cylindrical section to the gas-bag, a change to the empennage (as mentioned above) and provision of <b>new</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Apogon moored beside [...] on 10 March to {{commence}} refit. The submarine was drydocked at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard from 15-19 March for {{the installation of}} two <b>new</b> <b>propellers.</b> After additional training exercises, she got underway on 2 April.|$|R
25|$|While {{replacing}} propellers {{would be}} the most efficient on ships that are currently under construction, the benefits from <b>newer</b> <b>propeller</b> materials could outweigh costs of replacing current marine propellers. Despite the initial cost of the propellers, this solution costs nothing to operate making it more feasible to shipping around the globe.|$|R
25|$|Improved DA42 {{introduced}} in March 2012 with <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> and aerodynamic clean-ups to the rudder and engine cowling, resulting in greatly increased cruise speed performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine was}} a Rolls-Royce Merlin 47 driving a {{four-bladed}} Rotol propeller of 10ft 9 in (3.27 m) diameter; the <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> provided increased power at high altitudes, where {{the atmosphere is}} much thinner. To help smooth out airflow around the wingtips the standard rounded types were replaced by extended, pointed versions extending the wingspan to 40ft 2 in (12.2 m). Otherwise the wings were Type B.|$|E
25|$|On {{resuming}} service, Smith {{received an}} invitation from the Dutch government to bring the vessel to the Netherlands for a demonstration, which he accepted. On the voyage to the Texel however, Archimedes broke her crankshaft {{and was forced to}} return to England for further repairs, which on this occasion were effected by the firm of Miller, Ravenhill & Co. It was during this refit that the original full helix, single turn, single threaded propeller was replaced by a double-threaded, half turn propeller with two distinct blades. The <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> had the advantage of considerably reducing the ship's vibration at the stern.|$|E
25|$|In the Lazair {{application}} the 185 {{was used}} to drive two propellers stacked together in biplane configuration. This was not done for aerodynamic reasons but rather because the Lazair manufacturer had ample quantities of the nylon propellers on hand for its earlier engines and stacking them was more cost efficient than scrapping them and buying <b>new</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
50|$|She was {{the first}} American {{submarine}} designed (as opposed to modified) under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) for underwater performance rather than surfaced speed and handling. Key features included removing the deck guns, streamlining the outer hull, replacing the conning tower with a sail, installing <b>new</b> <b>propellers</b> designed for submerged operations, installing more air conditioning and a snorkel mast, and doubling the battery capacity.|$|R
50|$|After several delays the Michelangelo, under {{command of}} Senior Captain Mario Crepaz, was finally ready for service in May 1965. During the sea trials some {{vibrations}} were detected on {{the stern of}} the ship. Michelangelo was drydocked in December 1965 and received <b>new</b> <b>propellers</b> and some modifications to her transmission. She clocked 31.59 knots during her post-refit trials, making her the fifth-fastest passenger ship in the world at the time.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> steamer Ogdensburg {{was heading}} the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, {{carrying}} {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled to try and get the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E
25|$|The Griffon engine drove an 11ft (3.35 m) {{diameter}} five-bladed propeller, some 7inches (17.8cm) {{larger than}} that fitted to the Mk XIV. To ensure sufficient ground clearance for the <b>new</b> <b>propeller,</b> the undercarriage legs were lengthened by 4.5". The undercarriage legs also had a 7.75inch (19.7cm) wider track to help improve ground handling. The designers then devised a system of levers to shorten the undercarriage legs by about eight inches as they retracted, because the longer legs {{did not have enough}} space in which to retract. These same levers extended the legs as they came down. The larger diameter four spoke mainwheels were strengthened to cope with the greater weights; post-war these were replaced by wider, reinforced three spoke wheels to allow Spitfires to operate from hard concrete or asphalt runways. When retracted the wheels were now fully enclosed by triangular doors which were hinged to {{the outer edge of the}} wheelwells.|$|E
500|$|... 1916 {{ended on}} a {{personal}} high for McCudden. He received his commission on 28 December which came into effect on 1 January 1917. He was granted two weeks leave and returned to England. As a second lieutenant, McCudden returned to France on 21 January. He was determined to build up his personal tally {{despite the limitations of}} his DH.2. The very same day he was forced down for the first and only time. He attacked a Albatros D.III and damaged its engine which stopped. Unfortunately another attacked and he was forced to break off a certain kill when one of his propeller blades was partly shot off. Another DH.2 intervened and McCudden landed near Arras, ordered a <b>new</b> <b>propeller,</b> and flew back to base. Since no member witnessed the fate of the Albatros no claim was made.|$|E
50|$|Since {{entering}} service, Pilatus {{developed a}} large number of improvements and options upon the original PC-12 model; amongst these changes include increases in the maximum takeoff weight, the use of increasingly powerful engines, the adoption of new avionics, noise-reduction measures, <b>new</b> <b>propellers,</b> speed and range increases, additional interiors, and new inflight entertainment systems. Other aviation firms, such as Finoff Aviation Products, have also produced their own independent products and aftermarket enhancement packages for the PC-12.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} and economic benefits available by incorporation of advanced technologies into the small, short haul air transport were assessed. Low cost structure and advanced composite material, advanced turboprop engines and <b>new</b> <b>propellers,</b> advanced high lift systems and active controls; and alternate aircraft configurations with aft mounted engines were investigated. Improvements in fuel consumed and aircraft economics (acquisition cost and direct operating cost) are available by incorporating selected advanced technologies into the small, short haul aircraft...|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} flew 540 {{missions in}} Mexico - averaging 36 miles per mission. After six weeks, they were done. Their airplanes were worn out, and two had crashed. Four others needed parts and were grounded. For weeks afterward, crew members and pilots had blisters from carving <b>new</b> <b>propellers</b> out of logs. On 20 April 1916, the Army ordered the squadron back to Columbus, N.M. Their only real military success was finding a lost and thirsty cavalry column.|$|R
500|$|A {{variety of}} other tests and other {{projects}} were conducted using MiG-3s. Leading edge slats were evaluated in 1941 although they were not fitted on production aircraft, but were used by the I-210. A six-bladed propeller was fitted on one aircraft to increase thrust at high altitude to enable the fighter to catch the high-flying Junkers Ju 86P aircraft then overflying Moscow. A <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> hub was made that mounted six standard VISh-61 blades, but nothing more is known of the project. Four aircraft were converted to carry AFA-I cameras for evaluation and a fifth was then converted to evaluate all the improvements learned from the first four. It was approved for use after trials at the NII VVS. To improve their service ceiling two aircraft were lightened down to a weight of , but no further details are known other than one reached a height of [...]|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{departure}} from Scapa, the Admiralty decided that Furious should carry out Operation Bellows, to reinforce Malta (known informally as a Club Run) with Spitfires {{at the same}} time as Operation Pedestal. The departure of Furious was delayed by technical difficulties caused by the flight deck, that sloped upwards to a point amidships. A Spitfire made a practice take-off, with wooden wedges in the flaps to ensure a [...] and Furious steaming at , into a [...] wind. The Spitfire was thrown into the air by the rise on the flight deck, bounced onto the forward slope, fell off the front near stalling speed and narrowly avoided ditching. An immediate request was made to the Air Ministry for Constant-speed propellers and two days later, a Spitfire with the <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> took off easily, leaving 38 aircraft still on board to be flown to Malta. In company with , she joined Nelson and the convoy three days before the start of Operation Pedestal.|$|E
500|$|Tintin infiltrates the Soviet {{army and}} warns {{some of the}} kulaks to hide their grain, but the army catches him and {{sentences}} him to death by firing squad. By planting blanks in the soldiers' rifles, Tintin fakes his death {{and is able to}} make his way into the snowy wilderness, where he discovers an underground Bolshevik hideaway in a haunted house. A Bolshevik then captures him and informs him, [...] "You're in the hideout where Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin have collected together wealth stolen from the people!" [...] With Snowy's help, Tintin escapes, commandeers a plane, and flies into the night. The plane crashes, but Tintin fashions a <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> from a tree using a penknife, and continues to Berlin. The OGPU agents appear and lock Tintin in a dungeon, but he escapes with the aid of Snowy, who has dressed himself in a tiger costume. The last OGPU agent attempts to kidnap Tintin, but this attempt is foiled, leaving the agent threatening, [...] "We'll blow up all the capitals of Europe with dynamite!" [...] Tintin returns to Brussels amidst a huge popular reception.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938 Newport News Shipbuilding drydocked and {{extensively}} refurbished California as hull 377. <b>New</b> <b>propellers</b> were fitted. All {{three sisters}} were fireproofed {{to comply with}} Federal safety regulations, which had been revised {{as a result of}} the fire in 1934 that destroyed the liner [...] Californias state rooms were improved, her air conditioning was extended to her tourist class accommodation, a new swimming pool was installed, and her after deck was rebuilt with the addition of a veranda cafÃ©.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, VAW-120 {{received}} its first C-2A Greyhound aircraft upgraded with a <b>new</b> 8-bladed <b>propeller.</b> In addition, VAW-120 received the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.|$|R
50|$|However, this is {{beginning}} to change. The Royal Netherlands Navy for one is starting to experiment with composite materials like resins or carbon fiber. These materials, when formed into a propeller, are flexible enough under pressure to âdeflect,â which can reduce cavitation. Other options are made from carbon fiber, epoxy resin, or even glass, {{and are able to}} produce âa hydro elastic effectâ. Since these <b>new</b> <b>propellers</b> can flex and are not nearly as rigid under pressure, the risk of cavitation is reduced.|$|R
500|$|A revised {{design was}} {{approved}} on 28 February 1938 {{and the first}} ship was to be laid down on 15 July, but even this design was incomplete and would be revised later. Trials with similarly shaped motor launches suggested that the hull's propulsive efficiency would be [...] less than planned, and this was accepted in the November 1938 revision as a maximum speed of [...] However, a <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> design {{proved to be more}} efficient and was predicted to increase speed to [...] Another change was the deletion of the centerline rudder when tests showed that the two wing rudders {{would not be able to}} counteract its effects if it jammed. The weight toward the stern of the boat was calculated to be too great, producing a substantial stern-down trim. To remedy this, the two 100mm turrets mounted on the quarterdeck were deleted and the height of the armor belt abreast the rear turret was lowered, but this decision was reversed and they were restored by a decision of the State Defense Committee on 14 January 1941. This forced a revision of the aircraft arrangements as the aircraft catapult had to be removed from the centerline of the quarterdeck; two catapults were added to the sides of the quarterdeck instead.|$|E
2500|$|... 112A with an {{increased}} maximum takeoff weight, increased wingspan, <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> and larger wheels, 46 built.|$|E
2500|$|The 150B was the 1962 model. It had a <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> that {{increased}} cruise speed by [...] and {{the option of}} a two-passenger child seat for the baggage compartment. 331 [...] "B" [...] models were built. The Commuter version cost US$8,995.|$|E
2500|$|Carrier Strike Group Three {{completed}} its 2005 deployment at Naval Station Norfolk on 31 July 2005, and the carrier [...] began its scheduled 36-month Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH) at the Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard at Newport News, Virginia (pictured). [...] The ship will spend {{nearly two-thirds of}} its RCOH in dry dock to accomplish planned repairs and install the latest technologies in computer software, combat systems, propulsion controls, and aviation support, including the installation of <b>new</b> <b>propellers</b> and a main master for its island superstructure. Following its RCOH, the Vinson became the flagship for Carrier Strike Group One.|$|R
50|$|Bartley also {{developed}} and patented a <b>new</b> self-feathering yacht <b>propeller</b> with John Blundell.|$|R
50|$|The Scout {{was entered}} as a joint project between Skytrader and McDonnell Douglas Helicopter, and was {{selected}} as the winning design, receiving the designation UV-23. Revisions to the original Scout design included blown wings and <b>new</b> <b>propellers</b> and gearboxes to significantly reduce the aircraft's IR and noise signatures. The Skytrader 800 prototype was re-engined at this point, and flew with Turbomeca Astazou XIV turboprops. Before any production of the UV-23 could be undertaken, however, Grizzly Hunter was cancelled and replaced by a different requirement which was won by the RC-7. With the Army order falling through, Skytrader declared bankruptcy with intentions on continuing operations and was liquidated in August 1989.|$|R
2500|$|In 1941 {{he was on}} the USS Washington (BB-56), a [...] as its Damage Control Officer. [...] The Washington was {{commissioned}} on May 15, 1941 and assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. Because of major problems with acute longitudinal vibrations from her propeller shafts delayed full power tests until August 3, 1941. Repairs greatly reduced the vibrations by adding <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> combinations. This greatly reduced tanks, pipes, and other equipment breakages that kept Carpenter and other damage control personnel busy.|$|E
2500|$|When {{word of the}} {{accident}} reached the companyâs office in Klamath Falls, they dispatched the gasoline launch Ewauna to tow the steamer back to the city. [...] Not long before, a similar accident had broken off two propeller blades, and the company had replaced it with its only spare. [...] No new spare propeller had been ordered, and so the steamer {{would have to be}} laid up for about 10 days to await delivery of a <b>new</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With {{the added}} {{weight of the}} bombs and armour, bigger brake discs were fitted to the main wheels. At first this only applied to [...] "Bombphoons", but {{eventually}} all Typhoons used these brakes. After tests conducted in 1943, {{it was determined that}} the Typhoon was capable of carrying a [...] bomb under each wing. With the increased load, it was decided that the extra take-off performance conferred by a four-bladed propeller was an advantage. This led to the adoption of a four-bladed propeller unit (de Havilland or Rotol) from early 1944. Coinciding with the <b>new</b> <b>propeller,</b> it was also decided that the larger tailplanes of the Hawker Tempest were to be fitted when tests showed that they improved the handling characteristics of the Typhoon when carrying [...] bombs. Problems were experienced with oil seal leaks from the <b>new</b> <b>propeller</b> unit {{and a growing number of}} Typhoons were held in Maintenance Units (MUs) awaiting the arrival of new seals from the U.S. Some 200 Typhoons were manufactured with the new Tempest tails and the three-bladed propeller. A modification programme was inaugurated but it took several months before a majority of operational Typhoons had the four-bladed propeller and enlarged tailplane.|$|E

5000|$|During {{its service}} the Sunderland Mark I {{received}} various improvements. The nose turret was upgraded {{with a second}} [...]303 (7.7 mm) gun. <b>New</b> <b>propellers</b> together with pneumatic rubber wing de-icing boots were also fitted. Although the [...]303 guns lacked range and hitting power, the Sunderland had {{a considerable number of}} them and it was a well-built machine that was hard to destroy. On 3 April 1940, a Sunderland operating off Norway was attacked by six German Junkers Ju 88C fighters. It shot one down, damaged another enough to send it off to a forced landing and drove off the rest. The Germans are reputed to have nicknamed the Sunderland the Fliegendes Stachelschwein ("Flying Porcupine") due to its defensive firepower.|$|R
5000|$|Hawkeye 2000s first {{deployed}} in 2003 aboard [...] with VAW-117, the [...] "Wallbangers", and CVW-11. U.S. Navy E-2C Hawkeyes have been upgraded with eight-bladed propellers {{as part of}} the NP2000 program; the first squadron to cruise with the <b>new</b> <b>propellers</b> was VAW-124 [...] "Bear Aces". The Hawkeye 2000 version can track more than 2,000 targets simultaneously (while at the same time, detecting 20,000 simultaneously) to a range greater than 400 mi and simultaneously guide 40-100 air-to-air intercepts or air-to-surface engagements. In 2014, several E-2C Hawkeyes from the Bear Aces of VAW-124 were deployed from [...] as flying command posts and air traffic controllers over Iraq during Operation Inherent Resolve against the Islamic State.|$|R
