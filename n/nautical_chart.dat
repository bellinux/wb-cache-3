25|$|Roger Bacon's {{investigations}} of map projections {{and the appearance}} of portolano and then portolan charts for plying the European trade routes were rare innovations of the period. The Majorcan school is contrasted with the contemporary Italian cartography school.

25|$|It {{is thought}} that Jehuda Cresques, son of the Catalan {{cartographer}} Abraham Cresques {{have been one of}} the notable cartographers at the service of Prince Henry. However the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by Pedro Reinel in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by Diogo Cão. Reinel was also author of the first <b>nautical</b> <b>chart</b> known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of an Wind rose.|$|E

25|$|Investigations {{carried out}} by the defense team of the Master of the Vessel and Louis Cruise Lines, after a lawsuit had been filed against them, have {{included}} a new hydrographic survey of the area of the accident in Santorini. This survey was {{carried out by}} Akti Engineering, and discovered discrepancies between the actual mapping of the sea area and the official charts used by the Sea Diamond (and all other vessels) {{at the time of the}} accident. The detailed survey claimed that the reef, which the Sea Diamond struck, is in fact lying at 131 meters (429 feet) from shore and not at a distance of 57 meters (187 feet) as is incorrectly marked on the <b>nautical</b> <b>chart.</b> The official chart also shows the depth of the water at the area of impact varying from 18–22 meters, whilst the recent survey shows that it is only 5 meters.|$|E
25|$|The graph of Cook Strait's tides shows {{separately}} {{the high}} water and low water height and time, through November 2007; {{these are not}} measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years-old measurements. Cook Strait's <b>nautical</b> <b>chart</b> offers tidal current information. For instance the January 1979 edition for 41°13·9’S 174°29·6’E (north west of Cape Terawhiti) refers timings to Westport while the January 2004 issue refers to Wellington. Near Cape Terawhiti {{in the middle of}} Cook Strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the tidal current reaches its maximum, especially near the notorious Karori Rip. Aside from weather effects, the actual currents through Cook Strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen, only one of the two spring tides at the north end (Nelson) has a counterpart spring tide at the south end (Wellington), so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} way in which symbols evolved on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts,</b> the identity of originators of these symbols, the spread in their use, and the forces involved in their continuing evolution. A twofold approach is utilized to resolve these questions. First a history of <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> prior to 1800 is presented and second, the actual examination of over 4200 <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> was carried out to discover and document their symbol content. A graphic summary of the symbols used on these charts is presented along with an analysis of the data gathered in 1 ight of the history of nautical cartography. The evolution of the symbols on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> was found to be closely aligned with one of the three types of symbols described by Dreyfuss (1972) : arbitrary, abstract or representational. The arbitrary symbols examined in this study clearly went through an evolutionary process, whereas the abstract and representational symbols remained virtually static throughout the period. The originators of the symbols are given when identifiable and the spread and evolution of the symbols is discussed. From this study it can be concluded that this type of research is most valuable in discovering the evolution of symbols on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> and that the graphic summary could be considered a standard for evaluating the evolution and use of symbols on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> prior to 1800...|$|R

2500|$|... 1537: Much of Portuguese {{mathematician}} and cosmographer Pedro Nunes' work {{related to}} navigation. He {{was the first}} to understand why a ship maintaining a steady course would not travel along a great circle, the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a spiral course, called a loxodrome. [...] These lines —also called rhumb lines— maintain a fixed angle with the meridians. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes connection —also called navigator connection. In his Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart [...] (1537), Nunes argued that a <b>nautical</b> <b>chart</b> should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused: a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used.|$|E
