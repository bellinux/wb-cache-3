40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{end-of-life}} {{decisions in}} the general population have received attention in several countries, not much is known about this in people with intellectual disabilities (IDs). Therefore, the prevalence and nature of end-of-life decisions were investigated in a Dutch centre providing residential care for 335 people with IDs. METHOD: A retrospective study of medical files of people who died between January 2002 and July 2007. RESULTS: One or more end-of-life decisions were taken in 27 out of 47 cases. A <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decision</b> was taken for seven residents, possibly shortening life expectancy in some cases. The family was involved in decision making in half of the 27 cases. No information was found about the process of end-of-life decision making. There was no evidence in the notes that any of the people with IDs was asked for his or her own opinion in taking an end-of-life decision. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that medical end-of-life decisions played a part in significant numbers of people with IDs who have died within this centre, but further studies are needed to establish decision-making processes...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To compare <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decision</b> making {{by general}} {{practitioners}} and geriatricians {{in response to}} vignettes. To see whether the doctors ’ decisions were informed by ethical or legal reason-ing. Design: Qualitative study in which consultant geriatricians and general practitioners (GPs) randomly selected {{from a list of}} local practitioners were interviewed. The doctors were asked whether patients described in five vignettes should be admitted to hospital for further care, and to give supporting reasons. They were asked with whom they would consult, who they believed ought to make such deci-sions, and whether the relatives ’ preferences would influence their decision making. Main measures: To analyse the factors influencing the doctors ’ decisions not to admit otherwise ter-minally ill patients to hospital for life prolonging treatment. Results: Seventeen GPs and 18 geriatricians completed the interview. All vignettes produced strong concordance in decision making between both groups. Ten per cent of the doctors would provide life prolonging treatment to patients with severe brain damage. Most would admit a surgical patient regardless of age or disability. Medical reasons were largely used to explain decision making. The wishes of relatives were influential and resource considerations were not. There was variability regard...|$|E

40|$|Medical {{end-of-life}} decisions, {{defined as}} end-of-life practices {{with a potential}} or certain life-shortening effect, precede almost 50 % of deaths in Western countries, and receive ample medical-ethical attention. This systematic review aims to detect {{whether there are differences}} in the prevalence of medical end-of-life decisions in 'vulnerable' patient groups. In 2009, five major databases were scrutinized for publications containing original data on the prevalence of euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide, life-ending without explicit patient request, intensified symptom alleviation, <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> and palliative sedation by social factors (eg age, gender and SES). Heterogeneous findings were pooled using a random effects model. We identified 6377 papers of which 51 papers were selected, involving over 1. 09 million patients. Most publications reported the prevalence of <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions.</b> The most studied social factors were age and gender. Among patients older than eighty years, <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> occurred more frequently compared with younger patients, while intensified symptom alleviation, palliative sedation, euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide and life-ending without explicit request were practiced less often. Similar patterns of association, although less strong, were found for female patients compared with males and those with lower levels of education versus more highly-educated patients. We conclude that the administration of medication with a potential or certain life-shortening effect seemed generally to be practiced less often among the elderly, females and less well-educated patients compared with younger, male or more educated patients, while decisions that include the withdrawal or withholding of treatments seem to be more common in these groups. Further studies should focus on investigating whether these differences reflect less than optimal end-of-life care for specific patient groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the direction and}} magnitude of participation bias in end-of-life research. Methods: Within {{the framework of a}} European survey on medical end-of-life decisions, a non-response study was conducted among physicians in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. People were asked about their attitudes and experiences in the area of medial end-of-life decision. The response rates ranged from 12. 8 % (Netherlands) to 39. 4 % (Switzerland). The responders (n = 5403) and the non-responders (n = 866) were compared regarding socio-demographic characteristics, experiences with terminal patients and agreement with attitudes towards "end-of-life decisions". The reasons for non-participation to the study were analyzed. Results: Non-response did not cause socio-demographic distortion, but non-responders had statistically significantly fewer terminal patients than responders. Agreement rates were statistically significantly higher among responders than among non-responders for euthanasia, <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decision</b> and life-preserving statements. Neutral answers were statistically significantly more frequent among non-responders than among responders for life-preserving and euthanasia statements. The most commonly mentioned reason for non-participation was "lack of time". Conclusion: Non-participation does cause an overestimation of proponents of life-shortening, as well as of life-preserving end-of-life decisions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{interobserver}} {{variation in}} the interpretation of median nerve SSEPs in patients with anoxic-ischaemic coma. METHODS: SSEPs of 56 consecutive patients with anoxic-ischaemic coma were interpreted independently by 5 experienced clinical neurophysiologists using guidelines derived from a pilot study. Interobserver agreement was expressed as kappa coefficients. RESULTS: Kappa ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 65 (mean 0. 52, SD 0. 14). Disagreement was related with noise level and failure to adhere strictly to the guidelines in 15 cases. The presence or absence of N 13 and cortical peaks caused disagreement in 5 cases each. For recordings with a noise level of 0. 25 microV or more, mean kappa was 0. 34; for recordings with a noise level below 0. 25 microV mean kappa was 0. 74. CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver agreement for SSEPs in anoxic-ischaemic coma was only moderate. Since the noise level strongly influenced interobserver variation, utmost attention should be given to its reduction. If an artefact level over 0. 25 microV remains, absence of N 20 cannot be judged with sufficient certainty and the SSEP should be repeated at a later stage. SIGNIFICANCE: Because of its moderate interobserver agreement, great care has to be given to accurate recording and interpretation of SSEPs before using the recordings for <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decision...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether accurate prognostic rules {{can be derived}} from the combined results of studies concerning prediction of poor prognosis in anoxic-ischaemic coma with biochemical markers of brain damage in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of prognostic studies in anoxic-ischaemic coma, selected from Medline and EMBASE databases, according to predefined criteria. SUBJECTS: Twenty-eight studies, with a total of 802 unselected, consecutive patients, in which tests, sampling time and outcome measures were described unequivocally and results were described using clear cut-off values or raw data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Poor outcome, defined as death or vegetative state, versus good outcome, defined as any other outcome state. ANALYSES: The overall prognostic accuracy of these variables was expressed as the 95 % CIs of the pooled false-positive test rate and the pooled positive-likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Only markers in CSF (creatine kinase isoenzyme (CKBB) > 204 U/l, neuron specific enolase (NSE) > 33 ng/ml, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 82 U/l and glutamate oxaloacetate (GOT) > 62 U/l) reached a 0 % false-positive rate. However, due to small sample sizes, the confidence limits were wide. The accuracy of prediction of poor outcome seemed acceptably high for CSF-CKBB (pooled false-positive rate 0 % [95 % CI 0 - 2. 3 %]; pooled positive-likelihood ratio 33. 2 [95 % CI 4. 8 - 230. 2]), but this result was based on two retrospective studies without blinding of the treating physicians for the test result.

40|$|Study design: Explorative {{retrospective}} files study. Objectives: To document end-of-life decisions (ELDs) in in-hospital deaths {{after new}} traumatic {{spinal cord injury}} (TSCI). Setting: The Netherlands. Methods: Discharge letters concerning patients with TSCI discharged from Dutch acute hospitals in 2010 were analysed. Data were extracted on survival, personal and lesion characteristics, comorbidities, other injuries, preexisting spinal stenosis, stabilising surgery, length of hospital stay and the presence and types of ELDs. Characteristics of deceased patients and survivors were compared using chi(2) and T-tests. Characteristics of the deceased patients and ELDs were further explored. Results: A total of 185 patients with new TSCI were identified. Twenty-six patients were excluded as their survival status at discharge was unknown-for example, because of discharge to another hospital without information about their final discharge. Thirty of the remaining 159 patients died during their initial hospital stay (18. 9 %). Deceased patients were older and had more often high cervical and motor complete injuries than survivors. The circumstances of death were sparsely documented, and in nine cases, {{it was not possible}} to determine the absence or the presence of an ELD. ELDs were reported in 19 deaths (63. 3 %). All were <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions,</b> and almost all (89. 5 %) were decisions of withdrawal of treatment. There were no cases of documented euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.

40|$|Objective: To examine {{differences}} in end-of-life decision-making in patients dying at home, {{in a hospital}} or in a care home. Design: A death certificate study: certifying physicians from representative samples of death certificates, taken between June 2001 and February 2002, were sent questionnaires on the end-of-life decision-making preceding the patient's death. Setting: Four European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland (German-speaking part). Main outcome measures: The incidence of and communication in different end-of-life decisions: physician-assisted death, alleviation of pain/symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect, and <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions.</b> Results: Response rates ranged from 59 % in Belgium to 69 % in Switzerland. The {{total number of deaths}} studied was 12 492. Among all non-sudden deaths the incidence of several end-of-life decisions varied by place of death. Physician-assisted death occurred relatively more often at home (0. 3 - 5. 1 %); <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> generally occurred more often in hospitals (22. 4 - 41. 3 %), although they were also frequently taken in care homes in Belgium (26. 0 %) and Switzerland (43. 1 %). Continuous deep sedation, in particular without the administration of food and fluids, was more likely to occur in hospitals. At home, end-of-life decisions were usually more often discussed with patients. The incidence of discussion with other caregivers was generally relatively low at home compared with in hospitals or care homes. Conclusion: The results suggest the possibility that end-of-life decision-making is related to the care setting where people die. The study results seem to call for the development of good end-of-life care options and end-of-life communication guidelines in all settings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Educational {{attainment}} {{has been}} shown to influence access to and quality of health care. However, the influence of educational attainment on decision-making {{at the end of life}} with possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs ie intensified pain and symptom alleviation, <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions,</b> euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide, and life-ending acts without explicit request) is scarcely studied. This paper examines differences between educational groups pertaining to prevalence of ELDs, the decision-making process and end-of-life treatment characteristics. Method. We performed a retrospective survey among physicians certifying a large representative sample of Belgian deaths in 2007. Differences between educational groups were adjusted for relevant confounders (age, sex, cause of death and marital status). Results: Intensified pain and symptom alleviation and <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> are more likely to occur in higher educated than in lower educated patients. These decisions were less likely to be discussed with either patient or family, or with colleague physicians, in lower educated patients. A positive association between education and prevalence of euthanasia/assisted suicide (acts as well as requests) disappeared when adjusting for cause of death. No differences between educational groups were found in the treatment goal in the last week, but higher educated patients were more likely to receive opioids in the last day of life. Conclusion: There are some important differences and possible inequities between educational groups in end-of-life decision-making in Belgium. Future research should investigate whether the found differences reflect differences in knowledge of and adherence to patient preferences, and indicate a discrepancy in quality of the end of life. © 2013 Chambaere et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} attitudes of secondary school students towards acceptability of requests by minors for end-of-life decisions (ELDs) with a possible life-shortening effect: non-treatment decisions, potentially life-shortening alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) and euthanasia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among second and fourth grades students in 20 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. An anonymous structured questionnaire was administered to measure attitudes towards acceptability of requests for euthanasia and other ELDs, towards the right to be informed about terminal prognosis and their own desire to be informed. RESULTS: In total, 1769 students participated. In case of a terminal patient, 61 % found a request for euthanasia acceptable, 60 % a request for APS and 69 % a request for <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decision,</b> compared with 18 % (euthanasia) and 50 % (APS) in case of a non-terminal patient. Acceptance was highest among: boys, participants older than 14 years and participants from general as opposed to technical and vocational education. Sixty-six per cent said the parents' opinion not being asked was a circumstance that should hold back a physician from administering a lethal drug. Ninety per cent of participants thought a minor has the right to be informed about terminal prognosis of a disease while 78 % would like to be informed themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes towards ELD requests varied with case and participant characteristics and type of ELD. The studied adolescents have a clear wish to be informed about terminal prognosis. Physicians and caregivers should adequately involve adolescents in decision making and tailor prognosis-related information to their needs and level of competenc...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} whether physicians find non-treatment decisions ethically challenging in their practice and what their intentions behind such decisions are. If physicians find non-treatment ethically challenging, then to explore how exactly do they find it challenging. Furthermore, how do physicians analyze their actions in light of the concepts of hastening, causing, and intending the patient s death? Do they find these ethical terms at all relevant for their non-treatment decision-making? Methods A qualitative analysis framework according to Malterud was used to analyze sixteen Norwegian physicians from relevant specialties' interviews. Interviews were divided in two parts. In part one the physician told their story where they performed non- treatment decision-making. In part two the interviewers asked the physician questions regarding the concepts of hastening, causing, and intending the patient s death, applied to the stories they had related. Results When analyzing the interviews, it became very clear that none of the physicians used ethical terms when describing their non-treatment decisions. Concepts such as hastening, causing and intending the patient s death seemed almost foreign to most of them in their practical considerations. There was almost a consensus amongst physicians in finding such concepts irrelevant to the moral assessment of their end- of-life practices. Physicians were always attempting to achieve the proper balance of the level of treatment at life s end; this was also their main dilemma. When framing their dilemmas, physicians did so not in ethical terms but medical terms. Conclusion Through the study, it became clear that the core concepts of traditional medico- ethical analyses of end-of-life decision-making (intending, causing and hastening death) do not match up with the practical landscape. There is, therefore, a need to rethink the ethical analysis of <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decision,</b> as well as the ethical concepts and their place in such an analysis...|$|E

40|$|This book {{is about}} the concept of 'medical futility' and the {{regulation}} and operationalisation of medical futility in Dutch Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). A NICU is a high-technology medical setting, {{where most of the}} life-prolonging treatment available for desperately sick newborns is administered. 'Medical futility' is a legal and ethical ground for withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment from a patient whose condition is too poor to justify (further) medical intervention.

In connection with its (real or supposed) 'objectivity', 'medical futility' can be a ground for unilateral <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions.</b> This means that if a treatment is 'medically futile', the doctor of medical team should withhold or withdraw it even over the objections of a competent patient (or, in the case of a non-competent patient such as a baby, its representative). ...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in medical}} {{practices}} during transitions in regulating healthcare are rarely investigated. In this study, we investigated changes in medical end-of-life decisions {{with a possible}} or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs) {{that occurred during the}} legalization process of euthanasia in Belgium. We took representative random samples from deaths reported to registries in Flanders, Belgium in 1998 (n= 3999) {{at the beginning of the}} process and in 2001 (N= 5005), at the end of the process. The reporting physicians received an anonymous mail questionnaire about possible ELDs preceding the death involved. We found no significant shifts in the epidemiology of diseases between 1998 and 2001. The overall incidence of ELDs did not change. The incidence decreased for euthanasia, administering life-ending drugs without patient's explicit request, and alleviation of pain and symptoms with life-shortening co-intention. Incidence increased for alleviation of pain and symptom without life-shortening intention, and remained stable for <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions.</b> All decisions in 2001 were more often discussed with patients, their relatives and nurses. In 2001, continuous deep sedation was reported in 8. 3 % of deaths. We can conclude that physicians' end-of-life practices have substantially changed during the short but tumultuous legalization process of euthanasia in Belgium. Although follow-up research is needed to investigate the continuance of these changes, it is important for policy makers to keep in mind that social factors related to transitions in healthcare regulation may play an important role in the physicians' actual behaviour.

40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} is to explore changes over time in the information and participation preferences of newly diagnosed stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Methods Patients were recruited by physicians in 13 hospitals and interviewed every 2 months until the fourth and every 4 months until the sixth interview. Results Sixty-seven patients were interviewed three times. Over a period of 4 months from diagnosis, half of patients changed their information preferences for palliative care and end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain lifeshortening effect (ELDs, e. g., <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions)</b> in both directions, from not wanting to wanting the information, but also-and as much-from wanting to no longer wanting it. The latter {{were more likely to}} be in a better physical condition. Preferences for participation in medical decision making also changed: 50 %to 78 %, depending on the type of decision (general, treatment, transfer or ELD), changed their preference towards wanting more or less participation. Pain seemed to be a trigger for patients wanting more involvement, which contrasts with studies suggesting that patients who are more ill tend to give up more control. Conclusions Doctors should regularly ask their advanced lung cancer patients how much information and participation they want because preferences do change in unexpected ways. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|During the 1980 s and 1990 s life {{expectancy}} at birth has risen only {{slowly in the}} Netherlands. In 2002, however, the rise in {{life expectancy}} suddenly accelerated. We studied the possible causes of this remarkable development. Mortality data by age, gender and cause of death were analyzed using life table methods and age-period-cohort modeling. Trends in determinants of mortality (including health care delivery) were compared with trends in mortality. Two-thirds {{of the increase in}} life expectancy at birth since 2002 were due to declines in mortality among those aged 65 and over. Declines in mortality reflected a period rather than a cohort effect, and were seen {{for a wide range of}} causes of death. Favorable changes in mortality determinants coinciding with the acceleration of mortality decline were mainly seen within the health care system. Health care expenditure rose rapidly after 2001, and was accompanied by a sharp rise of specialist visits, drug prescriptions, hospital admissions and surgical procedures among the elderly. A decline of deaths following <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> suggests a change towards more active treatment of elderly patients. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the sharp upturn of life expectancy in the Netherlands was at least partly due to a sharp increase in health care for the elderly, and has been facilitated by a relaxation of budgetary constraints in the health care system...|$|R
40|$|In The Netherlands, it is openly {{acknowledged}} that the parents' ability {{to take care of}} their child plays a role in the decision-making process over administration of life-prolonging treatment to severely defective newborn babies. Unlike other aspects of such decision-making process up until the present time, the 'ability to take care' has not received specific attention in regulation or in empirical research. The present study is based on interviews with neonatologists in two Dutch NICUs concerning their definition of the ability to take care and its relevance in <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions.</b> All of the respondents think that the ability to take care consists of more than one factor. Most doctors mention the parents' emotional state, social network and cognitive abilities.

Most doctors think the ability to take care has a secondary relevance in the decision-making process, while the primary concern is assessing the condition of the child. A substantial minority thinks the ability to take care does not play any role, while one doctor thinks it is a factor of primary importance.

Some of us have returned from the {{annual conference of the}} American Society for Bioethics and Humanities in San Diego, while others have good memories of the 10 th World Congress of Bioethics in Singapore last summer. But not only bioethicists are travelling, bioethics itself is as well, following the globalization of health care and medical research. Anthropologist Petryna (2009), in her interesting book When experiments travel, has shown how the clinical trials industry has moved into the developing countries, using the poor as research subjects and ignoring all the norms that have been established in the developed world. Bioethics has become a global concern and has now really moved into a new stage involving all countries and cultures. This issue of the journal testifies of this expansion of the scope of bioethics. However, there are different perspectives on the globalization of bioethics. In this issue, Gielen et al. (2011) report about the attitudes of palliative care professionals in New Delhi towards withholding life-sustaining treatment. The need for palliative care exists everywhere. It is therefore interesting to study how <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> are made in other countries. The authors refer to the specific context in India, such as the legal provisions that facilitate that refusal of life-sustaining treatment can be regarded as suicide, making physicians reluctant to withdraw or withhold such treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background This study compares {{prevalence}} {{and types of}} medical end-of-life decisions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities of Belgium. This is the first nationwide study that can make these comparisons and the first measurement after implementation of the euthanasia law (2002). Methods We performed a mortality follow-back study in 2005 – 2006. Data were collected via the nationwide Sentinel Network of General Practitioners, an epidemiological surveillance system representative of all Belgian GPs. Weekly, all GPs reported the medical end-of-life decisions among all non-sudden deaths of patients in their practice. We compared the northern Dutch-speaking (60 %) and southern French-speaking communities (40 %) controlling for population differences. Results We analysed 1690 non-sudden deaths. An end-of-life decision with possible life-shortening effect was made in 50 % of patients in the Dutch-speaking community and 41 % of patients in the French-speaking community (OR 1. 4; 95 %CI, 1. 2 to 1. 8). Continuous deep sedation until death occurred in 8 % and 15 % respectively (OR 0. 5; 95 %CI, 0. 4 to 0. 7). Community differences regarding the prevalence of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide were not significant. Community differences were more present among home/care home than among hospital deaths: <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> with explicit life-shortening intention were made more often in the Dutch-speaking than in the French-speaking community settings (OR 2. 2; 95 %CI, 1. 2 to 3. 9); while continuous deep sedation occurred less often in the Dutch-speaking community settings (OR 0. 5; 95 %CI, 0. 3 to 0. 9). Conclusion Even though legal and general healthcare systems are {{the same for the}} whole country, there are considerable variations between the communities in type and prevalence of certain end-of-life decisions, even after controlling for population differences. </p...|$|R
40|$|End-of-life {{decisions}} in the UK involving medical practitioners C Seale Centre for Health Sciences, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London This study estimates the frequency of different medical end-of-life decisions (ELDs) made in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2007 – 2008, comparing these with 2004. Postal survey was carried out with 8857 medical practitioners, of whom 3733 (42 %) practi-tioners replied, with 2869 having attended a person {{who died in the}} previous year. The proportion of UK deaths involving (1) voluntary euthanasia (0. 21 %; CI: 0 – 0. 52), (2) physician-assisted suicide (0. 00 %) and (3) ending of life without an explicit request from the patient (0. 30 %; CI: 0 – 0. 60) is low. Better questions about ELDs showed both <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> (21. 8 %; CI: 19. 0 – 24. 5) and double effect measures (17. 1 %; CI: 14. 6 – 19. 6) to be much less common than suggested in earlier estimates, rarely involving intent to end life or being judged to have shortened life by more than a day. Continuous deep sedation (16. 5 %; CI: 14. 3 – 18. 7) is relatively common in UKmedi-cal practice, particularly in hospitals, home care settings and with younger patients. Further findings about the distribution of ELDs across subgroups are also reported. Survey research in this area requires careful control over question wording if valid estimates and comparisons of the prevalence of ELDs are to be made. The high rate of sedation compared with other countries may be a cause for concern.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} {{evidence}} {{in recent years}} that people with intellectual disabilities in acute hospitals are at risk of preventable deterioration due to failures of the healthcare services to implement the reasonable adjustments they need. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the challenges in monitoring and preventing patient safety incidents involving people with intellectual disabilities, to describe patient safety issues faced by patients with intellectual disabilities in NHS acute hospitals, and investigate underlying contributory factors. METHODS: This was a 21 -month mixed-method study involving interviews, questionnaires, observation and monitoring of incident reports to assess the implementation of recommendations designed to improve care provided for patients with intellectual disabilities and explore the factors that compromise or promote patient safety. Six acute NHS Trusts in England took part. Data collection included: questionnaires to clinical hospital staff (n[*]=[*] 990); questionnaires to carers (n[*]=[*] 88); interviews with: hospital staff including senior managers, nurses and doctors (n[*]=[*] 68) and carers (n[*]=[*] 37); observation of in-patients with intellectual disabilities (n[*]=[*] 8); monitoring of incident reports (n[*]=[*] 272) and complaints involving people with intellectual disabilities. RESULTS: Staff did not always readily identify patient safety issues or report them. Incident reports focused mostly around events causing immediate or potential physical harm, such as falls. Hospitals lacked effective systems for identifying patients with intellectual disabilities within their service, making monitoring safety incidents for this group difficult. The safety issues described by the participants were mostly related to delays and omissions of care, in particular: inadequate provision of basic nursing care, misdiagnosis, delayed investigations and treatment, and <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> and Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) orders. CONCLUSIONS: The events leading to avoidable harm for patients with intellectual disabilities are not always recognised as safety incidents, and may be difficult to attribute as causal to the harm suffered. Acts of omission (failure to give care) are more difficult to recognise, capture and monitor than acts of commission (giving the wrong care). In order to improve patient safety for this group, the reasonable adjustments needed by individual patients should be identified, documented and monitored...|$|R
40|$|Aim: After {{two large}} scale studies on medical {{end-of-life}} practices in Belgium in 1998 and 2001, {{we conducted a}} follow-up study in 2007 to investigate trends in frequency and characteristics of these practices and differences {{before and after the}} enactment of the laws on palliative care and on euthanasia in 2002. Methods: We drew a stratified at random sample of 6927 cases from all deaths that occurred between June and November 2007 in Flanders, Belgium and mailed questionnaires about medical end-of-life practices to the certifying physicians. Results: Response rate was 58. 4 %. In 2007, the rate of intensified pain alleviation in Flanders increased from 18. 4 % of all deaths in 1998 and 22. 0 % in 2001 to 26. 7 % in 2007, and that of <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> from 14. 6 % in 2001 to 17. 4 % in 2007. In 1. 9 % of all deaths physicians reported euthanasia, a rate that was higher than that in 1998 (1. 1 %) and 2001 (0. 3 %). The rate of lethal drug use without the patient’s explicit request was lower in 2007 (1. 8 % of all deaths) than that in 1998 (3. 2 %), but similar to that in 2001 (1. 5 %). No shift in characteristics of patients whose death was the result of using these drugs was found. In 14. 5 % of all deaths in 2007, physicians reported continuous and deep sedation until death, which was substantially more often than in 2001 (8. 2 %). In 2007, physicians discussed medical end-of-life practices more often with competent patients, relatives and colleagues than in 1998. Conclusion: The enactment of the Belgian laws on palliative care and on euthanasia was followed by an increase in all types of medical end-of-life practices, {{with the exception of the}} use of lethal drugs without patient’s explicit request. No shift toward the use of life-ending drugs in vulnerable patient groups was observed. The substantial increase in the frequency of deep sedation demands more in-depth research.

40|$|The British Medical Association (BMA) {{recently}} published guidance from its medical ethics committee on decision making concerning the withholding and withdrawing of life-prolonging medical treatment. It {{is a very}} thoughtful and thought-provoking document, the ramifications of which go far beyond the immediate situation it is addressing. The authors are clearly well aware of this. When considering a doctor’s ethical response to “contemporaneous requests for life-prolonging treatment” made by competent patients, the committee observes: “Although patients’ wishes should always be discussed with them, {{the fact that a}} patient has requested a particular treatment does not mean that it must always be provided. ” They advance four propositions in support of this conclusion, namely: “(a) Health professionals are not obliged to provide any treatment which cannot produce the desired benefit”. “(b) There is no obligation to provide any treatment which is clearly contrary to an individual’s health interests. A life-prolonging treatment may, for example, prolong life but result in severe pain or loss of function so that overall it produces severe harm to the patient”. “(c) Except in an emergency situation, doctors are not obliged to treat contrary to their conscience (though they may be obliged to make an appropriate referral) ”. “(d) Where resources are limited, it is inevitable that some patients will not receive all of the treatment they request even though such treatment could be potentially beneficial to them”. Towards the end of their commentary on the last of these propositions, they observe: “Health professionals have an ethical duty to make the best use of the available resources and this means that hard decisions must be made. Whilst this is a much broader issue than can be discussed thoroughly in this document, it is clear that doctors are not obliged to comply with patients’ requests for treatment when they make inequitable demands on scarce resources”. Later they come back to this issue in the context of patients who have lost or never attained competence. In that connection they observe: “Existing guidelines and court judgments have insisted that <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> for people who lack the ability to make or communicate decisions should be based on considerations of benefit to the patient and not cost. It is obvious, however, that money spent caring for irreversibly and severely brain-damaged patients is money which cannot be used to treat other patients. This is an issue which needs to be acknowledged and addressed on a national scale as part of the debate on rationing and prioritising resources”...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Children {{and parents}} need to make {{important}} decisions {{in the period of}} being informed about the diagnosis of childhood cancer. Although parents' and children's involvement is legally required, it is unclear whether oncologists involve them. This study explored which decisions families face, how oncologists involve them in shared decision-making (SDM) and which factors are associated with this process. Methods: Forty-three families with children, starting treatment for childhood cancer, were recruited from three Dutch academic pediatric oncology clinics. Diagnostic consultations were audio-taped and coded with the OPTION. Results: On average, 3. 5 decisions were discussed per consultation. Most frequently discussed decisions concerned registration in a patient database (42 %) and how to deal with hair loss (33 %). Oncologists' assistance in SDM focused on giving information and ensuring the parents' and the child's understanding. The hospital in which children were treated (F(2, 2) = 5. 39, p =. 01) and discussing trial participation (F (1, 1) = 8. 11, p =. 01) were associated with oncologists' assistance. Conclusion: Decision-making during diagnostic consultations appears to focus on <b>non-treatment</b> related <b>decisions.</b> Oncologists' assistance mostly concerned sharing information, instead of SDM. Practice implications: Additional research is needed to provide insight in how to increase oncologists' assistance, while taking into account children's and parents' preferences concerning SDM.

40|$|Aim: To {{examine how}} physicians’ life stances affect their attitudes to {{end-of-life}} decisions and their actual end-of-life decision-making. Methods: Practising physicians from various specialties {{involved in the}} care of dying patients in Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia received structured questionnaires on end-of-life care, which included questions about their life stance. Response rates ranged from 53 % in Australia to 68 % in Denmark. General attitudes, intended behaviour with respect to two hypothetical patients, and actual behaviour were compared between all large life-stance groups in each country. Results: Only small differences in life stance were found in all countries in general attitudes and intended and actual behaviour with regard to various end-of-life decisions. However, with regard to the administration of drugs explicitly intended to hasten the patient’s death (PAD), physicians with specific religious affiliations had significantly less accepting attitudes, and less willingness to perform it, than non-religious physicians. They had also actually performed PAD less often. However, in most countries, both Catholics (up to 15. 7 % in The Netherlands) and Protestants (up to 20. 4 % in The Netherlands) reported ever having made such a decision. Discussion: The results suggest that religious teachings influence to some extent end-of-life decision-making, but are certainly not blankly accepted by physicians, especially when dealing with real patients and circumstances. Physicians seem to embrace religious belief in a non-imperative way, allowing adaptation to particular situations. Physicians’ attitudes to life and death appear to orient their end-of-life decision-making. 1 It is important therefore to both assess their attitudes 2 and understand exactly how these are related to end-of-life decision-making. Research has generally corroborated that (stronger) theistic religious beliefs are associated with lower acceptance of various end-of-life decisions (ELDs), particularly euthanasia. 3 – 9 Often this is explained by the traditional viewpoints of Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam (or their religious authorities) regarding end-of-life issues, extensively described in the bioethical literature. 10 – 18 However, as these traditional religious doctrines are commonly balanced by considerations of due care and general sentiments of humanity and compassion, which come into play in actually dealing with patients, there is some dispute over the decisiveness of statements of doctrine for physicians’ actual decision-making. 19 A specific research question of this study is therefore: are viewpoints from different life stances on different kinds of ELDs, as illustrated in the recent Lancet series, 11 16 18 also translated into attitudes and actual practices of the physicians who adhere to these life stances? We will examine the effect of life stance on physicians’: * general attitudes to different ELDs: <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions</b> (NTDs); alleviation of pain and symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect; terminal sedation; and administration of lethal drugs (ie, physician-assisted dying (PAD)); * willingness to make these ELDs, given certain circumstances; * actual decision-making. We will also examine whether the country of residence has an effect, making it possible to evaluate also the influence of the surrounding (secular) culture...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and aims: Illicit methamphetamine (MA) use is an {{important}} public health concern. There is a dearth of knowledge about effective and cost-effective treatments for methamphetamine (MA) dependence in Australia. This article evaluates the cost-effectiveness of counselling as a treatment option for illicit MA use compared with no treatment option. Design and methods: Data are from 501 individuals recruited into Methamphetamine Treatment Evaluation Study (MATES). The population of MA users from MATES is extrapolated to a total number of 1000 MA users in the intervention group (counselling treatment) and control group (<b>non-treatment</b> group). A <b>decision</b> analytic model is developed that examines the costs and health outcomes [measures as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained] for the treatment and comparison group over a 3 -year period. A societal perspective is adopted and model inputs are subject to sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to test the robustness of results to parameter variability. Results are discounted by using 3 % discount rate and expressed in 2011 Australian dollars. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that counselling is a dominant health care intervention, i. e. saves money and {{is more effective than}} a do nothing intervention. The incremental difference in costs is −AU$ 18. 36 million (95 % CI −AU$ 22. 80 million to −AU$ 14. 31 million) and the incremental difference in QALY is 107 (95 % CI − 640 to 820) with a probability of 78. 64 % of counselling being a dominant and cost-effective treatment within the acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $ 63 [*] 832 per QALY in the Australian society. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the ICER is most sensitive to change in five major inputs: baseline utility, utility at 3 months, dealing crime costs, property crime costs and fraud crime costs. Discussion and Conclusions: The economic evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of counselling for MA dependence, as a first cost-effectiveness study to assess psychosocial treatment options for MA dependence, shows that greater investment in this cost-effective strategy will produce significant cost-savings and improve health outcomes as well as improve a lot of externality issues associated with drug use...|$|R
40|$| {{withdrawal}} of treatment. Third, irrespective of being (non-) Hasidic Orthodox or secularized Orthodox, interviewees who had faith in God, but {{who refused to}} believe in Gods almighty power with regard to life, death, illness and health, {{were more likely to}} stress human beings right to decide about the end of their life. God would not want human beings to suffer, they argued, thus leaves room for ending their lives in a situation of unbearable suffering. In comparison to the centuries-old presence of Judaism in Belgium, the emergence of Islam in the country is rather recent. Yet, ever since Muslim migration to Belgium started in the late 1950 s-early 1960 s, the Muslim population continues growing. Considering this, and given the fact that first generation migrants of Moroccan and Turkish origin grow old today, and hence might have increasing medical needs, we considered it important to investigate Islamic views on ethical dilemmas in end-of-life health care. More specifically, the second part of this dissertation constitutes of a presentation and discussion of the data obtained from our exploratory qualitative empirical study conducted in the Turkish and Moroccan Muslim communities in Antwerp (Belgium). Given the research expertise of the Interdisciplinary Centre for the Study of Religion and World View (KU Leuven) - normative Islamic views on ethical dilemmas in end-of-life care were already extensively investigated in the past - we did not assume it useful to give in our text an overview of Islamic end-of-life ethics in general. Therefore, the second part focuses on reconstructing the way of thinking of a particular group of Muslims living in Antwerp (Belgium) with regard to religion, medicine, illness, and specific treatment decisions at the end of life. From June 2009 until January 2011 face-to-face interviews were done with 30 elderly (age &# 8805; 55) first generation Muslim women of Moroccan (15) and Turkish (15) origin, with the assistance of two experienced interpreters, fluently speaking Turkish, Moroccan and Berber. Given the segregation of the sexes in Islam, as a female researcher we only recruited Muslim women to participate in the study. In three subsequent chapters {{in the second part of}} the dissertation, we discuss the views of the interviewees ona) medicine, illness and suffering, b) active termination of life, and c) <b>non-treatment</b> <b>decisions.</b> In the discussion section of the chapters, the views are confronted with normative Islamic standpoints. To sum up, the religious views and ethical attitudes found among our interviewees were almost homogeneous. This is related to the homogeneity of their religious convictions. The overwhelming majority of our interviewees perceived God as almighty and all-knowing. They believed that God judges human beings way of living, and that it has repercussions in the afterlife. Stressing their faith in Gods sovereignty in the domain of life and death, these participants radically opposed every medical act which would contribute to a patients death: voluntary euthanasia, assisted suicide, non-voluntary euthanasia, and mostly also withdrawal and withholding of treatment. Slight differences were found between Turks and Moroccans. At the same time, we observed nevertheless that there might be openness for euthanasia among some Muslims. One Turkish and one Moroccan interviewee, who were both deeply religious, did not reject active termination of life. They toned down Gods sovereignty with regard to death, and left room for human decision-making at the end of life. They reported that God is a protector of human beings, and that God does not decide about illness and suffering. As such, our study suggests that being a religious Muslim not automatically implies disapproval of active termination of life. We also noticed that personal confrontation with illness might have a significant influence. Anyway, we discovered that specific religious beliefs, centring around Gods characteristics, might exert an important influence with regard to views on specific ethical dilemmas in end-of-life care. The overwhelming majority of our Muslim interviewees expressed a strong disapproval of every act which was perceived as active termination of life. We concluded that this attitude was related to their image of God: omnipotent, omniscient and judging. The epilogue of the dissertation aims to offer some preliminary comparative perspectives on the way of thinking of our Jewish and Muslim participants with regard to treatment decisions at the end of life. It offers very tentative insights into the way Jewish and Islamic beliefs and practices may influence the manner very specific moral dilemmas in end-of-life health care are dealt with. Drawing very tentative conclusions, we take into account that - when comparing Jewish and Muslim views - certain variables, such as socio-economic and educational level, were substantially different. Specifically, this epilogue takes the multidimensional nature of religion into account, and explores which facets of religion were most influential in the religion-ethics interplay we discovered in our empirical studies. As such, in this epilogue, the influence of our participants religiosity on the way they handle ethical dilemmas is addressed in its complexity. In sum, our study results indicate that different dimensions of religiosity have a stronger or weaker influence. Most obvious is the impact of the ideological dimension of religiosity (a persons image of and beliefs about God or ultimate reality). Irrespective of religious affiliation, interviewees who believed that God is omnipotent, that God puts human beings to the test throughout life, and that God will evaluate a persons earthly deeds after life, were more likely to have a negative attitude to every act which they perceived as active termination of life. As such, not only (non-) voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide were rejected, withdrawal (and often also withholding) of treatment, which was considered as contributing to a patients death, was negatively perceived as well. Additionally, the epilogue shows that other factors, such as personal confrontation with illness, might have an impact on approaching ethical dilemmas in end-of-life care, and that it might yield viewpoints which are more or less different from what is perceived to be the normative Orthodox Jewish or Islamic view. status: publishe...|$|R
