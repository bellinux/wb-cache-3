25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> to ensure that no current flows through the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> switching is needed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire,</b> two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
25|$|Law 2: A tool must perform its {{function}} efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason ground-fault circuit interrupters exist. Any running tool {{will have its}} power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire,</b> and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount.|$|E
50|$|Residual current device (RCD), also {{residual}} current circuit breaker (RCCB): A circuit breaker triggered by non-matching currents {{in line and}} <b>neutral</b> <b>wires</b> (i.e., electrical power is passing to earth). Mandatory for most circuits as of 17th Edition regulations.|$|R
50|$|All <b>neutral</b> <b>wires</b> of {{the same}} earthed (grounded) {{electrical}} system {{should have the same}} electrical potential, because they are all connected through the system ground. Neutral conductors are usually insulated for the same voltage as the line conductors, with interesting exceptions.|$|R
5000|$|Cables {{are most}} {{commonly}} a single outer sheath containing separately-insulated [...] and <b>neutral</b> <b>wires,</b> and a non-insulated protective earth to which sleeving is added when exposed. Standard sizes have a conductor {{cross sectional area}} of 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6 and 10 mm2. Sizes of 1 or 1.5 mm2 are typically used for 6 or 10 ampere lighting circuits and 2.5 mm2 for socket circuits.|$|R
25|$|In some multi-standard sockets the {{aperture}} size for NEMA plugs {{is the same}} for both Line (Hot) and Neutral (see second picture), which may defeat the polarization of NEMA 1 plugs. In a socket designed to accept both NEMA and BS 1363 plugs, the lower right contact (in the orientation shown in the picture) should be connected to the Line wire for BS 1363 plugs, but the <b>Neutral</b> <b>wire</b> for NEMA plugs, so safe wiring of these devices for universal use is not possible.|$|E
2500|$|For example, the triplen, or zero-sequence, {{harmonics}} (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) {{have the}} property of being in-phase when compared line-to-line. In a delta-wye transformer, these harmonics can result in circulating currents in the delta windings and result in greater resistive heating. In a wye-configuration of a transformer, triplen harmonics will not create these currents, but they {{will result in a}} non-zero current in the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire.</b> This could overload the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> in some cases ...|$|E
2500|$|... 12/2 and 14/2 {{can also}} be used for the rare 240-volt-only 15- or 20-amp plug by clearly marking the white wire red, since there is no <b>neutral</b> <b>wire.</b> [...] Two {{conductor}} cable is available with black and red conductors only for this purpose; the outer sheath is likewise red.|$|E
5000|$|In North America, {{the cases}} of some kitchen stoves (ranges, ovens), cook tops, clothes dryers and other {{specifically}} listed appliances were grounded through their <b>neutral</b> <b>wires</b> as a measure to conserve copper from copper cables during World War II. This practice {{was removed from the}} NEC in the 1996 edition, but existing installations (called [...] "old work") may still allow {{the cases of}} such listed appliances to be connected to the neutral conductor for grounding.|$|R
50|$|Removing the {{grounding}} pin of the appliance’s plug is unsafe, {{and leaves}} the appliance without proper grounding even when relocated and plugged into a properly grounded three-prong receptacle. Additionally, since most NEMA 5-15P plugs have both current-carrying prongs the same width and rely on the ground pin for correct orientation, removing it allows insertion of the plug with hot and <b>neutral</b> <b>wires</b> reversed, creating an additional hazard. In most cases it also invalidates the manufacturer's warranty against defects as an unsupported modification of the appliance.|$|R
50|$|The order (polarity) of {{the pins}} of a three pin flat pin plug, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin - green/yellow <b>wire),</b> <b>Neutral</b> (light blue <b>wire)</b> and then Active (brown wire), in a {{clockwise}} direction, {{when viewed from}} the front of the plug looking at the pins.|$|R
2500|$|Most duplex {{receptacles}} have metal tabs {{connecting the}} top and bottom receptacles. These tabs are pre-scored {{so that they can be}} broken off to allow {{the top and}} bottom receptacles to be wired onto separate circuits. This may allow for one switched receptacle for a lamp, or for two separate supply circuits when heavy loads are anticipated. Two branch circuits may optionally share a common <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> terminating on duplex receptacles, a condition sometimes referred to as [...] "split-wiring", [...] "split-receptacle", or [...] "half-split".|$|E
2500|$|Relying on {{the neutral}} {{conductor}} was a legal grounding method for electric ranges and clothes dryers, under the National Electrical Code from the 1947 to the 1996 editions. Since North American dryers and ranges have certain components (timers, lights, fans, etc.) {{that run on}} 120V, {{this means that the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> indirectly used for grounding would also carry current, even under non-fault conditions. Although this is contrary to modern grounding practice, such [...] "grandfathered" [...] installations remain common in older homes in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{four-wire}} three-phase system, {{sometimes called}} [...] "four-wire wye", the safety ground {{is connected to}} a <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. [...] Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. [...] In the U.S., the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type. [...] In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.|$|E
50|$|Another {{specialized}} connector {{version has}} a permanently attached wire pigtail {{protruding from the}} top of the insulated cap. The pigtail may be unterminated, or it may end in a preinstalled spade lug. If colored white, it typically may be used for splicing <b>neutral</b> <b>wires</b> in a device box, while leaving a pigtail free for connection to a device (such as a receptacle). If colored green, the assembly is intended to be used as a grounding pigtail, similar to the feedthrough twist-on wire connectors described in the previous paragraph.|$|R
50|$|In the Carter system, the {{incoming}} live (energized) and <b>neutral</b> <b>wires</b> {{were connected to}} the traveler screws of both 3-way switches, and the lamp was connected between the common screws of the two switches. If both switches were flipped to hot or both were flipped to neutral, the light would remain off; but if they were switched to opposite positions, the light would illuminate. The advantage of this method was that it used just one wire to the light from each switch, having a hot and neutral in both switches.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{the plug}} is polarised, CEE7 does not define the {{placement}} of the line and neutral and there is no universally-observed standard. However, the Czech standard recommends that the line wire to be on the left side when facing the socket. The French convention changed circa 2002 from nothing particular, to, if the earth pin was at the top then the line hole in the socket would be on the right looking at the socket. However, the socket may not necessarily be installed with the earth pin at the top. Packaging in France of sockets is normally marked with correct connection of the cables. Polarised pre-fitted plugs on appliances are therefore connected with the brown line wire to the right pin and the blue <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> to the left, the earth being connected to the contact at the [...] "top" [...] of the plug.|$|E
50|$|Half-wave {{rectifier}} may {{be considered}} as wye connection (star connection), because it returns the current through the centre (<b>neutral)</b> <b>wire.</b> Full-wave is more like delta connection, although it can {{be connected to the}} three phase source of either wye or delta and it does not use the centre (<b>neutral)</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{a primary}} <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> is available, a 'wye' or 'phase to neutral' {{transformer}} can be used. This usually {{has only one}} bushing on top, connected {{to one of the}} primary phases. The other end of the primary winding is 'grounded' to the transformer's case, which is connected to the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> of the 3 phase system, and also earth ground. This type of distribution system, called 'grounded wye', is preferred because the transformers present unbalanced loads on the line, causing currents in the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire.</b> With the 'delta' connection, this can cause variations in the voltages on the 3 phase wires.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>wires</b> {{are usually}} {{connected}} at a neutral bus within panelboards or switchboards, and are [...] "bonded" [...] to earth ground at either the electrical service entrance, or at transformers within the system. For electrical installations with split-phase (three-wire single-phase service), the neutral {{point of the}} system is at the center-tap on the secondary side of the service transformer. For larger electrical installations, such as those with polyphase service, the neutral point is usually at the common connection on the secondary side of delta/wye connected transformers. Other arrangements of polyphase transformers may result in no neutral point, and no neutral conductors.|$|R

The transfer of potentials between the grounding area to outer points by buried conductors, such as communication or signal circuits, <b>neutral</b> <b>wires,</b> pipes, rails, or metallic fences, may produce serious safety problems [2].

40|$|The present {{invention}} discloses {{a method}} of detecting and locating current imbalances such as ground faults in multiwire systems using the Faraday effect. As an example, for 2 -wire or 3 -wire (1 ground wire) electrical systems, light is transmitted along an optical path which is exposed to magnetic fields produced by currents flowing in the hot and <b>neutral</b> <b>wires.</b> The rotations produced by these two magnetic fields cancel each other, therefore light on the optical path does not read the effect of either. However, when a ground fault occurs, the optical path is exposed to a net Faraday effect rotation due to the current imbalance thereby exposing the ground fault...|$|R
50|$|The {{currents}} {{returning from}} the customers' premises to the supply transformer all share the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire.</b> If the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases, {{the sum of the}} returning currents in the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> is approximately zero. Any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently.|$|E
50|$|If no <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> is available, a 'delta' or 'phase to phase' {{transformer}} must be used. This has two bushings on top {{which are}} connected {{to two of the}} three primary wires, so the voltage across the primary winding is the phase-to-phase voltage. This type is used on long distribution lines where it is uneconomical to run a fourth <b>neutral</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> is {{identified}} by gray or white insulated wire, perhaps using stripes or markings.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{protection}} of a three-phase four-wire distribution network (DEN) with a voltage of 0. 4 kV from the interruption of electric power lines is considered. On {{the basis of}} the analysis of the values of complex resistances of interpersonal sections of the main line of the network, criteria are proposed that allow detecting critical situations associated with discontinuities in power transmission lines. Using these criteria makes it possible to localize the places of breaks of phase and <b>neutral</b> <b>wires.</b> Mathematical models and methods that are used to evaluate the complex resistances of interpersonal sections of a three-phase network are briefly considered. The obtained results are oriented for use in the automated system of electricity control and accounting (ASMAE) ...|$|R
5000|$|The screw {{terminals}} are hollow and allow up {{to at least}} three 1 mm (CSA) wires, twisted together, to be inserted {{to a depth of}} up to 10 mm and secured with a set screw. The contact terminal set screws are installed at a slight angle to allow easier screwdriver access after the switch mechanism has been installed into a wall-plate - before fixing the wall-plate to the wall. Also shown is a “loop” connection terminal. This terminal plays no part in the action of the switch but, because there is available space, it is provided as an insulated terminal for joining other wires, if required (such as the <b>neutral</b> <b>wires).</b> Each Australian rocker switch mechanism is actually a Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) Switch, also known as a [...] "two-way switch", and has three terminals.|$|R
50|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> to ensure that no current flows through the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance.

5000|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>wire</b> is {{the return}} {{conductor}} of a circuit; in building wiring systems, the <b>neutral</b> <b>wire</b> {{is connected to}} earth ground at least at one point. North American standards state that the neutral is neither switched nor fused except in very narrowly defined circumstances.

50|$|The self-balancing dynamo is {{of similar}} {{construction}} to the single- and two-phase rotary converter. It was {{commonly used to}} create a completely balanced three-wire 120/240-volt DC electrical supply. The AC extracted from the slip rings was fed into a transformer with a single center-tapped winding. The center-tapped winding forms the DC <b>neutral</b> <b>wire.</b> It needed to be driven by a mechanical power source, such as a steam engine, diesel engine, or electric motor. It could be considered a rotary converter used as a double current generator; the AC current was used to balance the DC <b>neutral</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Various {{earthing}} {{systems are}} used {{to ensure that the}} ground and <b>neutral</b> <b>wires</b> have zero voltage with respect to earth, to prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment. In some installations, there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a single-phase three-wire. Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables (these exist with either two or three insulated conductors) terminated in a plug, which is inserted into a fixed receptacle (socket). Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power. These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications.|$|R
5000|$|In many countries, {{household}} {{power is}} single-phase electric power, {{with two or}} three wired contacts at each outlet. <b>Neutral</b> and line <b>wires</b> carry current and are defined as live parts.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>Neutral</b> (N) <b>wire</b> is fed {{straight}} through the Rectiverter, the mains feed should have an unbroken path from N to Protective Earth (PE), i.e. the N should not be broken in any distribution point from the source to the Rectiverter system. If the feed is broken the N must be bonded to PE in the system with a link of the same rating as the incoming feed.|$|R
