Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little as , and would explode {{with the power of}} thousands of tons of dynamite. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to shelve its own <b>nuclear</b> <b>ambitions,</b> and participate in the American project.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{government}} has officially taken a silent policy towards {{the nuclear weapons}} ambitions {{of the state of}} Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of Iran and North Korea. Until 2005 when the program was cancelled, it was violating its own non-proliferation treaties in the pursuit of so-called nuclear bunker busters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. was done, in part, on indications that Weapons of Mass Destruction were being stockpiled (lately, stockpiles of previously undeclared nerve agent and mustard gas shells have been located in Iraq), and the Bush administration said that its policies on proliferation were responsible for the Libyan government's agreement to abandon its <b>nuclear</b> <b>ambitions.</b>|$|E
25|$|By early 2010, the Obama administration's efforts towards {{forging a}} new {{relationship}} with Iran had failed to gain headway, and the U.S. adopted a policy of adopting international sanctions against it and isolating it diplomatically in order to curtail the that country's nuclear program. This was a policy {{more in line with}} Clinton's thinking and went back to disagreements she and Obama had had during the 2008 presidential campaign. Clinton was put in charge of rallying support in the United Nations for these sanctions and spent considerable time over the following months and years doing so. At times Clinton suggested the possibility of military action against Iran should economic and diplomatic actions fail to deter it from its <b>nuclear</b> <b>ambitions.</b>|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} coup, the clandestine nuclear energy project {{was no longer}} a secret to the outside world. Part of his {{strategy}} was the promotion of nuclear proliferation in anti-western states (such as North Korea, Iran, and communist China) to aid their own <b>nuclear</b> <b>ambitions,</b> to divert international attention which was difficult. In 1981, Zia contracted with China when he sent weapon-grade uranium to China and also built the centrifuge laboratory which increasingly enhanced the Chinese nuclear programme. This act encouraged Abdul Qadeer Khan, who allegedly tried to aid the Libyan nuclear programme but because Libya–Pakistan relations were strained, Khan was warned of serious consequences. This policy envisaged that this would deflect international pressure onto these countries, and Pakistan would be spared the international community's wrath.|$|E

In the 2000s (decade), North Korea would soon follow the same suit after it was targeted by the international community for its on-going nuclear programme. In the 2000s (decade), North Korea attempted to aid the Syrian and Iranian nuclear programmes in the 1990s. The North Korean connection to the Syrian nuclear programme was exposed in 2007 by Israel in its successful strategic operation, Orchard, which resulted in them sabotaging the Syrian nuclear programme as well as the deaths of 10 senior North-Korean scientists who were aiding the nuclear program.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the South Korean government’s policy during the entire post Cold War period, from Roh Tae-woo’s {{administration}} to the current Lee Myung-bak administration, did little to resolve the issues pertaining to the conflictual North-South relationship.

North Korea’s <b>nuclear</b> <b>ambition</b> as well as its go ahead started in the very sensitive entry period in to the post Cold War era (1988 – 1993). Despite all its claimed success in dealing with China, the Soviet Union, {{and the rest of the}} formerly communist countries, South Korea’s Nordpolitik failed to penetrate North Korea to produce any foundation on which the problem of division could be dealt with. In fact, President Roh Tae-woo’s Nordpolitik had the impact of solidifying the partition of the Korean peninsula, isolating the already fragile regime in the North – pushing it in to the embrace of nuclear arms. Thus, the questions to be asked here are: What when wrong? And, if any, what can the South Korean Government salvage from such an experience? Upon addressing these questions, the paper delves in to West Germany’s successful policy of Ostpolitik to seek out lessons from it...|$|R

No studies have researched the cohesion of the ROK-U. S. alliance through robust empirical analysis. To answer this question empirically, this thesis examines three indicators for measuring the cohesion of the ROK-U. S. alliance: institutionalization, capacity of the USFK, and the ROK-U. S. combined exercises. In addition, this thesis analyzes three categories of the U. S. military spending to determine whether a certain relation exists between the cohesion of the ROK-U. S. alliance and U. S. military spending. Through empirical analysis, this thesis concludes that there is no certain relationship between the cohesion of the ROK-U. S. alliance and U.
