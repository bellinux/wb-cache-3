Among such V regions an amino acid substitution due to somatic mutation is recurrently observed at V CDR 2 position 58, regardless of which of these haptens is used for immunization.

Finite size effects are highly relevant to ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices, where an external trap creates smaller effective regions {{in the form of the}} celebrated "wedding cake" structure and the local density approximation is often not applicable. Specifically, for the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian we calculate number, quantum depletion, local von-Neumann entropy, generalized entanglement or Q-measure, fidelity, and fidelity susceptibility; for the Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian we also calculate the pairing correlations, magnetization, charge-density correlations, and antiferromagnetic structure factor.

40|$|Cross-linguistic {{studies in}} agrammatic aphasia have attested asymmetries in the {{comprehension}} of semantically reversible structures with <b>canonical</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>non-canonical</b> argument order, {{with the latter}} compromised. Recently, Grillo (2005, 2008, 2009) introduced the Relativized Minimality approach to locality in syntax as a possible explanation for agrammatic deficits, suggesting that minimality effects arise between an A-moved element and its copy/trace {{if there is an}} intervener with similar morphosyntactic features. In an extension of this approach, Friedmann et al. (2009) suggested that the source of minimality effects is the presence of lexical NP restriction in the displaced and in the intervening element. The present study aimed at investigating whether the predictions within this version of RM can be confirmed by the data obtained from six Greek-speaking agrammatic individuals. Our results provide some support for Friedmann et al. 's RM approach but are not entirely compatible with it. We suggest that minimality effects in the agrammatic speakers' comprehension can emerge {{even in the absence of}} lexical NP restriction, and that the internal structure of the A'-moved element and of the intervener crucially modulates these effects, although to a lesser extent. Last, we show that morphological case does not facilitate agrammatic speakers' comprehension, and, thus, we conclude that morphology does not provide cues that can 'resolve' minimality effects in language breakdown.

A {{cognitive}} system, which is adapted to the environment, would take such co-occurrences into account and use top-down driven expectancies for faster recognition. Although many object recognition theories assume a serial bottom-up processing and disregard top-down feedback from later stages to earlier ones, neuropsychological and imaging studies suggest recurrent feedback during object identication (e. g., Humphreys, Riddoch and Price, 1997, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, 1275 - 1282). We present further evidence for top-down in uences in object recognition using a priming approach. In Experiment 1 participants named objects (e. g., TV) in two dierent views (<b>canonical</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>non-canonical),</b> which were preceded by a contextually consistent (e. g., remote control) or inconsistent (e. g., hammer) priming stimulus. We found clear eects of prime consistency and target viewpoint as well as a signicant interaction. Presenting a consistent prime prior to a target reduced the viewpoint dependency signicantly. These results were replicated in Experiment 2 using a contextual association task. Participants had to judge whether the second of two sequentially presented objects tends to co-occur with the rst one. Consistent priming stimuli reduced the viewpoint-dependency of the reaction times to the target objects.

While (unstressed) personal pronouns are the default means to indicate coreference with the most prominent discourse entity (backward-looking function) and typically mark {{the maintenance of the}} current topic, demonstratives are used to refer to a less prominent entity and serve the additional forward-looking function of signaling a possible topic shift. In Experiment 1, we present an ERP study that examines the time course of processing personal and d-pronouns in German (er vs. der) and assesses the impact of two prominence features of the antecedent, thematic role and sentential position, as well as neurophysiological correlates of backward- and forward-looking functions of referential expressions. We tested the comprehension of personal and d-pronouns following context sentences containing two potential antecedents. In addition to the factor pronoun type (er vs. der), we varied the verb type (active accusative verbs vs. dative experiencer verbs) and the thematic role order (<b>canonical</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>non-canonical)</b> in the context sentences to vary the antecedent’s prominence. Time-locked to pronoun-onset, the ERPs revealed a general biphasic N 400 -Late Positivity for d-pronouns over personal pronouns with further subtle interactions of the prominence-lending cues in the early time window. The findings indicate that the calculation of the referential candidates’ prominence (backward-looking function) is guided by thematic role and positional information. Thematic role information, in combination with initial position, thus represents a central predictor during referential processing. Coreference with a less prominent entity (assumed for d-pronouns) results in processing costs (N 400). The additional topic shift signaled by d-pronouns (forward-looking function) results in attentional reorienting (Late Positivity). This is further supported by Experiment 2, a story continuation study, which showed that personal pronouns trigger topic maintenance, while d-pronouns yield topic shifts...|$|R

Many cellular factors are reportedly associated with the IRF-mediated signalling pathways, but the IRF-associated signals are not completely understood yet. We identified BTBD 2 as a novel cellular factor interacting with IRF- 4 by the yeast two-hybrid system. A short BTBD 2 variant transcript, termed variant 2 (v 2), was found in various cell lines, expressed from an internal promoter in the third intron, {{in addition to the}} canonical BTBD 2 transcript (<b>v</b> 1). The <b>canonical</b> <b>v</b> 1 protein did not bind to any IRFs tested, but the v 2 protein bound to all the tested IRF family members. Furthermore, only the v 2 protein inhibited TLR- and RLR-mediated signalling significantly, probably due to suppressing the nuclear translocation of IRFs. Knockdown of BTBD 2 expression by siRNA enhanced TLR 4 -activated IFN-β and IL- 12 p 40 expressions. Taken together, this study found that BTBD 2 v 2 negatively controls the IRF-associated signalling pathways, suggesting that BTBD 2 v 2 {{is one of the key}} regulatory factors involved in the negative feedback of IRF signalling. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 622 号 学位授与年月日:平成 25 年 9 月 19 日Author: Koon Jiew Chua, Kiyoshi Yasui, Yoshinao Kubo, Yuhua Ma, Toshifumi Matsuyama, Hideki HayashiCitation: International Journal of Integrative Biology, 14 (1), pp. 31 - 38; 201...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese {{language}} allows flexible {{word order}} (Shibatani, 1990) and allows missing noun constituents (Shibatani, 1990). The case-marking is realized with postpositional particles, e. g. the subject marker —ga and the direct object marker -o. However, these case markers are often omitted (Aida, 1993; Miyata, 2008; Rispoli, 1989). While Bates and MacWhinney (1989) and Sasaki and MacWhinney (2006) view case marking as the strongest cue in Japanese and animacy contrast {{as the second}} reliable cue, Ito, Tahara, and Park (1993) and Rispoli (1987) claim that Japanese children produce case markers with errors {{because they do not}} process them. It has not been clear how Japanese children acquire verb argument structure when there is little structural information in their input. The current study aims to account for first language acquisition of Japanese verb argument structure by means of corpus analysis. We hypothesize that, while case markers are often omitted, both mothers' production and children's production initially follow the canonical pattern where the word order cue and the animacy contrast cue form a coalition (Bates & MacWhinney, 1989; Sasaki & MacWhinney, 2006), which aids children to identify the grammatical relations of the verb arguments. The results indicated that the coalition we proposed is reliable information when the two nouns were realized. While both mothers and children produced the non-canonical form frequently even at the earliest age contrary to our prediction, children start from the <b>canonical</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>non-canonical</b> ratio that is similar to the maternal speech and then develop their own distribution as they get older. Moreover, we suggest that animacy contrast cue in Japanese is more important for children than it has been suggested in the past. The animacy contrast is almost always present in the utterances and it is the information the speakers and the listeners use to specify the grammatical relations of the noun arguments when the sentence involves the reordering of the constituents or includes only one noun. On the other hand, the case-marking cue only appeared in a redundant context, which makes it hard for Japanese children to acquire case-marking...|$|R

However, {{the contribution of}} <b>canonical</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>non-canonical</b> pathways in cartilage is unknown because the role of Smad 2 in chondrogenesis has not been investigated in vivo. Therefore, we analyzed mice in which Smad 2 is deleted in cartilage (Smad 2 CKO), global Smad 3 -/- mutants, and crosses of these strains. Growth plates at birth from all mutant strains exhibited expanded columnar and hypertrophic zones, linked to increased proliferation in resting chondrocytes. Defects were more severe in Smad 2 CKO and Smad 2 CKO;Smad 3 -/- (Smad 2 / 3) mutant mice than in Smad 3 -/- mice, demonstrating that Smad 2 {{plays a role in}} chondrogenesis. Increased levels of Ihh RNA, a key regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, were seen in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the three mutant strains at birth. In accordance, TGFβ treatment decreased Ihh RNA levels in primary chondrocytes from control (Smad 2 fx/fx) mice, but inhibition was impaired in cells from mutants. Consistent with the skeletal phenotype, the impact on TGFβ-mediated inhibition of Ihh RNA expression was more severe in Smad 2 CKO than in Smad 3 -/- cells. Putative Smad 2 / 3 binding elements (SBEs) were identified in the proximal Ihh promoter. Mutagenesis demonstrated a role for three of them. ChIP analysis suggested that Smad 2 and Smad 3 have different affinities for these SBEs, and that the repressors SnoN and Ski were differentially recruited by Smad 2 and Smad 3, respectively. Furthermore, nuclear localization of the repressor Hdac 4 was decreased in growth plates of Smad 2 CKO and double mutant mice. TGFβ induced association of Hdac 4 with Smad 2, but not with Smad 3, on the Ihh promoter. Overall, these studies revealed that Smad 2 plays an essential {{role in the development of}} the growth plate, that both Smads 2 and 3 inhibit Ihh expression in the neonatal growth plate, and suggested they accomplish this by binding to distinct SBEs, mediating assembly of distinct repressive complexes...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of heavy-ion {{collision}} experiments is to study {{the structure of the}} QCD phase diagram. The QCD phase diagram is typically plotted as temperature (T) vs. baryon chemical potential (μ_B). The statistical thermal model THERMUS compared to experimental data provides chemical freeze-out parameters such as temperature, baryon chemical potential and strangeness saturation factor (γ_s). However, the values of these parameters depend on models and their underlying assumptions, such as the nature of the ensemble used, particle ratios vs. particle yields, and the treatment of feed-down contributions to particle yields. In these proceedings, we report on a systematic study of chemical freeze-out parameters using THERMUS, as a function of collision centrality and collision energies (√(s_NN) = 7. 7 - 200 GeV). These studies are performed with the string melting version of A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. A comparison is presented of freeze-out parameters between grand-canonical <b>vs.</b> strangeness <b>canonical</b> ensembles, particle yields vs. ratios, with and without feed-down contributions to the particle yields.
