5|$|The Wrongs of Woman {{begins in}} medias res with the upper-class Maria's unjust {{imprisonment}} by her husband, George Venables. Not only has he condemned Maria {{to live in}} an insane asylum, but he has also taken their child away from her. She manages to befriend one of her attendants in the asylum, an impoverished, lower-class woman named Jemima, who, after realizing that Maria is <b>not</b> <b>mad,</b> agrees to bring her a few books. Some of these have notes scribbled in them by Henry Darnford, another inmate, and Maria falls in love with him via his marginalia. The two begin to communicate and eventually meet. Darnford reveals that he has had a debauched life; waking up in the asylum after a night of heavy drinking, he has been unable to convince the doctors to release him.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E
500|$|The Norwegian symbolist artist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) had to {{cope with}} disease, mental illness, and death in his family, as well as a strict and {{strongly}} religious father. During his lifetime he experienced disappointment in love and feeble health, causing him fits of melancholia; Munch also became an alcoholic. The artist never married. This influenced his artistic production and the emotional states of his paintings. [...] "Most of Munch’s figures," [...] writes Roberta Smith, [...] "are <b>not</b> <b>mad,</b> but paralyzed by oceanic feelings of grief, jealousy, desire or despair that many people found shocking either for their eroticism, crude style or intimations of mental instability." [...] Though shocking, his paintings are characterized by an emotional honesty and integrity that makes them [...] thrilling.|$|E

500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Now Christopher Smart {{was a very}} beggarly poet of {{the eighteenth}} century [...] but had not the {{smallest}} claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem. Kit Smart, in fact, though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse, could not write poetry—nor anything else [...] Legally mad, that is; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses, and a decent citizen out of them. He went mad—legally and medically—once, and nothing came out of it, perhaps because he was <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> enough. Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in Bedlam wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century—perhaps the finest-before the advent of Blake [...] Smart regained his senses, and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry. And he never did anything after.|$|E
500|$|Polonius forces Ophelia {{to return}} Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince {{while he and}} Claudius watch from afar to {{evaluate}} Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether [...] "to be or not to be". When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries [...] "get thee to a nunnery," [...] though {{it is unclear whether}} this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room: proof positive for Hamlet of his uncle's guilt.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{the release}} of [...] "Roar", many accused Perry of copying Sara Bareilles' [...] "Brave". When Bareilles herself {{was asked about the}} {{controversy}} between the two songs, she responded: [...] "Katy's a friend of mine and we've known each other a really long time", and was upset that there was a [...] "negative spin on two artists that are choosing to share positive messages." [...] She also mentioned she had known about [...] "Roar" [...] before its release and stated [...] "If I'm <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> I don't know why anybody else is upset". In response to the accusations, Dr. Luke tweeted on August 14, 2013: [...] "Roar was written and recorded before Brave came out." [...] In direct response to the attention [...] "Brave" [...] received {{as a result of the}} plagiarism accusations, Bareilles' record label, Epic Records, decided to promote [...] "Brave" [...] to the mainstream pop radio format.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} the album's {{production}} was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating [...] "The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but they turned the album into this dancey electro-pop. A lot of it had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, {{not only did they}} change the music, they changed it into something [...] I couldn't relate.'" [...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>mad.</b> But I don't repeat words when I rap. They cooked up some electronic stuff, you know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{announced}} a 90-minute special entitled Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular. It {{was the second}} Thanksgiving television special on ABC by Gaga, after A Very Gaga Thanksgiving in 2011. The singer collaborated with the Muppets for the special, which aired on November 28, 2013. [...] "I was so excited when ABC called me about doing a holiday special this year. I knew it just wouldn't be a complete night of laughter and memories without the Muppets! Can't wait to see the gang again, and I hope Miss Piggy's still <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> about Kermit ... We're just friends," [...] Gaga said about the special. Guest stars included Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elton John and RuPaul, with an appearance by Kristen Bell. Gaga performed several songs from her third studio album, Artpop. The singer had collaborated twice with the Muppets in the past; in 2009 Kermit the Frog was her date at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she featured Jim Henson's Creature Shop pieces on the Monster Ball Tour (2009–2011).|$|E

500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
500|$|On 5 October 1983 {{the band}} were rehearsing and {{discussing}} a possible television series, which was being written {{for them by}} Ben Elton and Richard Curtis. Barson then informed the band {{that he would not}} be able to take part, as he was tired of the music business and wanted to spend more time with his wife. They had recently relocated to Amsterdam. [...] Barson agreed to finish recording the album Keep Moving; he left after playing for the last time with the band at the Lyceum Ballroom on 21 December 1983. After leaving the band James Mackie took Barson's place appearing with Madness on the US hit television show Saturday Night Live on 14 April 1984. After leaving the band, Barson returned to the UK for the filming of two music videos as he had played on the tracks, [...] "Michael Caine" [...] and [...] "One Better Day". He officially left the band in June 1984, following the release of [...] "One Better Day", however finished live performance with the band in 1983, Paul Carrack took Barson's place whilst the band toured America in early 1984. The six remaining members left Stiff Records and formed their own label, Zarjazz Records, which was a sub-label of Virgin Records. In 1985, the label released the band's sixth album, Mad <b>Not</b> <b>Mad.</b> Barson's keyboard parts were filled by synthesisers and Steve Nieve joined the band to take his place. In later years, frontman Suggs described the album as a [...] "polished turd". The album reached number 16 in the UK charts, which was the band's lowest position on the album charts to date. Despite the poor chart showing, the album was listed as number 55 in NME's All Time 100 Albums. The singles for the album fared even worse, with [...] "Yesterday's Men" [...] peaking at number 18 in the UK charts. The subsequent singles, [...] "Uncle Sam" [...] and [...] "Sweetest Girl", failed to make the top 20, which was a first for Madness singles.|$|E

2500|$|Karam's 2002 album, Tahamouni, was {{far removed}} from the [...] "easy going" [...] {{contemporary}} feel of Oyoun Qalbi and Nedmaneh, and audiences noticed. The album was intended to get back in touch with a more youthful audience from other Arab nations, with whom had taken slight dis-interest in Karam's music from the late 90s. This was shown though songs like Tahamouni (They accused me) which included attempts at rapping, and Ew'a Tekoun Ze'alt (I hope you're <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> at me) which seemed to have a complete Western influence. The songs had a youthful sound.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Hislop {{comments}} that {{history has been}} somewhat unkind to [...] "Britain's most hated civil servant", by forgetting that he proposed a much better bus service that ministers never delivered, and {{that in some ways}} he was used to do their [...] "dirty work for them". Hislop describes Beeching as [...] "a technocrat [...] wasn't open to argument to romantic notions of rural England or the warp and weft of the train in our national identity. He didn't buy any of that. He went for a straightforward profit and loss approach and some claim we are still reeling from that today". Beeching was unrepentant about his role in the closures: [...] "I suppose I'll always be looked upon as the axe man, but it was surgery, <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> chopping".|$|E
2500|$|Aware of Blake's visions, William Wordsworth commented, [...] "There was {{no doubt}} that this poor man was mad, but there is {{something}} in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott." [...] In a more deferential vein, writing in A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature, John William Cousins wrote that Blake was [...] "a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few", who [...] "led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations". Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, whose entry on Blake comments that [...] "the question whether Blake was or was <b>not</b> <b>mad</b> seems likely to remain in dispute, but {{there can be no doubt}} whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence".|$|E

2500|$|The {{new owner}} was Francis Fane, a {{barrister}} and Member of Parliament. The Fanes completed the interior decoration {{of the state}} rooms, but other than this they are remarkable only for their various eccentricities rather than their structural alterations. Francis Fane lived at Brympton d'Evercy for 26 years before bequeathing it to his brother Thomas, who became the 8th Earl of Westmorland. Thus once again the house became a secondary residence. The house {{seems to have been}} left largely empty until the time of John 10th Earl. This amorous adventurer [...] had taken as his second wife Jane Saunders, so wildly eccentric that she was described by Charles Fox as :"...perhaps <b>not</b> <b>mad,</b> but nobody ever approached so near it with so much reason". The Countess decided to shock conventional society and leave her husband, taking her daughter Lady Georgiana Fane with her. This unconventional pair of ladies set up home at Brympton d'Evercy. The countess was responsible for installing the classical fireplaces which remain in situ today, and assembling the furniture and art collection which remained at Brympton until it was dispersed in a large sale in the late 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Several documentaries have {{attempted}} to portray Tourette's syndrome accurately and to advocate for greater understanding of persons with Tourette's, while others focus on sensationalizing coprolalia. The Emmy Award-winning television documentary film I Have Tourette's but Tourette's Doesn't Have Me was produced by HBO {{in conjunction with the}} Tourette Syndrome Association, featuring {{children between the ages of}} six and 13. It was described by the Cincinnati Enquirer as [...] "the best simple overview yet of Tourette's". John's <b>Not</b> <b>Mad</b> (1989) and The Boy Can't Help It (2000) are documentaries about a young man from Scotland, who has severe Tourette's and coprolalia. Twitch and Shout examines a society that is quick to judge a person who strays outside the limits of conventional behavior and was nominated for an Emmy. A 2007 British documentary, Tourette De France, followed a group of teenagers with Tourette's on a trip to Paris; many of the teenagers featured in the program had coprolalia. Movements and Madness: Gusti Ayu is a documentary about the struggles of a young woman with severe Tourette's in a small village in Indonesia.
