This study examined coping strategies used by a sample of deaf women who self reported an unwanted sexual experience at any point in their life and assessed the relationship between coping strategies used and their overall psychological health and life satisfaction. The current study modified and extended the Frazier et al. (2005) study by including two additional coping strategies: problem-solving (PS) and social support (SS). It was hypothesized that the coping strategies problem avoidance (PA), social withdrawal (SW), problem-solving (PS), cognitive-restructuring (CR), expressing emotions (EE), and social support (SS) would predict significant variance in psychological distress {{at the time of the}} unwanted sexual experience(s). Specifically, PA and SW would positively <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> past psychological distress and PS, CR, EE and SS would <b>negatively</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> past psychological distress. Also, it was hypothesized that PA and SW would positively <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> current psychological distress, while PS, CR, EE and SS would <b>negatively</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> current psychological distress. Finally, it was hypothesized that PA and SW would <b>negatively</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> life satisfaction and PS, CR, EE and SS would positively <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> life satisfaction. Findings supported all three hypotheses regarding the prediction of the coping strategies on current or past psychological distress and satisfaction with life. Additional findings are discussed...|$|R

This indicates that the shorter the disbursement lag, the higher the loan repayment, which also conforms to a priori expectations.

25|$|There is {{research}} {{evidence that}} the digit ratio {{of the length of}} the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat <b>negatively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.|$|E
25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also <b>negatively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E
2500|$|After the Obama {{administration}} reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties {{reduced their}} immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found [...] "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, {{a measure of}} policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led {{to an increase in}} policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police." [...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly <b>negatively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> crime rates. The bad news is that the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero." ...|$|E
