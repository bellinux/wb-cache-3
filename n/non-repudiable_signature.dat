40|$|In this {{document}} a reporting system is described {{with the aim}} of allowing an easy reading of medical report (in PDF format) to a human-user (clinician), and to a programmatic- user who has to capture and make available the clinical data contained in EHR software. The system provides a <b>non-repudiable</b> <b>signature,</b> with PADES protocol, which attests the role and purpose of Authorized Signer of the PDF document. We approached to this problem by validating the technologies provided by the standards of medical infomatics. Clinical data, acquired from clinical experts, are converted in a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), as defined by the Health Level 7 (HL 7) organization...|$|E

A June 2008 New Scientist article critiqued Bitfrost's P_THEFT security option, which allows each laptop to be configured to transmit an individualized, <b>non-repudiable</b> digital <b>signature</b> to a central server at most once each day to remain functioning.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{extend the}} definitional work of Dwork, Naor and Sahai from deniable {{authentication}} to deniable key-exchange protocols. We then use these definitions {{to prove the}} deniability features of SKEME and SIGMA, two natural and efficient protocols which serve as basis for the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. The two protocols require distinct approaches to their deniability analysis, hence highlighting important definitional issues as well as necessitating different tools in the analysis. SKEME is an encryption-based protocol for which we prove full deniability based on the plaintext awareness of the underlying encryption scheme. Interestingly SKEME’s deniability is possibly the first “natural ” application which essentially requires plaintext awareness (until now this notion has been mainly used {{as a tool for}} proving chosen-ciphertext security); in particular this use of plaintext awareness is not tied to the random oracle model. SIGMA, on the other hand, uses <b>non-repudiable</b> <b>signatures</b> for authentication and hence cannot be proven to be fully deniable. Yet we are able to prove a weaker, but meaningful, “partial deniability ” property: a party {{may not be able to}} deny that it was “alive ” at some point in time but can fully deny the contents of its communications and the identity of its interlocutors. We remark that the deniability of SKEME and SIGMA holds in a concurrent setting and does not essentially rely on the random oracle model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Proxy {{signature}} schemes {{have been}} invented to delegate the signing capability to a designated person (called a proxy signer). In this paper, we have proposed an efficient <b>non-repudiable</b> threshold proxy <b>signature</b> scheme, with traceability of adversarial proxy signers and without assistance of any trusted third party. The main advantages of our scheme are traceability of malicious proxy signers and security against so-called conspiracy attack. (i. e., t or more signers act in collusion and can impersonate any other set of signers to forge signatures). As the Internet {{becomes more and}} more a part of our day-to-day life and as e-commerce continues to grow, Internet security becomes more of an issue. Cryptography is no longer attached only with military organizations as before but for all secure business transactions over Internet. In 1976, Diffie and Hellman[1] introduced the concept of public key cryptography. Since then, more an...|$|R
40|$|Post-Wang trauma SHA- 1 much {{weaker than}} thought Lost {{confidence}} in SHA- 1 {{but also in}} our ability to design secure collision resistant hashing (how much cryptanalysis ahead?) <b>Non-repudiable</b> * digital <b>signatures</b> depend essentially on collision resistance (*most other uses of signatures do not require CR) Digital signatures cannot “afford ” such uncertainty (too central to the “electronic society”) Is reliance on collision resistance evitable? Can we build secure digital signatures on weaker assumptions? Yes in theory, how about practice? Our Proposal: Executive Summary A randomized mode of operation for hash functions Use any hash function as is (existing and future, mainly M-D) Add simple input randomization Combine with digital signatures Effect: increased security (cryptanalysts will have to work much harder to break the resultant signature schemes) Off-line collisions useless, attack requires interaction with signer! Even WEAK CR hash functions may be saved by this mode (remember HMAC?) What’s needed: change to signature standards salt and encoding (no change to hash functions or signing algorithms) What this proposal is NOT NOT a new hash function NOT a call to stop searching for stronger hash functions NOT a magic bullet (but an effective vaccine) NOT required for all uses of digital signatures (eg. ephemeral authent’n) NOT a replacement for all applications of CR hashing (eg. deterministic hashing, compare independ’ly computed hashes, bit commitment, counter-sigs) NOT a new cryptographic notion (but a new mode of operation...|$|R
