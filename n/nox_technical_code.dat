40|$|A growing {{attention}} has been addressed {{to the influence of}} infills on the seismic behavior of Reinforced Concrete buildings, also supported by numerical and experimental analyses, and by the observation of damage to infilled RC buildings after recent earthquakes (e. g. L'Aquila 2009, Lorca 2011, Emilia 2012). In this paper, the attention is focused on the Damage Limitation Limit State (DL LS), defined as dependent on displacement capacity limit directly related to the damage to infill panels. Although inelastic (post-cracking) displacement demand in RC members at this LS can be quite low, infill behavior can be already strongly non linear, if a diffuse state of cracking has begun to arise in infill panels. Thus, {{based on the results of}} several non linear dynamic analyses, a reduction factor of the initial elastic stiffness of infills is estimated, in order to obtain an effective stiffness of infill panels to be used in a linear analysis in order to obtain a displacement demand at DL LS (i. e., maximum Interstorey Drift Ratio) which is approximately equal to the demand evaluated through non linear dynamic analysis on the same model. To this end, Incremental Dynamic Analyses (IDAs) are performed on four- and eight-storey infilled frames, designed for seismic loads according to the current Italian <b>technical</b> <b>code</b> and for gravity loads only according to an obsolete <b>technical</b> <b>code.</b> Influence of number of storeys and design typology on the obtained effective stiffness is also analyzed...|$|R

The free-dripping method still requires the bears to be prodded with a metal rod when the wound heals over and under veterinary examination, some bears with free-dripping fistulae were actually found to have clear perspex catheters permanently implanted into their gallbladders.

40|$|The {{deformation}} {{performance of}} the base cross sections of reinforced concrete buildings is fundamental when large seismic events occur allowing the structure to have large excursions in nonlinear field and guaranteeing an overall ductile behaviour. It {{is well known that}} the axial force acting on columns significantly reduces the curvature capacity of the sections and for this reason the <b>technical</b> <b>codes</b> give design criteria stating a limitation in order to preserve the displacement capacity. It is also recognized that when biaxial bending occur the cross section undergo a loss in strength capacity. Starting the study of from Bresler (1960), which provided suitable expression to predict 3 D limit interaction surfaces, several numerical and analytical models were developed {{to take into account the}} biaxial interaction in strength. Simultaneously it is noteworthy to point out that the presence of biaxial bending also influences the deformation capacity of sections causing in most of the cases a relevant loss of the curvature and ductility available with respect to the one owned along the principal axes. This important issue is not faced by <b>technical</b> <b>codes</b> and not exhaustively treated in scientific literature as it was done for strength. Moreover nonlinear structural models based on lumped plasticity do not take into account these interaction aspects when defining plastic hinge properties in terms of curvature capacity. The paper presents a numerical study in which the deformation capacity of RC cross sections subjected to axial load and biaxial bending is investigated by means of a fiber discretization. A procedure for the numerical definition of biaxial domains of ultimate curvature, yielding curvature and curvature ductility is provided and the sensitivity of the biaxial deformation performance to some geometrical and mechanical parameters (aspect ratio, concrete strength and confinement efficacy) is discussed...|$|R
