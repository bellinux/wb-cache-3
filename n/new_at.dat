25|$|In 1978, AT {{commissioned}} {{a new building}} at 550 Madison Avenue. This <b>new</b> <b>AT</b> Building was designed by Philip Johnson and quickly became an icon of the new Postmodern architectural style. The building was completed in 1984, the same year of the divestiture of the Bell System. The building proved to be too large for the post-divestiture corporation and in 1993, AT leased the building to Sony, which now owns it.|$|E
25|$|Gude {{was finally}} {{accepted}} into the Academy {{in the autumn of}} 1842 and joined Schirmer's landscape painting class where he made quick progress. The landscape painting class at the Academy was <b>new</b> <b>at</b> the time, having been founded in 1839 as a counterpart to the more long standing figure painting class. At the time figure painting was considered a more prestigious genre than landscape painting as it was thought only through painting the human body could true beauty be expressed.|$|E
25|$|Diogenes Laërtius {{divided the}} history of the Academy into three: the Old, the Middle, and the <b>New.</b> <b>At</b> the head of the Old he put Plato, {{at the head of the}} Middle Academy, Arcesilaus, and of the New, Lacydes. Sextus Empiricus {{enumerated}} five divisions of the followers of Plato. He made Plato founder of the first Academy; Arcesilaus of the second; Carneades of the third; Philo and Charmadas of the fourth; Antiochus of the fifth. Cicero recognised only two Academies, the Old and New, and made the latter commence with Arcesilaus.|$|E

25|$|In addition, many NA {{groups were}} not {{following}} the 12 traditions very closely (which were quite <b>new</b> <b>at</b> the time). These groups were at times accepting money from outside entities, conflating AA with NA, or even adding religious elements to the meetings. For {{a variety of}} reasons, meetings began to decline in the late 1950s, {{and there was a}} four-month period in 1959 when there were no meetings held anywhere at all. Spurred into action by this, Kinnon and others dedicated themselves to restarting NA, promising to hold to the traditions more closely.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} its random-access memory, or RAM, the Nintendo 64 {{is one of the}} first modern {{consoles}} to implement a unified memory subsystem, instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, for example. The memory itself consists of 4 megabytes of RDRAM, made by Rambus. The RAM is expandable to 8MB with the Expansion Pak. Rambus was quite <b>new</b> <b>at</b> the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth for a relatively low cost.|$|E

25|$|The group's mostly {{instrumental}} compositions were novel melodic sound collages {{based on}} digital sampler technology, which was <b>new</b> <b>at</b> the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring {{the distinction between}} the art and its creators. The band is noted for innovative use of electronics and computers in pop music and particularly for innovative use of sampling. From the earliest releases on ZTT, the band referred to itself as both Art of Noise and The Art of Noise. Official and unofficial releases and press material use both versions.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Reno tasked the Justice Department with {{compiling}} {{a report on}} DNA exoneration. The science was still <b>new</b> <b>at</b> that point in time. Reno commissioned the report after reading about the exoneration of a death row inmate. She {{wanted to know how}} many cases existed like the one she read about and what the Department of Justice could learn from it. The resulting report concluded there was a strong possibility that many more wrongful convictions which could be cleared with DNA evidence existed. Reno changed policies on how to interview eye witnesses and laboratory protocols in response.|$|E
25|$|Murmurs sound {{characterized}} the quieter, introverted {{side of the}} first wave of alternative rock in the United States. The sound was <b>new</b> <b>at</b> the time, though not stepping beyond the constructs of traditional rock music. The guitars have a bright, ring-like chime that brought on comparisons to The Byrds, and the bass guitar has the bright punchy sound of the Rickenbacker favored by Mike Mills. Mills carries much of the melodic element of the music on the bass, contributing to the moody sound of early R.E.M. albums. Also contributing to this sound is the distant singing of Michael Stipe whose obscure lyrics, sung indistinctly, lend to the mystery and depth of the music.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the various}} {{resulting}} 1984 spinoffs, only BellSouth actively used and promoted the Bell name and logo during its entire history, from the 1984 break-up to its merger with the <b>new</b> <b>AT</b> in 2006. Similarly, cessation of using either the Bell name or logo occurred {{for many of}} the other companies more than a decade after the 1984 break-up as part of an acquisition-related rebranding. The others have only used the marks on rare occasions to maintain their trademark rights, even less now that they have adopted names conceived long after divestiture. Examples include Verizon, which still used the Bell logo on its trucks and payphones until it updated its own logo in 2015, and Qwest, formerly US West, which licenses the Northwestern Bell and Mountain Bell names to Unical Enterprises, who makes telephones under the Northwestern Bell name.|$|E
