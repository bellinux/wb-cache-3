40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explored}} {{the utility of}} restricted <b>neck</b> movement in epidemiologic case definition for <b>neck</b> disorders. METHODS: Data on <b>neck</b> pain, sensory symptoms in the arm, psychosocial and physical risk factors for <b>neck</b> disorders, {{and the range of}} active <b>neck</b> movements were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire, interview, and physical examination for a community-based sample of 2145 adults aged 25 - 64 years. The prevalence of <b>neck</b> pain and sensory symptoms was examined according to the extent of <b>neck</b> movements. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of risk factors to <b>neck</b> disorders, defined by various combinations of pain and restricted movement, and the associations were compared. RESULTS: The ranges of different categories of <b>neck</b> movement were correlated within persons, and their sum ("total <b>neck</b> movement") was unimodally distributed across persons. The prevalence of <b>neck</b> pain and sensory symptoms was elevated when total <b>neck</b> movement was below the 30 th centile, and particularly below the 10 th centile. Associations between <b>neck</b> pain and low vitality and poor support at work were stronger when there was also restricted <b>neck</b> movement, but the extent of <b>neck</b> movement did not materially modify the relation of <b>neck</b> pain to physical risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The restriction of total <b>neck</b> movement may serve as a marker of severity in community-based studies of <b>neck</b> disorders, but no indication was found that it distinguishes a subset of cases with a distinct etiology...|$|R

The {{effect of}} pectoralis major flap (PMF) harvest on {{shoulder}} function, {{allowing for the}} effects of <b>neck</b> dissection, has not previously been objectively measured. Methods. Twenty-two patients who underwent PMF recon-struction were studied. The control group comprised 35 patients with <b>neck</b> dissection (without PMF). <b>Neck</b> dissections in both groups were classified into 3 grades; grade 1 : no <b>neck</b> dissection/selective <b>neck</b> dissection; grade 2 : modified radical <b>neck</b> dissection; grade 3 : radical <b>neck</b> dissection/extended radical <b>neck</b> dissection.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{study the}} {{relation}} between <b>neck</b> pain and work related <b>neck</b> flexion, <b>neck</b> rotation, and sitting.  METHODS—A prospective cohort study was performed with a follow up of 3  years among 1334  workers from 34  companies. Work related physical load was assessed by analysing objectively measured exposure data (video recordings) of <b>neck</b> flexion, <b>neck</b> rotation, and sitting posture. <b>Neck</b> pain was assessed by a questionnaire. Adjustments were made for various physical factors that were related or not related to work, psychosocial factors, and individual characteristics.  RESULTS—A significant positive relation {{was found between the}} percentage of the working time in a sitting position and <b>neck</b> pain, implying an increased risk of <b>neck</b> pain for workers who were sitting for more than 95 % of the working time (crude relative risk (RR) 2. 01,  95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 04  to 3. 88; adjusted RR 2. 34,  95 % CI 1. 05  to 5. 21).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Neck</b> {{dissection}} is {{an important}} surgical procedure {{for the management of}} metastatic nodal disease in the <b>neck.</b> The gold standard of <b>neck</b> nodal management has been the radical <b>neck</b> dissection. Any modification in the <b>neck</b> dissection is always compared with this standard. Over the last few decades, in order to alleviate the morbidity of radical <b>neck</b> dissection, several modifications and conservative procedures have been advocated. These procedures retain certain lymphatic or non-lymphatic structures and have been shown not to compromise oncological safety. Methods A literature search of the Medline was carried out for all articles on <b>neck</b> dissections. The articles were systematically reviewed to analyze and trace the evolution of <b>neck</b> dissection. These were then categorized to address the nomenclature, management of node positive and node negative <b>neck</b> including those who had received chemoradiation. Results The present article discusses the <b>neck</b> nodal nomenclature, the radical <b>neck</b> dissection, its modifications and migration to more conservative procedures and possible advances in the near future. Conclusion Radical <b>neck</b> dissection is now replaced with modified radical <b>neck</b> dissections in most situations. Attempts are being made to replace modified radical <b>neck</b> dissections with selective <b>neck</b> dissections for early node positivity. Sentinel node biopsy is being studied {{to address the issue of}} node negative <b>neck.</b> More conservative surgeries are likely to replace the 'radical' surgeries of bygone era. This process is facilitated by earlier detection of the disease and better understanding of cancer biology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives：The {{status of}} {{cervical}} lymph node is a great influence to the prognosis of patient with head and <b>neck</b> cancer. There {{has been a great}} controversies on the treatment of clinical N 0 <b>neck.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the outcomes of the elective <b>neck</b> dissection in clinical N 0 <b>neck</b> of various sites of primary lesion. Materials and Methods：The authors analyzed the outcomes of elective <b>neck</b> dissection by retrospective study with review of records of 38 head and <b>neck</b> cancer patients (56 sites) who had clinically N 0 <b>neck.</b> Results：The overall rate of occult <b>neck</b> metastasis was 31. 6 %. Occult <b>neck</b> metastasis rates according to primary sites were 37. 5 % (supraglottic larynx), 25. 0 % (glottis), 25. 0 % (hypopharynx) and 20. 0 % (tongue) and according to T stage were 50. 0 % (T 1), 13. 3 % (T 2), 57. 1 % (T 3) and 0 % (T 4). Four cases had nodal recurrence (1 out of 4 had occult <b>neck</b> metastasis) after elective <b>neck</b> dissections and there were no significant postoperative complications.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{advancement}} in science, molecular medicine and target therapies, surgical treatment of metastases using different techniques, from selective <b>neck</b> dissection to extended radical <b>neck</b> dissections, form {{a major part}} {{in the management of}} <b>neck</b> metastases. This {{is due to the fact}} that, so far, there is no treatment more effective for resectable <b>neck</b> metastases, than surgery. Since most head and <b>neck</b> cancer patients die due to loco-regional progression of disease, and a very large majority of them do not live long enough to develop distant metastases, the status of <b>neck</b> lymph nodes remains the single most important prognostic factor, in these cases. In the 100 years since George Washington Crile described Radical <b>Neck</b> Dissection, we now have a much better understanding of the biological and clinical behaviour of <b>neck</b> metastases. This has ultimately led to the conservative approaches of selective <b>neck</b> dissections depending on the primary site of the tumour, type of tumour and the characteristic features of the metastases themselves. A search of the literature on <b>neck</b> lymph nodes and <b>neck</b> dissections, on the internet and in old publications, not available in the electronic media, has been carried out. Using this as the basis, we arranged, in sequence, the dates of various landmarks in the treatment of head and <b>neck</b> cancer related to <b>neck</b> dissections to emphasize the overall process of evolution of <b>neck</b> dissection thereby showing how the field of head and <b>neck</b> surgery has travelled a long way from radical <b>neck</b> dissection to its modifications and further to selective <b>neck</b> dissections and sentinel node biopsies. The present understanding of the patterns of <b>neck</b> metastases enables us not only to adequately treat the <b>neck</b> metastases, but also to diagnose metastases from unknown primaries. Therefore, depending on the site of the primary tumour, it is now easy to predict the most probable route of metastatic spread and vice versa. This has enabled us to adopt modified and selective <b>neck</b> dissections which have ultimately led to a dramatic reduction in morbidity and almost eliminated mortality due to <b>neck</b> dissection. In the near future, molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies for treating metastases should be able to further reduce the burden of head and <b>neck</b> cancer...|$|R
