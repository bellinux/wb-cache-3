Ladies and gentlemen: as the eldest son of my late father, and the unworthy head of this household, I bid you welcome. By your leave, Minister Anderson: by your leave, Lawyer Hawkins. The head of the table for the head of the family. (He places the chair at the table between the {{minister}} and the attorney; sits down between them; and addresses the assembly with a presidential air.) We meet on a melancholy occasion: <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>dead!</b> <b>an</b> uncle actually hanged, and probably damned. (He shakes his head deploringly. The relatives freeze with horror.) That's right: pull your longest faces (his voice suddenly sweetens gravely as his glance lights on Essie) provided only there is hope {{in the eyes of the}} child. (Briskly.) Now then, Lawyer Hawkins: business, business. Get on with the will, man.|$|R

40|$|This essay, {{part of a}} {{book about}} Shakespeare's {{treatment}} of fathers and father figures, discusses the middle comedies, concentrating on The Merchant of Venice. I argue that mourning for <b>a</b> lost <b>father</b> is the common psychological background of these plays, in which the characteristic fate of fathers has three stages: strength, collapse, and partial recovery. In Twelfth Night, unfinished mourning is a central feature of the plot but is transferred from fathers to brothers; in As You Like It and Much Ado About Nothing, the process has been completed; in The Merchant, the work of mourning dominates the action. Portia lives in the shadow of <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>father</b> and demonstrates the "decomposition of ambivalence" which, according to psychoanalytic theory, is caused by such a loss: she revives <b>a</b> good <b>father,</b> Antonio, and destroys an evil one, Shylock. An additional part of her response is identification; like other heroines in the comedies, Portia embodies her lost father's essential qualities. These strategies do not completely resolve the play's conflicts about attachment, but they anticipate the greater tranquility of the romances...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies of}} {{bereavement}} {{deal with the}} mourning process. Through this process, the relationship is built between the bereaved and the dead. This paper focuses on what the relationship is. How can we be with the dead when we are left alive and alone? I researched what a relationship with <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>father</b> or mother is by the "Nine-In-One Drawing Method" and interviews with two subjects as cooperators. In these interviews, I asked about their mourning processes and {{found them to be}} very individual. I asked them to draw about their <b>dead</b> <b>father</b> or mother. While they were drawing, their relationship with the deceased parent appeared. They could feel warmth, and they felt cared for in the relationship. I believe that such experiences play important roles in the mourning process, enabling them to have an individual relationship with the dead. The relationship was not realistic. But it was true in the intermediate area. Therefore, I am convinced that a relationship with the dead can take form in the intermediate area, and it should be grasped and understood in relation to the mourning process...|$|R
