The rugged natural scenery, sense of isolation, and natural attractions such as Cathedral Caves makes the Catlins a popular {{destination}} for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack's Bay and Pounawea. Ecotourism is becoming increasingly important to the area's economy, {{with many of the}} visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.|$|E

25|$|Herring {{are found}} in the North Sea and the North Atlantic at depths to 200 meters. Important herring {{fisheries}} have existed in these areas for centuries. Herring of different sizes and growth rates belong to different populations, each of which have their own migration routes. When spawning, a female produces from 20,000 to 50,000 eggs. After spawning, the herrings are depleted in fat, and migrate back to feeding grounds rich in plankton. Around Iceland, three separate populations of herring were traditionally fished. These stocks collapsed in the late 1960s, although two have since recovered. After the collapse, Iceland turned to capelin, which <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> about half of Iceland's total catch.|$|E
25|$|Every year, {{thousands}} {{of cases of}} the plague are still reported to the World Health Organization, although, with proper treatment, the prognosis for victims is now much better. A five- to six-fold increase in cases occurred in Asia {{during the time of}} the Vietnam War, possibly due to the disruption of ecosystems and closer proximity between people and animals. The Plague is now commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas which <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> over 95% of reported cases. The plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals. In the United States, mammals such as the black-tailed prairie dog and the endangered black-footed ferret are under threat.|$|E

25|$|Kentucky has {{a broadly}} based {{classified}} property tax system. All classes of property, unless exempted by the Constitution, are taxed by the state, although at widely varying rates. Many of these classes are exempted from taxation by local government. Of the classes that {{are subject to}} local taxation, three have special rates set by the General Assembly, one by the Kentucky Supreme Court and the remaining classes {{are subject to the}} full local rate, which includes the tax rate set by the local taxing bodies plus all voted levies. Real property is assessed on 100% of the fair market value and property taxes are due by December 31. Once the primary source of state and local government revenue, property taxes <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> only about 6% of the Kentucky's annual General Fund revenues.|$|E
25|$|During {{the rest}} of the 20th century, commercialization {{patterns}} for food and other staples were strongly influenced by the United States, with the introduction of concepts such as supermarkets and convenience stores. The current retail situation in Mexican cities varies widely. On one end, there are a myriad of small corner stores (called mesceláneas, expendios de abarrotes or tienditas) and on the other are major supermarket and department chains such as Comercial Mexicana, Wal Mart, Liverpool and others. These types of markets <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> eighty percent of food sales in Mexico City. The appearance of supermarkets has diminished the sales in many markets. For example, sales at the market in Colonia Industrial were cut by half when a supermarket opened nearby in 2009. Although mercados usually have better prices and fresher produce, the rundown conditions of many is one factor why many consumers prefer supermarkets.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output continued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other nation. Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas alone <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output. In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered {{at the hands of a}} system that has rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than 10 percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization. Some heavy industries and products deemed to be of national strategic importance remain state-owned, but an increasing proportion of lighter and consumer-oriented manufacturing firms are privately held or are private-state joint ventures.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that romantic {{involvement}} in adolescence decreases aggression in males and females, but decreases {{at a higher rate}} in females. Females will seem more desirable to their mate if they fit in with society and females that are aggressive do not usually fit well in society, they can often be viewed as antisocial. Female aggression is not considered the norm in society and going against the norm can sometimes prevent one from getting a mate. However, studies have shown that an increasing number of women are getting arrested for domestic violence charges. In many states, women <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> a quarter to a third of all domestic violence arrests, up from less than 10 percent a decade ago. The new statistics reflect a reality documented in research: women are perpetrators as well as victims of family violence. However, another equally possible explanation is a case of improved diagnostics: it has become more acceptable for men to report female domestic violence to the authorities {{while at the same time}} actual female domestic violence has not increased at all. This can be the case when men have become less ashamed of reporting female violence against them, therefore an increasing number of women are arrested, although the actual number of violent women remains the same.|$|E
25|$|Junior {{teams were}} {{originally}} {{banned from the}} race on safety grounds, but the pressure {{to allow them to}} compete resulted in the introduction of stages in 1953, originally two, but soon changed to three, with compulsory overnight stops at Newbury, Marlow and Ham, just below Teddington lock. There were two crews in the junior category in 1953, but this had risen to over 50 by 1961, and in 1970 there were 100 junior crews. Numbers after that gradually declined, but a schools trophy was set up in 1975, and school teams <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> most of the junior entries. Women were barred from the race at first, and it was not until 1971 that Sheila Burnett from Cambridge Canoe Club finished the race with Colin Dickens, only to be disqualified when it was discovered that she was a woman. In 1973, Anne-Marie Evans entered the race under a false name, in partnership with Jonathan Hutt, and was awarded a certificate for finishing, but the official policy was still that women should not enter the race. By the late 1970s attitudes had changed, and the first all-female crew finished the race in 31 hours 6 minutes in 1976. Trophies for ladies and mixed doubles classes were introduced in 1980. In 1995, Danielle Sellwood and Sandra Troop set the women’s record at 18 hours 47 minutes, and in 1997 Danielle Sellwood was placed third overall, becoming the first woman to hold the civilian trophy. A class for junior ladies was introduced in 1976, and a junior mixed doubles class in 1981.|$|E

500|$|The {{widespread}} {{availability of}} nutritional guidelines {{has done little}} to address the problems of overeating and poor dietary choice. From 1971 to 2000, obesity rates in the United States increased from 14.5% to 30.9%. During the same period, an increase occurred in the average amount of food energy consumed. For women, the average increase was [...] per day ( [...] in 1971 and [...] in 2004), while for men the average increase was [...] per day ( [...] in 1971 and [...] in 2004). Most of this extra food energy came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than fat consumption. [...] The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates are sweetened beverages, which <b>now</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> almost 25 percent of daily food energy in young adults in America, and potato chips. [...] Consumption of sweetened drinks such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, iced tea, and energy and vitamin water drinks is believed to be contributing to the rising rates of obesity and to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency is related to diseases associated with obesity.|$|E
