5000|$|Alan H Goldstein has {{proposed}} that, because nanobiotechnology {{is in the}} process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological. Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference [...] "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat. Goldsteins basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of intelligence such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena. Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced. Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. <b>neuroelectronic</b> splices. A-Life researchers mainly take a systems-level approach. The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard A-Life paradigms. As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.|$|E

The adopted methodology consists, first, in recording the spontaneous activity at the highest spatial resolution (inter-electrode separation of 21 µm) from the whole array of 4096 microelectrodes. Then, the full resolution dataset is spatially down sampled in order to evaluate the effects on raster plot representation, array-wide spike rate (AWSR), mean firing rate (MFR) and mean bursting rate (MBR). Furthermore, the effects of the array-to-network relative position are evaluated by shifting a subset of equally spaced electrodes on the entire recorded area. Results highlight that MFR and MBR are particularly influenced by the spatial resolution provided by the <b>neuroelectronic</b> interface. On high-resolution large MEAs, such analysis better represent the time-based parameterization of the network dynamics. Finally, this work suggest interesting capabilities of high-resolution MEAs for spatial-based analysis in dense and low-dense neuronal preparation for investigating signalling at both local and global neuronal circuitries...|$|E
40|$|Applications of {{non-invasive}} <b>neuroelectronic</b> interfacing in {{the fields}} of whole-cell biosensing, bio-logical computation and neural prosthetic devices depend critically on an efficient decoding and processing of information retrieved from a neuron–electrode junction. This necessitates develop-ment of mathematical models of the neuron–electrode interface that realistically represent the extra-cellular signals recorded at the <b>neuroelectronic</b> junction without being computationally expensive. Extracellular signals recorded using planar microelectrode or field effect transistor arrays have, until now, primarily been represented using linear equivalent circuit models that fail to reproduce the correct amplitude and shape of the signals recorded at the neuron–microelectrode interface. In this paper, to explore viable alternatives for a computationally inexpensive and efficient modeling of the neuron–electrode junction, input–output data from the neuron–electrode junction is modeled using a parametric Wiener model and a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive network with eXogenous input trained using a dynamic Neural Network model (NARX-NN model). Results corresponding to a validation dataset from these models are then employed to compare and contrast the computational complex-ity and efficiency of the aforementioned modeling techniques with the Lee-Schetzen technique o...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of neural tissue by surgically implanted <b>neuroelectronic</b> devices to restore lost neural function {{has become an}} integral part of today's medicine. Ethical issues and the current public debate about these implants precipitate around two major questions: 1. Does the benefit of the prosthetic implant justify the risk of adverse effects to the individual and to society? 2. Is it desirable to enhance human capabilities by <b>neuroelectronic</b> devices? The objective of this paper is to provide both scientific and moral arguments in this ongoing debate. As with most public discussions, arguments about humanneuroelectronic interfaces are clouded by fears, hopes, market interests and academic endeavors, as well as by philosophical and religious differences of opinion. The case of the cochlear implant helps to define both questions. There is no doubt that cochlear implants benefit thousands of people without major risk. Still, even the cochlear implant is not universally accepted as a therapeutic intervention by the profoundly deaf. Some see it as an intrusion into their way of life, claiming that th...|$|E

Hybrid systems incorporating magnetoresistive sensors are applied to <b>neuroelectronic</b> studies and biomedical imaging, namely magnetoencephalography and magnetocardiography. Lab-on-a-chip MR-based platforms are under development to perform biological studies at the single molecule level. This review introduces and discusses the potential and main characteristics of those MR-based biomedical devices, comparing to the existing technologies, while giving particular examples of targeted applications. Applications to the detection of DNA hybridization events (DNA-chips) [3] and antibody-antigen recognition at immunoassays (immuno-chips) [4] are discussed. Particular examples for cell free DNA and genomic sequences detection, for pathogen (Salmonella enteritidis, see Fig. 1) detection and for flow cytometry (separation and counting) of CD 34 + magnetically labeled cells coming from bone marrow or cord blood samples are given. Moreover, lateral immuno-assay configurations where analytes are labeled with magnetic nanoparticles are discussed. For biomedical imaging applications, field sensitivity is being pushed towards 1 pT/sqrt(Hz) and below in hybrid devices incorporating flux guides with the magnetoresistive element allowing the direct detection of bio-magnetic fields (from brain and heart).

40|$|Spintronic {{devices have}} been {{proposed}} {{over the past decade}} for various biomedical applications. These include static or dynamic biomolecular recognition platforms (DNA-cDNA, antibody-antigen, phage-bacteria,), cytometer and cell separation devices and lateral bio assay platforms, microelectrode based devices for <b>neuroelectronic</b> applications, and hybrid sensor arrays for imaging applications [1]. The biomolecular recognition platforms include a magnetoresistive sensor array, a set of biomolecular probes (surface immobilized or in solution), biological targets labeled with particular magnetic micro beads or magnetic nanoparticles, and arraying architectures and microfluidics used to increase sensitivity and favour probe-target interaction. The platforms also incorporate the proper signal conditioning and processing electronics. Results will be shown for cell free DNA detection as a cancer marker indicator, and for cell detection using phage markers. For <b>neuroelectronic</b> applications, magnetoresistive sensors were fabricated onto Si microelectrode arrays. Experiments probe either extra cellular currents measured in mouse hypocampus slices, or spinal medulla signals probed directly with implanted magnetoresistive electrodes. For deep brain simulation and detection, sensors and electrodes are being fabricated into flexible polyimide probes. Separation between straight electrical contributions and magnetic signals is discussed. For imaging applications (magneto cardiography) efforts continue to reach pT level detectivity at 1 Hz, using hybrid MEMS/magnetoresistive sensor devices.

One of the major challenges for the development of reliable neuro-electronic systems is to perform extracellular recordings of action potentials with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The poor quality of these recordings is caused by the culture medium, which is present in the cleft between the cell membrane and the sensor surface (P. Fromherz, <b>Neuroelectronic</b> interfacing: semiconductor chips with ion channels, nerve cells and brain, in Nanoelectronics and Information Technology, R. Waser, ed., Wiley-VCH, Berlin, 2003, pp. 781 - 810; G. Zeck and P. Fromherz, Noninvasive <b>neuroelectronic</b> interfacing with synaptically connected snail neurons immobilised on a semiconductor chip, PNAS 98 (2001), pp. 10457 - 10462). In this article, we describe a method allowing a reduction of the distance between the membrane and the surface by combining surface chemistry and topography. We have developed a specialised surface chemistry, based on small laminin-derived peptides, which applied onto the topographical structures, triggers their engulfment by the cell membrane in a phagocytosis-like event. In the phagocytotic pit, the distance between the cell membrane and the sensor surface is believed to be minimal. We describe the surface chemistry used for the controlled immobilisation of the small peptides {{on the surface of the}} needle-like structures that are manufactured on the surface of electronic devices.

The cells formed a network with electrical synapses after outgrowth in brain conditioned medium. Pairs of neurons were electronically interfaced for noninvasive stimulation and recording. Voltage pulses were applied to a capacitive stimulator on the chip to excite the attached neuron. Signals were transmitted in the neuronal net and elicited an action potential in a second neuron. The postsynaptic excitation modulated the current of a transistor on the chip.

The expected outcome of this project is to help the development of a generic 0. 5 m MOS technology to form <b>neuroelectronic</b> hybrids.

40|$|In this article, {{we discuss}} the {{numerical}} approximation of transport phenomena occurring at material interfaces between physical subdomains with heterogenous properties. The model in each subdomain consists of a partial differential equation with diffusive, convective and reactive terms, the coupling between each subdomain being realized through an interface transmission condition of Robin type. The numerical approximation {{of the problem in}} the two-dimensional case is carried out through a dual mixed-hybridized finite element method with numerical quadrature of the mass flux matrix. The resulting method is a conservative finite volume scheme over triangular grids, for which a discrete maximum principle is proved under the assumption that the mesh is of Delaunay type in the interior of the domain and of weakly acute type along the domain external boundary and internal interface.

Standard electrophysiological methods {{are not able to}} characterize ion channels under these conditions. Here we consider the area of cell adhesion on a solid substrate as a model system. We used HEK 293 cells cultured on fibronectin and studied the activation of NaV 1. 4 sodium channels in the adherent membrane with field-effect transistors in a silicon substrate. Under voltage clamp, we compared the transistor response with the whole-cell current. We observed that the extracellular voltage in the cell-chip contact was proportional to the total membrane current. The relation was calibrated by alternating-current stimulation. We found that Na+ channels are present in the area of cell adhesion on fibronectin with a functionality and a density that is indistinguishable from the free membrane.

40|$|Optimization of methodologies toward {{engineering}} {{the life}} sciences and healthcare remains a grand challenge. In the field of neurotechnology tremendous {{progress has been made}} in fundamental knowledge of the nervous system and translation to build technology to diagnose and treat some neurological diseases. However, two major limitations remain: our understanding of normal and diseased nervous system function and technological approaches to measuring and manipulating neuronal circuits. Neural prosthetic devices are artificial extensions of body parts which allow a disabled individual to restore the body functions. Electrical interface using a <b>neuroelectronic</b> device is the key to restore the disabled body functions. Also, in vivo monitoring of the electrical signals from multiple cells as well as from multiple locations from a single cell during nerve excitation and cell-to-cell communication are important for design and development of novel materials and methods for laboratory analysis. In vitro biological applications such as drug screening and cell separation also require cell-based biosensors. The electrophysiological activity of certain cells such as neurons and cardiac cells are monitored using planar microelectrode arrays or field-effect transistors integrated with microfluidic devices. Of particular interest is the development of experimental models used to study neurodegenerative diseases that preserve the anatomical structures but greatly limit the experimentation at the cellular level, to dissociated cell culture systems that allow detailed manipulation of cell phenotype but lack the highly ordered and instructive brain environment. Our efforts in this field are devoted to research and development of durable electronic devices for the efficient interfacing with neuronal cells. These <b>Neuroelectronic</b> hybrid systems will be important for basic neurobiological research, for high throughput pharmacological screenings, and future use in linking the brain and computers. Our research encompasses the following topics: Sensitive electronic devices that can be fabricated using CMOS technology can provide direct, real–time monitoring of biological processes [1]. In addition, local electric fields generated by these devices can influence biological processes and interactions. We develop and investigate novel chip-based interfaces for communication with cells and cellular networks. The envisaged interfaces will rely on nanofabrication technology and biomimetics that will add a new dimension to the development of neural biohybrid systems. This includes the development of 3 D-electrode structure to improve the <b>neuroelectronic</b> [2]. Electrode design for successful interfacing requires a narrow seal and can be based on 3 D geometry, which gets integrated into the cell like “stealth” probes [3]. On the other side we aim for building an artificial synapse by creating synthetic postsynaptic cell surfaces by self-assembling lipid bilayers onto inorganic materials [4]. This configuration preserves key properties of the cell membrane, such as lateral fluidity and incorporation of fully functional transmembrane proteins. The combination of methods of micro-/nanotechnology with neuroscience will also help to advance our basic understanding of the nervous system and create novel applications based on neuroengineering principles. Here we construct and analyze neural networks to unravel principals of information processing. Our approach is to reduce the network complexity and control the network architecture and finally the signal propagation in networks. This includes micro- and nanopatterning techniques to construct geometrically defined networks and electrophysiological measurements to analyze them [5, 6]. One mayor goal is to explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of neuronal polarity and implement key signals into strategies for directing axo- and synaptogenesis [7].

40|$|A {{revolution}} in cell culturing {{has been seen}} {{in the last two decades}} in which 3 D culturing became the state-of the-art, with the goal to mimic the in-vivo situation more closely and allow for a physiologically more relevant study compared to the environment in a petri dish. This revolution, however, has not been fully incorporated in the field of in-vitro neuroscience and neither in commercial activities, yet. In this work an attempt has been made to make such a 3 D environment available for a conventional planar microelectrode array (MEA) for in-vitro electrophysiology. A reliable platform is realized by combining microfabrication and microfluidics towards a 3 D brain-on-chip allowing for drug discovery and the study on diseases. A novel hybrid microbioreactor has been developed as a tool for hydrogel 3 D cell culturing on a conventional MEA towards a more physiologically relevant model for the study on brain tissue. The Hydrogel/ poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) bioreactor enables a low shear stress 3 D micro-sized culture environment on top of a MEA surface. Furthermore the hybrid bioreactor is explored to realize an on-chip biochemical readout from a 3 D culture by a commercial microchip capillary electrophoresis (CE) system with contactless conductivity detection (C 4 D). An advanced MEA device, termed a microsieve electrode array (μSEA), has been developed by integration of electrode material to a realized highly uniform silicon microfabricated sieving structure. This μSEA allows for the positioning of neurons in 3 D pores containing sensing electrodes for extracellular recordings of 3 D cultured neurons. Performed characterization of the μSEA includes the tuning of the shape and size of the sensing electrodes, electrical properties and initial studies on neuronal cells. In conclusion, by combining microfabrication and microfluidics a platform has been realized towards a 3 D brain-on-chip. The conventional microelectrode array principle is engaged to realize a 3 D cell environment for the cells positioned at the sensing electrodes (establishing the <b>neuroelectronic</b> interface) and a microbioreactor add-on is realized allows for 3 D culturing of the cells in between the electrodes (neuronal network).

MRI has the advantage of providing structural anatomical details with high sensitivity, though histological specificity is limited. Although combining MRI with other imaging modalities, such as positron-emission tomography (PET), has proven to increment specificity, exact correlation between PET threshold uptake ratios (URs) and histological diagnosis and grading has not yet been described. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} correlate exactly the histopathological criteria of the biopsy site to its PET uptake value with high spatial resolution (mm 3), and to analyze the diagnostic value of PET using the amino acid O-(2 -[18 F]fluoroethyl) -L-tyrosine (18 F-FET) PET in patients with newly diagnosed brain lesions in comparison to histological findings obtained from stereotactic serial biopsy. Patients and methods: A total of 23 adult patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors on MRI were enrolled in this study. Subsequently to diagnoses, all patients underwent a 18 F-FET PET-guided stereotactic biopsy, using an original newly developed software module, which is presented here. Conventional MRI, stereotactic computed tomography series, and 18 F-FET PET images were semiautomatically fused, and hot-spot detection was performed for target planning. UR was determined using the uptake value from the biopsy sites in relation to the contralateral frontal white matter. UR values ≥ 1. 6 were considered positive for glioma. High-grade glioma (HGG) was suspected with URs ≥ 3. 0, while low-grade glioma (LGG) was suspected with URs between 1. 6 and 3. 0. Stereotactic serial biopsies along the trajectory at multiple sites were performed in millimeter steps, and the FET URs for each site were correlated exactly with a panel of 27 different histopathological markers. Comparisons between FET URs along the biopsy trajectories and the histological diagnoses were made with Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. Analysis of variance was performed to test for significant differences in maximum UR between different tumor grades. Results: A total of 363 biopsy specimens were taken from 23 patients by stereotactic serial biopsies. Histological examination revealed eight patients (35 %) with an LGG: one with a World Health Organization (WHO) -I lesion and seven with a WHO-II lesion. Thirteen (57 %) patients revealed an HGG (two with a WHO-III and three with a WHO-IV tumor), and two patients (9 %) showed a process that was neither HGG nor LGG (group X or no-grade group). The correlation matrix between histological findings and the UR revealed five strong correlations. Low cell density in tissue samples was found to have a significant negative correlation with the measured cortical uptake rate (r=- 0. 43, P= 0. 02), as well as moderate cell density (r=- 0. 48, P= 0. 02). Pathological patterns of proliferation (r= 0. 37, P= 0. 04), GFAP (r= 0. 37, P= 0. 04), and Olig 2 (r= 0. 36, P= 0. 05) showed a significant positive correlation with cortical URs. Analysis of variance tests showed a significant difference between the LGG and the HGG groups (F= 8. 27, P< 0. 002), but no significant differences when differentiating between the X group and the HGG (P= 0. 2) /LGG (P= 0. 8) groups, nor between the no-grade group and the WHO-I group. Conclusion: 18 F-FET PET is a valuable tool, as it allows the differentiation of HGGs from LGGs. Its use is not limited to preoperative evaluation; it may also refine biopsy targeting and improve tumor delimitation for radiotherapy. Histology is still necessary, and remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of brain lesions.
