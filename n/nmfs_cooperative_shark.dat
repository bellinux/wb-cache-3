40|$|The National Marine Fisheries Service (<b>NMFS)</b> <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Shark</b> Tagging Program (CSTP) {{is part of}} {{continuing}} research directed {{to the study of}} the biology of large Atlantic sharks. The CSTP was initiated in 1962 at the Sandy Hook Laboratory in New Jersey under the Department of Interior's U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). During the late 1950 's and early 1960 's, sharks were considered a liability to the economy of resort communities, of little or no commercial value, and a detriment to fishermen in areas where sharks might damage expensive fishing gear or reduce catches of more commercially valuable species...|$|E

The extent of the tagging effort, areas of release and recapture, sources of tags and recaptures, capture methods, and movements of tagged sharks are reported. Summary information includes number {{of males and females}} tagged and recaptured, overall recapture rate, and maximum distance traveled and time at liberty. In order to examine regional trends in size and maturation categories, the study area is divided into geographical areas. General migration patterns for life history stages for the two shark species are summarized and discussed. 2 LCS 05 / 06 -DW- 2...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} {{to conduct a}} stock assessment for the blue shark (Prionace glauca) in the North Atlantic have been handicapped {{by the lack of}} reliable catch and effort data. The use of tag-recapture data is among ICCAT’s recommendations for future assessment work. This paper proposes a statistical framework for estimating blue shark movement and fishing mortality rates from the tag-recapture data of the National Marine Fisheries Service <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Shark</b> Tagging Program (NMFS-CSTP). The model considers four geographical regions. Blue sharks can stay in the region in which they were tagged and they can move among regions. The parameters of the model are the intra- and inter-region movement probabilities and the catchability coefficients that relate the probabilities of capture and the ICCAT longline fishing effort data. Bayesian estimation methods are used to estimate and quantify the uncertainty associated with the values for these parameters. The dataset of the NMFS-CSTP shows potential for use in a blue shark stock assessment and should be investigated further. Areas of interest for future research are identified. RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} multiple coordi-nating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) that can localize and track a shark tagged with an acoustic transmitter. Each AUV {{is equipped with a}} stereo-hydrophone system that provides measurements of the relative bearing to the transmitter, as well as an acoustic modem that allows for inter-AUV communication and hence <b>cooperative</b> <b>shark</b> state estimation and decentralized tracking control. Online state estimation of the shark’s state is performed using a Particle Filter in which measurements are shared between AUVs. The decentralized control system enables the AUVs to circumnavigate a dynamic target, (i. e. the estimated shark location). Each AUV circles the target by tracking circles of different radii and at different phase angles with respect to the target so as to obtain simultaneous sensor vantage points and minimize chance of AUV collision. A series of experiments using two AUVs were conducted in Big Fisherman’s Cove in Santa Catalina Island, CA and demonstrated the ability to track a tagged leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata). The performance of the tracking was compared to standard manual tracking performed using an directional hydrophone operated by a researcher in a boat. In an additional experiment, the AUVs tracked an acoustic tag attached to the tracking boat to quantify the error of the state estimation of the system. I...|$|R
40|$|Proportional {{survival}} (S) is {{a crucial}} life-history parameter in population dynamics, natural selection, and management of harvested stocks; variations in survival due to age, sex, or geographic region may have large effects {{on the success of}} managing fish stocks. The blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, is the most abundantly harvested shark species in American fisheries. Direct estimates of survival are preferred, but all current survival estimates for this species are either focused on young-of-the-year (YOY) or based on indirect methods. The objectives of this study were to determine whether age, sex, or geographic grouping affects survival and to generate direct survival estimates based on tag-recovery data. As a byproduct of this analysis, distribution maps and descriptive data summarizing captures were included. The U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service has been collecting tag-recovery data since 1962 through the <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Shark</b> Tagging Program (CSTP). Models were generated from this database with program MARK, ranked in order of parsimony according to Akaike 2 ̆ 7 s Information Criterion, and tested for significance of effects with likelihood ratio tests. No movement has been observed to date between the west Gulf of Mexico, east Gulf of Mexico, and U. S. Atlantic, but 2 sharks tagged in the U. S. Virgin Islands were recaptured off Florida and Georgia (displacement= 1049 and 1183 n. mi., respectively). Survival did not differ significantly for males vs. females (P= 0. 761), east vs. west Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 654), or U. S. Atlantic vs. Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 243). However, significant differences were found for survival of YOY (0. 580) and post-YOY (0. 725) within the Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 0003). These results demonstrate that survival can be modeled effectively for species in the CSTP with relatively small sample sizes. Future analyses may benefit from a length-based model, due to the difficulty in assigning life stages based on size. ...|$|R
