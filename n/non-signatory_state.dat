40|$|Discussion of Middle Eastern refugee law {{and policy}} has focused largely on Palestinians, with {{relatively}} little analysis of non-Palestinian refugees and the legal framework that applies to them in Middle Eastern countries. This article seeks to address this gap through a wide-ranging examination of the treatment of Iraqi refugees in Jordan (a <b>non-signatory</b> <b>state</b> to the Refugee Convention), following the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. In so doing, it also examines certain issues with wider global implications, such as the nature of refugee protection, the importance of identity, {{and the need for}} improved ‘burden sharing’. The article provides a brief outline of the background to refugees in Jordan, together with a discussion of the legal regime applicable to asylum seekers and refugees. It assesses the importance of legal status and labelling to the Iraqi in Jordan, not only for access to rights and provision of needs, but also for identity. The tension between the UNHCR’s concepts of ‘protection’ and ‘protection space’ and the Jordanian Government’s own approach to sanctuary are explored, with reference to five key areas: employment, health, education, resettlement and return. The article concludes by reflecting {{on the extent to which}} the Jordanian case study can assist improved management of mass flight in the future...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} the motivation behind Pakistan’s nuclear behaviour and its ramifications for the global non-proliferation system. Pakistan is an extremely important case because of its status as a <b>non-signatory</b> <b>state</b> to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a country from which proliferation has occurred (to Iran, North Korea and Libya). The central interest in this study is the extent to which Pakistan’s security interests and its nuclear behaviour were factored into the global non-proliferation regime and why that regime failed to constrain Pakistan’s nuclear behaviour so that it first developed nuclear weapons and then proliferated them to states which are a matter of concern to the international community. The thesis seeks to explain Pakistan’s nuclear behaviour through the prism of regime theory and a three-models approach (neo-realism, neo-liberalism and constructivism). The thesis also provides an in-depth analytical account of whether or how far international institutions and regimes can succeed in influencing the behaviour of states through cooperation, a theme suggested by regime theory. The three schools of thought offer useful arguments to help explain why it was that Pakistan did not choose to join the non-proliferation regime and the constraints which international institutions face with regard to non-signatory states. Drawing lessons from the case of Pakistan, the thesis suggests ways in which global non-proliferation institutions might be strengthened in the future, which would also help in linking Pakistan more firmly to the non-proliferation regime. These changes would also help to align other non-NPT states, such as India and Israel, with the non-proliferation regime and offer a firmer challenge to other states to change their conduct – states such as North Korea and Iran, which remain a cause of concern to the international community.

40|$|The {{concept of}} nuclear {{non-proliferation}} emerged after the Second World war {{when the world}} saw the disaster caused by the atomic bomb. A number of plans were discussed and an international consensus was reached on a treaty for controlling {{the spread of nuclear}} weapons in the world. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) was not initially signed by many states but gradually received universally acceptability. States entered into the treaty as either nuclear weapon or non-nuclear weapon <b>states.</b> Three <b>non-signatory</b> <b>states</b> were India, Pakistan and Israel Located in Asia. The thrust of US nuclear non-proliferation policy was in South Asia where two major <b>non-signatory</b> <b>states</b> were situated bordering each other. India reached the level of a nuclear power in 1947 while Pakistan started its program about the same time. The US initially pressurized Pakistan to stop its nuclear program but the situation changed after the Soviet military intervention of Afghanistan in 1979. Until the late eighties, the US exempted Pakistan from all restrictions and supplied significant military aid. After 1990, it reverted back to its strict policy towards Pakistan. During the same period, it continued to neglect Indian nuclear program in order to bring India closer to the US and away from the Soviet Union. This dissertation is an attempt to highlight important events of theUS nuclear non-proliferation policy towards India and Pakistan in the period 1947 - 1990. The purpose of this research is to compare the US policy towards these two countries and to demonstrate its uneven and contradictory approach as far as the issue of nuclear non-proliferation is concerned...|$|R

[...] Following the treaty's entry into force, it was closed for signature and the only method for <b>non-signatory</b> <b>states</b> to become a party was through accession. As of April 2016, 192 states, representing over 98 percent of the world's population, are party to the CWC. Of the four United Nations member states that are not parties to the treaty, Israel has signed but not ratified the treaty, while Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan have neither signed nor acceded to the Convention. Neither has the State of Palestine, which since becoming a UN observer state in 2012 is eligible to accede to the Convention. [...] Taiwan, though not a Member State, has stated that it complies with the treaty.|$|R
50|$|In December 2016, British {{government}} research revealed that British-made cluster bombs {{had been used}} by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. This was confirmed by the Saudi Arabian Government in the same month. Cluster munitions (another term for cluster bombs) can lie unexploded {{for long periods of time}} and cause severe injury to civilians even years after the initial attack. It is illegal to use, produce, transfer or stockpile cluster bombs, since the coming into force of the UN Convention on Cluster Munition on 1 August 2010. This treaty is international law and although Saudi Arabia has neither signed nor ratified it, the UK ratified this treaty in 2010, meaning it is not only illegal for the UK to produce and transfer cluster bombs according to British as well as international law, but the country also has a duty to promote the aims and ratification of the treaty to <b>non-signatory</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R

Using EPO data of over 3, 500, 000 citations in years 1997 - 2007, we find national variation in the probability of an applicant originating a citation rather than the examiner. Symmetrically to the US case, EPO examiners add extra citations to <b>non-signatory</b> member <b>states.</b> Moreover, if examiners are likely {{to come from the}} same country of the applicants, applicant-citation shares increase, pointing to the existence of national bias in EPO patent examiners. These results hold after controlling for sub-national characteristics of the patenting process. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
30|$|The European and the South and Southeast Asian Region {{are very}} {{different}} regarding {{their commitment to the}} refugee convention. While Europe is the only continent, where all countries are signatories of the Convention and the Protocol of 1967, the latter is the region with the most <b>non-signatories.</b> 43 <b>states</b> are not signatories or have not ratified the treaty, although they host large refugee contingents, notably in ASEAN. Only the Philippines (since 1981) and Cambodia (since 1992) of ASEAN are signatories. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and even Singapore are all non-Parties. South Korea and Japan are both members. Hence, the initial situations in an interregional comparison look very different. Being a non-Party does not exempt those states from customary law. The central principle of non-refoulement belongs to customary law. It states that refugees cannot be sent back to countries where they fled from when the conditions they fled have not changed and are covered by the Convention. Yet, many other important matters are not customary law or are at least disputed. Contracting partners give refugees the right to receive travel documents, free access to courts, administrative assistance, identity papers, the right to transfer their assets, rights related to marriage, and so forth. These examples show the centrality of the convention for the refugees.|$|R
50|$|The {{key reason}} for {{countries}} that signed the Nuclear Free World Policy:1. We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden {{have considered the}} continued threat to humanity represented by {{the perspective of the}} indefinite possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear-weapon states as well as by those three nuclear-weapons-capable states that have not acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the attendant possibility of use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. The seriousness of this predicament has been further underscored by the recent nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan.These countries are weary of nuclear weapons’ deployment above everything else. Although 8 states are exempted from ban on nuclear weapons, 5 nations retain a de jure status of a “nuclear weapon state.” These states are the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the People’s Republic of China, France and Russia—all of whom had already tested nuclear weapons before the NPT was signed. NWS’s right to possess a nuclear arsenal is countered by Article VI of the treaty, which says that they have a legal obligation to eventually disarm. They also criticized NWS countries for failing to meet their obligation to disarm, in addition to criticizing the 3 <b>states</b> <b>non-signatory</b> nuclear weapons-capable <b>states</b> (which are considered de facto nuclear weapons states). This was stated in point 4 of the Joint Declaration of 1998:4. We can no longer remain complacent at the reluctance of the nuclear-weapon states and the three nuclear-weapons-capable states to take that fundamental and requisite step, namely a clear commitment to the speedy, final and total elimination of their nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons capability and we urge them to take that step now.The NAC re-iterated the criticism from its Joint Declaration of de jure nuclear-weapon states’ repeated obduracy and attempts to avoid fulfilling their Treaty obligations to eventually disarm in an address given by Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews {{on the occasion of the}} Joint Ministerial Statement.|$|R
