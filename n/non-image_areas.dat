50|$|The theory behind {{waterless}} printing is {{that the}} silicone material which makes up the <b>non-image</b> <b>area</b> of the plate has a very low surface energy.

40|$|Driography is a planographic {{printing}} process. A driographic printing plate differs from a conventional offset lithographic plate in that water {{is not required}} to keep the <b>non-image</b> <b>area</b> clean of ink during printing. Water, or fountain solution, is not required during printing because a silicone rubber coating which repels ink is used for the <b>non-image</b> <b>area</b> of a driographic plate. The first driographic plate was introduced in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s by the 3 M Company. The plate was a positive working printing plate and has since been discontinued. Driography has since been researched by a number of companies but only one is presently marketing a driographic plate. The Toray Company, a Japanese based firm, is producing a negative working driographic printing plate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research Toray 2 ̆ 7 s negative working driographic printing plate. It is hypothesized that as ink tack decreases, toning in the <b>non-image</b> <b>area</b> will increase. In this experiment, ink tack was monitored at the point of impression using a thermocouple device. The thermocouple was used to measure ink temperature on an inking form roller. Temperature/tack curves were developed and used to convert ink temperatures to tack readings. The actual experiment was performed on a duplicator offset printing press. A second technique using ink tack-reducer to alter ink tack was performed as an alternative test to support the initial method results. During the course of the study a number of variables could have altered the test results. These variables were monitored and kept constant during testing. The variable which affected test results most dramatically was the oil content in the ink. It was concluded that the amount of oil content in an ink had more influence on the degree of toning than ink tack did as originally hypothesized...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being relatively inexpensive, glass is chemically inert. It does not oxidize, nor does it change or interact with the composition of printing inks, especially yellows and whites, which can turn green or gray in contact with metal plates. According to Claire Van Vliet of Janus Press, intaglio vitreographs also have an advantage over metal in that the glass plate wipes cleanly in <b>non-image</b> <b>areas,</b> allowing bright white to coincide with “black that is velvety as a mezzotint” in the finished print.|$|E
50|$|Gravure {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} {{made of steel}} and plated with copper, though other materials, e.g. ceramics can also be used. The desired pattern is achieved by engraving with a laser or a diamond tool, or by chemical etching. If the cylinder is chemically etched, a resist (in {{the form of a}} negative image) is transferred to the cylinder before etching. The resist protects the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of the cylinder from the etchant. After etching, the resist is stripped off. The operation is analogous to the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Following engraving, the cylinder is proofed and tested, reworked if necessary, and then chrome plated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gelatinous}} emulsion {{is applied}} to a paper backing, and is rendered sensitive to light when immersed in a 3:4% [...] solution of potassium bichromate. After drying, it is ready for use. The carbon tissue is first exposed to a film positive. In those areas where the carbon tissue has received the most light (i.e., <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> and highlights) the emulsion becomes thick and hard, and the thickness and hardness decreases with decreasing exposure to the light source, the emulsion being thinnest and softest in image areas corresponding to shadows and solids. After developing the carbon tissue, it is adhered {{to the surface of}} the copper-plated cylinder.|$|E

40|$|Gravure {{printing}} delivers intricate print {{quality and}} exhibit better feasibility for printing long run packaging jobs. PVC and PETG {{are widely used}} shrink films printed by gravure process. The variation in ink transfer from gravure cells on to the substrate results in print mottle. The variation is inevitable and requires close monitoring with tight control on process parameters to deliver good dot fidelity. The electrostatic assist in gravure improves the ink transfer efficiency but is greatly influenced by ESA parameters such as air gap (distance between charge bar and impression roller) and voltage. Moreover, {{it is imperative to}} study the combined effect of ESA and gravure process parameters such as line screen, viscosity and speed for the minimization of half-tone mottle in shrink films. A general full factorial design was performed for the above mentioned parameters to evaluate half-tone mottle. The significant levels of both the main and interactions were studied by ANOVA approach. The statistical analysis revealed the significance of all the process parameters with viscosity, line screen and voltage being the major contributors in minimization of half-tone mottle. The optimized setting showed reduction in halftone mottle by 33 % and 32 % for PVC and PET-G respectively. The developed regression model was tested that showed more than 95 % predictability. Furthermore, the uniformity of dot was measured by image to <b>non-image</b> <b>area</b> (ratio) distribution. The result showed reduction in halftone mottle with uniform dot distribution...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies and}} {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} to test the new Toray plate. The studies revealed that the new plate eliminated {{many of the problems}} that used to hinder the progress and development of the driographic plate system. The two major problems with this plate were short run lengths and toning in the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas.</b> This study investigates toning problems in negative working Toray plates. Toning is a term that refers to the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of the driographic plate that are accepting ink. Previous studies have shown that ink tack and flow do not affect toning in any way. However, printing speed, nip pressure, printing density and ink temperature were found to have some effect on toning. To investigate the effect that different percentages of oil in the ink has on toning in the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of Toray negative working plates, this study uses five ink samples, each containing a different percentage of oil, and measures with a densitometer the density of toning in the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas.</b> The hypothesis tested in this study states that the amount of toning in the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of negative Toray plates increases as the amount of oil contained in the ink increases. Upon analyzing the data collected, it was found that when using the special driographic ink no scumming occured. However, the hypothesis proved to stand true because it was found that a strong positive relationship exists between the amount of oil contained in the driographic ink and the amount of toning in the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of negative Toray plates...|$|E

40|$|Most people {{conceive}} of lithography as a planographic method of printing. In point of fact, {{only some of}} the original lithographic plates had truly planographic surfaces. Most lithographic plates used in industry today {{do not have the same}} material in the image and <b>non-image</b> <b>areas,</b> so they are called double-phase plates. Because of light undercutting and the roughness of the grain structure of the carrier, the use of conventional double-phase plates for fine image reproduction, where resolution is the main concern, has been limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the image formation mechanism of single-phase plates (i. e. plates with image and <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> on the same plane and made of the same material.) by investigating the resolution performance of Association Product plates. There are good reasons to believe that Association Product plates give better resolution than conventional double-phase plates. A comparative study of the resolving power of Association Product plates and commonly used double phase plates provides information about the quantitative difference of resolution between these two types of plates. In choosing to study the image-forming mechanism from the coating variations point-of-view, it was hoped to arrive at a demonstrable independence of plate resolving power from plate coating thickness in the single-phase plate. Results of the experiment showed that coating thickness and grain structure of the plate base does not affect the resolving power of this type of plate. The main factor which directly affects the resolving power is the exposure time...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} types of surfaces of aluminum plates; 1) brush grained, 2) chemically grained, 3) brush grained and anodized, and 4) electrochemical ly grained and anodized substrates coated with polyvinyl oxazol, an organic photoconductor were studied. The experiments {{were divided into two}} parts. The first part concerned with the photoelectric characteristics of the various surfaces, and the second part was involved with image quality relative to photoelectric properties of different substrates. The characteristics of each of the surfaces was briefly discussed. Photoelectric properties such as 1) photosensitivity, 2) spectral response, 3) surface acceptance potential, 4) dark decay, 5) light decay, 6) retentivity, and 7) residual potential of the various surfaces of the aluminum substrates were reported. Image quality of a variety of plates in terms of 1) resolution of halftones and line patterns, 2) edge sharpness, 3) solid fill-in, 4) image density, and 5) cleanliness of <b>non-image</b> <b>area</b> were analyzed. The relationship of photoelectric properties vs. image quality of these surfaces was reported. Most of the experiments were repeated several times and the data were analyzed by statistical techniques, i. e., correlation, regression analysis, analysis of variance and multiple regression. The plates were not press tested. Under experimental conditions, the electrochemically grained and anodized surface exhibited the best photoelectric properties as well as image quality. The (electro-) chemical graining of the plates provided better photoelectric properties when compared to mechanical graining. Anodizing the plate surface further improved photoelectric characteristics. Image quality was related to the photoelectric performance of surfaces of the plates...|$|R
40|$|Lithography is {{the most}} common {{printing}} process. However, very {{little is known about the}} theory of lithography. Pressroom practices have evolved more out of experience than on the basis of any theory. The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the <b>non-image</b> <b>area</b> of the offset lithographic plate. A model of this kind would provide a rationalization for the observed behavior in lithographic process. The study concentrates on the various materials and the phenomena involved. Properties of aluminum oxide surface and gum arabic that make them suitable for the process have been presented. Rheological properties of ink have been discussed to show their effect on the print quality. Most importantly the subject of surface energetics has been used to explain the interfacial behavior of the three phases involved - ink, fountain solution and plate surface. The study of the interfacial behavior helps in arriving at the final model. There are several phenomena taking place in making lithography work. Adsorption of gum arabic, wetting of the plate by fountain solution and film splitting at the nip exit are explained and the interrelationship between them derived. Surface energetic equations and Griffith 2 ̆ 7 s free energy for fracture have been used to present the final model for the system. The model as proposed in this paper gives a deeper insight into the lithographic process and helps- in understanding the reasons for the printing aberrations. There is a need to model other aspects of the process and design methods to test them so as to help in development of better equipment and standard practices for lithography...|$|R
40|$|The Association Product is a {{photosensitive}} coating for continuous-tone litho plates (It {{can also}} be used as a plate coating for halftone printing). It consists of phenolic resin and poly(ethylene oxide) and is photosensitized by a water soluble sensitizer. Continuous-tone lithography has better quality potential than the halftone process. Because the halftone process converts the continuous-tone image of the original into small dots of varying sizes, it thus inherently degrades the image quality and adds time and material costs in screening. The water soluble sensitizer converts the hydrophilic Association Product to an oleophilic state in direct proportion to exposing energy, which makes the Association Product become a single-phase plate, and thus simplifies the processing procedure. The curing property of phenolic resin makes the Association Product hardened simply by applying heat, and thus gives a long-run plate. A significant problem of the Association Product printing plate is that the contrast is too high (gamma equal to 3. 0 or higher). This study investigated possibilities of lowering the contrast of Association Product printing plates by physical ways such as varying the baking time and the thickness of the photosensitive layer, and a factorial experiment was designed. It was found that the thinner the coating, the lower the contrast; the less the baking time, the lower the contrast. In the best combination of conditions in this experiment (proofs printed by an Association Product plate which was coated by a coating solution containing 1000 ml of DMF and without baking), the gamma value was 1. 4, which was much better than it is usually. Baking hardened the Association Product printing plate, so after-process baking was used to get a long-run plate. Although after-process baking lowered the density of <b>non-image</b> <b>area,</b> the contrast was increased from 1. 4 to 2. 7...|$|R
40|$|Silicic acid is a {{water soluble}} {{colloidal}} resin {{which can be}} obtained commercially. The effect of silicic acid as a desensitizer in fountain solution was studied. The resin of this colloidal solution was compared to gum arabic solution. The study included {{the investigation of the}} physical properties of the solution at different concentrations as well as press performance. Comparisons were drawn regarding wettability, viscosity, surface tension, dot size change, minimum dampening rate to clean-up the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas,</b> resolution, resistance to scum, blinding of image areas, rate of de-inking over- run <b>non-image</b> <b>areas,</b> performance distinction between lithium silicate and sodium silicate, and changes with aging in solubility properties of silicates in fountain solutions. The experiments were carried out under carefully controlled conditions; the only variable present was one ingredient of the fountain solution. The concentration of the necessary solution was determined. The effect of concentration was discussed and reported. A considerable number of the results were statistically analyzed by the two factor analysis of variance. The effectiveness of silicic acid solution as a substitute for gum arabic solution varied. Silicic acid is comparable in regard to the ability of the solution to clean the plate with minimum number of sheets, resistance to scum, resolution, and blinding of image areas. Performance distinctions between lithium silicate and sodium silicate and solubility properties of silicates with aging were noted. Gum arabic produces smaller changes in dot size and does not blind images as quickly as silicic acid does. The advantages of silicic acid are good resistance to bacterial attack, longer shelf life, and better wetting of the plate than gum arabic when properly diluted...|$|E
40|$|Q. Can I use my X-Rite {{densitometer}} {{to verify}} dot area on printing plates {{before going to}} press? A. Yes. Your densitometer {{can be used to}} measure, correct, and control your plate imaging process. To {{get the most out of}} using your densitometer in this way, consider the following factors. The Densitometer’s Forte The first thing to keep in mind is that, color reflection densitometers are designed to read the amount of incident light absorbed by a photograph, press sheet or off-press proof. As a result, these densitometers are designed to accurately measure Black, Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow colorants on a substrate like paper. YES YOU CAN! X-Rite has successfully measured dot area from exposed and processed lithographic offset plates – conventional and digital alike. In addition, comparisons made by leading plate manufacturers have found X-Rite densitometers to be doubly useful. In addition to measuring a variety of plate materials with consistent and reliable results, these manufacturers have used the same instruments to also measure their proofs and press sheets. Offset lithographic plates, however, do not usually have cyan, magenta, yellow, or black images on a white substrate. Instead, the plate material is usually brushed aluminum with a gray color. The color of the image area varies with the plate type and manufacturer; typical colors include green, pink, brown, black and blue. Polyester-based digital plates are nearly the inverse of ink on paper—a near-white image on a flat black sustrate. These color properties introduce unique issues that arise when the plates are evaluated using densitometers. Contrast As a result of plate color properties, the contrast between the image and <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of the plate may be less than ideal. Plate contrast is typically less than half that of ink on paper. In fact, some plate materials do not exhibit enough color difference between image and <b>non-image</b> <b>areas.</b> As a result, the densitometer may not be able to calculate the exact dot area imaged...|$|E
40|$|Offset lithographic {{printing}} plates, until several years ago, used incoherent light sources for image creation in light sensitive coatings. These light sources are {{primarily in the}} ultraviolet light region. Image creation, using an incoherent light source, requires either a film negative or positive and long exposure times. Exposure time {{is dependent on the}} sensitivity of the light sensitive coating and the light intensity. In recent years both equipment and plate suppliers have been working to develop offset {{lithographic printing}} plates which use coherent laser light for image creation. To date all recorded developments have worked on light hardening image creation techniques. At present there has been no recorded effort in developing a thermal curing technique, using a coherent infrared laser beam, for image creation. The infrared laser light would be used to thermal-harden image areas only and leave <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> soft or unexposed. After exposure, <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> would be removed with a developing solvent. This thesis was conducted to determine if image creation would be possible based on thermal curing of a modified phenolic resin. Ten experiments were conducted to determine the image creation requirements of different coating formulations and various exposure conditions. Several coating formulations were used to determine the optimum coating for thermal curing using a carbon dioxide infrared laser. Exposure time, exposure speed and light intensity (laser output power) were varied to determine the effect each has on thermal -hardening of the modified phenolic resin coating. Experimental results supported the theory that images could be created in a modified phenolic resin coating. Both halftone dots and solids could be created in the coating. Solids required much less energy than halftone dots. It is believed that {{this is due to the}} poor infrared absorption of the coating. Solids received much longer exposure time than halftone dots. This longer exposure time enables the coating to absorb more infrared light. Further studies of the thermal response of the modified phenolic resin coating could make the plate a useable product in the future. It is believed that the phenolic resin coating could become a useable method of image creation with further modifications. Infrared absorption of the coating must be increased to enable images to be created at higher exposure speeds and shorter exposure times. Other exposure techniques could also be investigated to reduce the amount of energy required to thermal-harden the coating...|$|E

40|$|Digital halftones as output on {{plain paper}} {{are the focus}} of this study. A new {{terminology}} is suggested to allow proper description of digital halftones. The most important of these terms is the use of 2 ̆ 2 addressability 2 ̆ 2 to replace the often misused term 2 ̆ 2 resolution. 2 ̆ 2 Also important is {{the use of the term}} 2 ̆ 2 spot 2 ̆ 2 rather than 2 ̆ 2 dot 2 ̆ 2 to describe addressability. A means of properly describing digital halftones is suggested to avoid confusion with analog (ie., conventional photographic) halftones. Halftone patterns were created to test the efficiency of different designs at 300 spot per inch addressability on a laser printer. The page description language PostScript was used to create the halftone patterns which were modeled on three basic designs. It has been established that two halftone dot patterns constructed on the same matrix and containing the same number of spots will produce different densities if the configuration of the spots within the matrix is different This has been tested by comparing the results of the tone production curves of the condensed and open halftone dot designs. These patterns were output on a laser printer and measured for density. Tone production curves were drawn and compared. Even though each matrix contains the same number of spots, it has been shown that different densities result. This is solely a consequence of the dot design. Microscopic studies were conducted to illustrate the nature of the filling-in in the <b>non-image</b> <b>area.</b> Microscopic measurements were also made to ascertain the size of an individual spot at various screen rulings. It was found that the spot, which was very irregular to begin with, actually began to break up as the linescreen approached 150 lines per inch. Paper tests were run to gauge the maximum density and the tone production capabilities of various papers. Although the results were inconclusive, they point out another flaw of digital halftones which are output on plain paper. The number of grays predictable, given a matrix size, is greater than what is achievable in practice. These results mean the following for designers of digital halftones. First, purely due to the nature of digital halftones, the highlight and shadow areas will be most difficult to control. Secondly, use of a screen angle can limit the filling-in in the tone production curve. Thirdly, the variability of the spot size on paper, and its irregularities must be closely observed to assure that these dot forms will be reproducible in the lithographic process if this is desired. And finally, careful planning in the design of a halftone dot may allow an improved tone production curve...|$|R

One of these mysteries is the physical measurement of the amount of lithographic fountain solution wetting a lithographic plate.

This thesis deals with a proposed method of determining the amount of lithographic fountain solution applied to a lithographic plate surface, both image and <b>non-image</b> <b>areas.</b> The method utilizes the I.

The experiment deals specifically with temperature of fountain solution, different types of fountain solution, plates with different topographies, and image areas and the effects of these on the volume of fountain solution per area of plate surface. The results of the experiment indicate that temperature, plate topography and image area have a direct effect on the wetting of the lithographic plate by the fountain solution and the type of fountain solution does not have any effect...|$|E

It is the aim of this paper to compare the interpretation of the actual changes apparent on the Shroud image with known medical standards of postmortem changes, including rigor mortis and bodily decomposition. At the moment of death, an initially intact body commences to decompose unless intervening circumstances prevail. The earliest changes of decomposition take place at the cellular level and are thus not immediately visible.

The Shroud is a linen cloth, bearing the image of {{what appears to be}} a crucified man with the classical stigmata of Christ's crucifixion. The presence of whole blood was established by detection of heme derivatives, bile pigments, and proteins. Although iron in several forms is found over the whole cloth its distribution is shown to be accounted for by natural processes rather than as an added pigment. There is no chemical evidence for the application of any pigments, stains, or dyes on the cloth to produce the image found thereon. The chemical differences between image and <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of the cloth indicate that the image was produced by some dehydrative oxidative process of the cellulose structure of the linen to yield a conjugated carbonyl group as the chromophore.

40|$|The {{permanence}} of printed documents and books {{appears to be}} primarily dependent on paper stability. Other researchers implicate pH as {{a major factor in}} the deterioration rate of paper and acidity as major the cause of this deterioration. During the lithographic printing process, ink is in direct contact with fountain solution, which can be acidic or alkaline. Fountain solution is a mixture of water and chemicals used to keep the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of a lithographic plate moist. On press the intimate contact of ink with fountain solution creates a fountain solution-in-ink emulsion. The emulsion used here is a stable suspension of fountain solution droplets within the ink. The objective of this study was to determine if ink/fountain solution emulsion, which is printed on paper during lithographic printing, affects the rate of deterioration of paper. The stability of four commonly available papers was observed. These paper types were groundwood, publication grade, coated book, and uncoated book. Samples of the four paper groups were printed with four different ink formulations. The ink formulations were ink, ink and distilled water, ink and acidic fountain solution, and ink and alkaline fountain solution. Samples of the unprinted and printed paper were subjected to an accelerated - aging process by heating the samples for 72 hours at 100 C. The properties of unaged and aged papers were evaluated by pH determination, folding endurance, and tearing resistance. On the basis of statistical analysis of the data, inferences were made about the effect of the ink formulations on the paper properties. This experiment indicates that ink/fountain solution emulsion did affect the paper pH, but this effect is due to the ink with little change in pH due to the addition of acidic or alkaline fountain solution to the ink. The results of folding endurance and tearing resistance tests after accelerated aging established no clear pattern of variance that would indicate the differences observed in these properties were due to the pH change associated with the ink/fountain solution emulsions. Several unexpected occurrences were exhibited by this experiment. These include: groundwood was the paper least affected by the aging process; the pH of coated paper increased with the application of ink/fountain solution emulsion; a decrease in tearing resistance was associated with alkaline fountain solution...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} one of the newer planographic printing plates, specifically 3 M 2 ̆ 7 s Dry Plate. This plate is part of the system more popularly known as driography. As with many new processes, driography is beset with several problems. These include plate durability, substrate suitability, and toning. This study deals with the problem of toning and a. method for investigating it. In driography, toning is defined as the inking of the non-image background of the plate. Several factors are thought to {{have an effect on the}} amount of toning. Factors such as ink tack, ink temperature, room temperature, humidity, speed, and pressure are included. This investigation specifically researched the relationships between toning and ink tack, inking pressure, and printing speed. A parallel study of these relationships was made on both an IGT Printability Tester and on an ATF Chief 15 press. This was done in an attempt to show that the IGT Printability Tester could print driographically but, under the conditions used, it was a poor predictor of toning. Two methods of recording the effects of toning were used. One method was the recording of absolute densities taken in the <b>non-image</b> <b>areas</b> of the test sheets. The other method was the recording of a. ratio of the density of a solid patch to the density- of a tinted patch. It was hoped that the ratio would eliminate some of the extraneous variables that might affect the amount of toning. It was found, however, that the ratio result tended to record not only the pure toning, but also, the effects of some of the extraneous variables. Several statistical methods v/ere used to analyze the data accumulated. To compare one printing method with another and to compare one recording method with another, a correlation analysis was made and a graphical study done. To determine the reliability of the graphical analysis, a spot check was made using a paired comparison technique. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was made of the data from each printing and recording method to determine the significant factors in the experiment. This experiment showed that ink tack, inking pressure, printing speed, and their interactions all were significant factors in toning. Unfortunately it was impossible to include some other factors in the experiment which are known to have a significant effect on toning. These include such factors as ink temperature, room temperature, and humidity. More work needs to be done in the area of driography, especially in toning. The crucial question is whether this is a plate or an ink problem. As more control is obtained over toning, the use of driography should increase...|$|E
