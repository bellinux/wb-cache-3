40|$|Abstract: Smoking {{cessation}} {{continues to}} be an area of great concern for public health. Smoking status and willingness to quit should be assessed at every patient visit. A variety of nonprescription and prescription pharmacotherapy options exist for those willing to quit. Medications currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for smoking ces-sation include nicotine replacement <b>therapy</b> (<b>gum,</b> lozenge, <b>patch,</b> inhaler, and nasal spray), bupropion sustained release, and the newly approved vare-nicline. Nortriptyline and clonidine are not indicated for smoking cessation but have been used as second-line agents. This review focuses on each treatment option, including precautions, proper dosing and duration, adverse effects, and medication delivery issues. Attention is also given to individual patient consid-erations such as combination therapy, pregnancy, postcessation weight gain, and effects of cessation on the current medication regimen...|$|R
50|$|Nicotine {{replacement}} therapy, in {{the form}} of <b>gum,</b> <b>patches,</b> nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products. Studies have shown that nicotine replacement therapy is equally as effective as medications such as bupropion, in helping people quit smoking for at least 6 months. Studies have also shown that each form of nicotine replacement <b>therapy,</b> including nicotine <b>gum,</b> <b>patches,</b> nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varied, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays. It {{is important to note that}} using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve one's success rates in stopping tobacco use. Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates.|$|R
40|$|The most {{effective}} preventive intervention that a clinician can provide for tobacco-using patients against heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} is an empathic, personalized smoking cessation intervention program with extended assistance and follow-up. The {{goal of the}} intervention must be complete smoking cessation. Reduction provides no direct health benefits to the individual smoker. Interventions are readily available, but underutilized, in part due to lack of clinician training and organizational support. The present article summarizes the current guidelines for smoking cessation interventions as a framework from which to start. The guidelines incorporate the Transtheoretical Model of patient behavioral change and the “Five A's”: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange. Pharmacotherapeutic tools, including nicotine replacement <b>therapies</b> (nicotine <b>gums,</b> <b>patches,</b> nasal sprays, inhalers and new therapies) and non-nicotine therapies (bupropion, clonidine, nortriptyline and other antidepressants and anxiolytics) are con-sidered.

40|$|The great {{majority}} of smokers are chronically dependent on tobacco. This dependence arises from the rituals and sensory associations of smoking that are reinforced, within seconds, by a rapid burst of nicotine from the cigarette. All forms of nicotine replacement <b>therapy</b> (NRT) — <b>gum,</b> <b>patches</b> and inhaler — and bupropion are safe and effective for increasing smoking cessation rates in the short and long terms. Other {{than those who are}} minimally dependent, all patients willing to quit should be offered one of these therapies unless contraindications exist. The effectiveness of drug treatments is multiplied when associated with effective counseling or behavioral treatments. While NRT is not recommended during pregnancy or in patients with cardiac disease, if the alternative is smoking NRT is almost certainly safe. Combination NRT (more than one therapy) may be indicated in patients who have failed monotherapy in association with withdrawal symptoms. There are some specific contraindications to the use of bupropion. Its subsidized availability should not influence prescribers to ignore these...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} impact and costs of {{coverage}} for tobacco dependence treatment benefits with no patient cost sharing for smokers with employer sponsored coverage in two large independent practice association (IPA) model health maintenance organisations (HMOs) in California, USA.  METHODS—A randomised experimental design was used. 1204  eligible smokers were randomly assigned either to the control group, which received a self-help kit (video and pamphlet), or to the treatment group, which received the self-help kit and fully covered benefits for over the counter (OTC) nicotine replacement <b>therapy</b> (NRT) <b>gum</b> and <b>patch,</b> and participation in a group behavioural cessation programme with no patient cost sharing.  RESULTS—The quit rates after one year of follow up were 18 % in the treatment group and 13 % {{in the control group}} (adjusted odd ratio (OR) 1. 6,  95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 1  to 2. 4), controlling for health plan, sociodemographics, baseline smoking characteristics, and use of bupropion.

40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{reducing}} the number of cigarettes in smokers not trying to quit increases or decreases the likelihood of future quitting. In a pilot study, smokers not currently interested in quitting (n~ 67) were randomized to two groups. Experimental participants received behavioral treatment and nicotine replacement <b>therapy</b> (choice of <b>gum,</b> <b>patch,</b> or inhaler) to reduce smoking by 50 % over 4 weeks, followed by brief advice to quit. Usual-care participants received only brief advice to quit and nicotine replacement if they decided to quit. During the 4 -week treatment period, nonabstaining reduction participants decreased from 23 to 14 cigarettes per day (pv. 01) and maintained their reduction over the 6 -month follow-up period. At the 6 -month follow-up, 35 % of usual-care and 41 % of reduction participants (nonsignificant [ns]) moved forward in their stage of change. Over the 6 months, 34 % of usual-care participants had at least one 24 -h quit attempt, compared with 25 % of reduction participants (ns). A total of 9 % of usual-care participants remained quit at 6 months vs. 13 % in the reduction group (ns). These preliminary results suggest that adding a reduction option neither increases nor undermines interest in cessation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nicotine {{dependence}} is {{the major}} obstacle for smokers who want to quit. Guidelines have identified five effective first-line therapies, four nicotine replacement <b>therapies</b> (NRTs) [...] <b>gum,</b> <b>patch,</b> nasal spray and inhaler [...] and bupropion. Studying {{the extent to which}} these various treatments are cost-effective requires additional research. OBJECTIVES: To determine cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios of pharmacotherapies for nicotine dependence provided by general practitioners (GPs) during routine visits as an adjunct to cessation counselling. METHODS: We used a Markov model to generate two cohorts of one-pack-a-day smokers: (1) the reference cohort received only cessation counselling from a GP during routine office visits; (2) the second cohort received the same counselling plus an offer to use a pharmacological treatment to help them quit smoking. The effectiveness of adjunctive therapy was expressed in terms of the resultant differential in mortality rate between the two cohorts. Data on the effectiveness of therapies came from meta-analyses, and we used odds ratio for quitting as the measure of effectiveness. The costs of pharmacotherapies were based on the cost of the additional time spent by GPs offering, prescribing and following-up treatment, and on the retail prices of the therapies. We used the third-party-payer perspective. Results are expressed as the incremental cost per life-year saved. RESULTS: The cost per life-year saved for only counselling ranged from Euro 385 to Euro 622 for men and from Euro 468 to Euro 796 for women. The CE ratios for the five pharmacological treatments varied from Euro 1768 to Euro 6879 for men, and from Euro 2146 to Euro 8799 for women. Significant variations in CE ratios among the five treatments were primarily due to differences in retail prices. The most cost-effective treatments were bupropion and the patch, and, then, in descending order, the spray, the inhaler and, lastly, gum. Differences in CE between men and women across treatments were due to the shape of their respective mortality curve. The lowest CE ratio in men was for the 45 - to 49 -year-old group and for women in the 50 - to 54 -year-old group. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in treatment efficacy produced effects only for less-well proven treatments (spray, inhaler, and bupropion) and revealed a strong influence of the discount rate and natural quit rate on the CE of pharmacological treatments. CONCLUSION: The CE of first-line treatments for nicotine dependence varied widely with age and sex and was sensitive to the assumption for the natural quit rate. Bupropion and the nicotine patch were the two most cost-effective treatments...|$|R

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials of NRT that have assessed abstinence at least 6 months after the start of NRT were identified and 53 trials (42 <b>gum,</b> 9 <b>patch,</b> 1 intranasal spray, 1 inhaler), with data from 17, 703 subjects, were included in the analyses. Use of NRT increased the odds ratio (OR) of abstinence to 1. 71 (95 % confidence interval 1. 56 - 1. 87) compared with those allocated to the control interventions. The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1. 61 for gum, 2. 07 for transdermal patch, 2. 92 for nasal spray, and 3. 05 for inhaled nicotine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Use of {{smokeless}} tobacco (ST) {{can lead to}} nicotine addiction and long-term use can lead to health problems including periodontal disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacologic interventions {{for the treatment of}} ST use. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts Online, and Scopus. Date of last search: October 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit with follow up of at least six months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data. We summarised as odds ratios. For subgroups of trials with similar types of intervention and without substantial statistical heterogeneity, we estimated pooled effects using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. MAIN RESULTS: Data from one study suggest that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (Odds Ratio [OR] 1. 6, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1. 08 to 2. 36) among Swedish snus users. Two trials of bupropion SR did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (OR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 47 to 1. 57). Nicotine replacement <b>therapy</b> (<b>patch,</b> <b>gum,</b> and lozenge) was not observed to increase tobacco abstinence rates (OR 1. 14, 95 % CI: 0. 91 to 1. 42). There was statistical heterogeneity among the 14 trials of behavioural interventions; seven of them reported statistically and clinically significant benefits, four suggested benefit but with wide CIs, whilst two had similar intervention and control quit rates and relatively narrow CIs. Heterogeneity was not explained by the design (individual or cluster randomization), whether participants were selected for interest in quitting, or specific intervention components. Most trials included either telephone counselling, an oral examination and feedback about any ST induced mucosal changes, or both. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis there was some evidence that behavioural interventions which include telephone counselling might increase abstinence rates more than interventions with less contact. In one trial an interactive website increased abstinence more than a static website. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{nicotine}} replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping {{resist the urge}} to smoke cigarettes. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to determine the effectiveness of the different forms {{of nicotine}} replacement <b>therapy</b> (chewing <b>gum,</b> transdermal <b>patches,</b> nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; and to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in April 2001. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measures was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model (Peto). MAIN RESULTS: We identified 108 trials; 94 with a non NRT control group. The odds ratio for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1. 73 (95 % confidence interval 1. 62 - 1. 85), The odds ratios for the different forms of NRT were 1. 66 for gum, 1. 76 for patches, 2. 27 for nasal spray, 2. 08 for inhaled nicotine and 1. 73 for nicotine sublingual tablet. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (odds ratio 2. 67, 95 % confidence interval 1. 69 to 4. 22). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy, in which bupropion was significantly more effective than nicotine patch or placebo. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: All of the commercially available forms of NRT (nicotine <b>gum,</b> transdermal <b>patch,</b> the nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler and nicotine sublingual tablets) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase quit rates approximately 1. 5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. There is promising evidence that bupropion may be more effective than NRT (either alone or in combination). However, its most appropriate place in the therapeutic armamentarium requires further study and consideration...|$|R

The model indicates that a 0. 076 % reduction in cigarette consumption is associated with the availability of nicotine patches after 1992.  The over the counter dummy variable (after 1996) has a negative sign, but is not significant, perhaps due to only a few quarters of data in the study period.  CONCLUSIONS—Nicotine replacement products (nicotine <b>gums</b> and nicotine <b>patches)</b> {{play a significant role in}} reducing cigarette consumption, in addition to the negative effect of increasing cigarette price and the overall trend of declining cigarette consumption (as reflected by the time trend variable). The findings of this study suggest that additional efforts for promoting sales of nicotine replacement products will be another effective alternative to discouraging cigarette consumption.    Keywords: nicotine replacement products; nicotine gum; nicotine patches; cigarette consumptio...|$|R
40|$|Background: In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} switching nicotine <b>gum</b> and <b>patch</b> from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status. Some {{expressed concerns}} that broader availability {{and lack of}} physician control might increase persistent use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) —that is, use beyond the period specified by the FDA approved label...|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1970 s {{there were}} no {{effective}} pharmacological treatments for tobacco dependence. The invention of nicotine gum was a major treatment advance and also greatly helped {{our understanding of the}} nature of tobacco dependence. There are now eight effective pharmacotherapies (nicotine <b>gum,</b> <b>patch,</b> nasal spray, inhaler, lozenge/tablet, bupropion, nortriptyline and clonidine) available to aid smoking cessation. Other non-nicotine agents that show promise are under investigation, including glucose, rimonabant, selegiline and varenicline. Greater knowledge of the mechanisms of action of the effective non-nicotine agents should lead to better {{understanding of the nature of}} tobacco dependence. Future research into optimal treatments should examine long-term combination pharmacotherapy combined with improved psychosocial support that is partly designed to enhance medication compliance. In addition, there is a need for studies designed to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacotherapies in populations such as youth, pregnant smokers and smokers with co-occurring mental health problems...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{nicotine}} replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation to help {{resist the urge}} to smoke cigarettes. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to determine the effectiveness of the different forms {{of nicotine}} replacement <b>therapy</b> (chewing <b>gum,</b> transdermal <b>patches,</b> nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; and to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 49 trials of nicotine gum, 32 of transdermal nicotine patch, four of intranasal nicotine spray, four of inhaled nicotine and two of nicotine sublingual tablet. Three trials compared combinations of two forms of nicotine therapy with one form alone. The odds ratio for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1. 72 (95 % confidence interval 1. 60 to 1. 84), The odds ratios for the different forms of NRT were 1. 63 for gum, 1. 77 for patches, 2. 27 for nasal spray, 2. 08 for inhaled nicotine and 1. 73 for nicotine sublingual tablet. These odds were largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. Eight weeks of patch therapy was as effective as longer courses and {{there was no evidence that}} tapered therapy was better than abrupt withdrawal. Wearing the patch only during waking hours (16 hours/day) was as effective as wearing it for 24 hours/day. The odds ratio for abstinence in the trials which directly compared 4 mg versus 2 mg gum in highly dependent smokers found a significant benefit in favour of 4 mg gum (odds ratio 2. 67, 95 % confidence interval 1. 69 to 4. 22). There is no strong evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Only one study directly compared NRT against another pharmacotherapy (bupropion) and found that the latter was significantly more effective either alone or used in combination with nicotine patch than if nicotine patch was used alone. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: All of the commercially available forms of NRT (nicotine <b>gum,</b> transdermal <b>patch,</b> and in some countries, the nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler and nicotine sublingual tablets) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase quit rates approximately 1. 5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Since all the trials of NRT reported so far have included at least some form of brief advice to the smoker, this represents the minimum which should be offered in order to ensure its effectiveness. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. There is promising evidence that bupropion may be more effective than NRT (either alone or in combination). (ABSTRAC...|$|R
