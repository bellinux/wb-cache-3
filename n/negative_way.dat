5|$|Camino, a 2008 Spanish film {{directed}} by Javier Fesser, allegedly {{based on the}} real story of Alexia González-Barros, a girl who died from spinal cancer at fourteen in 1985 and awaits canonization. Fesser portrays the Opus Dei in a <b>negative</b> <b>way,</b> depicting it as an extreme cult destroying families, suggesting that Opus Dei manipulated the tragedy of the young Camino's painful death for its own ends.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness in a <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't {{be able to be}} an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
25|$|At present (2013), popular Turkish TV {{shows are}} alleged {{to portray the}} Greek people in a <b>negative</b> <b>way.</b> This {{resulted}} in complaints by representatives of the local Greek communities, since similar tendencies triggered the outbreak of anti-Greek pogroms and massive expulsions during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The famous Lamentation Texts {{from the}} First Intermediate Period reveal some {{interesting}} {{views about the}} monumental tombs from the past; they were at that time seen as proof of vanity.

25|$|Discussion {{of cloning}} {{in the popular}} media often {{presents}} the subject negatively. In {{an article in the}} 8 November 1993 article of Time, cloning was portrayed in a <b>negative</b> <b>way,</b> modifying Michelangelo's Creation of Adam to depict Adam with five identical hands. Newsweeks 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.|$|E
50|$|According to Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin, {{the most}} {{significant}} of Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire; thirty of the 118 articles in his Dictionnaire philosophique dealt with Jews and described them in consistently <b>negative</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|R
50|$|People {{often find}} {{ways of dealing with}} distress, in both <b>negative</b> and {{positive}} <b>ways.</b> Examples of positive ways are listening to music, calming exercises, coloring, sports and similar healthy distractions. <b>Negative</b> <b>ways</b> can include {{but are not limited to}} use of drugs including alcohol, and expression of anger, which are likely to lead to complicated social interactions, thus causing increased distress.|$|R
50|$|Human {{society and}} forests {{influence}} {{each other in}} both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>ways.</b> Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people's health. Human activities, including harvesting forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.|$|R
25|$|According to Martin Kramer, the Quran {{speaks of}} Jews in a <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> and reports {{instances}} of Jewish treachery against the Islamic prophet Muhammad. However, Islam didn't hold up those Jews who practiced treachery against Muhammad as archetypes {{nor did it}} portray treachery {{as the embodiment of}} Jews in all times and places. The Quran also attests to Muhammad's amicable relations with Jews.|$|E
25|$|Another {{appeal of}} the railroads is the {{business}} side of railroading. Railroads were long central to economic growth and commerce, and still are to some extent. The history of railroads and railroaders (such as James J.

25|$|Radical {{grassroots}} {{movements and}} organisations came out strongly against the 2008 xenophobic attacks calling them pogroms promoted by government and political parties.

25|$|Drug addiction, alcoholism, {{a mental}} disability, bio-chemical changes and PTSD can all {{lead to a}} person {{committing}} an aggressive act against another person. Not having sufficient skills {{on how to handle}} oneself when faced with aggression can lead to very undesirable outcomes. These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting in a <b>negative</b> <b>way.</b> Prolonged or intense anger and frustration contributes to physical conditions such as headaches, digestive problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety or depression. Angry outbursts can be a way of trying to cope with unhappiness, or depression.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.|$|E

40|$|How {{many times}} have we {{realized}} that what and how we assess our students greatly influences how and what the students learn? Assessment can drive learning in both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>ways.</b> One consequence of the commonly used evaluation system is that it leads our students, society in general, and perhaps even ourselves to focus on grades and not learning. The purposes and practices of evaluation must be realigned to promote learning over grades. Assessment can drive learning in <b>negative</b> <b>ways.</b> This overemphasis on grades results in many of our students spending time figuring out {{what it will take}} to get the grades they need in a course and not thinking about what they should be learning.

25|$|When people fail to gain self-verifying {{reactions}} {{through the}} display of identity cue or through choosing self-verifying social environments, they may still acquire such evaluations by systematically evoking confirming reactions.

25|$|A {{common problem}} is that terms chosen by an {{identity}} group, as acceptable descriptors of themselves, {{can be used in}} <b>negative</b> <b>ways</b> by detractors.

Perhaps the writers made this one super-sincere to counteract the inherent cynicism behind its origins, but the show just seems sappy and lame." [...] Winnipeg Free Press columnist Randall King wrote in his review of the eleventh season of The Simpsons that there is [...] "something undeniably funny about having Maude Flanders die by a barrage of T-shirts fired by air cannons at a speedway.

Q provided a two-out-of-five-stars rating and commented that [...] "Sadly, bra-burning rhetoric and gospel warbling make poor substitutes for addictive songs". AllMusic's editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also wrote a negative review, commenting that the album is [...] "the sound of an artist who was given too much freedom too early and has {{no idea what to do}} with it". Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles also provided a negative review, commenting that Stripped [...] "is a blast of excess that risks alienating Ms. Aguilera's old fans without luring new ones, and it's bursting with misguided energy".|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} merit-making may have affected the economies of Buddhist countries in a <b>negative</b> <b>way,</b> because spending savings on the local temple would prevent consumption and investment and therefore stunt economic growth. Other researchers have disagreed, pointing out that spending resources on a Buddhist temple does stimulate economic growth through the investment in goods for the temple. It has also been suggested {{that even if the}} economy of Buddhist countries would be better off without merit-making, it would result in an economy {{that the majority of the}} population would not prefer. Another criticism often leveled at merit-making in modern times is that it prevents people from using their resources to help the poor and needy. Very often, however, temples do have many social roles in society, and offer help to many groups in society—resources are therefore redistributed widely. Moreover, since merit-making is often done as a community, merit-making may strengthen social ties, which Walters calls [...] "sociokarma".|$|E

500|$|Mark Arm, the vocalist for the Seattle band Green River—and later Mudhoney—is {{generally}} credited {{as being}} {{the first to use}} the term grunge to describe the Seattle genre of music. Arm first used the term in 1981, when he wrote a letter under his given name Mark McLaughlin to the Seattle zine Desperate Times, criticizing his own band Mr. Epp and the Calculations as [...] "Pure grunge! Pure noise! Pure shit!". Clark Humphrey, contributor to Desperate Times, cites this as the earliest use of the term to refer to a Seattle band, and mentions that Bruce Pavitt of Sub Pop popularized the term as a musical label in 1987–88, using it on several occasions to describe Green River. Sub Pop called Green River's 1986 EP Dry as a Bone [...] "ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation." [...] Everett True states that when Arm stated that Seattle's streets were [...] "paved with grunge", he was using the word in a <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> to mean [...] "orthless."

Kim's ex-husband Kris Humphries first appeared on the show during the premiere of the sixth season; their relationship was chronicled throughout the season and ended with the couple's wedding special [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event". They eventually went through a highly publicized divorce; Kardashian's former publicist later claimed that Humphries was allegedly set up to be portrayed on the show in a <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> and that the short-lived marriage was staged for the cameras as a ploy to generate money.|$|E
500|$|On August 10, a Superior Court Judge officially {{approved}} the deal between Columbia Pictures (film distributor) and AEG Live (the concerts' promoter) for Columbia {{to be able}} to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson and the rehearsal crew for the film. The deal also included a merchandising agreement with Bravado International Group—the company is a division of Universal Music Group that is owned by Vivendi—so that they can distribute and sell [...] "Jackson-themed products". Columbia had reportedly paid $60 million for rights to the rehearsal footage in court documents that were filed. The papers filed had also reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue. In the agreement, Columbia and AEG Live both agreed in the deal that {{the final version of the}} film should be no longer than 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes), and that the film must attain a PG rating. The contract also stated that the film is not allowed to show footage of Jackson that shows him in a <b>negative</b> <b>way,</b> stating that: [...] "Footage that paints Jackson in a bad light will not be permitted" [...] and [...] "Under the terms of the proposed contract, the film will have to be screened for Jackson's estate and cannot include any footage that puts the superstar in a bad light."
