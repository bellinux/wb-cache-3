5|$|In December 1958, {{an event}} that {{initially}} had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Playford, occurred, and eventually intensified into a debacle that {{was regarded as a}} turning point in his premiership and marked the end of his rule.|$|E
5|$|It had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his {{immigration}} status. And it's {{just being}} used by advocates of this crushing anti-immigration policy to make a cheap political point.|$|E

5|$|Mme M'Barek further {{stated that}} the {{arguments}} she had with her husband had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> money, but rather arose {{as a result of}} Lord Shaftesbury's excessive sexual demands brought on by his seemingly endless injections of testosterone.|$|E
5|$|The name {{actinium}} originates {{from the}} Ancient Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{previous}} episode, Postgame Mortem, Veronica is arrested by Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) on the suspicion that she helped the now-missing Josh Barry to escape from prison. This episode opens with Lamb questioning her and learning little, as she had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his disappearance.|$|E

They're past patching; there's <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> them. There's <b>nothing</b> {{accordingly}} <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Mrs. Medwin but to put her off." [...] And Lady Wantridge rose to her height.|$|R

5|$|In December 1958 there {{occurred}} {{an event}} that initially had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Playford, but eventually intensified into a debacle that {{was regarded as a}} turning point in his premiership and marked the end of his rule. Dunstan was prominent in pressuring Playford during this time.|$|E
5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E

50|$|James Peek died aged 79 at {{his home}} in Watcome near Torquay, Devon. After George's son James Frean retired in 1887, his family had <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> running the business. Peek's nephew Francis Hedley Peek became the first {{chairman}} of the now publicly listed company in 1901, but on his death in 1904 again the Peek family had <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> managing the business. James Carr's family remained actively associated with the business for several more generations.|$|R

5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it. On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it was a matter of circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the missing parts of his brain.|$|E

5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It {{is argued that}} {{the teaching of evolution}} degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> its objective empirical reality.|$|E
5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess that has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavators}} {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated {{it might be}} an arrowhead {{that had been embedded}} in its back. An X-ray analysis showed it was a nail, probably of Romano-British date, that by chance had been in the ground immediately under the grave or was in soil disturbed when it was dug and had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the body.|$|E
5|$|The smaller {{of the two}} cocks-of-the-rock, {{the male}} Guianan takes the lesser part in breeding. It is {{polygynous}} and has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to the females.|$|E
5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle failed, and that The Evil Queen will never be more powerful than him. She then tells him that she had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's feelings were real) and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, leaping off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E
