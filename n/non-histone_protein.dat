50|$|Originally {{named because}} of its {{sequence}} similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NHP2 (<b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> 2), this protein {{appears to be a}} highly conserved nuclear protein that is a component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. It binds to the 5' stem-loop of U4 snRNA. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.|$|E
50|$|Chromobox protein homolog 5 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the CBX5 gene. It {{is a highly}} conserved, <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> part of the {{heterochromatin}} family. The protein itself is more commonly called (in humans) HP1α. Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) has an N-terminal domain that acts on methylated lysines residues leading to epigenetic repression. The C-terminal of this protein has a chromo shadow-domain (CSD) {{that is responsible for}} homodimerizing, as well as interacting with a variety of chromatin-associated, non-histone proteins.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the SBTS {{is similar to the}} Tn5 transposon system, however the enzyme and gene sequences are eukaryotic in nature as opposed to prokaryotic. The system's tranposase can act in trans as well as in cis, allowing a diverse collection of transposon structures. The transposon itself is flanked by inverted repeat sequences, which are each repeated twice in a direct fashion, designated IR/DR sequences. The internal region consists of the gene or sequence to be transposed, and could also contain the transposase gene. Alternatively, the transposase can be encoded on a separate plasmid or injected in its protein form. Yet another approach is to incorporate both the transposon and the transposase genes into a viral vector, which can target a cell or tissue of choice. The transposase protein is extremely specific in the sequences that it binds, and is able to discern its IR/DR sequences from a similar sequence by three base pairs. Once the enzyme is bound to both ends of the transposon, the IR/DR sequences are brought together and held by the transposase in a Synaptic Complex Formation (SCF). The formation of the SCF is a checkpoint ensuring proper cleavage. HMGB1 is a <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> from the host which is associated with eukaryotic chromatin. It enhances the preferential binding of the transposase to the IR/DR sequences and is likely essential for SCF complex formation/stability. Transposase cleaves the DNA at the target sites, generating 3' overhangs. The enzyme then targets TA dinucleotides in the host genome as target sites for integration. The same enzymatic catalytic site which cleaved the DNA is responsible for integrating the DNA into the genome, duplicating the region of the genome in the process. Although transposase is specific for TA dinucleotides, the high frequency of these pairs in the genome indicates that the transposon undergoes fairly random integration.|$|E
50|$|In chromatin, those {{proteins}} {{which remain}} after the histones have been removed, {{are classified as}} <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins.</b> Scaffold proteins, DNA polymerase, Heterochromatin Protein 1 and Polycomb are common <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins.</b> This classification group also includes numerous other structural, regulatory, and motor proteins.|$|R
40|$|Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} technology enables somatic cells to achieve totipotency. In addition, pluripotency is acquired by introduction of only four transcriptional factors（Oct 3 / 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, c-Myc） into somatic cells using iPS cell technology. However, {{one of the}} problems in these technologies is low efficiency of reprogramming. In previous studies, it was reported that the efficiency of reprogramming improved by histone deacetylase inhibitor （HDACi） treatment, but little is known of the molecular mechanism. The facilitation of histone acetylation by HDACi treatment relates to an increase in gene expression, and HDACi treatment also facilitates acetylation of <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins,</b> and affects physiological activation. Thus, it is suggested that the acetylation of <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> relates to improvement of the reprogramming efficiency. In this review, we outline the mechanism of acetylation of <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins,</b> and extract <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> possibly related to improving reprogramming fromGEO database...|$|R
40|$|Studies are {{presented}} {{on the nature}} of chromatin-associated phosphoproteins whose phosphorylation is influenced by polyamines. After labelling with 32 P, chromatin-associated proteins were separated into four fractions. Fraction I comprised neutral and basic non-histone phosphoproteins, including high-mobility-group non-histones; fraction II consisted mostly of histones; fraction III consisted of a class of (salt-soluble) acidic non-histone phosphoproteins; and fraction IV consisted of residual (salt-insoluble) acidic non-histone phosphoproteins. The average relative distribution of protein in the four fractions (I-IV) was about 1 : 4 : 2 : 1 for both liver and prostate. However, tissue-dependent differences were observed in the incorporation of 32 P in various protein fractions. In the presence of polyamines (e. g. 1 mM-spermine or 2 mM-spermidine) maximal stimulation of phosphorylation was observed in <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> of fraction I (160 - 180 %), followed by that in <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> of fraction III (80 - 110 %). The phosphorylation of residual <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> in fraction IV, and the small extent of phosphorylation of histones in fraction II, remained unaltered in the presence of polyamines. Thus polyamines do not stimulate the phosphorylation of all non-histone proteins; their stimulative effect is most prominent in the phosphorylation of neutral and basic <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> and a class of salt-soluble acidic <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins.</b> In accord with our hypothesis, these differential effects of polyamines on phosphorylation of endogenous <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> may relate to the conformation of these substrates rather than to endogenous kinases...|$|R
40|$|Although histone {{acetylation}} and deacetylation machiner-ies (HATs and HDACs) regulate {{important aspects}} of cell function by targeting histone tails, recent work highlights that <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> acetylation is also pervasive in eukaryotes. Here, we use quantitative mass-spectrometry to define acetylations targeted by the sirtuin family, pre-viously implicated in the regulation of <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> acetylation. To identify HATs that promote acetylation of these sites, we also performed this analysis in gcn 5 (SAGA) and esa 1 (NuA 4) mutants. We observed strong sequence specificity for the sirtuins and {{for each of these}} HATs. Although the Gcn 5 and Esa 1 consensus sequences are entirely distinct, the sirtuin consensus overlaps al-most entirely with that of Gcn 5, suggesting a strong co-ordination between these two regulatory enzymes.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{synthesis}} of non-histone chromosomal proteins in simian virus (SV) 40 -infected African green monkey kidney cells was analyzed by polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis {{to see whether}} the changes in chromosomal protein metabolism are involved in the viral-induced synthesis of cellular DNA and mRNA. During the prereplicative phase of infection, the rate of histone synthesis was decreased until 15 h postinfection, whereas that of <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis was increased after 5 h postinfection and reached a maximum at 10 to 15 h postinfection when viral-induced synthesis of cellular DNA and mRNA began to be observed. Stimulation of <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis was also observed in the infected cells treated with cytosine arabinoside and was dependent on the multiplicity of infection. Stimulation occurred in almost all species of non-histone proteins. These results suggest that the stimulation of <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis is caused by an early SV 40 function and occurs prior to the viral-induced synthesis of cellular DNA and mRNA. During the replicative phase of infection, a marked increase in the rate of synthesis was observed in the non-histone proteins with molecular weights of about 48, 000, 35, 000, and 23, 000, which were subsequently found to be SV 40 capsid proteins...|$|E

50|$|HDAC inhibitors have {{effects on}} <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> {{that are related}} to {{acetylation}}. HDIs can alter the degree of acetylation of these molecules and, therefore, increase or repress their activity. For the four examples given above (see Function) on HDACs acting on <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins,</b> in each of those instances the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) blocks the effect. HDIs have been shown to alter the activity of many transcription factors, including ACTR, cMyb, E2F1, EKLF, FEN 1, GATA, HNF-4, HSP90, Ku70, NFκB, PCNA, p53, RB, Runx, SF1 Sp3, STAT, TFIIE, TCF, YY1.|$|R

40|$|Histone or <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> {{acetylation}} plays {{important roles}} {{in all kinds of}} cellular events, including the normal and abnormal development of blood cells, through changing the epigenetic status of chromatin and regulating non-histone protein’s function. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which are the enzymes responsible for the histone or <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> acetylation, contain p 300 /CBP, MYST and GNAT family etc. HATs are not only the protein modifiers and epigenetic factors, but also the critical regulators of cell development and cancerogenesis. Here we will review the function of HATs such as p 300 /CBP, Tip 60, MOZ/MORF and GCN 5 /PCAF in the normal hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. The inhibitors that have been developed to target HATs will also be reviewed here.

40|$|Biochemical and immunochemical {{techniques}} {{were used to}} probe the changes in composition of the chromatin of differentiating Müllerian ducts. The <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> increases gradually in the left duct and reaches a constant amount at day 15 of incubation, then remains at the same value until after birth. In the regressing right duct, the <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> increases and then decreases. Gel electrophoresis indicated an increased heterogeneity {{in the composition of}} the <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> corresponding to Müllerian-duct differentiation. Little variation in quantity and quality of the histone was observed; however, immunochemical assay confirmed the structural change of Müllerian-duct chromatin during development. An antibody against the chromatin of the newborn-chick oviduct was produced in the rabbit. The chromatin of Müllerian ducts from the early embryonic stage showed a small affinity with the antibody; the affinity increased during the late embryonic stages. The affinity was greatly decreased in the regressing right duct. Oestrogen-binding sites were present in the chromatin of the left and right Müllerian ducts during differentiation, with more sites in the left duct than in the right one during the late stages of development. After oestrogen treatment in vivo, the oestrogen-binding sites on the chromatin of both {{the left and the right}} ducts were increased, with a greater increase in the left duct than in the right. In the developing left duct the binding sites reach a maximum on day 15 of incubation, and remain constant at that value until birth...|$|E
40|$|The {{arrangement}} of the protein component on the DNA of the chromatin complex was studied by comparing the rate of release of oligonucleotides and of protein after addition of deoxyribonuclease I and deoxyribonuclease II to rat thymus chromatin. Also the action of deoxyribonuclease I on normal chromatin and on chromatin depleted of <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> was compared, to elucidate {{the role of the}} latter protein in chromatin structure. As a preliminary to the above, the rate of action of deoxyribonuclease I on DNA and on chromatin at the same DNA concentration, and the dependence of the action of this enzyme on the Mg 2 + concentration, were studied. It was found that: (1) little if any DNA in chromatin is present in extensive, truly `free' zones, i. e. completely uncovered by protein; (2) at relatively low concentrations of added Mg 2 +, deoxyribonuclease I degrades chromatin more rapidly than DNA; (3) the <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> is not attached directly to the DNA in chromatin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen nuclei {{were treated}} with the {{chemotherapeutic}} agent, cis-Pt(II), they were crosslinked {{to the extent that}} their nuclear morphology as assayed by light microscopy was retained even in the presence of SDS. Protein analysis showed that the histones were completely absent from these nuclear structures, while the <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins,</b> with one possible exception, were completely retained. When the nuclear structures in SDS {{were treated with}} thiourea to reverse the crosslinks, the <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> were liberated and the nuclear structures disappeared. When treated with Proteinase K in SDS, the nuclear structures also disappeared, indicating that protein components were necessary to maintain the structures...|$|R
40|$|Subnucleosome {{particles}} SN 2 and SN 3 containing short DNA {{fragments and}} <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> {{of the high}} mobility group, HMG-G and HMG-E respectively, were purified from the chromatin preparations of mouse L cells partially digested with staphylococcal nuclease. Labeled DNAs prepared from these particles were hybridized to an excess of nuclear RNA. The binding of subnucleosomal DNA was about 3 -fold higher comparing to total cellular DNA fragmented to the same size. Special control experiments showed that DNA. protein complexes present in subnucleosomes SN 2 and SN 3 preexisted in nontreated nuclei. The conclusion has been drawn that <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> HMG-G and HMG-E {{are associated with the}} DNA of transcriptionally active chromatin and are released by nuclease as subnucleosomes...|$|R
40|$|Mononucleosomes {{derived from}} brief {{digestion}} of uninduced Friend cell nuclei with micrococcal nuclease contain {{a set of}} <b>non-histone</b> chromosomal <b>proteins</b> which are partly or altogether missing in the oligomeric nucleosomes. On the other hand, the latter contain a protein of Mr 190, 000 not seen in the mononucleosomes. Longer digestion removes most of these <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins,</b> excepting the Mr 190, 000 protein. Brief digestion of nuclei from Friend cells induced by DMSO or by n-butyrate removes most of the <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins</b> from the nucleosomes, as did the prolonged digestion of uninduced nuclei. The Mr 190, 000 protein remains, while a protein of Mr 27, 000 is increased. The rate of phosphorylation of histone H 1 associated with mononucleosomes was 3 to 4 -fold greater in cells induced with DMSO. The major phosphoprotein {{and most of the}} other phosphorylated non-histones were modified at the same rate in control and induced cells. However, a Mr 95, 000 protein was less phosphorylated in the induced cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chromatin}} <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> on DNA and chromatin stability is investigated by differential thermal denaturation method. 1) Chromatin (rat liver) yields a multiphasic melting profile. The {{major part of}} the melting curve of this chromatin is situated at temperatures higher than pure DNA, with a distinct contribution due to nucleosomes melting. A minor part melts at temperatures lower than DNA which may be assigned to chromatin non-histone protein-DNA complex which destabilized DNA structure. 2) Heparin which extracts histones lowers the melting profile of chromatin and one observes also a contribution with a Tm lower that of pure DNA. In contrast, extraction on non-histone proteins by urea supresses the low Tm peak. 3) Reconstitution of chromatin non-histone protein-DNA complexes confirms the existence of a fraction of chromatin <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> which lowers the melting temperature when compared to pure DNA. It is concluded that chromatin non-histone proteins contain different fractions of proteins which are causing stabilizing and destabilizing effect on DNA structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} tri-iodothyronine {{injection}} {{on the nuclear}} tri-iodothyronine receptor (putative thyroid-hormone receptor) was examined in rat liver. Nuclear receptors were extracted from isolated nuclei with 0. 4 M-KCl, and their association constants (Ka) and maximal binding capacities (Cmax.) were determined by Scatchard analyses with and without correction for the endogenous hormone. The amount of endogenous tri-iodothyronine bound to <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> was estimated {{on the basis of}} the specific radio-activity of [125 I]tri-iodothyronine injected 2 h before the rats were killed. It was demonstrated that Cmax. of the nuclear receptors was 2. 5 -fold higher in severely hyperthyroid than in hypothyroid rats. However, irrespective of the thyroid status, the Ka of the receptors remained unchanged when corrected for endogenous tri-iodothyronine bound to <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein.</b> The validity of the correction was supported by experiments in vitro in which nuclear receptors were preincubated with unlabelled tri-iodothyronine. The increase in Cmax. of nuclear receptors was directly related to mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity. These results suggest a hormonal modulation of the nuclear receptors which is associated with hormonal action...|$|E

40|$|Diverse {{cellular}} functions {{including the}} regulation of inflammatory gene expression, DNA repair and cell proliferation are regulated by changes in the acetylation status of histones and <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins.</b> Many human diseases, particularly cancer, {{have been associated with}} altered patterns of histone acetylation. Furthermore, abnormal expression and activation of histone acetyltransferases, which act as transcriptional co-activators, has been reported in inflammatory diseases. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been developed clinically for malignancies due to their effects on apoptosis. More recently, in vitro and in vivo data indicates that HDAC inhibitors may be anti-inflammatory due to their effects on cell death acting through acetylation of <b>non-histone</b> <b>proteins.</b> Although there are concerns over the long-term safety of these agents, they may prove useful particularly in situations where current anti-inflammatory therapies are suboptimal...|$|R

The active and inactive chromatin fractions from control and DMSO-treated cells had essentially the same total histone content, but the active chromatin fractions from both control and treated cells contained significantly less H 1 histone. The amount of <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> was similar in the corresponding chromatin fractions of control and treated cells. For both treated and control cell chromatin, however, the content of <b>non-histone</b> <b>protein</b> was consistently lower in the inactive fraction, P 2, than in the active fraction, S 2. No significant differences were observed between the polyacrylamide gel banding patterns, as determined by Coomassie blue staining, of histone or non-histone chromatin proteins of the corresponding fractions from treated and control cells. However, dual radioisotope labeling studies indicated an increased incorporation of radioactive amino acids into a 50 000 D polypeptide of unfractionated chromatin and a 23 000 D polypeptide of active chromatin (S 2) from DMSO-treated cells...|$|E

40|$|By {{selective}} dissociation of histones {{with the}} ionic detergent sodium deoxycholate, we {{have demonstrated that}} these basic chromosomal polypeptides, which are effective inhibitors of transcription, are more tenaciously bound to DNA in mitotic than in S-phase chromatin. Evidence is presented which suggests that cell-cycle-stage-specific <b>non-histone</b> chromosomal <b>proteins</b> can account for such variations in the association of histones with DNA. When chromatin is reconstituted with DNA and histones are pooled from S-phase and mitotic cells and either S-phase or mitotic <b>non-histone</b> chromosomal <b>proteins,</b> a preferential extraction of histones with sodium deoxycholate from chromatin reconstituted with S-phase rather than mitotic <b>non-histone</b> chromosomal <b>proteins</b> is observed. In contrast, the extractability of histones with sodium deoxycholate from nucleohistone complexes reconstituted with DNA pooled from S-phase and mitotic cells and either S-phase or mitotic histones is identical. Since <b>non-histone</b> chromosomal <b>proteins</b> rather than histones {{are responsible for the}} differences in chromatin template activity during S-phase and mitosis, we propose that <b>non-histone</b> chromosomal <b>proteins</b> may modify gene expression during the cell cycle by mediating the binding of histones to DNA...|$|R
