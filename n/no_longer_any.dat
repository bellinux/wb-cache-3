5|$|After these revelations, {{the people}} of Springfield begin to {{distrust}} Armin. Armin decides that there is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> place for him in Springfield. The real Skinner is then offered the chance to realize his dream and take over as school principal. He takes the job, but the real Skinner finds himself isolated by the townspeople who realize they prefer Armin over him. Armin, however, has already left Springfield and gone to Capital City to resume his old persona as a no-good street thug.|$|E

He also redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.|$|E

This process allowed {{for the application of}} a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{convened a}} meeting on 29 November 1946 to settle the future policy on jet fighters for the VVS and PVO. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 was {{selected}} as the primary fighter with the Yakovlev Yak-15 relegated to conversion training and familiarization. The imminent availability of British jet engines and access to German jet technology and engineers meant that there was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> need for mixed-power aircraft, but Stalin insisted that the I-250 finish its trials and that the tooling and drawings should be retained along with unassembled parts even though the program was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|With the {{stations}} at Wood Siding and Brill closed, and the Great Western Railway's Brill and Ludgershall railway station inconveniently sited, the GWR {{opened a new}} station on the Chiltern Main Line nearby at Dorton Halt on 21 June 1937. Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall stations were closed on 7 January 1963; the line remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North.

5|$|Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall {{stations}} were closed on 7 January 1963 and trains no longer stop, although the line through them remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North. Quainton Road station was bought in 1969 {{by members of}} the London Railway Preservation Society to use as a permanent base, and now houses the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The station is still connected to the railway network and used by freight trains and occasional special passenger services, but no longer has a scheduled passenger service. There are <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> open railway stations in the areas formerly served by the tramway. Plans have been proposed by the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre to rebuild and reopen a stretch of the tramway as a heritage railway.|$|E
5|$|Fusō was {{commissioned}} on 8 November 1915 and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet on 13 December. The ship did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> forces of the Central Powers in Asia {{by the time she}} was completed. She served as the flagship of the 1st Division during 1917 and 1918, and patrolled off the coast of China during that time. The ship aided survivors of the Great Kanto Earthquake between 9 and 22 September 1923. In the 1920s, Fusō conducted training off the coast of China and was often placed in reserve. After assignment as a training ship in 1936 and 1937, she briefly operated in Chinese waters in early 1939.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SIRT {{purchased}} {{the property of}} the B and merged it with the Staten Island Railway. The line had been worked with B and SIRT equipment since it opened in 1890. By 1949, there were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations on the line, with the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had waiting rooms and agents. The stations without waiting rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if there was someone waiting at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open for the morning and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Armoured Brigade was {{established}} in February 1943 {{as part of a}} reorganisation of the Australian Army's armoured units. As there was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> threat of Japanese forces invading Australia, the 2nd Armoured Division was disbanded to free up manpower for other purposes. However, it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division's 6th Armoured Brigade to command armoured units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific. This specialised formation was designated the 4th Armoured Brigade. The need for armoured support of infantry forces had been demonstrated by the Army's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, there was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded.|$|E

5|$|Radiohead {{were largely}} {{inactive}} following their 1997–1998 tour; after its end, their only public performance in 1998 {{was at an}} Amnesty International concert in Paris. Yorke later said that during that period the band came close to splitting up, {{and that he had}} developed severe depression. In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a follow-up to OK Computer. Although the album's success meant there was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> pressure or a deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke experienced writer's block, influencing him toward a more abstract, fragmented form of songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their newly completed studio in Oxford. Eventually, all the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles. After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.|$|E
5|$|Sweden {{had just}} lost one third of its population, as Russia had conquered the eastern part and created the Grand Duchy of Finland out of it during the Finnish War in 1808–1809. Shortly after, in 1814, the west flank had been secured by the {{personal}} union with Norway, and after the Napoleonic Wars, the former main enemy of Sweden in the south, Denmark, was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> threat. The only threat left was Russia, which now stood {{just across the border}} in the north, and had possession of the Åland Islands less than 150km from the Swedish capital Stockholm. The Swedish Navy was considered superior to the Russian in the Gulf of Bothnia, so a seaborne invasion against the coast of Norrland was not likely. And even though the Russians had invaded northern Sweden via Finland in the previous war, the general opinion was that in case of a new war, their main attack would be conducted towards Stockholm and southern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Abir Congo Company (founded as the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company {{and later}} {{known as the}} Compagnie du Congo Belge) was a company that {{exploited}} natural rubber in the Congo Free State, the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium. The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company {{changed its name to}} the Abir Congo Company and changed its residence for tax purposes to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of rubber obtained from a relatively rare rubber vine. The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels.|$|E
