40|$|Information {{exchange}} between patients and health professionals {{is fundamental to}} achieving patient participation in decision-making and shared decision-making is said to require the exchange of "all information relevant to decision-making". This paper reports on a qualitative investigation of instances in which information that was potentially relevant to decision-making was not exchanged in consultations. Consultations from 5 diverse clinical areas in the UK were video-recorded and the health professionals and patients involved were interviewed separately before and after their consultations. This analysis is based on cases involving 20 patients. It draws on data from their 26 -recorded consultations and from the 137 associated interviews. Several strategies were used to identify instances in which patients and/or health professionals did not disclose information that was potentially relevant to decision-making. Analysis focussed on the types of information not disclosed, the reasons that health professionals and patients gave for non-disclosure, and the apparent or potential significance of the non-disclosure. We identified 34 instances of <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> relating to the patient's problem and 52 instances of <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> relating to treatment or management options. The types of information not disclosed were diverse and the reasons given for non-disclosure varied. Some, but not all, instances of non-disclosure had negative implications {{for the quality of}} decision-making and/or the patient's healthcare experience. Our findings have implications for future attempts to examine information exchange in consultations [...] whether for research or for professional assessment purposes. In particular, they highlight the importance of appraising instances of <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in context and of recognising the limitations of approaches that rely on single consultations and/or single perspectives for assessments of information exchange.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} two {{topics in}} Japanese medical ethics: <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>information</b> by Japanese physicians, {{and the history}} of human rights abuses by Japanese physicians during World War II. These contrasting issues show how culture shapes our view of ethically appropriate behavior in medicine. An understanding of cultural context reveals that certain practices, such as withholding diagnostic information from patients, may represent ethical behavior in that context. In contrast, nonconsensual human experimentation designed to harm the patient is inherently unethical irrespective of cultural context. Attempts to define moral consensus in bioethics, and to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable variation across different cultural contexts, remain central challenges in articulating international, culturally sensitive norms in medical ethics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Intellectual capital (IC) {{relevant}} information {{is an important}} aspect of the reporting process because it complements the conventional financial disclosure in the new economy. It describes the hidden assets of a company especially in the initial public offering (IPO) setting where high information asymmetry exists. This study investigates several variables that may contribute to the relatively low level of IC disclosures in the IPO prospectus using the maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian of the Tobit regression models. The sample of this study consists of 112 randomly selected companies seeking a listing in the Bursa Malaysia between 2004 and 2008. The results provide evidence that board size, board independence, leverage and listing board significantly affect the extent <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> IC <b>information</b> in a company’s IPO prospectus. Conversely, the study finds no significant association with board diversity, age, size, underwriter and auditor type. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} recent judicial {{expansion of}} criminal liability for sexual fraud. This has occurred through the criminalisation of words or conduct considered to amount to ‘active deception. ’ In contrast, <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> does not attract criminal liability. The article argues that (i) {{the distinction between}} active deception and <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> provides an inadequate basis for setting the parameters of criminal liability for sexual fraud, and (ii) the distinction is vulnerable to analytical collapse and therefore criminal law overreach. In relation to (i), five justifications for reliance on the distinction will be considered and rejected. These are that criminalisation of active decep-tion is less offensive to principles of liberty and causality than criminali-sation of non-disclosure and that active deception is more morally cul-pable, involves a greater violation of sexual autonomy and/or is more harmful than non-disclosure. In developing this argument the article will draw on examples of sexual intimacy {{where one of the}} parties is HIV+. In relation to (ii), the article will focus on application of the distinction to ‘gender fraud’ claims. The example is a useful one because it serves to dramatise the problem of judicial slippage between active deception and non-disclosure...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{traditional}} view that parties involved in commercial negotiations are entitled to keep their cards close to their chest. Such a view holds that, {{in the absence of}} any fiduciary relationship or obligations of utmost good faith, parties are entitled to operate on the basis of advancing their own interests. They are free to conduct investigations to determine and verify legal, accounting and general business information. Any other matters are generally seen to be at the risk of the parties. But while this view is often expressed by the courts, negotiating parties and their lawyers need to be aware of the extent to which it is under challenge from developments in the law relating to matters such as misleading and deceptive conduct, negligent misstatement, equitable estoppel, unconscionable conduct, and even the rules on professional ethics.

40|$|Transparency {{underlies}} WTO {{models of}} trade and market models of corporate governance. The disclosure of information produced by listing is claimed to be necessary so Chinese state owned banks can compete with foreign banks, meeting China’s WTO obligations. Events in the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Holdings Ltd (BOCHK) in 2003 show that information disclosure to share markets is an imperfect way to efficiently manage corporate capital. The sudden removal from Hong Kong to Beijing of the BOCHK’s CEO and the <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about it reveals its weaknesses. Disclosure focused on media, rather than regulatory, requirements. The opacity formed by the coincidence of state power and ownership in mainland China and the jurisdictional boundary with Hong Kong was increased in Hong Kong by the investor relations professionals. Information came to be manipulated by the bank’s investor relations advisers. The ostensible openness of the bank was used by regulators to justify further inaction. Rather than increasing transparency the BOC(HK) experience suggests that {{the economic and political}} power of Chinese companies, and their state shareholders, may lead to less transparency outside mainland China...|$|E

40|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} adopted {{as a measure of}} counter-terrorism law in many jurisdictions. It has been authorised under the Security Certificate regime in Canada and the Control Order regime in United Kingdoms. Since their adoption, the two regimes have become objects of much debate. The reason is that they both legalised the use of secret evidence and secret hearings in their prosecution. The issue arose whether the <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> such <b>information</b> in a judicial review to decide the reasonableness of a control order/a security certificate deprives terrorist suspects from a fair hearing. This paper explores that question by analysing two landmark cases in the United Kingdom and Canada: AF (No 3) and Charkaoui I. The paper’s thesis is that the findings of the courts in these two cases are reasonable. However, the alternative to full disclosure as adopted by both the United Kingdom and Canada – the Special Advocate model – is currently too limited. This paper subsequently offers solution for this: the judges should have {{a more active role in}} investigating the relevant facts of the cases...|$|R

Surprisingly, the equilibrium has a simple structure; strategic <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (i. e., pooling) only takes the form of non-participation in the early auction by bidders with valuations below a threshold, while bidders with valuations above the threshold participate and bid truthfully; that is, they stay in the auction until the price reaches their true valuations. The participation threshold is strictly higher than the reserve price in the first auction, so some buyers who would find it profitable to buy at the reserve price select not to participate in order to attempt to decrease the reserve price in the second auction. Participation in the first auction is lower than under full commitment, but the probability of at least one bidder participating in the second auction is higher...|$|E

Most patients wanted to receive basic information about their medication, alternatives for the prescribed medication and side effects. Some patients did not need basic information or explicitly mentioned that information about side effects would negatively influence their attitude towards medication.

The authors analyzed a total of 522 required case reports on ethical dilemmas experienced by interns from September 1995 to May 1999 at the medical school of Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. They identified four regularly described and numerous less frequently described topics. The interns addressed {{a wide range of}} ethical themes. In 45 % of the cases, they mentioned disclosure or <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and informed consent; in 37 %, medical decisions at the end of life; in 16 %, medical failures; and in 9 %, problems transferring patients from one caregiver to another. The interns also identified 27 themes linked to their unique position as interns and 19 themes related to specific types of patients. Based on self-reported experiences, the authors conclude that clinical ethics teachers should reflect on a multitude of dilemmas. Special expertise is required with respect to end-of-life decisions, truth telling, medical failures, and transferring patients from one caregiver to another. The clinical ethics curriculum should encourage students to voice their opinions and deal with values, responsibilities, and the uncertainty and failings of medical interventions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Withholding {{information}} from cancer patients {{is a common}} practice in many Asian countries, including China, Japan, and Singapore, {{as well as in}} some Western countries, such as Spain, Greece, and Italy. Much research has investigated why doctors withhold {{information from}} cancer patients generally, both in the West and the East, but little research has been done on specifically why Chinese doctors withhold such information. Methods: Three focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 16 oncologists in China. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated. Qualitative data were analyzed using systematic text condensation. Results: The result of this study revealed numerous circumstances that can lead to <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> cancer-related <b>information.</b> Many <b>of</b> these circumstances have been described in previous studies about non-disclosure in other countries. We found two additional circumstances that have not been described in previous literature and might therefore expand our current knowledge about this phenomenon; they are contradiction between laws and fear for personal safety.

The findings of this study suggest further assessment and clarification about the laws that govern doctor-patient communication and that action should be taken to ensure safe working environments for Chinese oncologists. </p...|$|R

The <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> useful quantified <b>information</b> regarding the firms’ environmental and social responsibilities suggests that, firms do not voluntarily provide information beyond their specific administrative obligation regarding its CSR. Yet this disclosure is expected by the (potential) investors as they would need detailed and quantified information to evaluate rigorously the environmental impact of the firms, and especially that of the agribusinesses in our case of which the profitability is so closely linked to their natural environment.

40|$|In CIA v. Sims, the United States Supreme Court {{held that}} the CIA could {{withhold}} information about controversial government-sponsored psychological experiments in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The Court reasoned that the requested information would reveal intelligence sources related to national defense, which were specifically protected from disclosure under the National Security Act of 1947. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the CIA could refuse to disclose the information under FOIA Exemption 3, which allows withholding of information “specifically exempted from disclosure by statute. ” Numerous scholars assailed Sims, arguing that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s broad reading of the National Security Act gave the CIA carte blanche to withhold information and operate with no accountability. Sims 2 ̆ 7 implications, however, go far beyond giving the CIA the ability to conceal its activities from scrutiny. Sims relied, in part, on a controversial theory known as mosaic theory [...] {{the notion that the}} government may withhold otherwise trivial or innocuous information because it might prove dangerous if combined with other information by a knowledgeable actor (especially a hostile intelligence agency). Reliance on mosaic theory expands the universe of exempt information and often leads to <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that otherwise would have been disclosed.

40|$|In {{clinical}} trials, {{the need}} to obtain patient’s consent by way of informed consent has been mandatorily imposed {{as a way to}} protect the patient as subject. Unfortunately, many {{studies have shown that the}} doctor-investigators had failed to disclose full information to patients. Hence, the aim of this paper is to examine the factors for <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> by doctor-investigator and provide potential solutions to the problem. This study employed a mixed-method data collection that is library research and interview. A qualitative methodology and analysis were used in an open-ended, face-to-face interviews with 12 patients recruited to participate in a trial to investigate drug for chemotherapy and schizophrenia. This study reveals that doctor-investigators fail to disclose information due to the absence of monitoring by the ethics committees and that the Good Clinical Practice Training Curriculum (GCPTC) is too basic and almost introductory and the attitude of the patient that put high hopes on doctor investigators. Hence, random monitoring by the ethics committees and monitoring using video tape during the informed consent process are recommended. In addition, GCPTC needs to be improvised and further enhanced by inserting topic on the differences of objective between medical treatment and clinical trials and topic on infamous conduct according to Code of Profesional Conduct 1987 (CPC). In addition, a framework model in respect of information disclosure is also proposed by incorporating several new clauses in the CPC equivalent to the requirements of internationally recognized rights of patient as subject...|$|E
40|$|The Common European Sales Law (CESL) {{sets the}} {{conditions}} in which the mistaken party is entitled to rescission and compensation from the other party. Some of the CESL 2 ̆ 7 s provisions, however, are inconsistent with efficiency. First, under the CESL, as long as the mistake is essential, for the mistaken party to be allowed to rescind the contract, it is sufficient that the other party caused the mistake. From an efficiency perspective, however, causation is not enough to allow rescission for mistake. Second, the CESL permits rescission when one party failed to disclose information to the other party that would have revealed to the latter his essential mistake and the former party knew or could be expected to have known the mistake. In contrast, under efficiency, not all essential mistakes made by the one party that the other party knew or could have known about constitute grounds for rescission. Third, the CESL allows rescission for fraud, which includes <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> The CESL provides a list of considerations that should be taken into account in deciding whether a duty of disclosure arises. In contrast, under efficiency, there are far more concrete guidelines for determining whether a duty of disclosure arises, and in fact, under certain conditions, intentional (2 ̆ 2 fraudulent 2 ̆ 2) misrepresentations are even permitted. Fourth, the CESL allows a contract to be rescinded when both parties made the same essential mistake.
