500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1967, it was decided the Christmas Candle would be renamed the Peace Candle, because the city planned to sell Christmas cards {{depicting}} the structure and hoped Easton would become known as [...] "the Peace Candle city". On October 18, the city's businesses issued a statement, [...] "Whether you choose {{to call it a}} Christmas Candle or a Peace Candle is not important. The important aspect is that the Candle is our clarion call, and this call will be issued this year as a reaffirmation of our desire for peace and harmony in all facts of our lives and throughout the world." [...] On November 27, 1967, about 1,500 people attended the Peace Candle lighting, which would prove to be the final ceremony of its kind for that incarnation of the candle, which would be rebuilt in subsequent years. The bells of six different downtown churches were rung during the ceremony, and people surrounded the Peace Candle holding lit wax candles themselves. Also in 1967, a photo and caption of the Peace Candle was featured in the December 6 issue Weekly Reader, a national children's <b>newspaper</b> <b>circulated</b> in the nation's schools. A columnist for the magazine named [...] "Aunt Em" [...] said it was featured because, [...] "I think the candle in Easton is especially lovely since it is a symbol for both Hanukkah and Christmas". Appeared on December 6, 1967.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1940s {{assemblies}} in Egypt {{had been}} extended into Suez, Tanta and Sohag. During this period of growth pioneers went beyond the Middle East to Scotland. A public lending library was established in Cairo to satisfy inquires being made but anti-Bahá'í pamphlets were published and posted in Tanta instigating violence and individuals in other cities were actually attacked. Opposition began to reach out from Egypt in the form of article in an Egyptian Daily <b>newspaper</b> <b>circulated</b> in the United States published a story subtitled [...] "Necessity of a Moslem Cultural Center in America to Inform the Americans of the True Moslem Cult." [...] And attacks in Tanta escalated to the point that a government official publicly addressed the summoned ringleaders saying [...] "Your evil deeds have shown you to be far removed from the teachings of Islám for Islám is a religion of peace" [...] and made them sign a statement of good behavior. In May 1948 Shoghi Effendi announced goals for the Egyptian Bahá'í community evolving increasing the number of assemblies, smaller groups of Bahá'ís, and purchases of lands. A number of events and incidents brought the religion to the awareness of diverse audiences. There were formal representations from the Egyptian Bahá'í community to the government, invitations to Egyptian leaders and random incidents and in the public media. There were specific developments in the community in 1951. An assembly was established in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, and it was announced that the Egyptian Government had given recognition to Bahá'í marriages. At this time women were allowed to be and were elected according to the rules of Bahá'í administration to local assemblies in Cairo, Alexandria, and Port Said, (indeed some were elected officers in 1952.) Also publishing Bahá'í material resumed which had been curtailed for a time. And a wave of pioneers left Egypt in 1951 for North and Central Africa (see Bahá'í Faith in Uganda for a start.) ...|$|E
