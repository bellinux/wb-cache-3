25|$|Native American individuals, {{tribes and}} {{organizations}} have been questioning {{the use of the}} name and image for decades. In the 1940s the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate <b>negative</b> <b>stereotyping</b> of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports. The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people, and demean their native traditions and rituals. The NCAI issued a new report in 2013 summarizing opposition to Indian mascots and team names generally, and the Washington Redskins in particular.|$|E

500|$|Thomas {{argues that}} the world of Thunderbirds {{is similar to the}} 1960s to the extent that {{contemporary}} capitalism and class structures appear to have survived mostly intact. He also observes, however, that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths. According to Thomas, a contributing factor to the series' lasting popularity is the realism of IR's machines. Newman, for his part, suggests that [...] "the point isn't realism. The 21st century of Thunderbirds is detailed... but also de-populated, a high-tech toyland". He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values, noting the [...] "square, almost 50s" [...] attitudes to race, gender and class. With regard to stereotyping, Hood comments that he [...] "would be happier if [...] didn't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation". Cull, by contrast, considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race, arguing that it rejects <b>negative</b> <b>stereotyping</b> through the use of [...] "positive non-white characters" [...] such as Kyrano and Tin-Tin. However, he deems many of the one-off villains derivative, commenting that these characters are typically presented as [...] "corrupt businessmen, spivs and gangsters familiar from crime films".|$|E

Such negative images are frequently used in an attempt to shame males into behaving more positively." [...] Meriton stated that the practice of <b>negative</b> <b>stereotyping</b> ignores the fact that such negative behaviours do not apply to the vast majority of men and boys, or that such negativity may detrimentally impact the self-image and self-esteem of boys, which in turn impacts their willingness to contribute to building better relationships and communities as they grow into adults. In conclusion he stated that [...] "International Men's Day calls for and promotes positive masculinity which we in Seychelles can strongly identify with as it forms part of the social renaissance campaign launched {{at the beginning of the}} year by President James Michel." ...|$|E

This questionnaire is based on the Palmore Questionnaire (Palmore, 1988) and the Montorio and Izal questionnaire (Montorio & Izal, 1991). It consists of 15 items in the original form, corresponding to <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> of old age, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The first psychometric study was conducted with a sample of 757 noninstitutionalized elderly between the ages of 65 and 96  years old. The analysis showed three factors (health, motivational-social, and character-personality), which can vary between 5 and 20 points with higher scores indicating a high degree of belief in <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about old age and low scores indicating a weak belief in <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> regarding old age.|$|R

Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task. They found that African Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words associated with relevant <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> (e.g., completing [...] "__mb" [...] as [...] "dumb" [...] rather than as [...] "numb").|$|R

On October 4, 2014, lawyers for Michael Jagodzinski, a mining foreman in West Virginia, announced a lawsuit against his former employer, Rhino Eastern, for discrimination based on national origin.

As part of a January 2016 settled consent decree, Jagodzinski will receive monetary relief.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Research {{has shown}} that the threat of <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> can have pernicious effects on the {{decision-making}} thoughts and behaviors for those who are targets (Steele, 2011). When college students and professors subscribe to stereotypes that student-athletes enter college based solely on their physical abilities rather than their academic and intellectual capabilities, targets of the stereotypes may experience identity dissonance that exacerbates their decisions, behaviors, and ultimately their academic performance. In light of the impact of <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> on student-athlete performance, the purpose of this dissertation was to conduct a phenomenological, qualitative study that examined how Black male football players engage and cope with <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> at a predominantly White institution (PWI). Data was collected and analyzed from semi-structured interviews with 10 Black male football student-athletes employing grounded theory methodology to examine how they experience, are affected by, and respond to <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> Empirical results elucidate various strategies employed to engage with stereotype threat. Thematic categories include responses that exacerbated, habituated to, or mitigated the stereotype encounter. The current study investigates the successful coping strategies Black football players currently use. Emergent themes gained from this inquiry helped the researcher identify specific harbingers for interventions that would inculcate Black male student-athletes with tools to mitigate <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> that may undermine their performance in college and all areas of life. Implications are further discussed for postulating an institutionalized workshop series designed to teach effective coping mechanisms for all Black athletes...|$|R
