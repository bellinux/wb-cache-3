5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by <b>neoliberalism,</b> which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as <b>neoliberalism</b> was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E

5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and <b>neoliberalism</b> since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming <b>neoliberalism</b> for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

It argues that agency is the province of that subject.  </p...|$|R
25|$|Although the Progressive Conservative Party {{switched}} to <b>neoliberalism,</b> the party did retain its social progressive policies unlike other parties which advocated <b>neoliberalism.</b> Mulroney {{and the government}} pursued an aggressive environmental agenda under the aide of then-environmental policy advisor, present-day Green Party leader Elizabeth May. Mulroney {{and members of the}} U.S. government sparred over action on acid rain. In the end Mulroney managed to convince U.S. President Ronald Reagan to sign an acid rain treaty, to reduce acid rain.

Notwithstanding this, if digital technologies continue to be proposed {{as a means to}} advance the marketisation of HE, then it is likely that pedestrian, potentially inequitable, and even pedagogically harmful, implementations of digital technologies in HE will persist. Furthermore, any capacity that digital technologies might have if their application was focused on issues that they might actually be able to address are unlikely to be realised.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, when the {{break-up}} {{of the soviet}} bloc spread to the Balkans, dominant neoliberal economic wisdom recommended swift privatization of public assets, deregulation, and dismantling of the social safety net. Building upon the research of one of <b>neoliberalism’s</b> leading architects, this paper examines why enacting neoliberal economic and social policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina have led to outcomes contrary to those predicted by traditional neoliberal theory. We conclude by offering five policy recommendations that should, when enacted, reduce market distortions and yield significant economic growth...|$|R

25|$|Between 1933 and 1939, federal {{expenditure}} tripled, and Roosevelt's critics {{charged that}} he was turning America into a socialist state. The Great Depression was a main factor {{in the implementation of}} social democracy and planned economies in European countries after World War II (see Marshall Plan). Keynesianism generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s, when Milton Friedman and other neoliberal economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of <b>neoliberalism</b> and incorporated them into the Chicago School of Economics as an alternative approach to the study of economics. <b>Neoliberalism</b> went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policy-making in the United States, having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States, and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|This essay explores <b>neoliberalism’s</b> predatory practices, both {{global and}} local, which {{are at work}} to {{dissolve}} democracy, by enslaving its citizens, demobilizing the working class, subordinating knowledge and cultural workers and reduced the role of education to corporate-style managerialism and maximization of profit (Levidow, 2001).

We argue that contrary to claims of shared restraint and the pressing need for public austerity, Premier McGuinty’s Liberal’s have re-branded and re-packaged core neoliberal policies in such a manner that costs are socialized and profits privatized, thereby intensifying class polarization along with its racialized and gendered diversities...|$|R
40|$|The Palestinian statehood-by- 2011 program, framed through {{neoliberal}} institution building, redefines and diverts the Palestinian liberation struggle. Focusing on {{its economic}} aspects, {{and in particular}} the underlying neoliberal thought that goes beyond narrow economic policy applications, this essay argues that the program cannot succeed either as the midwife of independence or as a strategy for Palestinian economic development. Its weaknesses, the authors contend, derive not only from <b>neoliberalism’s</b> inability to deliver sustainable and equitable economic growth worldwide, but also because neoliberal “governance” under occupation, however “good,” cannot substitute for the broader struggle for national rights nor ensure the Palestinian right to development. ...|$|R

40|$|In Southern Africa {{the last}} ten years have seen a rather {{dramatic}} shift in donor and state interest and funding from ‘community conservation’ to ‘transfrontier conservation’. The new trend broadens the aim of conservation – development interventions to also include interstate cooperation. The article critically analyzes this development within a wider shift in neoliberal politics. It is argued that this broader shift helped create the right ‘enabling environment’ for the transfrontier conservation discourse to be presented as an all-embracing and unifying ideological ‘model of meaning’. Moreover, underlying <b>neoliberalism’s</b> contemporary political conduct is a strong reassertion and the actual neoliberalisation of the state. It is this move that has truly enabled the ‘transfrontier’ to revive the telos of conservation in Southern Africa. ...|$|R

Positioning the show within <b>neoliberalism’s</b> faux feminism and superficial discourse of diversity, the article posits that the focus on the melodramatic struggles of real estate buyers in the reality genre of property TV brings to the fore anxieties and contradictions incited by the neoliberal imperatives to reframe the domestic sphere as real estate investment and normalize debt...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{across the}} social {{sciences}} are beginning to note that <b>neoliberalism’s</b> influence is no longer restricted to macroeconomic and social policies, but can now be detected in individuals’ behaviors, relationships, perceptions, and self-concept. However, psychologists lack a means of assessing neoliberal beliefs directly. We collected data from three samples of U. S. undergraduates to develop and test a measure of neoliberal ideology, the Neoliberal Beliefs Inventory (NBI). Using first exploratory and then confirmatory factor analysis, we devised a 25 -item measure that is both reliable and valid, at least within a particular demographic (i. e., U. S. traditionally-aged undergraduates). The NBI may help psychologists specify and analyze the role of neoliberal ideology in shaping human behavior and functioning...|$|R
