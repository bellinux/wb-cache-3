5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. <b>Nickel</b> <b>carbonyl</b> (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage.

5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonyl</b> complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E

Abstract: Submitted thesis deals with study of thin layers based on platinum and cerium oxides {{in order to}} use them in fuel cells with polymer membrane (PEM- FC). A set of samples with different amount of platinum was prepared by means of magnetron sputtering. Samples were investigated by X - ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and results were confronted with sputtering parameters. It was found out that chemical state of platinum is related to its amount in thin layer. The less platinum was contained in thin layer, the less amount of Pt 0 state was observed and amounts of Pt 2 + and Pt 4 + states increased. Furthermore the temperature stability of prepared layers in the interval from room temperature to 250 ◦ C was studied by means of XPS. The adsorption of carbon monoxide was measured by infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). Increasing degree of adsorption on sample probably related to platinum reduction with increased tem- perature was observed. Measurements of other samples were devaluated by strong contamination with <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonyls.</b> Keywords: PEMFC, cerium oxide, magnetron sputtering, XPS, CO adsorptio...|$|R

40|$|Adsorption of {{hydrogen}} (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on transition metals is {{of paramount importance}} for several (catalytic) processes. These include the purification of H 2 streams and the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, in which a mixture of H 2 and CO is converted to synthetic fuels. As a consequence, many studies into the binding of these two molecules on transition metals have been performed. Nevertheless, fundamental questions regarding the effects of metal particle size and electron density on adsorbate binding geometry, {{as well as on the}} effects of co-adsorption, remain. The research described in this Ph. D. thesis explores these questions, both experimentally and theoretically, by focusing on well-defined transition metal clusters in the gas-phase as model systems. The first part of the thesis deals with the adsorption H 2 on a variety of transition metal clusters. It is shown that the hydrogen binding sites are highly dependent on the metal, as well as on cluster size and that they are different for small clusters compared to extended surfaces. In addition, it is found that the first H 2 molecule to bind on a relatively unreactive Ni 4 + cluster, can bind molecularly, while it binds exclusively dissociatively on the reactive Ni 5 + and Ni 6 + clusters. In the second part of the thesis, investigations into the effects associated with co-adsorption of H 2 and CO are presented. These effects were studied by focusing on an early (vanadium) and a late (cobalt) transition metal as case studies. In case of vanadium it is found that co-adsorption of H 2 leads to a stabilization of CO against dissociation. This is shown to be predominantly a structural effect. In contrast, co-adsorption of H 2 is demonstrated to have a significant electronic effect on cobalt clusters. To explain the experimental observations, a model describing the cluster size and charge dependence of the binding of CO on transition metal clusters was extended to incorporate the co-adsorption of H 2. Each adsorbed hydrogen atoms lowers the electron density of the metal particle by 0. 09 - 0. 25 of an electron, depending on cluster size. In the last part of the thesis, the dependence of the adsorbate binding geometry on the charge state of the metal cluster is explored. For these studies, rhodium, cobalt, and <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonyls</b> were used as model systems. In case of the rhodium and cobalt carbonyls, the removal of an electron from a neutral complex leads to a destabilization of bridge bound CO ligands. This destabilization is shown to be due to the removal of an electron from an orbital that is bonding with respect to the bridge bound carbonyl groups...|$|R

They found that the resulting gas colored the gas flame of a burner in a greenish-yellowish color; when heated in a glass tube it formed a nickel mirror. The gas could be condensed to a colorless, water-clear liquid with a boiling point of 43 °C.

40|$|Abstract This thesis forms one of {{the final}} parts of an {{extended}} study on the hydrogen storage and generation properties of metal borohydrides. Manganese borohydride, Mn(BH 4) 2, {{which is expected to}} be formed by the mechano-chemical activation synthesis (MCAS) from a mixture of sodium borohydride, NaBH 4, and manganese chloride, MnCl 2, is the candidate explored in this thesis. The effect of catalytic additives graphene and ultrafine filamentary <b>carbonyl</b> <b>nickel</b> (Ni), in addition to lithium amide (LiNH 2) is also studied. The mixture of (2 NaBH 4 +MnCl 2) was ball milled in a magneto-mill. No gas release was detected. The XRD patterns of the ball milled mixture exhibit only the Bragg diffraction peaks of NaCl-type salt which {{on the basis of the}} X-ray diffraction results reported in the literature is possibly identified as a solid solution Na(Cl) x(BH 4) (1 -x), possessing a cubic NaCl-type crystalline structure. No presence of any crystalline hydride was detected by powder X-ray diffraction which clearly shows that NaBH 4 in the initial mixture must have reacted with MnCl 2 forming a NaCl-type by-product and another hydride that does not exhibit X-ray Bragg diffraction peaks. Mass spectrometry (MS) of gas released from the ball milled mixture during combined thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) experiments, confirms mainly hydrogen (H 2) with a small quantity of diborane gas, B 2 H 6. The Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectrum of the ball milled (2 NaBH 4 +MnCl 2) is similar to the FT-IR spectrum of crystalline manganese borohydride, c-Mn(BH 4) 2, synthesized by ball milling which strongly suggests that an amorphous a-Mn(BH 4) 2 hydride was formed. The catalytic additives of 5 wt. % graphene and ultrafine filamentary nickel added before ball milling significantly improved the dehydrogenation characteristics of the mixture. The addition of graphene suppressed the formation of B 2 H 6. The powder mixture desorbed ~ 3 wt. % H 2 after 24 hours at 120 °C. 5 wt. % lithium amide, LiNH 2, when added before ball milling changed the nature of the dehydrogenation reaction from endothermic to exothermic and almost completely eliminated the release of diborane. This powder mixture desorbed ~ 3 wt. % H 2 after 24 hours at 140 °C. The highlight of this work is the crystallization of likely amorphous Mn(BH 4) 2 produced after MCAS without additives during the subsequent filtration/extraction process and the generation of ~ 7. 5 wt. % of H 2 by this powder, which has never before been reported in literature...|$|R
