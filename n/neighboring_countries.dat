5|$|Rosas {{desired to}} {{recreate}} the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He aimed to build a powerful, republican state with Argentina placed at the center. The defunct Viceroyalty had shattered into several separate nations following the Argentine War of Independence {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century. To achieve reunification, the Argentine government needed to annex the three <b>neighboring</b> <b>countries</b> - Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay, as well as to incorporate a portion of the southern region of Brazil. Rosas first had to gather allies across the region who shared his vision. In some instances, this meant that he had to become involved in the internal politics of <b>neighboring</b> <b>countries,</b> backing those sympathetic to union with Argentina, and occasionally even financing rebellions and wars.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} young {{people living in the}} border area and their {{knowledge}} about the <b>neighboring</b> <b>country.</b> It investigates attitudes related to the image of the <b>neighboring</b> <b>country</b> among Finnish and Russian high school students from the border region of North Karelia (Finland) and the Republic of Karelia (Russia). The aim of research was to discover relation between students’ personal experience in visiting <b>neighboring</b> <b>country,</b> level of knowledge, stereotyped thinking and image of the <b>neighboring</b> <b>country.</b> The research applied quantitative method of survey. Altogether, there were distributed 222 questionnaires in both countries: 67 in Finland and 155 in Russia among 16 – 17 years old high school students. As a result, research findings indicate that the higher level of knowledge about the <b>neighboring</b> <b>country</b> suggests the lower level of stereotyped thinking towards it. Personal experience in visiting <b>neighboring</b> <b>country</b> has mostly positive impact on absence of stereotyped thinking and biased attitude towards the neighbor. However Russia is still viewed as a threat by the Finnish young people whereas Russian youth see Finland as a friendly and reliable neighbor...|$|R

The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in <b>neighboring</b> <b>countries.</b> Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders.

By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from <b>neighboring</b> <b>countries.</b> Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now commander-in-chief of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a gendarmerie headed by police chief Jean Izamo, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.|$|E
