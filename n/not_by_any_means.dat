The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the questions the monsters ask feel monotone due to how often they are repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system was fun. In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it to Final Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> an outstanding game, {{it was one of}} few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E

25|$|As {{would be}} expected, REBT argues that mental {{wellness}} {{and mental health}} {{to a large degree}} results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving. When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, likely to be more healthy, constructive and functional. This does <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December, orders came {{to move on}} to Trier Airfield, on the Moselle, {{about sixty}} miles from Preutin. The {{squadron}} flew their Salmsons on the receipt of the news.

It was at Trier that the 91st had its first opportunity to fly German aircraft turned over to the Allies, and for taking rides in the Fokker or the Pfaltz became a popular pastime. Christmas Day we spent at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men at two o'clock, to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm.

500|$|Carte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919–20, {{featured}} ten of {{the thirteen}} extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] These included Princess Ida, which had its first London performances since the original production. [...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. [...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. [...] All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation....

500|$|Larkin's posthumous {{reputation}} was deeply {{affected by the}} publication in 1992 of Anthony Thwaite's edition of his letters and, the following year, his official biography, Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life by Andrew Motion. These revealed his obsession with pornography, his racism, his increasing shift to the political right wing, and his habitual expressions of venom and spleen. In 1990, even before the publication of these two books, Tom Paulin wrote that Larkin's [...] "obscenity is informed by prejudices that are <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> as ordinary, commonplace, or acceptable as the poetic language {{in which they are}} so plainly spelled out." [...] The letters and Motion's biography fuelled further assessments of this kind, such as Lisa Jardine's comment in The Guardian that [...] "The Britishness of Larkin's poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the Selected Letters now make explicit". On the other hand, the revelations were dismissed by the novelist Martin Amis in The War Against Cliché, arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient. A similar argument was made by Richard Bradford in his biography on Larkin from 2005. Commenting on Letters to Monica ...|$|E
500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics.

Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now it looks as if it might not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> boring, but you do {{have to be in the}} mood to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, the {{relation}} between them quickly deteriorated, as Young began to feel {{that he was being}} denied due credit for his own [...] "first steps" [...] in the decipherment. Also, because of the tense political climate between England and France {{in the aftermath of the}} Napoleonic Wars, there was little inclination to accept Champollion's decipherments as valid among the English. When Young later read the published copy of the lettre he was offended by the fact that he himself was mentioned only twice, and one of those times being harshly critiqued for his failure in deciphering the name [...] "Berenice". Young was further disheartened by the fact that Champollion at no point recognized his work as having provided the platform from which decipherment had finally been reached. He grew increasingly angry with Champollion, and shared his feelings with his friends who encouraged him to rebut with a new publication. When by a stroke of luck a Greek translation of a well-known demotic papyrus came into his possession later that year, he did not share that important finding with Champollion. In an anonymous review of the lettre Young attributed the discovery of the hieratic as a form of hieroglyphs to de Sacy and described Champollion's decipherments merely as an extension of Åkerblad and Young's work. Champollion recognized that Young was the author, and sent him a rebuttal of the review, while maintaining the charade of the anonymous review. Furthermore, Young, in his 1823 An Account of Some Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature and Egyptian Antiquities, including the author's original alphabet, as extended by Mr. Champollion, he complained that [...] "however Mr Champollion may have arrived at his conclusions, I admit them, with the greatest pleasure and gratitude, <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> as superseding my system, but as fully confirming and extending it."(p.146).|$|E
