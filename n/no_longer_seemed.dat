5|$|The cathedral's {{original}} architect (commissioned by Bishop Augustin Henninghaus) {{designed a}} three-aisled Gothic church, but the World WarI conquest of Qingdao by the Japanese on November 16, 1914, {{put an end}} to the cathedral plans. The city reverted to Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China. The Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan-tung was renamed the Vicariate Apostolic of Yanzhoufu on December 13, 1924, and on February 22, 1925, the Apostolic Prefecture of Qingdao was established from its territory, with Bishop Georg Weig, SVD, appointed prefect on March 18 of that same year. On June 14, 1928, it was elevated to a Vicariate Apostolic. When construction resumed, the original Gothic plan <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> appropriate for the modern townscape of Qingdao. Father Alfred Fräbel designed the present neo-Romanesque structure, built during the tenure of Bishop Weig, who is entombed in the cathedral.|$|E

The decision in 1985 to declare Lëtzebuergesch (Luxembourgish) the national language was also a step in the affirmation of the country’s independence. In fact, the linguistic situation in Luxembourg was characterised by trilingualism: Lëtzebuergesch was the spoken vernacular language, German the written language, in which Luxembourgers were most fluent, and French the language of official letters and law.|$|E

This rift was partially healed and Tupper and Macdonald managed {{to work together}} during the negotiations with George Stephen's syndicate in 1880, but the men were no longer close, and Tupper <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> to be Macdonald's heir apparent. By early 1881 Tupper had determined that he should leave the cabinet. In March 1881 he asked Macdonald to appoint him as Canada's High Commissioner in London. Macdonald initially refused, and Alexander Tilloch Galt retained the High Commissioner's post.|$|E
25|$|During {{the weeks}} that followed, the British {{authorities}} became concerned that the Germans would retaliate in kind. When intelligence reported {{the arrival of a}} German paratroop battalion across the Channel, Rowe was given orders to move the unit with all haste. The task of finding a suitable site eventually fell to Spencer Freeman of the Emergency Service Organisation. Freeman began scouring lists of schools and partially completed hospitals by the Ministry of Works and Buildings, but none seemed suitable. While waiting out an air raid in Bristol, Freeman recalled someone having mentioned Malvern College. This had originally been set aside {{for the use of the}} Admiralty in case they were forced to leave London, but by this time the threat of invasion <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> immediate and the site was no longer needed for their use.|$|E

500|$|British {{timing was}} good. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first {{artificial}} satellite, on 4 October 1957, {{came as a}} tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action {{in response to the}} Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis. At the suggestion of Harold Caccia, the British Ambassador to the United States, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge. To do this, the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed. British information security, or the lack thereof, <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958. The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed on 3 July, and was approved by Congress on 30 July. Macmillan called this [...] "the Great Prize".|$|E
500|$|Views of Elgar's stature {{have varied}} {{in the decades}} since his music came to {{prominence}} {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. Richard Strauss, as noted, hailed Elgar as a progressive composer; even the hostile reviewer in The Observer, unimpressed by the thematic material of the First Symphony in 1908, called the orchestration [...] "magnificently modern". Hans Richter rated Elgar as [...] "the greatest modern composer" [...] in any country, and Richter's colleague Arthur Nikisch considered the First Symphony [...] "a masterpiece of the first order" [...] to be [...] "justly ranked with the great symphonic models – Beethoven and Brahms." [...] By contrast, the critic W. J. Turner, in the mid-twentieth century, wrote of Elgar's [...] "Salvation Army symphonies," [...] and Herbert von Karajan called the Enigma Variations [...] "second-hand Brahms". Elgar's immense popularity was not long-lived. After the success of his First Symphony and Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received but without the earlier wild enthusiasm. His music was identified in the public mind with the Edwardian era, and after the First World War he <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> a progressive or modern composer. In the early 1920s, even the First Symphony had only one London performance in more than three years. Henry Wood and younger conductors such as Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli championed Elgar's music, but in the recording catalogues and the concert programmes of the middle of the century his works were not well represented.|$|E

40|$|Michael Oakeshott’s early metaphysics, {{especially}} {{his account of}} the modes, have typically been read as entailing uncompromising positions in his later work, such as an “authoritarian” reading of Hobbes, a social “conservatism”, and a “libertarian” political philosophy. This thesis proposes a reading that conceives of the modes as “fluid” rather than absolutely separate, arguing that this allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the nuances of some Oakeshott’s later work. As a result, his reading of Hobbes <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seems</b> selective; his conservatism <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> reactionary; his opposition to substantive measures (e. g., the redistribution of wealth) <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seems</b> absolute...|$|R

2500|$|On West German television, {{the great}} American musicians were {{introduced}} to audiences during prime time. Around 1960, Western music producers' interest in recording musicians such as Wolfgang Lauth waned, as jazz music <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be a good}} sale. In 1964, Horst Lippmann had noted: [...] "The German record industry neglected all modern German jazz musicians and only occasionally presented records with amateur Dixieland bands in the area. No German record company seems to be prepared for the artistic obligation to publish modern German jazz appropriate as it is the case in the field of symphonic and chamber music." [...] Shortly thereafter, as if this appeal had been heard and had caused a new generation of jazz producers (such as Siegfried Loch, and Hans-Georg Brunner Schwer) to emerge, records by Klaus Doldinger, Albert Mangelsdorff, but also by Attila Zoller or Wolfgang Dauner came onto the market.|$|E
2500|$|Some 34,000 men {{served with}} the {{division}} under Allen, fighting for 195 consecutive days after landing in France on September 7, 1944. The division's first action came in October 1944 during the taking of Achtmaal and Zundert in the Netherlands. It then advanced through the Siegfried line to the Rhine River, crossing the Inde river into Cologne. Throughout his command of the division, Allen continued to display his independence and a hearty contempt for 'chickenshit' regulations that interfered with combat readiness, a trait which <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> to infuriate his superior officers. After the 104th Division had secured its new lines, Bradley, now commanding the U.S. 12th Army Group, arrived in Cologne, Germany, to meet with Allen, stating [...] "Terry, I'm pleasantly surprised to see these young Timberwolves of yours already ranked along with the First and the Ninth as the finest assault divisions in the ETO."

2500|$|Less impressed, Rolling Stone {{continued}} to regard Harrison in an unfavourable light after what Elliot Huntley terms its [...] "volte-face" [...] in 1974. The magazine's reviewer, Ken Tucker, noted {{the accessibility of}} [...] "fast, cheerful numbers" [...] such as [...] "Woman Don't You Cry for Me" [...] and [...] "This Song" [...] but lamented both [...] "George's persistent preaching" [...] elsewhere and that Scott's presence rendered the album as [...] "music with the feeling and sincerity of cellophane". NME critic Bob Woffinden admired Harrison's guitar playing but dismissed him as a lyric writer, before concluding: [...] "Harrison's general demeanour is more encouraging... While it is an album of no particular merit in itself, it is one which leads {{me to believe that}} his best work may not necessarily be behind him." [...] Four years later, however, Woffinden offered a more positive assessment, writing that [...] "His spiritual convictions <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> to be cramping his style, but affording him a generous and open heart. An excellent production and frequently inspired guitar work were amongst the other positive qualities which the album could boast." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crucially, {{he managed}} to secure the support of Carl T. Durham, the {{chairman}} of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with Congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to cooperate with all America's NATO allies, and not just Britain. Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO. While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from Senator Clinton P. Anderson failed to attract much support. On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes, and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator John O. Pastore, held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and Major General Herbert Loper, the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about nuclear proliferation. British information security, or the lack thereof, <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb, but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American plutonium, under which the US would pay the UK $30 per gram for plutonium that cost $12 per gram to produce.|$|E
2500|$|West's {{parents had}} her baptised into the Church of England {{two months after}} birth and she {{considered}} herself a Christian, though an unconventional believer. At times, she found God to be wicked; at other times she considered Him merely ineffectual and defeated. However, she revered Christ as the quintessentially good man, she had great respect for the literary, pictorial, and architectural manifestations of the Christian ethos, and she considered faith a valid tool {{to grapple with the}} conundrums of life and the mysteries of the cosmos. Although her writings are full of references to the Bible and ecclesiastical history, she was essentially anti-doctrinaire and occasionally blasphemous. In 1926 she expressed the unorthodox belief that [...] "Christianity must be regarded not as a final revelation but as a phase of revelation." [...] Moreover, she rejected specific articles of belief such as the virgin birth, Original sin, the Atonement, and Providence. Her contribution to Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Letters Series, Letter to a Grandfather (1933), is a declaration of [...] "my faith, which seems to some unfaith" [...] disguised as philosophical fiction. Written {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression, Letter to a Grandfather traces the progressive degeneration of the notion of Providence through the ages, concluding skeptically that [...] "the redemptive power of divine grace <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seemed</b> credible, nor very respectable in the arbitrary performance that was claimed for it." [...] As for the Atonement, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is in part meant as a refutation of that very doctrine, which she saw as having sparked a fatal obsession with sacrifice throughout the Christian era and, specifically, as having prompted Neville Chamberlain to formulate his policy of appeasement, which she vehemently opposed. She wrote:"All our Western thought is founded on this repulsive pretence that pain is the proper price of any good thing... developed a theory of the Atonement which was pure nonsense, yet had the power to convince... This monstrous theory supposes that God was angry with man for his sins and that He wanted to punish him for these, not in any way that might lead to his reformation, but simply by inflicting pain on him; and that He allowed Christ to suffer this pain instead of man and thereafter was willing on certain terms to treat man as if he had not committed these sins. This theory flouts reason at all points, for it is not possible that a just God should forgive people who are wicked because another person who was good endured agony by being nailed to a cross." ...|$|E
