It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father.

After Mero was introduced, Sable came out and told Mero that she did not <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to fight for her, insisting she would fight Mero. Mero then lay down and allowed Sable to pin him. However, he reversed the pin at a two count and rolled Sable into a small package, winning the match via pinfall. This forced Sable to leave the WWF.|$|E

[...] He wrote that [...] "Fan service doesn't erase the fact that Quiet is a strong, well-written character that doesn't <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to save her.

2500|$|Although Cheap Thrills {{sounded as}} if it {{consisted}} of concert recordings, like on [...] "Combination of the Two" [...] and [...] "I <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> to Love", only [...] "Ball and Chain" [...] was actually recorded {{in front of a}} paying audience; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings. The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a drinking glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song [...] "Turtle Blues". Cheap Thrills produced very popular hits with [...] "Piece of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Summertime". Together with the premiere of the documentary film Monterey Pop at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on December 26, 1968, the album launched Joplin's successful, albeit short, musical career. Cheap Thrills reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart eight weeks after its release, remaining for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks. The album was certified gold at release and sold over a million copies in the first month of its release. The lead single from the album, [...] "Piece of My Heart", reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the fall of 1968.|$|E
2500|$|Farmiga later {{withdrew from}} the project as she had become {{pregnant}} with her second child, and Riseborough replaced her. After Farmiga had declined the project, Madonna looked into many actresses, before zeroing on Riseborough, whom she had seen as a young Margaret Thatcher in the BBC film The Long Walk to Finchley. Madonna explained her choice: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} certain quality: something fragile, androgynous and yet feminine in a really old-fashioned way. When I saw Andrea, I knew immediately she was the one." [...] Cornish commented on her role as Winthrop, [...] "Madonna is a strong, independent woman who doesn't <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to define her– and that's admirable. She's studied every aspect of what happened with Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII. [...] It's a fascinating insight into class and romance. Madonna's created a contemporary woman—who I will play—called Wally, who is fascinated by what happened to Mrs. Simpson." [...] Madonna's daughter Lourdes was offered a part, but Madonna decided against the idea. However, she later allowed Lourdes to appear for a minor role in the film. The part she played was later confirmed by Cornish in an interview in March 2011 as the younger self of her character Wally Winthrop.|$|E
