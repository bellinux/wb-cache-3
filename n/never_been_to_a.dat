Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006. The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual, in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of the film was unprecedented and cinemas played the film for longer runs than usual, often to packed houses, while some arranged additional screenings to meet demand. The film {{is thought to have}} achieved attendance figures of twenty million in its first six weeks of release. The film also attracted more middle-class audiences, some of whom had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cinema before. William Jury, as the film's booking director, initially charged exhibitors £40, with the fee decreasing by £5 a week; after two months, a reduced fee of £6 for three nights put the film within the price range of village halls wishing to show the film. By October 1916, the film had been booked by more than two thousand cinemas in Britain, earning over £30,000.|$|E

[...] Marburger's conduct on the committee was praised by activists on both sides of the debate, with his focus on listening to all viewpoints and his ability to not take disagreements personally being especially noted.|$|E
500|$|Overall, the Clippers have {{qualified}} for the post-season twelve times; most recently in the 2015–16 season.

Additionally, the Clippers have never won league or Conference titles, let alone play in either title game in their 45-year history they have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Western Conference Finals, and the 30-year drought between winning a playoffs round is the longest in league history. They also have only eleven seasons with a winning percentage of [...]500 or better, and as a result, in their April 17, 2000 issue, the Sports Illustrated had three Clippers fans on the cover that stated [...] "The worst franchise in sports history". However, with the additions of Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, they made steady progress as a title contender in recent years. They won their first division title in the 2012-13 season, their 43rd year in the league, and repeated the following year. Chris Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets for eight players and a 2018 draft pick, after the 2017 season.|$|E

500|$|Two {{months prior}} to the Olympics, Lynch went to North America and competed in World Cup races in Canada and the United States. She then competed in the 1996 pre-Olympic cycle tour, winning one of the stages. Once she arrived at the Olympic Village in Atlanta, she was underwhelmed by the support she {{received}} from the cycling team; most had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mountain bike event. The team jersey was unsuitable for the heat and humidity. Her new bike had a hole in the bottom bracket and the neutral tech support insisting that she couldn't ride it. Her old frame was couriered over with two days to spare. Life in the village was unpleasant due to constant security checks, and athletes who had completed their event partying all night. Lynch moved out and shared accommodation with Jacqui Nelson in a suburb. Whilst this required a two-hour bus ride to the mountain bike venue, it made for a more pleasant stay and sufficient sleep. The mountain bike course overlapped with the equestrian venue and was not open for mountain bike training until two days prior to the race. Lynch ignored this and promptly ran into an American army unit looking for bombs and was arrested. After an hour's detention, one of the mountain bike officials verified that she was a competitor. The race day, 30 July, was the hottest of the Olympic Games, and the [...] laps were reduced to [...] Lynch settled into fifth place in the first lap, but crashed on one of the corners. A few riders went past and she continued in 12th place. In the third lap, the heat became unbearable, but Lynch had a CamelBak with frozen drink; one of the few riders to do so. She kept her pace as other riders struggled. She finished 8th, with two previous world champions behind her (Juli Furtado in 10th, and Silvia Fürst in 16th).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I begin {{by arguing that}} {{aesthetic}} terms cannot be used as metaphors and I end by arguing {{that the concept of}} an aesthetic property is analyzable in nonaesthetic terms. The beginning {{and the end of the}} paper are connected by a complex reasoning that can be summarized as follows: aesthetic terms cannot be used metaphorically because their applicability <b>is</b> <b>never</b> restricted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular category of objects (Section I); if the applicability of aesthetic terms <b>is</b> <b>never</b> restricted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular category of objects then a fortiori it <b>is</b> <b>never</b> restricted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> category of nonvisual objects; if the applicability of aesthetic terms <b>is</b> <b>never</b> restricted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> category of nonvisual objects, then all aesthetic terms <b>are</b> applicable <b>to</b> visual objects (Section II); if all aesthetic terms <b>are</b> applicable <b>to</b> visual objects, then all aesthetic properties can be exemplified by such objects; finally, if all aesthetic properties can be exemplified by visual objects, then for the purpose of analyzing the concept of an aesthetic property it suffices to analyze the concept of a visual aesthetic property (Section III) ...|$|R
