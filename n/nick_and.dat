5000|$|<b>Nicks</b> <b>and</b> Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in January 1975, {{six weeks}} after Keith Olsen played their track [...] "Frozen Love" [...] for drummer Mick Fleetwood, {{who had come to}} Sound City in California, in search of a studio to record Fleetwood Mac's next album. Fleetwood remembered Buckingham's guitar work when guitarist Bob Welch {{departed}} to pursue a solo career. On December 31, 1974, Fleetwood called Buckingham to ask him to replace Welch as guitarist, but Buckingham insisted that <b>Nicks</b> <b>and</b> he were [...] "a package deal." [...] A few days later, <b>Nicks</b> <b>and</b> Buckingham discussed the offer over dinner with Fleetwood and the McVies, and the feeling was mutual that incorporating the Buckingham-Nicks pair would improve Fleetwood Mac, making the British band into an Anglo-American one. The first rehearsals confirmed this feeling, with the harmonies of the newcomers adding a pop accessibility to the hard rock. Despite this development, the duo of Buckingham-Nicks was called to perform three sold-out dates in Birmingham, Alabama - the one area in which their album had seen success.
