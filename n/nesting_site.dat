5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose {{and covered in}} dung to support the bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of cash crops such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's <b>nesting</b> <b>site.</b> While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law.

I measured temperature in vireo breeding habitat at KWMA to determine the influence of vegetation characteristics on ambient temperature across sites.

5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests that they had a long-term colonial <b>nesting</b> <b>site</b> at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding separated them and deposited them vertically as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E
5|$|Group-living species {{tend to be}} {{communal}} group breeders. In {{addition to}} these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend {{to stay at the}} edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its <b>nesting</b> <b>site.</b> Most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site, but the Magellanic woodpecker and acorn woodpecker are cooperative roosters.|$|E

40|$|Selecting a <b>nest</b> <b>site</b> is an {{important}} decision for waterfowl. Because most nest failure is due to depredation, the primary selective pressure in choosing a <b>nest</b> <b>site</b> should be to reduce depredation risk. This task is difficult, however, because predators use differing tactics to locate nests, such as olfactory or visual cues. The purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate both the olfactory and visual components of waterfowl <b>nest</b> <b>site</b> selection and <b>nest</b> depredation in North Dakota. We located waterfowl nests, monitored them until termination (hatched or depredated), and collected both visual and olfactory concealment characteristics of <b>nest</b> <b>sites</b> and paired random sites in 2006 and 2007. Waterfowl <b>nest</b> <b>sites</b> and random sites did not differ in their olfactory concealment characteristics. However, waterfowl did select <b>nesting</b> <b>sites</b> with greater lateral concealment than random sites, a visual characteristic. The only difference found between successful and depredated nests consisted of lateral dispersion, an olfactory concealment characteristic. These results indicate that while waterfowl may select <b>nest</b> <b>sites</b> based on visual concealment characteristics, those characteristics were not predictive of nest success. Olfactory concealment characteristics may be more important for nest success in our study area because the dominant nest predators, including raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), primarily utilize olfactory cues to locate <b>nest</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good <b>nesting</b> <b>site</b> and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage.

5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established <b>nesting</b> <b>site,</b> showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate {{guarding}} {{during the period}} females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly {{on the side and}} following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a <b>nesting</b> <b>site.</b> The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.|$|E

Sedimentary structures indicate that the nesting area was in the vicinity of a lake.
