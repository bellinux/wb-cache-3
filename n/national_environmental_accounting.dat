40|$|Abstract OnlyThe World Bank has {{constructed}} wealth {{accounts for}} nearly 15 years, {{most recently in}} The Changing Wealth of Nations. The accounts include produced capital, natural capital and human and social capital. Natural capital includes agricultural land, forests, subsoil assets and protected areas, but omit a number of critical natural capital stocks, {{one of which is}} fisheries. This omission reflects the lack of readily available data for fisheries accounts at the country level for most, if not all countries in the world. In general, fisheries and aquatic resources are poorly represented in most <b>national</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> efforts. In a recent review of natural capital accounting in The Changing Wealth of Nations, only a few countries, i. e., New Zealand, Iceland and Norway, construct monetary asset accounts for fisheries on a regular basis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a model is put forward for setting targets for ecologically {{sustainable}} {{development in a}} region. A case study approach facilitates {{the development of the}} environmental impact model of Ehrlich and Holdren (1974). Targets for a region 2 ̆ 7 s population and water quality are discussed in some detail {{with the help of the}} model. The region, the far north of Queensland, Australia, is centred on the Cairns District, which is growing rapidly due to tourism. As well as exploring the environmental impacts of change in the interaction variables of population, consumption and technology, the article contains discussion on setting environmental rehabilitation targets. Major regional externalities would be removed by the achievements of regional water quality improvements. However, other externalities could be generated by the imposition of a limit on regional population.

As well, subsoil assets, timber for producing logs, and land are valued monetarily, and included on the non-produced assets in the National Balance Sheet. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is currently working with several other national departments on the <b>National</b> Plan for <b>Environmental</b> Information (NPEI), the State of the Environment Report, and planning for <b>national</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> is {{organized}} in three sub-disciplines: global, <b>national,</b> and corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting,</b> respectively. Corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> {{can be further}} sub-divided into <b>environmental</b> management <b>accounting</b> and <b>environmental</b> financial <b>accounting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several Australian {{organizations}} produce <b>national</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts.</b> The Australian Bureau of Statistics produces Water Account Australia and a pilot Land Account for the Great Barrier Reef, both {{of which}} are based on the SEEA framework. The Bureau of Meteorology produces a complementary National Water Account on the water available to be used. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency reports on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has created a trial, <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> model that can be applied to regions of any size. These regional accounts use a common unit of measurement, which allows comparisons to be made between different natural capital assets.

40|$|The {{crisis that}} affects {{enterprises}} has two salient features, {{the first of}} which concerns the transition phase we are going through and that will result in a market system, which has no precedent and that will need to develop ways to address enterprises that were never, or partly only, previously considered. We {{are in the process of}} transition to “modern sustainable” growth where “dissipative” growth, which considers profit as the main objective of companies, requires for the various countries a series of local and international interventions that are based mostly on the defense of resources at the time referred to as “nonrenewable. ” This over time has increased the focus on a particular aspect, which in the past had no relevance and that was included in the naming of nonrenewable resources. Currently, instead of the term that inspires even more concern always and above all for companies, increasing attention is given to the “common goods,” i. e., not only goods that belong to everyone and therefore potentially include nonrenewable resources but also goods that appear to be belonging to a nation or a territory, i. e,, energy sources, etc., which, paradoxically, instead involve the fate of all humanity. In the past there dwelt the reasoning about the advantages and disadvantages of globalization; the current status of this reasoning is useful, but it is no longer sufficient to guide business decisions, since globalization is a characteristic feature of all business decisions. These decisions are enriched with other important elements such as just the modern sustainable and common goods. What answers to give to these guidelines, which are critical for the survival of companies and the planet. The company’s objectives are enriched in their new carrier (or dusted) decision variables and the search for “better” becomes the object of measurement processes and communication. One such variable is the environmental variable. The impact of the environmental variable on the enterprise has changed considerably over time. In fact, in the past it was found to have a bearing mainly on the physical aspects of natural pollution. It also had a connotation of the negative impact on environment in the sense that the company was polluting and wanted to take into account this impact, and therefore, it was necessary to make improvements with appropriate long-term investments orthrough the incurrence of costs attributable to exercise to make up for the damage allegedly caused by the company. The current state of the art, the ecological variable is no longer considered only in terms of physical environment and only in terms of an overload of higher costs for the company, but it has recently developed the logic that the environment variable generates significant economic opportunities for both the company that takes care of it. The environmental variable is creating new business opportunities and employment. This concept is known as “business environment. ” This stems from the recognition that the “ecological bales,” such as plastic, paper, and glass, defined as recycled raw materials, are available at a lower cost and then at a lower final cost for the goods derived from them. It develops therefore a positive consideration of attention to the environment understood as direct impact and not just indirect impact on business activity. One can imagine a route that starts from a negative connotation of the environmental variable and gradually becomes more and more positive and reaches the opposite end which examines the excessive focus on the environment. This excessive attention to the environment could generate new activities arising from it, such as waste management. In this sense, the meaning of environmental management from the past is reversed, because the push towards an interest in the company was likely to create environmental variable increases, forward excessively oriented towards a profit resulting from the treatment of waste (!). The book develops an interesting scientific and practical path starting from the importance of the environmental variable to arrive at new and more all-encompassing measurement methods and communication of environmental, social, sustainable, and integral ones. These assessment methods and communication are increasingly necessary to develop and transmit information to guide the decisions of enterprises and stakeholders. Such information is also important to legitimize the enterprises’ activities in the context of globalization in order to build a sustainable modernity. Moreover, the information system must know how to identify (and reward) the ability of companies to create sustainable value and amend the behavior that undermines the sustainability. While in the past there dwelt the reasoning about the advantages and disadvantages of globalization, currently this reasoning is no longer sufficient to guide business decisions, which are (and must be) enriched by other important elements such as the “modern sustainability,” common goods, and the environmental variable which are critical for the survival of companies and the planet itself. The current state of the art, the ecological variable is no longer considered only in terms of physical environment and in terms of an overload of higher costs for the company, but it is also considered in terms of business environment. The logic that the environment variable generates significant economic opportunities for both the company and in the socio-economic context (local, national, and international context) has been developed recently. It is clear that the companies must adapt to the need to work on global markets, given the increasingly fierce competition, ever-dwindling natural resources, and the ever-increasing and new regulatory requirements for clean production. We show the variety and breadth of opportunities for environmental (and social) accounting and reporting. With this, we believe that the readers of this book from the circles of business will be convinced about the opportunities it provides in taking appropriate management decisions to improve the financial and reputational performance of the organizations. We hope that the critics and skeptics concerning the possibilities of environmental accounting will become less. We also believe that accounting colleagues in countries without systematic rules for <b>national</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> and reporting, who would read this book, may be convinced how important it is to create national standards for environmental accounting and reporting that can assist the management of the business. There is abundant experience in purely scientific research and in the practice of environmental accounting and reporting. These two aspects expect their new specific and creative application, adaptation, and enrichment, which is the inevitable future of laboratory science and business. All of our hopes are based on the conviction that the painful withdrawal of the “industrial wave” may become easier precisely by the efforts of the greening of human industrial and domestic activities and that “postindustrial society and postindustrial economy” are the world in which man belongs to nature, not nature to man. Environmental accounting and reporting in their tremendous diversity serve this new world to achieve the complex balance between the human well-being and the natural well-being—the symmetry between humans and the environment. Indeed, this book is the first attempt to show the business circles how to read the measurement methods and how to communicate them. It opens the way to new research questions and to new research fields, and we would be quite satisfied if we have been able to respond to the complex research questions, which we pose at the beginning of the work, that is: “What are the elements that must be taken into account as the foundation of the environmental decision-making process? We have tried to give a first response both from a theoretical point of view and from the practical point of view. ” New perspectives are in fact developing in the environment and enterprise administration, as a passage from Environmental reporting to Integrated reporting. These new challenges, the current state of the art, cannot find an exhaustive answer in terms of measurement and internal/external communication. Such new doctrinal and empirical orientations create an attractive perspective in economics and management research fields that may provide new challenges to accounting scholars...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} quantifies {{the extent}} to which the US has shifted the environmental impact associated with the goods it consumes to other countries through trade. To achieve this, we use a life-cycle, consumption-based approach to measure the environmental impacts embodied in US trade activities for global warming potential (GWP), energy, toxics, and the criteria air pollutants. We use these values to determine the amount of environmental impact “leaked” from current, production-based approaches to analyzing <b>national</b> <b>environmental</b> trends for the years 1998 – 2004. We find that in 2004, with reasonable assumptions about the environmental intensity of imports and exports, this leakage exceeds 10 % for all studied impacts, exceeds 20 % for GWP, energy, and most criteria air pollutants, and exceeds 80 % for lead emissions and toxics. By including the environmental impacts embodied in trade activities into <b>national</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts,</b> we provide consumption-based, US per capita, environmental impacts, which we use to evaluate the relationship between income and environmental impact.

This suggests that new regulation may run into local opposition. The incidence of a carbon tax correlates negatively with votes for the Green Party in the 2007 general election. Emissions from production are clustered around the cities but the spatial pattern is dominated by a small number of point sources (which are already regulated). Consumption emissions dominate total emissions in suburbs and the countryside. Production emissions dominate total emissions in the towns and cities as well as in those electoral districts that have a point source of carbon dioxide.

These mirror image couples are approximately just as reliable as the full average of all decomposition forms. Besides reliable results, the full average also foresees the mutual comparability between the distinguished change factors and is therefore applied in the empirical analyses presented in this paper. The results of these analyses contain the macro-economic developments, results on the industry level as well as a comprehensive overview of the origin and destination of pollution in the Dutch economy that includes the environmental consequences of consumption and international trade.

40|$|This paper reviews {{assessments}} of environmental impacts arising from consumption, {{taking into account}} the production and disposal of goods consumed. Assessments have mostly focused on understanding household consumption, but there is an increasing interest in understanding government consumption, {{as well as in the}} treatment of gross capital formation and trade. <b>National</b> economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts</b> are the most frequently used data source for such studies and input-output techniques are usually applied. For many OECD countries and a few developing countries, assessments address only energy or greenhouse gas emissions. Few studies address a broader range of emissions-related environmental impacts. There is a lack of consideration for important pressures on ecosystems such as habitat change and overexploitation of fisheries and forests. In all countries, housing and food are important. In poor countries, public services can contribute substantially, while in rich countries, mobility and the consumption of manufactured goods is important. In rapidly developing economies, investments, especially in infrastructure and buildings, are important causes of environmental pressure as well. Differences in production conditions and pollution intensities across countries are substantial, so explicitly modelling the production of internationally traded goods using multi-regional input-output analysis is necessary to account correctly for the environmental impacts arising from the consumption of imported goods.

First of all, <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> introduced a limitation in scale, which was inapplicable on a micro scale. A second restriction concerned the physical unit measure that was used instead of a monetary unit measure. Finally, a third limitation {{was related to the}} fact that <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> only takes costs into <b>account,</b> and not <b>environmental</b> benefits. These three limitations led us to develop an <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> model that considered both consumed and produced resources in the Natural Reserve. The model aimed at supplementing monetary accounting (based on cost and revenue) with <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting,</b> which not only reflects environmental cost, but also environmental revenue; i. e. environmental benefit.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which Portuguese local {{entities}} have implemented a set of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices, and to analyse some potential determining factors of their use. Design/methodology/approach – The data were collected by sending a postal questionnaire to a sample of medium-sized and large city councils and the municipal companies belonging to those municipalities. Three variables were considered as possible factors that drive the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in the local public sector. Findings – The degree of development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in Portuguese local entities is low. Organisational size and the degree of development of environmental management practices are positively and statistically related to the level of development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices. However, the findings suggest that the existence of compulsory <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> standards is not positively associated with the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices by Portuguese local entities. Research limitations/implications – The study limits itself to Portugal and, therefore, its results could not be applicable in other settings. Practical implications – Portugal is experiencing a phase of development of regulatory environmental disclosure requirements. Understanding the <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> and reporting practices currently developed by Portuguese local entities, as well as their drivers, may help regulators to develop more suitable standards for the sector. Originality/value – The majority of empirical studies on <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in public organisations are focused largely on an Anglo-Saxon context. This paper attempts to address this gap in the literature by providing a snapshot of the <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices developed by Portuguese local entities. <b>Accounting,</b> <b>Environmental</b> management, Local government, Portugal...|$|R

First they could adopt a {{research}} agenda to address <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> issues {{which might be}} able to be solved in an Industry 4.0 setting and, second, they could explore ways in which <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> education could be improved. The research agenda could consider how external <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> and <b>environmental</b> management <b>accounting</b> could piggy-back on the potential of Industry 4.0 for providing new, more accurate, better quality, real time physical and monetary data about businesses.|$|R
