Through an analysis that utilized a Gestural Response Instrument (GRI) it was determined that, even if the use of verbal and facialcues were eliminated, some experienced conductors successfully utilized <b>non-verbal</b> <b>conducting</b> gestures to communicate specific musical interpretations. It appeared that musicians responded in specific ways to the musical interpretation of conductors who had command of a variety of conducting gestures. The results illustrated the existence of a perceptual contract that facilitates the non-verbal communication expressed through gestural conducting.

For the context of team decision-making, we identify two potentially beneficial micro-level leadership behaviours, question asking and behavioural mimicry. Specifically, we propose that under conditions of informational complexity and unshared information, participative leadership is most appropriate for team decision-making, that its effects are mediated by inquiring and empathy, and that question asking and mimicry are the behavioural micro-level manifestations of inquiring and empathy. We thus hypothesize that the effect of participative leadership on team decision quality and leader evaluation is mediated by question asking and mimicry. We conduct a laboratory experiment with student teams working on a hidden profile decision-making task and measure question asking through behavioural coding and mimicry with motion sensors. Results show that the effect of participative leadership on decision quality is mediated by question asking, and that the effect of participative leadership on leader evaluation as transformational is mediated by leaders’ behavioural mimicry and question asking.

The court stated that although the process of tattooing is considered <b>non-verbal</b> <b>conduct</b> that can express certain ideas, such expression is not sufficiently imbued with elements of communication and therefore cannot receive First Amendment protection. The process of tattooing was not considered pure expressive activity or expressive conduct. Failing to reach either of these statuses, Judge Christina Snyder reviewed the zoning statute by applying the rational basis test. The court found that the municipal ban on tattoo parlors was valid because the regulation was rationally related to the city’s interest of protecting the public from potential health risks associated with the tattooing process.|$|E

The paper addresses two research questions: (1) How is music therapy with a non-verbal child perceived by music therapy professionals? (2) How does sharing these professionals’ understanding of music therapy improve the MTS’s understanding of this therapeutic process? The MTS’s self-reflections were treated as part of the data in this research, as was the non-verbal communication within the music therapy intervention to support the findings. The qualitative research, ‘Naturalistic inquiry’ was used for this research. Data was collected by interviewing these three professionals individually about their perceptions of music therapy after watching three video extracts of normal music therapy sessions with the child. The video extracts were selected from the significant moments of non-verbal communication. Through this process of sharing the professionals’ perceptions, the MTS gained a deeper understanding of both the child and the music therapy practice administered, confirming and extending her understanding of the musical and therapeutic skills and techniques of the three professionals, which they had gained in their varied experiences and which had been shaped by their varied backgrounds. The MTS was thus engaged in a learning process which hoped would enhance the quality of therapy provided by her in the future...|$|R
40|$|What Toscanini {{said about}} {{conducting}} {{could be said}} about leadership. There are those who merely manage {{and those who are}} master leaders who “make music ” with their organizations. Like a conductor, an executive is at once both a leader and an artist – directing the actions of others towards a goal. This goal is not simply one of creating a product – it is the goal of expressing the human experience {{in a way that will}} benefit the quality of life. This is music. This is leadership. A “maestro ” is defined as a “master of an art. 2 ” It is a term usually reserved for master conductors, and is used as a term of respect. However, as leadership itself is an art 3, it would seem logical to assume that there are master leaders, who might also be appropriately called “maestro. ” Literature on leadership often consists of metaphors 4. The orchestral conductor as a model for leadership is itself a metaphor. What is unique and useful about it? Here are four parallels between leadership and conducting: 1. CONDUCTING IS ABOUT “SOUND ” VISION The conductor carries the responsibility for leading the orchestra with one vision. If the musicians were each to perform the music with their own individual vision, the result would be chaos. The conductor must first know what he/she wants to create in the music. While the program of music may be the result of consultation with the orchestra’s board of directors, the musicians, and ultimately the paying public, the vision for the sound of the music must come solely from within the conductor. Once the conductor has a clear understanding of what he/she wants, this must then be communicated with the orchestra. Words may be used in this communication, but the real test is communicating it through the <b>non-verbal</b> act of <b>conducting.</b> The physical act of conducting is the embodiment of the conductor’s vision through everything he/she does. Every single movement – big or subtle, every eye contact, and even every thought and every breath of the conductor must embody his/her vision for the music...|$|R

Psychological {{violence}} is currently {{emerging as a}} priority concern in all workplaces owing to its serious negative consequences on victims? health. This study, using a cross–sectional mixed–methodology, investigates the nature and impact of psychological violence on staff members? health at FET Colleges and how they cope with it. Based on the findings, preventative and supportive strategies are proposed to address and ameliorate staff members? experiences of psychological violence and the impact thereof on all contexts of their health. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative data, namely a Psychological Violence Scale that has been developed, and a Symptom Checklist. These instruments were distributed simultaneously to the study population of 262 academic and administration staff members at FET Colleges. Purposive sampling was used and the sample size of 174 respondents returned the completed instruments. Twenty–nine respondents indicated their willingness to be individually interviewed for the qualitative part of the study. Quantitative findings indicated that psychological {{violence is}} prevalent in FET Colleges, which is experienced severely and originates mostly from superiors. The most prevalent and severe forms of psychological violence experienced by staff members include: excessive pressure to produce more work; being given unreasonable deadlines; being exposed to unmanageable workload; more tasks assigned to one as opposed to other staff members at similar post levels and complaints that fall on deaf ears. The most prevalent and severe experiences of staff members as determined by factor analysis include: unfair demands and lack of recognition, work excessively monitored, dysfunctional corporate communication and autocracy and intimidation. The respondents experienced new health symptoms emerging since the onset of psychological violence, namely: feeling chronically fatigued/tired, loss of concentration, disrupted sleep, feeling edgy, irritable, easily startled, constantly on guard, panic, stress headaches, depression and thinking about being violent toward others. Qualitative findings indicated that participants experienced managerial abuse as dysfunctional corporate communication, abusive verbal and <b>non–verbal</b> communication, dysfunctional <b>conduct,</b> disengagement, structural violence, dysfunctional management and unfair demands. Abuse experienced from the Department of Education includes; excessive pressure, intimidation, poor planning and the ineffective implementation of the new curriculum. Colleagues of equal status abused by means of inappropriate conduct, students abused through dysfunctional conduct and subordinates abused through disengagement. vii Psychological violence impacted negatively on the psychological, biophysical, spiritual, ecological and metaphysical health contexts of staff members. Witnesses to psychological violence (secondary psychological violence) were perceived as conforming to avoid bullying owing to fear of becoming the next target. Findings from both datasets confirmed that staff members at FET Colleges experience psychological violence in various forms in that it {{has an impact on}} their health and that they have limited strategies with which to cope. Based on the findings, a number of preventative and supportive strategies are recommended on national, organisational, leadership, group, interpersonal and individual levels to address psychological violence at FET Colleges and to ameliorate its impact on staff members? health. This study contributes significantly towards the psychological violence literature in general and in particular, FET Colleges. The innovative multi–level preventative and supportive strategies forthcoming from this study are imperative to address psychological violence in workplaces and to ameliorate its impact on staff members? health.

40|$|Classroom {{emotional}} climates (ECs) are interrelated with students’ {{engagement with}} university courses. Despite {{growing interest in}} emotions and EC research, {{little is known about}} the ways in which social interactions and different subject matter mediate ECs in preservice science teacher education classes. In this study we investigated the EC and associated classroom interactions in a preservice science teacher education class.

Participants used audience response technology to indicate their perceptions of the EC. Analysis of conversation for salient video clips and analysis of <b>non-verbal</b> <b>conduct</b> (acoustic parameters, body movements, and facial expressions) supplemented EC data. One key contribution that this study makes to preservice science teacher education is to identify the micro-processes of successful and unsuccessful class interactions that were associated with positive and neutral EC.

40|$|The {{emotional}} deficits {{of individuals}} with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are often striking. These have been underlined even in the earliest formal reports of this condition, and more recent research suggests the presence of extensive deficits in even those individuals who are otherwise cognitively capable. While the assessment of emotional skills in young children with ASD is complicated by their limited verbal activities, the non-verbal paradigm (Sigman, Kasari, Kwon, & Yirmiya, 1992) {{has proven to be}} an invaluable tool. In this paradigm, children are presented with naturalistic in-vivo emotional displays, and their reactions toward these are observed and coded. The results of studies using this method have also evidence responsiveness deficits in the group. Nevertheless, the boundaries of emotional deficit in ASD remain unclear, and it is regarding this question of boundaries that this thesis aim to further our understanding. Two broad studies combine qualitative and quantitative methods here to examine the skill strengths and deficits of young children with ASD at varying level of functioning. Study 1 presents parent-report data regarding children’s spontaneous and everyday responsiveness the results obtained in this more ‘natural’ study served to confirm those of prior experimental research, with parents of children with ASD were equally capable as were comparison parents of recalling and describing instances in which their children had responded appropriately toward others’ emotions. Qualitative analysis of these descriptions revealed very few group differences, suggesting that when children with ASD do respond to others’ emotions, their reactions are quite typical and appropriate, and elicited in the usual way. The design of study 2 incorporated the information provided by parents in Study 1 so as to expand upon the prior use of Sigman et al. ’s(1992) <b>non-verbal</b> paradigm in <b>conducting</b> a systematic exploration of the boundaries of emotional responsiveness in young children with ASD. Child behaviour samples were obtained in response to a variety of emotion scenarios, occurring across a number of contextual manipulations. Again, in line with past research, global responsiveness deficits were seen from the children with ASD. These children were not, however, at floor-level in their responsiveness, with spared aspects apparent from the detailed behavioural coding conducted. Recruitment of a large and heterogeneous sample of children with ASD also permitted assessment of the responsiveness of children at higher- and lower-levels of functioning. The results of these comparisons indicated that 3 while appropriate responsiveness was more often shown by the group with the more spared socio-communicative skills, evidence of appropriate responsiveness was found even in the less able group. Overall, the results of this thesis support the notion of a global responsiveness deficit in young children with ASD. However, the opportunity afforded by the non-verbal paradigm for experimental rigour in the assessment of moderating factors, along with the ability of parents to report on the spontaneous behaviours of children in their everyday environments, combined her to provide the basis for a more detailed discussion of the boundaries of such a deficit. Just as researchers have combined the primary cognitive theories of ASD to explain may of the clinical feature seen in this condition, here too these are drawn together in a discussion of the current research finding, regarding the evidenced capacity of intact emotional responsiveness in individuals who have a marked global deficit in this domain of functioning...|$|R
40|$|Since Poulin (2004) {{argued that}} “courts should not extend their {{reliance}} on videoconferencing further and instead must undertake studies {{to explore the}} impact of the technology in criminal proceedings” (Poulin in Braun & Taylor: 36), numerous research has been conducted, not in the least through the DG Justice funded projects AVIDICUS 1, 2 and 3. While the first project explored whether the quality of videoconference interpreting (VCI) and remote interpreting (RI) is suitable for criminal proceedings, AVIDICUS 2 did further research on this combination of technological mediation through videoconference technology and linguistic-cultural mediation through an interpreter. AVIDICUS II focused on how this affects the specific goals of legal communication and also presented a chapter on training in its final publication. The main aim of AVIDICUS 3 is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the VC solutions used in different types of legal institutions across Europe in order to ascertain whether these solutions are suitable for bilingual communication. With the AVIDICUS (and other) research as a background, we want to present such a comprehensive assessment through a transcribed case study of a real-life VC testimony between Belgium and Austria with an interpreter for German and Dutch. A CA (conversation analysis) approach of the corpus will uncover social interaction through verbal and <b>non-verbal</b> <b>conduct,</b> while an additional critical discourse analysis (CDA) will look at the power relationships in the triadic exchange. Since the researchers master both of the languages spoken (German and Dutch), their analysis will also unmask possible transfer errors and deontological issues that will again be linked back to the CDA and CA. We will present the most significant shifts of the interpreter’s role according to the 3 D role-space model as presented in Llewellyn-Jones and Lee (2014). The role of the German-French interpreter in this case will be described along the three axes of the role-space model: presentation of self, interaction management and alignment.
