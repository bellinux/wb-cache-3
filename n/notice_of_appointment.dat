Not only is a consid-erable part of the List of Events given over to occurrences affecting the Jews of that country, but some of the tragic effects are indicated also in the Necrology which includes the names of a number of distin-guished German Jews who died by their own hands, and in the <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointments</b> <b>of</b> scholars and teachers, ousted from the laboratories and the lecture halls of German colleges and universities, to positions of honor in the schools of foreign countries, where they were cordially welcomed. The present volume also contains a special article dealing with discussions of minority and refugee questions at the 1933 Assembly of the League of Nations, evoked by Germany's degradation of Jews and Christian descendants of Jews, one of whose effects was the flight from Germany of some sixty thousand refugees from a campaign of persecution which has outraged the conscience of mankind...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} non-attendance at new outpatient appointments. DESIGN [...] Case-control study of non-attenders and attenders. SETTING [...] Outpatient department of a general hospital. SUBJECTS [...] All non-attenders (n = 277) for first outpatient appointments in six specialties during a three month period were included. Controls (n = 135) were the attenders who followed every second non-attender; thus they attended the same consultant {{on the same day}} that the non-attenders were expected. INTERVENTIONS [...] None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Information on the clinical problem, difficulties in attending the hospital, and reasons for non-attendance from the questionnaire were coded and classified. Non-attenders had received shorter <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> their <b>appointment</b> than attenders (14 % v 1 % had received three days' notice or less). There were small differences in the seriousness of patients' clinical condition.

50|$|When an {{adjuster}} needs a New York State IME {{as quickly}} as possible due to a hearing or another urgent matter, a waiver can be signed by the claimant or their attorney, waiving their rights to 7 business days' <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> by mail (which is a law of the WCB). A common question from an IME Vendor, to a claimant or their attorney, may be to sign a waiver form. If the claimant signs this and goes to the appointment, this is okay. However, if an attorney's office refuses to sign it and won't let their client sign it, then the exam will have to be rescheduled to a later date to allow more notice time for the claimant. If a claimant attends the exam and their attorney says they'll sign the waiver, but never provides the signed waiver to the IME Vendor, the report that is dictated by the IME doctor will be precluded (meaning it is not valid because the waiver was never actually signed and returned).|$|R

50|$|Morris {{was ordained}} a priest of the Order of Saint Benedict on 29 June 1817 and was {{assigned}} to missionary work in London, first at the chapel of the Portuguese Embassy in Grosvenor Square, and then, after the closure of that chapel in 1829, in Chelsea. In 1831 he received <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> as bishop charged with the duty of conducting an Apostolic Visitation into {{the condition of the}} Catholic Church on the island of Mauritius where the local clergy had been in conflict with Bishop Edward Bede Slater who, since 1818, had been resident bishop there exercising his duties as Vicar Apostolic of the Mauritius and as the first Vicar Apostolic of the Cape of Good Hope. To that end, Morris was appointed Titular Bishop of Troas in October 1831, receiving episcopal ordination on 5 February 1832. His principal consecrator was Bishop James Yorke Bramston assisted by Bishop Peter Augustine Baines, O.S.B., and Bishop Robert Gradwell. The investigation, however, was rendered otiose by the impromptu flight of Slater from Port St. Louis in June 1832 and his death from exposure a few days later. Instead of investigating Slater, Morris was appointed to succeed him.|$|R
6000|$|Before 1854 Lowell's {{literary}} success {{had been}} won mainly in verse. With the {{appearance in the}} magazines of A Moosehead Journal, Fireside Travels, and Leaves from My Italian Journal his success as a prose essayist began. Henceforth, and against his will, his prose was a stronger literary force than his poetry. He now gave a course of lectures on the English poets at the Lowell Institute, and during the progress of these lectures he received <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> to succeed Longfellow in the professorship of the French and Spanish languages and Belles-Lettres in Harvard College. A year was spent in Europe in preparation for his new work, and during {{the next twenty years}} he faithfully performed the duties of the professorship, pouring forth the ripening fruits of his varied studies in lectures such as it is not often the privilege of college students to hear. That pulling in the yoke of this steady occupation was sometimes galling is shown in his private letters. To W.D. Howells he wrote regretfully of the time and energy given to teaching, and of his conviction that {{he would have been a}} better poet if he [...] "had not estranged the muse by donning a professor's gown." [...] But a good teacher always bears in his left hand the lamp of sacrifice.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is certain}} {{that at the time}} <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> to the super-intendancy his {{physical}} and mental strength had already become seriously impaired by the inroads of the insidious disease (Bright's) which ultimately, after several years of often intense suffering, ended in his death. That to some extent he was conscious of his enfeebled condition is evidenced by his remark when receiving the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment,</b> that [...] "it came too late." [...] Years before his life had been saddened by the loss of three young children; it was now darkened by the death of the last remaining son, Frederic, who, though always delicate, had lived to manhood and appeared to be entering upon a successful career as civil engineer. This blow, coming at a time when even in his letters he complained of increasing inability to do the accustomed amount of work, gave a grave downward impulse to his already failing strength. That he did not at that time find any one to lean upon as Bache had leaned upon him under similar circumstances was a misfortune which allowed matters to progress until a political change found in his case a welcome opportunity for the exhibition of the reformer's zeal. In respect to his physical and consequent mental condition at the time when he appeared before the Presidential commission on the conduct of the Coast Survey, it may suffice to say that the physician who examined him immediately after his resignation declared that had he been aware of the facts he [...] "would, unsolicited and from a sense of justice, have gone before that body and testified that Hilgard could not be held responsible for his acts." [...] This statement, amply corroborated by the severe illness immediately following, should dispose of the unjust censure visited upon him at the time, whether by those ignorant or by others forgetful of the devotion, singleness of purpose, and high ability which had uniformly marked his previous career. While there could be no question of the necessity for a change, the difficulty long experienced by the administration in finding a successor among his peers in science stands in evidence of the feeling excited in them by the harshness of the treatment bestowed upon him.|$|R
