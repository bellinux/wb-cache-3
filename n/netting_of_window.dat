40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method {{to set up}} energy performance requirements and energy classes for <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> all dimensions and configurations. The <b>net</b> energy gain <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> is the solar gain minus the heat loss integrated over the heating season. The net energy gain can be calculated for one orientation or averaged over different orientations. The averaged value {{may be used for}} energy labeling <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> standard size. Requirements in building codes may also be based on the net energy gain instead of the thermal transmittance <b>of</b> the <b>window.</b> The size and the configuration <b>of</b> the <b>window,</b> i. e. number of glazing units, have a very large effect on the net energy gain. Therefore the energy labeling or the requirements based on the standard size may not give valid information on the energy performance <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> non-standard size. The paper {{presents a}} method to set up requirements and classes for energy performance based on the net energy gain that includes the effect <b>of</b> <b>window</b> size and configuration. The <b>net</b> energy gain <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> can be divided into the <b>net</b> energy gain <b>of</b> the glazing unit and the heat losses of the frame and the assembly of the glazing unit and the frame. The glazing unit contributes proportionally to its area. The frame also contributes proportionally to its area, but as the area of the frame is the width times the length, the heat losses of the frame and the assembly both contribut...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the research}} done during the last 8 years at the Technical University of Denmark developing improved low-energy window solutions. The focus has been on maximizing the <b>net</b> energy gain <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> for residential buildings. The <b>net</b> energy gain <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> is the solar gain minus the heat loss integrated over the heating season. It is assumed that in northern cold climates all of the solar gain during the heating season can be utilized for space heating. Problems with overheating in the summer period must be solved with overhang or moveable solar shading devices. Two windows have already been developed and prototypes constructed for laboratory test and a third generation <b>of</b> the <b>window</b> design is now in the developing and designing phase in a new project. The first window constructed was made of wood profiles and a low-energy double glazing unit. The second and third <b>windows</b> are made <b>of</b> fiber-reinforced plastic (plastic reinforced by fine fibers made of glass). This composite material is a weatherproof material with very low thermal conductivity and high mechanical strength. These properties make the material very suitable for frame profiles due to lower heat loss and longer durability <b>of</b> the <b>window.</b> The glazing in these fiber reinforced polyester windows is both unsealed and sealed triple glazing units. To increase the net energy gain slim frame profiles have been developed to increase the glazing area and thereby the solar gain. The challenge when developing slim frame profiles is to make enough space for hinges and fasteners and still maintaining the functionality and strength <b>of</b> the <b>window.</b> Proposals for new hinges and handles are also given in this paper. 1...|$|R

From the first day he chose for his nightly roost a towel-line which had been drawn across the corner over the wash-stand, where he every night established himself with one claw in {{the edge of the}} towel and the other clasping the line, and, ruffling up his feathers till he looked like a little chestnut-burr, he would resign himself to the soundest sleep. He did not tuck his head under his wing, but seemed to sink it down between his shoulders, with his bill almost straight up in the air. One evening one of us, going to use the towel, jarred the line, and soon after found that Hum had been thrown from his perch, and was hanging head downward, fast asleep, still clinging to the line. Another evening, being discomposed by somebody coming to the towel-line after he had settled himself, he fluttered off; but so sleepy that he had not discretion to poise himself again, and was found clinging, like a little bunch of green floss silk, to the mosquito <b>netting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>window.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Cutaneous and visceral {{leishmaniasis}} is important endemic diseases {{in many parts}} of the world, including Iran, which are transmitted by bites of sandflies. This study is conducted to identify Phlebotomine sand flies fauna in Hamadan, Iran. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study which caught sand flies in the months of May, June, July, August, September and October. The catch was performed by sticky traps. Results: In this study, a total of 4871 sand flies were collected and identified. The number of sand flies caught from indoor and outdoor places was respectively 1302 (26. 73 %) and 3569 (73. 27 %). As a result of this study, nine species of sand flies were identified in the city of Hamadan, seven of which are of genre Phlebotomus (P. papatasi, P. kandelakii, P. sergenti, P. major, P. caucasicus, P. ansarii, P. halpensis) and two species are of the genre Sergentomyia (S. sintoni, S. dentata). Conclusion: In order to avoid the possible transmission of diseases and reduction of harassments of this insect during warm months of the year, personal protection such as use <b>of</b> mosquito <b>nets,</b> application <b>of</b> <b>window</b> and door mesh and use of repellents are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScIn this study, {{two methods}} of {{analysing}} activity concentrations of natural radionuclides (U, Th and K) in soil are critically compared. These are the Window Analysis (WA) and Full Spectrum Analysis (FSA). In the usual WA method, the activity concentrations are determined from the <b>net</b> counts <b>of</b> the <b>windows</b> set around individual γ-ray peaks {{associated with the}} decay of U, Th and K. In the FSA method, the full energy spectrum is considered and the measured spectrum is described as {{the sum of the}} three standard spectra (associated with U, Th and K, respectively), each multiplied by an unknown concentration. The concentrations are determined from the FSA and correspond to the activity concentrations of U, Th and K in the soil. The standard spectra derived from separate calibration measurements using the HPGe detector, represents the response of the HPGe to a Marinelli sample beaker containing an activity concentration of 1 Bq/kg.

In these days, gamma-ray spectroscopy with a High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector has been widely used for the activity measurements of natural radionuclides contained in the soil of the Earth. The energy spectra obtained by the HPGe detectors have been generally analyzed by means <b>of</b> the <b>Window</b> Analysis (WA) method. In this method, activity concentrations are determined by using the <b>net</b> counts <b>of</b> energy <b>window</b> around individual peaks. Meanwhile, an alternative method, the so-called Full Spectrum Analysis (FSA) method uses count numbers not only from full-absorption peaks but from the contributions of Compton scattering due to gamma-rays. Consequently, while it takes a substantial time to obtain a statistically significant result in the WA method, the FSA method requires a much shorter time to reach {{the same level of}} the statistical significance. This study shows the validation results of FSA method. We have compared the concentration of radioactivity of 40 K, 232 Th and 238 U in the soil measured by the WA method and the FSA method, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the determining 90 Sr via its β-emitting daughter, 90 Y, in environmental sam-ples by Cerenkov counting. The method {{is based on the}} isolation of 90 Y by solvent extraction, using HDEHP as an extractor. The liquid scintillation (LS) analyzer Tri-Carb 3170 TR/SL has been employed. After radiochemical treatment, environmen-tal samples might be colored, and this will lead to color quenching, {{which is one of the}} most important problems that affect Cerenkov counting. The channel ratio (CR) method has been employed to correct this effect. Thus, the A window, which includes the whole spectrum, and the B window, corresponding to the most energetic zone <b>of</b> the A <b>window,</b> are defined. The ratio between the <b>net</b> counts <b>of</b> these <b>windows</b> defines the CR. Most authors working with this method define the B window as starting from the channel with higher number of counts. However, no study justifies this selection. This paper presents mea-surements and criteria to optimize and justify the choice <b>of</b> the B <b>window.</b> Several “B windows ” have been defined, and their respective efficiency versus CR curves has been determined. During a study of the fitting parameters for the curves, we eval-uated how to choose the windows to establish the optimum curve that corrects the efficiency decrease due to color quenching. Results have been checked by taking part in an exercise of analytical intercomparison among a great number of Spanish lab-oratories for the measurement of 90 Sr in aqueous samples...|$|R
