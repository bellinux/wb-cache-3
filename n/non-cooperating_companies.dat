40|$|Consider {{multiple}} {{companies that}} continuously review their inventories and face Poisson demand. We study cooperation strategies for these companies and analyse if there exist allocations {{of the joint}} cost such that any company has lower costs than on its own; such allocations are called stable cost allocations. We start with two companies that jointly place an order for replenishment if their joint inventory position reaches a certain reorder level. This strategy leads to a simple expression of the joint costs. However, these costs exceed the costs for <b>non-cooperating</b> <b>companies.</b> Therefore, we examine another cooperation strategy. Namely, the companies reorder {{as soon as one}} of them reaches its reorder level. This latter strategy has lower costs than for <b>non-cooperating</b> <b>companies.</b> Numerical experiments show that the game-theoretical distribution rule — a cost allocation in which the companies share the procurement cost and each pays its own holding cost — is a stable cost allocation. These results also hold for situations with multiple companies. Key words: joint replenishment, stochastic demand, cost allocation, distribution rule, continuous review, game theory, inventory model...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} this {{research}} efforts in optimizing earthwork processes focused mainly on minimizing transportation costs and mass haul distances, respectively. This kind of optimization problem, {{well known as}} earthwork allocation problem can be solved by applying linear programming techniques. As a result, the most cost-efficient cut-to-fill assignments will be found. In this article, starting from an optimal cut-to-fill assignment, we formulate a new corresponding combinatorial optimization problem. This earthwork section division problem arises when a large road project is divided into several linear construction sections and tendered to different normally <b>non-cooperating</b> construction <b>companies.</b> The optimization objective is to partition the optimized cut-to-fill-assignments in different earthwork sections with minimal earth movements between them. This problem is subjected to certain user-defined constraints, like number of sections, minimal and maximal section-length, etc. The proposed solution model will be integrated into an earthwork modeling and assessment system which allows performing a quantity take-off from a roadway model to provide the necessary input data for the optimization algorithms...|$|R
