Maize being the principal food crops {{of the majority of}} the hill people and source of animal feed for ever growing livestock industries in Terai of Nepal. Despite the many efforts made to increase the maize productivity in the country, the results are not much encouraging. Many of the maize based technologies developed and recommended for the farmers to date are not fully adopted. Therefore, problem is either on technology development or on dissemination or on both. Considering the above facts, some of the innovative and modern approaches of plant breeding and crop management technologies to increase the maize yield need to be developed and disseminated. There is a need for location-specific maize production technologies, especially for lowland winter maize, marginal upland maize production system, and resource poor farmers. Research efforts can be targeted to address both yield potential and on-farm yields by reducing the impacts of abiotic and biotic constraints. Therefore, in order to streamline the future direction of maize research in Nepal, an attempt has been made in this article to highlight the present status and future prospects with few key pathways...|$|R

40|$|Legumes play a {{vital role}} in {{ensuring}} global <b>nutritional</b> food <b>security</b> and improving soil quality through nitrogen fixation. Accelerated higher genetic gain is required to meet the demand of ever increasing global population. In recent years, speedy developments have been witnessed in legume genomics due to advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and high-throughput genotyping technologies. Reference genome sequences for many legume crops have been reported in the last five years. The availability of draft genome sequences and re-sequencing of elite genotypes for several important legume crops have made it possible to identify structural variations at large scale. Availability of large-scale resources and low-cost and high-throughput genotyping technologies are enhancing the efficiency and resolution of genetic mapping and marker-trait association studies. Most importantly, deployment of molecular breeding approaches has resulted in development of improved lines in some legume crops such as chickpea and groundnut. In order to support genomics-driven crop improvement at a fast pace, the deployment of breeder-friendly genomics and decision support tools seem appear to be critical in breeding programs in developing countries.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} aquaculture, at present, is undoubtedly recognized. The sector {{is expected to}} effectively contribute to food <b>security,</b> <b>nutritional</b> well-being, poverty reduction and economic development. However, biosecurity lapses and transboundary aquatic animal diseases pose significant constraints to aquaculture sustainability. This paper discusses how aquaculture development brings new chal-lenges to aquatic animal health. These challenges include compliance to international treaties, practical implementation of regional guidelines and national strategies, in-creasing biosecurity and biosecurity awareness at all levels, empowering farmers to manage disease and other risks through better management practices, and conduct-ing targeted research that will support biosecurity assessments. A short brief on emerg-ing and re-emerging issues such as chemical usage, climate change and disease ecol-ogy, fish welfare and fish health, fish-vet cooperation and certification scheme for aquatic animal health service providers is included.

30|$|The Western Ghats of India, one of {{the global}} {{biodiversity}} hotspots and freshwater eco-regions, harbors several fish species which not just form the {{important part of the}} world’s freshwater biodiversity yet in addition are the vital segment of livelihood of the neighborhood population. The rate of fish decline in the Western Ghats is alarming. The absence of organized study and data scarcity on basic biology and life history traits of several species could be one reason behind the decline, and thus it is difficult to execute conservation action/s. This is especially true, particularly for data-deficient species for which definite data related to distribution, population size, and trend is not available. The present study deals with the detailed investigation of population dynamics of catfish species, Pachypterus khavalchor, which is data-deficient species inhabiting the Western Ghats of India and forms an important component of freshwater inland fishery, providing <b>nutritional</b> and financial <b>security</b> to the local community.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Health improvement, {{control of}} {{communicable}} diseases and increase in life expectancy {{among the elderly}} of developed and developing countries has greatly increased. Since the health care and social needs of older adults differ from that of other adults, {{it is necessary to}} identify the needs of the elderly in order to make proper plans that will promote their health. The aim {{of this paper is to}} critically review these researches. Methods: A comprehensive literature review on the needs assessment of elderly health was applied searching English and Persian databases in Pub Med, Science Direct, ProQuest, Elsevier, Magiran, ISC and using key words including, Health need, Assessment, Elderly, Aging, Older adults, Aged and Health care needs. Results: Initial search yielded 745 references, considering the inclusion criteria, 21 papers were reviewed. Results revealed that in conducting needs assessment, various methods and procedures in various health dimensions including physical health, mental health, emotional, care, social, cultural, economic, <b>nutritional,</b> service, <b>security,</b> legal and educational needs have been utilized. Some of the dimensions had been more explored and some rarely. Conclusion: Most of the conducted studies had mainly focused on the elderly physical health needs and had neglected to take in to account other needs such as social and health care needs. In order to comprehensively recognize the health needs of the elderly, identifying their health care and care services is also important. Furthermore, in addition to quantitative studies, discovering the older adults’ perceptions of their own health needs is also necessary. It seems that the challenge ahead of managers, experts and researchers on elderly health is trying to design comprehensive mechanisms of health need assessment and considering it as a reference for any future planning...|$|R
