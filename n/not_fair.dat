5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm {{on the grounds that it}} violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{talks with}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about his going to {{marriage}} counseling with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and Pam {{does the same}} with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Toby points out to Jim that it is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and awkward together.|$|E
25|$|Sachs {{does not}} {{see the need for}} {{independent}} evaluators, and sees them as a detractor to proper progress. He argues that many facets of aid cannot be effectively quantified, and thus it is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to try to put empirical benchmarks on the effectiveness of aid.|$|E

25|$|The dissent {{argued that}} in this case there was a net {{transfer}} from Penn Central to the city. The dissent argued that it was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to have the entire burden of preserving Grand Central fall on its owners. That cost is the opportunity cost of not developing the airspace over the terminal.|$|E
25|$|Elections in Sudan are {{riddled with}} corruption. Bashir was re-elected {{by a large}} {{majority}} in the 2010 elections, the country's first open election in over two decades, but international observers expressed deep concern about extensive fraud and intimidation. According to the observers, the election was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> by international standards; the US State Department deemed them unfree and unfair.|$|E
25|$|The {{court held}} that the Moscow on the Hudson poster was not a parody because it was not meant to satirize the Steinberg image itself, but merely satirized the same concept of the parochial New Yorker that was parodied by Steinberg's work. Because the copyrighted work was not an object of the parody, the {{appropriation}} of the image was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> use.|$|E

25|$|In {{both cases}} the {{data suggest that the}} null {{hypothesis}} is false (that is, the coin is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> somehow), but changing the sample size changes the p-value. In the first case, the sample size is not large enough to allow the null hypothesis to be rejected at the 0.05 level (in fact, the p-value can never be below 0.05 for the coin example).|$|E
25|$|On 7 November 2010, in an {{exclusive}} interview (the last given before his return to Haiti) with independent reporter Nicolas Rossier in Eurasia Review and the Huffington Post, Aristide declared that the 2010 elections were not inclusive of his party Fanmi Lavalas and therefore <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> and free. He also confirmed his wishes to go back to Haiti but that he was not allowed to travel out of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{recognized}} that the approach adopted towards fair criticism has a practical implication on the evidential burden. If fair criticism goes towards liability, the burden {{would be on the}} party alleging the contempt to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> criticism and poses a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. Conversely, if fair criticism is a defence to an allegation of contempt, the burden would be on the alleged contemnor to show on a balance of probabilities that the statement amounts to fair criticism.|$|E

25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. Many {{feel that it is}} <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} {{argument}} that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought {{that there is no}} justification for valuing scientific claims over claims by other ideologies like religions. Feyerabend also argued that scientific accomplishments such as the moon landings are no compelling reason to give science a special status. In his opinion, it is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to use scientific assumptions about which problems are worth solving in order to judge the merit of other ideologies. Additionally, success by scientists has traditionally involved non-scientific elements, such as inspiration from mythical or religious sources.|$|E
25|$|In the Listening exam of 2007, {{there was}} a part asking {{students}} to determine whether marked sentences were correct or not, based on the whole recording. There were 10 questions, carrying 2 marks each. In that part, if a candidate answered a question correctly, 2 marks were awarded but if the question was answered, 2 marks were deducted. No marks were given or deducted for blank answers. A candidate who answered all the questions, {{with no more than}} 5 being correct, would end up having no marks for that section, but if 5 were correct, 10 marks were given. That stirred up controversy among candidates, who claimed that the marking scheme was <b>not</b> <b>fair.</b> They said that all questions were compulsory so there should not be any advantage to those who left some of the blanks empty by deducting marks for wrong answers. The HKEAA said that it had been in practice for years to prevent students guessing answers, but in fact, this type of marking had appeared only in table-type questions in which candidates were required to tick some of the boxes in the table but not in questions in which all blanks were to be filled.|$|E

Just as he bends {{down to pick up}} the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter.

It's <b>not</b> <b>fair!</b> There was finally going to be TIME!...", much like what happens to Mr. Bemis.|$|E
500|$|Coffin {{explained}} in his autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin (1876), that he inherited his anti-slavery views from his parent and grandparents, {{who had never}} owned slaves. The Coffin family was greatly influenced by the teachings of John Woolman who believed that slaveholding was <b>not</b> <b>fair.</b> Coffin's parents probably met Woolman in 1767 during religious meetings held near their New Garden home with other non-slaveholding Quaker families. It is also likely that his cousin, Vestal Coffin, attended the meeting. (Vestal {{was one of the}} earliest Quakers to help slaves escape from North Carolina, beginning as early as 1819.) ...|$|E

500|$|In {{suppressing the}} revolution, Batista's {{government}} had killed thousands of Cubans; Castro and influential {{sectors of the}} press put the death toll at 20,000, but a list of victims published shortly after the revolution contained only 898 names—over half of them combatants. More recent estimates place the death toll between 1000 and 4000. In response to popular uproar, which demanded that those responsible be brought to justice, Castro helped set up many trials, resulting in hundreds of executions. Although widely popular domestically, critics–in particular the U.S. press–argued that many were <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> trials. Castro responded that [...] "revolutionary justice {{is not based on}} legal precepts, but on moral conviction".|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his {{team and the}} fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m getting old for that! I even said to the team I’m getting old! The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here." [...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to hand that question to Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he {{did a very good job}} today and you have to accept that." ...|$|E

Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me...
