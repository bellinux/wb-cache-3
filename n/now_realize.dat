500|$|The lecture {{caused a}} storm of controversy, even at the {{reception}} immediately following his talk. Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: [...] "How dare you!", and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had [...] "no sense of humour", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: [...] "I <b>now</b> <b>realize</b> that I had never really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years." [...] Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.|$|E
500|$|Historian Hugh Ross {{argued that}} in gaining the nomination, Willkie [...] "gave {{exceptional}} promise of being a winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party, queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership in order to entrust its political fortunes to a man without political experience. [...] In most of the previous instances, the nomination {{had gone to a}} military man. In 1940, it went to a businessman." [...] Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered by the success of its Eastern Establishment wing; [...] "whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come." [...] Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie's oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was Gerald R. Ford, who wrote many years later in his memoirs, [...] "I <b>now</b> <b>realize</b> that my participation did not make much difference at all to the political fate of Wendell Willkie. But it made a lot of difference to me." ...|$|E

She herself however was 'one {{of the most successful}} teachers in the history of psychoanalysis...her seminars were remarkable experiences for students, and her classes were remembered as spectacles'. Deutsch was a very esteemed and beloved training analyst and supervisor, whose seminars, based on case studies, were known to often run into the early morning hours.|$|E

[...] She also details why she {{went to work for the}} Internal Revenue Service. She says it was because she wanted to change the tax code, [...] "from the inside out." [...] She also commented on her role as a Tea Party leader. [...] "I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I <b>now</b> <b>realize</b> that I misspoke," [...] she admitted. [...] "I should have said 100 percent, because I believe that nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the Constitution offers." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{party is}} taking place at Angèle's house {{on the eve of}} her {{impending}} divorce from René. Three months have passed during which time René has been travelling with Armand. However, on his return René has seen Angèle perform at the Paris Opera and is deeply attracted to her. Determined to meet the singer, he and Armand attend her party, with René presenting himself as [...] "Baron von Reval". The two fall in love, not knowing that they are already married to each other. Angèle tells René of the impossibility of their love as she is about to be divorced from one man and is engaged to marry another. Prince Basilowitsch is also at the party, and alarmed at the turn of events, publicly announces his engagement to Angèle. René and Angèle <b>now</b> <b>realize</b> the true situation, but René has no money to buy himself out of the contract, having already squandered much the 500,000 francs he had received from the prince.|$|E
2500|$|After sailing for 31 years, she {{was deemed}} superannuated. [...] The ship {{would no longer}} {{transport}} iron ore, and instead was retrofitted as a carrier of stone aggregate. [...] This 1923–1924 refit included the installation of topside self-unloading gear, which affected her center of gravity and righting moment. [...] As wreck discoverer David Trotter stated: [...] "We found that the self-unloading mechanism was still in position, and that was an interesting discovery because we <b>now</b> <b>realize</b> that the unloading mechanism didn’t break free, causing the Clifton to have instability, resulting in her sinking." [...] The self-unloading machinery [...] "was added the same year she disappeared," [...] responded maritime expert Valerie Van Heest. She said the discovery has many levels of significance. She said, [...] "All of it was additional weight above the center line of the vessel", {{and that it was}} not coincidental that three other ships outfitted with an identical self-unloading system all sank.. [...] Four of the refitted ships were lost in relatively quick progression.|$|E

60|$|Certain {{principles}} seem {{to emerge}} from {{a study of the}} Chinese railways and mines as needing to be adopted by the Chinese Government if national independence is to be preserved. As regards railways, nationalization is obviously desirable, even if it somewhat retards the building of new lines.

[...] The faith worded so grotesquely {{could not have been more}} simply or humbly affirmed, and no man I think could have been more helplessly sincere. He had nothing of that false self-respect which forbids a man to own himself wrong promptly and utterly when need is; and in fact he owned to some things in his checkered past which would hardly allow him any sort of self-respect. He had always an essential gaiety not to be damped by any discipline, and a docility which expressed itself in cheerful compliance. [...] "Why do you use bias for opinion?" [...] I demanded, in going over a proof with him. [...] "Oh, because I'm such an ass--such a bi-ass." ...|$|E

I give you my word of honor that I have never been so indignant in my life. I do not come here to stir up enmities among you, and I will mention no more names.

60|$|She was {{probably}} not {{the daughter of a}} hundred earls, but there must have been some such far-descended fair among the ladies who showed themselves {{from time to time in}} the royal paddock across a little space from our Grand Stand. The enclosure has no doubt a more technical name, which I would call it by if I knew it, for I do not wish to be irreverent; but paddock is very sporty, and it must serve my occasion. The King never showed himself there at all, though much craned round for and eagerly expected. But ladies and gentlemen moved about in the close, and stood and talked together; very tall people, very easily straight and well set up, very handsome, and very amiable-looking; they may have been really kind and good, or they may have looked so to please the King and keep his spirits up. I did not then, but I do <b>now,</b> <b>realize</b> that these were courtiers, such as one has always read of, and were of very historical quality in their attendance on the monarch. I trust it will not take from the dignity of the fact if I note that several of the courtiers wore derby hats, and one was in a sack coat and a topper. I am not sure what the fairer reader will think if I tell that one of the ladies had on a dress with a white body and crimson skirt and sleeves, and a vast black picture-hat, and wore it with a charming air of authority.|$|E
