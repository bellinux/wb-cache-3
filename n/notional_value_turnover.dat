5000|$|A {{study by}} economists Connan Snider and Thomas Youle, in April 2010 corroborated {{the results of}} the earlier Wall Street Journal study, {{concluding}} that the Libor submissions by some member banks were being understated. Unlike the earlier study, Snider and Youle suggested that the reason for understatement by member banks was not that the banks were trying to appear strong, especially during the financial crisis period of 2007 to 2008, but rather that the banks sought to make substantial profits on their large Libor interest-linked portfolios. For example, {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, Citigroup had interest rate swaps of <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of $14.2 trillion, Bank of America had interest rate swaps of <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of $49.7 trillion and JPMorgan Chase had interest rate swaps of <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of $49.3 trillion. Given the large <b>notional</b> <b>values,</b> a small unhedged exposure to the Libor could generate large incentives to alter the overall Libor. In the first quarter of 2009, Citigroup for example reported that it would make that quarter $936 million in net interest revenue if interest rates would fall by [...]25 percentage points a quarter, and $1,935 million if they were to fall by 1 percentage point instantaneously.|$|R

It {{is important to}} note for the casual observer that, in many cases, <b>notional</b> <b>values</b> of derivatives carry little meaning. Often the parties cannot easily agree on terms to close a derivative contract. The common solution has been to create an equal and opposite contract, often with a different party, in order to net payments (Derivatives market#Netting), thus eliminating all but the counterparty risk of the contract, but doubling the nominal value of outstanding contracts.|$|R

50|$|If you {{are buying}} stock option {{contracts}}, for example, those contracts could potentially {{give you a}} lot more shares than you could control by buying shares outright. So the <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> {{is the value of}} what you control rather than the value of what you own.|$|R
50|$|Figures {{of total}} debt {{typically}} {{do not include}} other financial obligations such as derivatives.

50|$|Ordinary shares entitle {{the owner}} to {{a share in}} the company's net profit. It is {{calculated}} in the following way: the net profit is divided {{by the total number of}} owned shares, producing a <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> per share, known as a dividend. An individual's share of the profit is thus the dividend multiplied by the number of shares owned.|$|R
5000|$|Synthetic CDOs {{have been}} criticized as serving {{as a way of}} hiding short {{position}} of bets against the subprime mortgages from unsuspecting triple-A seeking investors, and contributing to the 2007-2009 financial crisis by amplifying the subprime mortgage housing bubble. [...] By 2012 the total <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of synthetics had been reduced to a couple of billion dollars.|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} {{and growth of}} the CDS market has meant that on many companies {{there is now a}} much larger outstanding notional of CDS contracts than the outstanding <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of its debt obligations. [...] (This is because many parties made CDS contracts for speculative purposes, without actually owning any debt that they wanted to insure against default.) [...] For example, at the time it filed for bankruptcy on September 14, 2008, Lehman Brothers had approximately $155billion of outstanding debt but around $400billion <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of CDS contracts had been written that referenced this debt. [...] Clearly not all of these contracts could be physically settled, since there was not enough outstanding Lehman Brothers debt to fulfill all of the contracts, demonstrating the necessity for cash settled CDS trades. [...] The trade confirmation produced when a CDS is traded states whether the contract is to be physically or cash settled.|$|R
50|$|Credit {{derivatives}} provide market signals {{regarding the}} risk of particular investments. For example, the cost of providing CDS protection for particular bonds is a signal regarding {{the risk of}} those bonds. CDS also allow particular credit risks to be hedged, as an entity can purchase protection from many sources of credit risk, much like an insurance policy. While total <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> related to CDS are enormous (estimated between $25-$50 trillion), the true exposure related to that <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> is approximately $2.5-$3.0 trillion. This amount would only be lost if the underlying assets lost their entire value (i.e., akin to all the cars insured by car insurance companies being totaled simultaneously; CDS insure bonds instead of cars), which is outside any reasonable scenario. Since many of these CDS provide protection against defaults of bonds in quality companies, true risk of loss related to CDS is considerably less.|$|R

5000|$|A major unknown {{regarding}} derivatives is {{the actual}} amount of cash behind a transaction. A derivatives contract with a <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> {{of millions of dollars}} may actually only cost a few thousand dollars. For example, an interest rate swap might be based on exchanging the interest payments on $100 million in US Treasury bonds at a fixed interest of 4.5%, for the floating interest rate of $100 million in credit card receivables. This contract would involve at least $4.5 million in interest payments, though the <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> may be reported as $100 million. However, the actual [...] "cost" [...] of the swap contract would be some small fraction of the minimal $4.5 million in interest payments. The difficulty of determining exactly how much this swap contract is worth, when accounted for on a financial institution's books, is typical of the worries of many experts and regulators over the explosive growth of these types of instruments.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the determinants {{and consequences of}} financial institutions voluntarily forming risk management committees (RMCs). Specifically, I determine whether RMCs are related {{to a change in}} risk outcomes, an increase in profitability, a change in hedging and trading derivative structures, and greater financial reporting quality during the post-committee formation period compared to a control group. I use a sample of financial institutions that form a RMC in any year from 1994 through 2008 and a control sample of financial institutions that do not form a RMC during the sample period. The results provide evidence to suggest that financial institutions with a higher level of risk, a Chief Risk Officer (CRO), lower financial reporting quality, a larger board, a board that has a greater proportion of independent members, international banking activity, merger and acquisition activity, a CEO as Chairman of the Board, and a Big N auditor, are more likely to form a RMC. There is some evidence to suggest that RMC formation is negatively associated with a change in risk only for financial institutions with a high-level of risk in the year prior to RMC formation. RMCs and CROs act as substitutes (not complements) when it comes to reducing non-performing assets and loan charge-offs in high risk firms. Additionally, the results provide some evidence to suggest that RMC formation is associated with an increase in the <b>notional</b> <b>values</b> of both hedging and trading derivatives. Interestingly, for firms with a high <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of trading derivatives, a CRO serves as a mitigating force to reduce the <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of trading derivatives. Moreover, for firms with a low level of profitability, RMC formation is not associated with a change in profitability. However, the presence of a CRO is related to an increase in profitability. The presence of both a RMC formation and a CRO is associated with a decrease in profitability. Therefore, RMCs and CROs do not act as substitutes r complements when it comes to increasing profitability in firms with a low level of profitability...|$|R
50|$|Like all swaps {{and other}} derivatives, CDS may either {{be used to}} hedge risks (specifically, to insure {{creditors}} against default) or to profit from speculation. Derivatives usage grew dramatically in the years preceding the crisis.
