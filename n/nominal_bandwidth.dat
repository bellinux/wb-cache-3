30|$|Nowadays, it is {{becoming}} more and more common that multiple digital communication devices, including wireless, coexist and concurrently operate in close physical proximity. A typical example would be a smartphone equipped with WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS, and capable of operating at various data protocols and in multiple frequency bands. This physical proximity, combined with a wide range of possible transmit and receive powers, creates a variety of challenging interference scenarios. Multiple sources of empirical evidence indicate that such interference often manifests itself as impulsive noise [1, 2], which in some instances dominates over the thermal noise [1, 3]. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding the origins and the particular manifestations of this type of noise. For example, a strong close transmitter (say, WiFi) can noticeably interfere with a receiver of a weak signal (say, GPS) even when the separation of their frequency bands exceeds the respective <b>nominal</b> <b>bandwidths</b> of the channels by orders of magnitude. When time domain observations of such far-out-of-band interference are made at the receiver frequency, in a relatively wide bandwidth to avoid excessive broadening of the transients, this interference is likely to appear impulsive. Understanding the mechanism of this interference and its impulsive nature, as initially analyzed in [4], is important for its effective mitigation.|$|R

40|$|A {{spectral}} camera (ALISS - Ambient Light Imaging and Spectral System) {{was used}} to image ambient light from high-temperature vents at 9 °N East Pacific Rise and the Juan de Fuca Ridge during 1997 and 1998 Alvin dive cruises. ALISS is a low-light digital camera with custom-designed optics. A set of nine lenses, each covered by an individual bandpass filter (50 and 100 nm <b>nominal</b> <b>bandwidths),</b> allows vents to be imaged in nine wavelength bands simultaneously spanning the range of 400 - 1000 nm. Thus, both spatial and spectral information are obtained. ALISS {{was used to}} image three types of vents: black smokers, flange pools, and beehives. The primary source of light is thermal radiation due to the high temperature of the hydrothermal fluid (~ 350 °C). This light is dominant at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. At flange pools, where the fluid is relatively stable, only thermal radiation is present. Black smokers and beehives, however, are subject to mixing with ambient seawater (2 °C) leading to mineral precipitation. Data from these types of vents show the existence of non-thermal, temporally varying light in the 400 - 700 nm region. This light is probably caused by mechanisms related to mixing and precipitation, such as chemiluminescence, crystalloluminescence and triboluminescence. by Sheri N. White. Thesis (Ph. D.)
