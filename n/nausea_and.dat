5|$|Other {{symptoms}} include: headache, <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, {{the latter}} being an uncommon but highly specific finding.|$|E
5|$|The tumor may {{compress}} neighboring organs, disrupting {{digestive processes}} {{and making it}} difficult for the stomach to empty, which may cause <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away. Constipation is common.|$|E

5|$|A green tinge in {{the skin}} is {{sometimes}} associated with <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green {{is used as a}} symbol of sickness or nausea.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, <b>nausea,</b> <b>and</b> vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF {{can sometimes be}} felt or observed as a discharge from the nose or ear.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, <b>nausea,</b> <b>and</b> constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E

25|$|Abdominal pain (1.6%), {{constipation}} (1.4%), vomiting (1.4%), <b>and</b> <b>nausea</b> (1.4%). Dyspepsia <b>and</b> increased appetite {{occurred in}} less than 1% of subjects in clinical trials.|$|R
5|$|Fly agarics {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|His first {{assignment}} is {{to assist with}} the encoffinment of a woman who died at home and remained undiscovered for two weeks. He is beset with <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> later humiliated when strangers on a bus detect an unsavoury scent on him. To clean himself, he visits a public bath which he had frequented as a child. It is owned by Tsuyako Yamashita (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), the mother of one of Daigo's former classmates.|$|E
40|$|A 46 -year-old {{woman with}} {{glaucoma}} secondary to chronic iridocyclitis complained of <b>nausea,</b> vomiting <b>and</b> diarrhoea upon topical application of travoprost and latanoprost. Unmasked dechallenge and rechallenge with both travoprost and latanoprost were carried out. Challenge with bimatoprost on both eyes was also performed. Travoprost and latanoprost, but not bimatoprost, induced <b>nausea,</b> vomiting <b>and</b> diarrhoea. Based {{on the findings}} of unmasked dechallenge <b>and</b> rechallenge, <b>nausea,</b> vomiting <b>and</b> sometimes diarrhoea should be considered as adverse effects of travoprost and latanoprost. In this report, bimatoprost did not induce the same gastrointestinal adverse effects, probably due to its different chemical structure and receptors...|$|R

50|$|Common {{side effects}} of {{primaquine}} administration include <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, <b>and</b> stomach cramps.|$|R
5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} may be useful. These medications carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have {{a greater risk of}} side effects, including dizziness, <b>nausea,</b> <b>and</b> constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|Stage 1 (30 {{minutes to}} 12 hours) {{consists}} of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals {{may appear to}} be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{medication}} may be indicated {{for treatment}} of <b>nausea,</b> tremor, <b>and</b> anxiety.|$|R
5000|$|But even in Mahagonny {{there are}} moments of <b>nausea,</b> {{helplessness}} <b>and</b> despair.|$|R
50|$|Faintness, dizziness, headache, {{increased}} pulse, restlessness, <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, <b>and</b> brief loss of consciousness.|$|R
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, <b>nausea,</b> <b>and</b> headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, <b>nausea,</b> <b>and</b> vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945â€“1946, Slotin shocked {{some of his colleagues}} with a bold action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause <b>nausea</b> <b>and</b> vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nausea</b> <b>and</b> {{vomiting}} {{are largely}} determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
