5000|$|KBEQ rode to {{popularity}} {{during a}} short period in the mid-'70s where the long-unappreciated FM band suddenly owned the majority of radio listeners. During the 50s, the only way many radio station owners could make the FM side profitable was to lease {{ten percent of the}} signal out for an SCA channel. Muzak was a huge customer, using FM stations to broadcast [...] "elevator music" [...] to banks and grocery stores. Mark Wodlinger recognized the value of this service, and brought AgReports to Kansas City, using the 103.3 subcarrier of KPRS by contract. Up to 80 miles away, a grain elevator would hoist an antenna to the roof and pick up a constant stream of up-to-the minute commodity prices. At first, reports came by voice on a McMartin SCA table radio, with formatted <b>note</b> <b>pads</b> included to jot prices on. Soon, the stream went digital and the output was a TV screen full of scrolling prices. Then, Mark brought in a medical radio network, free to doctors, with ad-supported medical talk radio all day, broadcast on KBEQ's own SCA channel, and picked up by McMartin radios (the plastic-cabinet TRE-6 radio was developed for this network).|$|E

5000|$|Soups on {{different}} stores {{may have the}} same ID, meaning {{that they are the}} same kind of soup, just spread out {{on different}} cards. When applications access soups, they usually do so by querying and accessing a [...] "union soup" [...] object. From an application's perspective, union soups merge all the soups of a given ID on different stores into one unified soup for that ID. This happens dynamically; when a user adds or removes cards, the union soup changes automatically, each application is notified, and they update their presentation to the user to reflect this. For example, if the user pulls out a card containing a <b>Note</b> <b>Pad</b> soup, the appropriate soup entries (i.e. [...] "notes") in the <b>Note</b> <b>Pad's</b> union soup automatically disappear, the <b>Note</b> <b>Pad</b> is notified, and its display is updated to show that these entries are now gone. Treating documents as database entries in a global union soup made Newtons very apt at handling multiple cards yanked and inserted while applications are running.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} Neil Taylor’s (1945 -) animations, situated {{between the}} moving image, performance and sculpture {{and in the}} shadows of his recognised wire-based sculptural practice. Taylor’s animations automatically inscribe the surfaces of flipbooks and <b>note</b> <b>pads,</b> (Short Lives 1980 - 90) cash register rolls (Roll Film 1990) and are enhanced by hand-made ‘machines’ (Copy Copy 1998) designed to shape this idiosyncratic activity. These short films are part of an avant-garde project ‘that continues to explore the physical properties of film and the nature of perceptual transactions which take place between viewer and film. ’ (John Hanhardt, 1976 : 44). Taylor’s practice is additionally placed, through Vilem Flusser’s ‘technical image’ in relation to the ascendancy of digital culture, and Pierre Bourdieu’s ‘habitus’ is used to frame both Taylor’s art and teaching practice, in order to examine the discounting of the technical classes that these fields of production consistently perform...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores from a phenomenological {{perspective}} {{the work}} of Australian Experimental Animator Neil Taylor (1945 -), works situated between animation, performance and sculpture. Taylor’s animated scribbling repetitively and automatically inscribe the surfaces of flipbooks or <b>note</b> <b>pads</b> (Short Lives (1980 - 90)) and cash register rolls (Roll Film 1990 and Copy Copy 1998) often enhanced by hand-made ‘machines’ designed to facilitate and shape this idiosyncratic activity. Taylor’s work is informed by his successful wire-based sculptural practice and his 20 years experience of teaching animation to tertiary students and 8 years previously in the Australian Technical School system (a system that has since been dismantled but for which these animations remain as an aesthetic trace). His work can be generally situated inside an avant-garde project ‘that continues to explore the physical properties of film {{and the nature of}} perceptual transactions which take place between viewer and film. ’ (John Hanhardt, 1976 : 44) This is performative research into the minutiae of the moving image and its ability to register body gesture.

40|$|Teamwork in many {{operational}} settings, such as {{air traffic}} control or telemedicine, involves members who are at different locations and, as in space exploration missions, may communicate under time-delayed conditions. Collaboration and coordination in distributed teams differ from face-to-face interactions {{in a number of}} important respects (Brennan & Lockridge, 2006). Remote communication eliminates visual cues and thus requires more effort to establish common ground. Unlike co-present partners, distributed team members cannot rely on gestures and facial expressions to direct the other’s attention and provide feedback on their understanding. Voice communication between remote partners maintains the meaning nuances of face-to-face interactions that is lacking in text-based conversations. On the other hand, writing enables partners to re-read and thus to remember past communications, and to review and revise their messages prior to sharing them with others. These resources are not available in spoken discourse where participants have to rely on their memory or external aids (e. g., <b>note</b> <b>pads)</b> {{to keep track of the}} flow of the conversation and to compose their contributions. Transmission delays between partners ’ contributions further complicate grounding (Olson, G., & Olson, J., 2000).
