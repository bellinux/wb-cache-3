2500|$|On December 20, 1996, A {{head coach}} R. C. Slocum {{promoted}} Sherman to offensive coordinator to replace dismissed Steve Ensminger. Months later, Sherman resigned {{to start his}} professional coaching career as the assistant offensive line and tight ends coach for the Green Bay Packers. When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers. I've enjoyed the small-town atmosphere of College Station for my family, and Green Bay offers that same atmosphere. If the truth be told, there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> difference between an `Aggie' and a `Cheesehead." [...] He served the position for the 199798 seasons. After Packers head coach Mike Holmgren resigned to accept the Seattle Seahawks head coach position, Holmgren hired Sherman to become the offensive coordinator for the 1999 season.|$|E
2500|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the season, Perry {{continued}} his torrid scoring pace. On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes.

He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya.

The focus of the article was on the dependency needs of female adolescent suicide attempters and non-attempters. It also looked at other social network and intimate relationships for both suicide attempters and non-attempters. The authors hypothesized that dependency needs would be higher in suicide attempters. The results displayed a similarity in both groups, although, the sample size was too small to generalize to attempters. The article suggests future research on the range of dependency and the effect dependency might have on suicide. (Beettridge & Favreau, 1995) ...|$|E

Ashes Remain {{certainly}} adds its own unique flavor to the formula, and What I've Become is a solid addition to any collection. One of the elements that sets them apart is their use of intricate, guitar-focused bridges in almost every track. Another element that gives them strength is their ability to meld acoustic and grittier elements flawlessly in the same song. Overall, it is a raw album that sheds some light amidst dark themes."
