5|$|Details on Buffalo's {{early life}} are sparse. Although {{he appears to}} have been favored by British traders and {{decorated}} by British authorities, few Ojibwa from Lake Superior fought in either the American Revolution or the War of 1812. There is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> Buffalo participating.|$|E
5|$|It is {{accepted}} {{that in fact}} Verdaguer invented the story of James's sojourn for his poem, since there is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> it before then, and that the poem's popularity created the legend.|$|E
5|$|Myles {{was born}} about 1629 and died at sea after March 20, 1661. His body was lost at sea. He married Sarah Winslow in Boston on July 19, 1660, {{but there is}} <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> children.|$|E

5|$|A {{descendant}} of his, Charles H. Atherton, said that Humphrey Atherton, {{his wife and}} three young children arrived at the colony in the ship James, August 7, 1635, but there is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> this. His descendant further said that Atherton and his wife were each about 15 years old when they were married.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E
5|$|By 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, {{was living}} as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford. Calcraft was ordered to pay 3shillings a week towards her upkeep, to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister {{should be made to}} help, and that he had three {{children}} of his own to support, although there is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> his marriage.|$|E

5|$|Commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1858, Garrard & Co. made a set {{of three}} large bow {{brooches}} containing more than 506 diamonds. There is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> Queen Victoria ever wearing them; Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother and Elizabeth were seen wearing them frequently. The brooches are often adjusted to contain a large pearl or emerald diamond drop. Queen Mary was pictured {{on more than one}} occasion with the smaller Cullinan diamonds as the drops.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Buffalo was {{presented}} with the Treaty of La Pointe covering his lands. Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart, who was promoting development of the Lake Superior copper industry, led the negotiations for the US government. <b>No</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> the negotiations was made. But materials written by missionaries, traders, and the Ojibwa through their agent indicated that Stuart used bullying and outright deception to force the Ojibwa to accept the terms.|$|E
5|$|For a {{landscape}} artist, it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little: to Blaricum, Egmond aan Zee, and Rhenen in the 1640s, with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim and Steinfurt {{just across the}} border in Germany in 1650, and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661, via the Veluwe, Deventer and Ootmarsum. Despite Ruisdael's numerous Norwegian landscapes, there is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> him having travelled to Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|Hutchinson's husband William died {{some time}} after June 1641 {{at the age of}} 55, the same age at which Anne's father had died. He was buried in Portsmouth. <b>No</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> his death exists because there was no {{established}} church, which would have been the customary repository for such records.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the Duchess of Kent's new comptroller, Sir George Couper, {{studied the}} old accounts. He found huge discrepancies. No records for her {{household}} or personal expenses {{had been kept}} after 1829. There was also <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> nearly £50,000 the Duchess had received from her brother, Leopold, nor of an additional £10,000 from William IV.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, the {{earliest}} {{examples of the}} use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest that he found a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that cricket {{was introduced to the}} Americas and India before it had spread throughout the British Isles. For example, there is <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> cricket in Yorkshire, home of the English game's most successful club, until 1751. The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln's mother, Nancy, {{is widely}} {{assumed to have}} been the {{daughter}} of Lucy Hanks, although <b>no</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found. According to William Ensign Lincoln's book The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln, Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however, the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock. Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.|$|E
