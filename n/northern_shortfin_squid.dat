50|$|Illex illecebrosus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>northern</b> <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> or Boston squid, is a species of neritic squids in the family Ommastrephidae. They are found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, from off the coast of eastern North America to Greenland, Iceland, and west of Ireland and the United Kingdom. They are a highly migratory and short-lived species, with lifespans of less than a year. They are commercially important and are fished extensively (primarily by the United States and Canada), mostly for the Canadian and Japanese markets.|$|E

A period of high productivity (1976 - 1981) occurred between two low productivity periods (1970 - 1975 and 1982 - 2004). During 2005, the relative biomass index from the Canadian Division 4 VWX July survey was well below the 1982 - 2004 average and the mean size of squid in the 2005 survey was smaller (69 g) than the 1982 - 2004 average (77 g). The 2005 nominal catch in Subareas 3 + 4 (559 mt) was also low relative to the 1982 - 2004 average (3 400 mt).

40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid,</b> Illex illecebosus, inhabits the {{continental}} shelf and slope {{waters of the}} Northwest Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and {{the east coast of}} Florida and constitutes a unit stock throughout its range. The species is highly migratory, growth is rapid and the lifespan is short, up to 215 days for individuals inhabiting the USA shelf. I. illecebrosus is semelparous and females spawn and die within several days of mating. Thus, natural mortality increases with age for the age range where spawning occurs. Fishing mortality and spawning mortality occur simultaneously. Stock structure is complicated by the overlap of seasonal cohorts. Age data indicate that spawning occurs throughout the year and that the first several months of the US fishery are supported by the winter cohort. The onset and duration of the fisheries occur in relation to annual migration patterns on and off {{the continental}} shelf which appear to be highly influenced by environmental conditions. On the USA shelf, a bottom trawl fishery generally occurs during June through October. Since its inception in 1987, the domestic fishery has taken a majority of the total annual landings. In recent years, there has been no fishery on the Scotian Shelf and landings from the Newfoundland jig fishery have been very low. There are no stockwide research surveys and it is unknown whether NEFSC research bottom trawl surveys trac...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize whole raw cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> (Illex coindetii) during storage in ice through sensory, microbiological, chemical and physical analyses. The recently developed Quality Index Method (QIM) tables for these species were used for sensory analysis. Shelf-life of whole cuttlefish and <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> were estimated as around 10 and 9 days, respectively, according to QIM, which is shorter than for most species, especially fish. The numbers of microorganisms found in cuttlefish and <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> surfaces until rejection were lower than in fish, which suggest predominance of enzymatic (autolytic) degradation. H 2 S-producing bacteria constituted a significant proportion of the spoilage flora. Physical analysis performed using the RT-Freshmeter and the Torrymeter showed these instruments can be applied to cuttlefish and <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid,</b> providing useful complementary information on the rates of change of electrical properties. Free tryptophan and VBN contents significantly changed during the first storage week indicating that low levels of these compounds could be used as indicators of fresh and high quality cuttlefish and broadtail <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid.</b> Urea can be useful as spoilage indicator for cuttlefish, as well as agmatine for broadtail <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid.</b> An overall look into data obtained shows, as expected, that spoilage of these cephalopod species can be considered a different phenomena when compared to fish and is not yet completely clarified...|$|R

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variation in Argentine <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> Illex argentinus abundance distribution was examined over its fishing phase on the Patagonia Shelf and shelf break, Southwest Atlantic (SWA), using Taiwanese jigger’s fishery data. Geostatistical techniques were applied to characterize the {{spatial and temporal}} variability in the squid abundance {{and its relation to}} seawater temperature. The experimental semivariograms indicated that the abundance of Argentine <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> was spatially structured in the SWA, with various abundance levels. The spherical models for all years, except 2010, explained most spatial information from the annual squid abundance distribution patterns. The linear regression analysis confirmed a negative relationship between the annual squid abundance and seawater temperature in the studied years. High squid abundance was estimated using Kriging interpolations along the 200 -m isobath from 40 °S to as far south as 50 °S. The elliptical isopleth lines extended a longer distance from the 200 -m isobath to the shelf side in high abundance years, such as 1999 and 2007. Scattered patches of low values were observed in the very low-abundance year of 2004. The integrated total squid biomass using Kriging interpolation upheld a healthy stock status in the SWA fishing ground.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The piked dogfish Squalus acanthias {{is part of}} the bycatch {{of several}} South American {{longline}} fisheries, although in Argentina, it was only reported in the bycatch of benthic and demersal fisheries operating bottom nets. This communication represents the first record of S. acanthias bycatch in a commercial semi-pelagic longline fishery within Argentinean waters. In October-November 2005, 185 piked dogfish were captured (122 females and 63 males). The es-timated mean catch rate was 0. 37 sharks/ 1000 hooks (544, 320 hooks deployed). Nearly half of the captured females and over 50 % of captured males were morphometrically mature. The piked dogfish bycatch could have been influenced by the use of the Argentine <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> Illex argentinus as bait; this squid {{is part of the}} shark’s natural diet. Although S. acanthias is abundant in the region, we believe that the bycatch species could be more vulnerable than the targeted ones since the signs indicating a declining population of non-target species in commercial catches and collapses in bycatch populations go unnoticed.

40|$|Abstract only. The Patagonian marine {{ecosystem}} {{is one of}} the most productive ecosystems in the world, with important commercial shared/straddling stocks. One of the highest mobility resources is the Argentine <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> (Illex argentinus). Its distribution is limited to the area of influence of the warm-cold waters of sub-Antarctic origin, particularly of the Falkland Current; and it plays an important ecological role in the region. This resource is exploited by different foreign fleets that operate both within the Argentine exclusive economic zone and within the adjacent area beyond the 200 -mile limit, as well as in Falklands (Malvinas) waters. Hence, the countries face what is known as stock externality in which one nations catch impacts negatively on another ones. Nevertheless, little research has been done on both legal and economic aspects of this fishery. By pursuing this line of inquiry in this paper, we use the predictive power of game theory to explore the economic benefits of cooperative or non-cooperative fisheries management of Illex argentinus between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The model used is a discrete-time one of finite horizon with the fishery steady state static model of harvesting. The preliminary empirical results suggest that there is a correspondence between what the fishery has experimented over the last few years, with a non-cooperative scenario. This paper also demonstrates that in the cooperative scenario both players would obtain better economic benefits, because each would reduce the fishing effort and hence the abundance of the stock would remain below the reference points recommended by scientists...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{exploitation}} of the Argentine <b>shortfin</b> <b>squid</b> (Illex argentinus) was virtually non-existent in Brazilian waters until 2000 when foreign trawlers initiated their operations on slope grounds {{as part of a}} government-induced chartering program. Since then, the species has been included among the targets of a developing slope trawl fishing off southeastern and southern Brazil. Biological samples were collected from commercial catches of 25 national and seven foreign (chartered) trawlers between 23 °- 33 °S and 170 - 740 m depth. These samples represent two periods of the commercial {{exploitation of}} Illex argentinus in Brazil: 2001 - 2003, when both chartered and national trawlers operated simultaneously, and 2006 - 2007, when only national vessels continued to exploit I. argentinus along with other slope stocks. Catches contained immature and ma-turing squid throughout the year, as well as at least two distinct, fully mature, spawning groups: one composed of small-sized males and females present year-round on the shelf-break/ upper slope (< 400 m), and the other consisting of large squid present only in austral winter-spring in southern (26 °- 29 °S) and deep fishing grounds (400 - 700 m). The latter group has sustained the large winter catches reported since 2000 and the large sizes and concentrations of the specimens sparked the interest of the fishing industry as a potential target of the slope fishery. The reproductive attributes and temporal/ spatial distribution patterns of winter spawners support the hypothesis that relates this group to migrating concentrations of a north Patagonian shelf stock. If confirmed, the present data would underscore the need to consider multinational shared stock management strategies in the SW Atlantic...|$|R
