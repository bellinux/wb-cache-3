5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in their life, and that they stay that way regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E
25|$|Dink {{was baptized}} and married within the Armenian Apostolic Church, but was educated and {{sheltered}} at Armenian Protestant institutions and received {{his introduction to}} religion within the Protestant sphere. Dink {{was a member of}} the Armenian Evangelical Church of Gedikpaşa, Istanbul, as well as a member by birth in the Armenian Apostolic Church. He regarded both churches as part of his culture and said that he was <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> dealt heavily with religious rituals. Keeping the duality to the end, his funeral service was held in the Apostolic Church, by Patriarch Mutafyan, with Protestant ministers delivering eulogies at the burial.|$|E

500|$|Qureshi was {{initially}} scheduled {{to make her}} film debut with Billa II, a Tamil gangster-thriller, directed and produced by Chakri Toleti, after surviving an audition out of 700 candidates. Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had any regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't. I am <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what I was looking for".|$|E
500|$|... "Circle the Drain" [...] is a rant song where, lyrically, Perry {{is telling}} off a self-destructive drug-addicted ex-boyfriend. Its candid lyrics also discuss the strains his {{addiction}} put {{on both of}} them. In the track's chorus, she sings about how {{she wants to be}} his lover, <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has to take care of him, such as a maternal figure. She also sings about how he had ultimately lost large opportunities. Styled in the genres of disco-rock, and gothic rock tones, it is an up-tempo song that lasts for fourminutes and 32 seconds, and also has influences of techno. The track is composed in the key of E minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5.|$|E

She recalled that [...] "he wears very stylish waist coats and cut-away jackets. With Jane around he'd have an extra swagger in front of her. James (McAvoy) was really into it. We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look." [...] Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion, which was [...] "the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is dictated to by fashion." [...] Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics [...] "to emphasise {{a woman who was}} very set in her ways".|$|E

For the song's vocals, Ryo used the Vocaloid singing synthesizer software Hatsune Miku, and he used an illustration of Miku by an artist named 119 (pronounced Hikeshi) on the video without his permission. After Ryo contacted 119 with an apology, 119 responded with great interest in [...] "Melt" [...] and began to work together with Ryo, thus forming Supercell.

500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> always thinks their horse is going to win, but this year I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna's voice spans one-and-a-half octaves in [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", from F3 to C5, and her vocal has a [...] "silky", [...] "seductive" [...] tone. In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} her feel like the only girl in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you {{to make me feel}} like I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And when you enter, you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her hair out of the castle for just any man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} reasons why Ganteaume played no further Test cricket after his single match. Apart from {{the slow pace}} of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested {{that it would have been}} better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: [...] "Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was going to bow and scrape to the white players who still dominated the region's cricket." [...] In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, My Story: The Other Side of the Coin was published, in which he criticised the West Indies [...] "establishment" [...] of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.|$|E

During this time she had toured as a musical artist, earned {{royalties}} from both her records and from films she had appeared in, and had owned and {{been in charge of}} multiple corporations. In a long post to her Tumblr, Hill said that she had gone [...] "underground" [...] and had rejected pop culture's [...] "climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism and ageism." [...] She added that, [...] "When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and paid my taxes.

[...] On June 29, 2012, Hill appeared in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark and pleaded guilty to the charges; her attorney said she would make restitution for the back taxes she owed. By April 22, 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately; U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> stands before the court penniless.

2500|$|One of Anthony Flew's most {{influential}} professional works was his 1976 The Presumption of Atheism in which Flew forwarded {{the proposition that}} the question of God's existence should begin with the Presumption of Atheism:"What I want to examine is the contention that the debate about the existence of God should properly begin from the presumption of atheism, that the onus of proof must lie upon the theist. The word 'atheism', however, has in this contention to be construed unusually. Whereas nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts {{that there is no such}} being as God, I want the word to be understood not positively but negatively... in this interpretation an atheist becomes: <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist.The introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear to be a piece of perverse Humpty-Dumptyism, going arbitrarily against established common usage. 'Whyever', it could be asked, don't you make it not the presumption of atheism but the presumption of agnosticism?Flew's proposal to change his profession's use of the term atheism saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew's negative sense of 'atheism' came to be forwarded more commonly. The impact of Flew's proposed negative atheism, which is often referred to today as 'weak atheism' or 'soft atheism', is illustrated by analytic Philosopher William Lane Craig's 2007 assessment that the Presumption of Atheism had become [...] "one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism." [...] And BBC journalist William Crawley 2010 analysis: [...] "The Presumption of Atheism (1976) made the case, now followed by today's new atheism, that atheism should be the ... default position". In recent debates, atheists often forward the Presumption of Atheism referring to atheism as the [...] "default position" [...] or has [...] "no burden of proof" [...] or asserting that the burden of proof rests solely on the theist.|$|E
