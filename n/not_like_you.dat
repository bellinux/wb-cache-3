It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can start up a new TV network and give one show a month and expect it to be successful... We couldn't quite pull that off with the money we had." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Lady Gaga was touring for {{her second}} world tour, The Monster Ball. At {{that time she}} started {{developing}} ideas for her second studio album, Born This Way. The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself which she wrote in Liverpool and Manchester, England, described by Gaga as a [...] "magical message" [...] song. She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an Immaculate Conception. White Shadow, one of the producers of the track, credited Gaga for {{coming up with the}} idea and the theme behind the song. [...] "We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It sounds like it reads, but <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> think until you hear it," [...] he added. Gaga wanted to record her own freedom song, and explained with Billboard her inspiration behind the song: ...|$|E

500|$|Growing up {{a fan of}} Disney films, Murphy {{had never}} wanted to play a princess, preferring {{characters}} who were adventurous and [...] "drove the action" [...] instead. In the actress' opinion, villains {{continue to be the}} most dynamic characters in Disney films. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney villain as a [...] "juicy" [...] experience, Murphy explained that this is because these characters are [...] "not bound by ethics or moral codes or concern for what someone thinks or how it might hurt someone else", providing actors with more freedom. Upon her first session, Murphy appreciated the directors for exposing her to early concepts and ideas about Gothel. However, Murphy was not provided with a complete script because [...] "They’re very protective about that." [...] Murphy was directed to lower the pitch of her voice in favor of demonstrating a rather [...] "flat" [...] sound. Although Murphy did not base her own performance on any one individual in particular, she admitted to Babble that she was somewhat inspired by Betty Lou Gerson's performance as Cruella de Vil in Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Comparing voice acting to Broadway, Murphy commented that, in animation, [...] "You’re recording and you’re discovering it and giving the performance all at the same time. It’s <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> have three weeks rehearsal." [...] Additionally, Murphy never worked with co-star Mandy Moore, voice of Rapunzel; instead, Murphy revealed that scenes with Gothel and Rapunzel were actually recorded opposite one of the directors impersonating Moore, who also explained to Murphy that Gothel's design will continue to evolve as the character begins to adapt the actress' mannerisms. Howard enthused that Murphy [...] "nailed" [...] Gothel, admitting to ultimately using 90% of the actress' original material and takes because [...] "The character just came right to life when she came in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} between Chérif Kouachi and Igor Sahiri, one of France's BFMTV journalists, Chérif stated that [...] "We are not killers. We are {{defenders of the}} prophet, we don’t kill women. We kill no one. We defend the prophet. If someone offends the prophet {{then there is no}} problem, we can kill him. We don’t kill women. We are <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you.</b> You are the ones killing women and children in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. This isn’t us. We have an honour code in Islam." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{her husband}} became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. [...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E

50|$|He was a disciplinarian, and {{possessed a}} talent for the {{education}} of young men, many of whom he received into his own family. Tom Brown, author of The Dialogues of the Dead, about to be expelled from Oxford for some offence, was pardoned by Fell on the condition of his translating ex tempore the 32nd epigram of Martial:"Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere - quare; Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te."To which he immediately replied with the well-known lines::I do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>thee,</b> Doctor Fell,:The reason why I cannot tell;:But this I know, and know full well,:I do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>thee,</b> Dr Fell.|$|R

2500|$|Aside from {{teaching}} and film-making, Khouri devotes time to feminist organizations. [...] "Don’t you think {{talking about it}} is important, making the next generation understand that things are still not right for women?" [...] says Khouri. “I feel like I owe aspiring writers at least the warning that they are picking maybe the hardest thing there is {{to do in the}} business,” she says. “It doesn’t matter any more how good you are. In some ways, it never really did. Bad movies get made as often as good ones, but so few movies get made now, period. If you write for a studio, you may be one of eight writers, so it’s <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can have an artistic vision of your own and achieve it solely through screenwriting. I was very lucky because Ridley really wanted to tell Thelma & Louise. He wanted to make the movie I wanted to make. But often times that’s not the case at all. They think your script is a good idea and that’s all. So they buy it and then they hire two or three other people to take a whack at it and it can be a very disappointing thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E

5000|$|The nursery rhyme [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>thee,</b> Doctor Fell" [...] was not {{included}} in Mother Goose collections until 1926, following the rhyme's inclusion in [...] "Less-Familiar Nursery Rhymes" [...] by Robert Graves of I, Claudius fame.|$|R

50|$|It’s tough {{a father}} {{sometimes}} because {{you go through}} a lot of heartbreak as a kid and then when you think you’ve grown out of it, you have a child of your own and you go through it all over again.
