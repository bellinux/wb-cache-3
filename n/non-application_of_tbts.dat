The concentrations <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> in mussels from the Norwegian coast varied from less than 10 µg/kg wet weight to about 3000 µg/kg wet weight. The highest concentrations were found in and around harbours. Some degree of imposex occurred in all populations of dogwhelks except four stations in northern Norway (Finnmark). At about half {{of the total number of}} sites, a part of the female dogwhelk population was sterile. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> in the dogwhelks from the unaffected populations in Finmark was below the detection limit (17 ng/g d. w.).

No remarkable changes <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> concentrations in sediment were observed in this period. At the presence day, mean concentration <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> in water from Japan was 0. 011 m g l 1 and no remarkable differences <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> concentrations among sampling sites were observed. On the other hand, TBT concentrations were high in sediment from Ofunato Bay, the Port of Osaka, Tanabe Bay and Hakata Bay with poor flushing and shallow water. TPT concentrations in Tanabe Bay were the highest among the surveyed coastal waters of Japan. OTs concentrations were high in mussels from Yamada Bay and Otsuchi Bay which have many fishing ports. The vertical distribution in water column from Osaka Bay was discussed. TBT concentrations were constant during 0 - 20 m of water depth, {{which is due to}} vertical mixture of water.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chironomids play an {{important}} role in the detritus cycle and as a component in brackish- and freshwater benthic and terrestrial food webs. If TBT is present in their environment, then they may accumulate tributyltin (TBT) during their juvenile period, which negatively affects many of their life history characteristics. The aim of this experiment is to test the effects <b>of</b> three <b>TBT</b> sediment concentrations (nominal 30, 90, and 180 μg/kg) on life history traits (development time, survival, fecundity, and weight) and immune response (number of hemocytes and phenoloxidase activity) of the nonbiting midge, Chironomus riparius. These responses were recorded immediately after one generation <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> exposure, and in the long run during five consecutive generations. We also assessed recovery from pollution after four generations <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> exposure. In a single generation, TBT affected all measured parameters, except phenoloxidase activity, when compared to the control. Long-term-effects <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> lead to extinction of all treatments after the fifth generation. Again, all measured variables significantly differ from the control, although TBT had varying effects on the measured variables. Most of the effects <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> on population viability were not evident during recovery, once TBT was removed from the sediment. The effect <b>of</b> previous <b>TBT</b> contamination was observed only in delayed larval development, suggesting that TBT has only limited maternal/epigenetic effects on individual condition. However, altered schedules in the life-cycle can have unexpected ecological impacts. TBT decreases the viability of Chironomus riparius and the effect will become stronger if exposure to TBT continues for many generations. Yet, the harmful effect <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> disappears quickly as the TBT is removed from the environment. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that there is a metabolic interaction between tributyltin (TBT), an organometal used as an antifouling biocide, and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a widespread carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. This study was therefore designed to examine the potential in vivo influence <b>of</b> <b>TBT,</b> BaP, and their mixture on hepatic antioxidant defense systems of Sebastiscus marmoratus, which were given a single ip injection <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> (0. 5, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg), BaP (0. 5, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg), or both in combination (0. 5, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg); control fish received olive oil vehicle only. Samples were collected for biochemical analysis after injection for 7 days. Cotreatment with BaP caused a significant inhibition of TBT-mediated malondialdehyde contents elevation. Cotreatment with TBT decreased BaP-mediated glutathione peroxidase activity induction. Cotreatment with TBT and BaP did not significantly alter the reduced glutathione levels, which were significantly induced by TBT or BaP alone. TBT-induced suppression of BaP bioactivation or BaP-induced stimulation of the phase 11 metabolism <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> and its biliary excretion, both of which have been reported previously, could explain the observed antagonism. The results suggest that combined exposure <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> and BaP increases the vulnerability of the fish to oxidative stress. BaP cotreatment decreased the induction of glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity by the lower dose <b>of</b> <b>TBT,</b> while cotreatment with TBT and BaP at the highest dose (10 mg/kg) resulted in inhibition of the GST activity by 4. 8 -fold. The results suggest that these biomarkers should be interpreted with caution in biomonitoring studies.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 591 on 12. 04. 2017 by CS (TIS) Tributyltin {{is arguably the}} most toxic compound ever to be deliberately introduced into the marine environment as an ingredient of antifouling paints. It has had widespread toxic effects on a range of marine organisms, with some gastropod species being particularly sensitive. Effects <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> on non-target species have resulted in partial bans on its use in many countries, so that new inputs to the water column have decreased in most areas. One of the physicochemical features <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> is that it is readily sequestered by suspended particulates due to its low solubility and its hydrophobicity, therefore becoming incorporated into estuarine sediments. The availability <b>of</b> this sediment-bound <b>TBT</b> has been investigated through its potential for re-release back to the water column, and directly from the sediment using the sediment dwelling gastropod Hinia reticulata. The sorption process itself has been investigated using natural components to determine the sediment-water partition coefficient (Kd) together with factors affecting its magnitude. Sorption by sediments {{has been shown to be}} rapid (minutes), although the achievement of equilibrium may take longer (hours), and exhibits a Freundlich-like dependence on the TBT concentration due to the variable energies <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> sorption sites on sediment particles. The major determinant of Kd is sediment type, greater adsorption occurring in fine-grained organic rich sediments compared to low organic sands; although both salinity and pH modify the degree of adsorption. The sorption process has been shown to be reversible, so that previously contaminated sediments may act as reservoirs <b>of</b> <b>TBT,</b> releasing the compound back to the overlying water for many years. Hinia reticulata has been shown to be an effective and quantitative accumulator of both dissolved and sediment-bound TBT, principally acquiring TBT from water across the respiratory surfaces. When additionally exposed to sediments, significantly higher body burdens were accumulated, with up to 80 % of the total attributable to the sediment. Uptake <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> across the surface of the head/foot appears to be an important pathway for sediment-exposed Hinia reticulata, while the ingestion of contaminated sediment does not appear to occur. Hinia reticulata is capable <b>of</b> metabolising <b>TBT</b> to lesser butylated and presumably less toxic products which are excreted, making its accumulated body burdens responsive to changing environmental TBT levels, and increasing its value as a biomonitor. When exposed to a range <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> contaminated sediments, Hinia reticulata showed there to be greater TBT availability from sediments with a low sorptive capacity (sands), principally through desorption <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> to the overlying water. Fine-grained organic-rich muds, which have a greater capacity for TBT, produced lower accumulated burdens in Hinia reticulata, but may represent more important long-term sources <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> to benthic organisms in estuaries.

Every aquaria contained 2 l. of dechlorenated water with concentration of 2 ppm <b>of</b> <b>TBT.</b> Samples <b>of</b> heamolymph and ovotestis tissues were taken after 2 and 4 weeks. Results: The physiological data revealed that the concentration of glucose, cholesterol, calcium, total proteins, albumin, and globulin changed from one species to the other in different responses and according to time of exposure. The histological data of the hermaphrodite gland or the ovotestis of both snails showed disturbances in differentiation and maturation process, cellular degeneration was also observed. Conclusion: Due to the hazardous effects <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> on the physiology and the histology of the ovotestis of both snail species, more research on the impact <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> or related compounds has to be conducted. The use <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> as antifouling agent has to be restricted in the developing countries and replace it by related compounds with less or no side effects...|$|R

40|$|Bioremediation <b>of</b> {{tributyltin}} (<b>TBT)</b> contaminated sediment was {{studied and}} degradation enhancement and improvement of bioavailability were also investigated. In TBT spiked sediment, the half-life <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> {{in the control}} sample, representing natural attenuation, was 578 d indicating its persistence. In the stimulated sample (pH 7. 5, aeration and incubated at 28 C), the half-life was significantly reduced to 11 d. Further stimulation by nutrient addition (succinate, glycerol and L-arginine) or inoculation with Enterobacter cloacae (107 viable cells g 1 of sediment) resulted in half-life reduction to 9 and 10 d, respectively. In non-spiked sediment, the indigenous microorganisms were able to degrade aged TBT, but the extended period of contamination decreased the degradation efficiency. To improve bioavailability, addition of surfactant, adjustment of salinity and sonication were studied. The highest percentage solubilisation <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> in water was obtained by adjusting salinity to 20 psu, which increased the solubility <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> from 13 % to 33 %. Half-lives after bioavailability was improved were 5, 4 and 4 d for stimulation, stimulation w/nutrient addition and stimulation w/inoculation, respectively. However, natural attenuation in the control sample was not enhanced. The results show that providing suitable conditions is important in enhancing TBT biodegradation, and bioavailability improvement additionally increased the rate and degraded amount <b>of</b> <b>TBT.</b> Unfortunately, nutrient addition and inoculation of the degrader did not enhance the degradation appreciably...|$|R
40|$|The biosorption and {{biodegradation}} <b>of</b> tributyltin (<b>TBT)</b> by free {{cells of}} a resistant microalgal species, Chlorella sorokiniana at two different densities, 1 × 10 6 cells ml - 1 (low) and 1 × 10 7 (high) were investigated. TBT in contaminated water was continuously removed by microalgal cells and reached a 54 % and 74 % removal {{at the end}} of 14 days treatment in low and high density cultures, respectively. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> removal in both densities was similar: with the decreases <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> in water, TBT uptake by algal cells increased, reached a peak and declined to low levels {{towards the end of the}} treatment period. In the high density culture, total amounts <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> uptake, including the adsorption on cell surface and absorption inside the cells, increased from 109 to 159 μg TBT +from days 1 to 7, then declined to 95 μg TBT + at day 14. The proportions <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> adsorbed on the cell surface decreased while that in the intracellular fraction increased with time, suggesting that the adsorbed TBT moved gradually into the cells for stepwise debutylation. The two degradation products, DBT (dibutyltin) and MBT (monbutyltin), started to appear in the intracellular fraction from day 3 and day 7 onwards in high and low density cultures, respectively, with more MBT than that of DBT. These results indicate that C. sorokiniana was not only capable <b>of</b> removing <b>TBT</b> from contaminated water, TBT was absorbed and degraded into DBT which was then rapidly metabolized to MBT by intracellular enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Tributyltin (TBT), {{widely used}} as an {{antifouling}} biocide, is the most abundant pesticide in coastal environments. One of its main toxic effects is immunosuppression in both vertebrates and invertebrates. At sublethal doses <b>of</b> <b>TBT,</b> phagocytes lose their ability to move towards and ingest foreign particles. For short-term cultures of haemocytes (60 min at 25 [*]°C) of a marine invertebrate, the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, exposed to 10 − 5 M TBT, we previously reported dose- and time-dependent impairment of yeast phagocytosis and changes in cell morphology related to cytoskeleton disorganization. These effects are Ca 2 +-dependent, since inactivation of Ca 2 +-adenosine triphosphatase and a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + occurred. As TBT can antagonize the effect of chlorpromazine, a specific calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor, and the co-presence of exogenous CaM and TBT in the incubation medium resulted {{in the absence of}} effects, we hypothesized an interaction between TBT and CaM. TBT may remove endogenous CaM from cell proteins, thus inactivating them and causing alteration of Ca 2 + homeostasis. With the aim of confirming the hypothesis of a direct TBT–CaM interaction, we first studied the effects <b>of</b> co-incubation <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> with other exogenous proteins on restoring the ability of phagocyte morphology. Although bovine serum albumin was never able to restore cell morphology, the effect of human spectrin was similar to that described for CaM, suggesting a common non-specific mechanism of action based on the interaction <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> with exposed hydrophobic pouches. We also analysed the conformational changes of pure CaM (10 − 5 M) in the presence of various concentrations (10 − 4 to 10 − 3 M) <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> and its degradation products, dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT), by circular dichroism. Results indicate the dose- and time-dependent interaction <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> with CaM. This interaction is a non-covalent interaction, probably hydrophobic in nature, between the aliphatic chains <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> and the hydrophobic regions of Ca 2 +-activated CaM. DBT and MBT turned out to be less active in inducing CaM conformational changes, without any {{significant differences between the two}} compounds...|$|R
40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} the {{antifouling}} agent tributyltin (TBT) on three microalgal species, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were studied. Toxic effects <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> on growth, reproduction and physiology of the microalgae were assessed. The 5 -day EC 50 on growth inhibition of C. vulgaris, C. pyrenoidosa and D. tertiolecta were 130 /μg I- 1, 33 μg 1 -l and 3 μg I- 1 TBT, respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} vulnerability to TBT was highly species dependent. When comparing with other species of microalgae, C. vulgaris was a highly tolerant microalgal species, with EC 50 value one or two order of magnitude higher. For this reason, the tolerant mechanism of microalgae was further investigated. The biodegradation, biosorption and bioaccumulation <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> in C. vulgaris and C. pyrenoidosa were studied. The results of gas chromatography with flame photometric detector analysis showed that C. vulgaris could eliminate 50 % of the initial 100 μg 1 -l TBT from external medium in 60 hours. At the end of a 2 -week experimental period, it was measured that 25 % and 39 % of the original amount <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> were degraded to dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT), respectively. In contrast to C. vulgaris, DBT appeared to be the only degradation product for C. pyrenoidosu within the testing period, with 30 % of the original amount <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> transformed into DBT. The results demonstrated that the higher tolerant ability of C. vulgaris may due to its capability in degrading TBT into less toxic metabolite. The biochemical study on the enzyme system involving in degradation process showed that the in vivo cytochtome P- 450 content in C. vulgaris was significantly increased after 4 -day exposure to sublethal concentration <b>of</b> <b>TBT.</b> A maximum <b>of</b> 80 -fold increase in cytochrome P- 450 was recorded. Meanwhile, the activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was concurrently increased as cytochrome P- 450 when the algal cells were exposed to sublethal concentration. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, rather than cytochrome b 5, was the potential primary electron donor for the mixed function oxygenase (MFO) reaction. Inhibition studies using piperonyl-butoxide, cinnamic acid and carbon monoxide greatly reduced the algal in vivo biotransformation <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> by 74 %, 61 % and 60 %, respectively. All these results suggested that debutylation <b>of</b> <b>TBT</b> in C. vulgaris was mediated by a cytochrome P- 450 dependent oxygenase system...|$|R
