6000|$|A certain bewilderment, for our hero, {{disengaged}} {{itself from}} these remarks: they {{struck him as}} a contradiction, a retractation, strange {{on the part of}} a man who hadn't the excuse of witlessness. He had certainly not expected his correspondent to rejoice in the death of his wife, and it was perfectly in order that the rupture of a tie of more than twenty years should have left him sore. But if she had been so clear a blessing what in the name of consistency had the dear man meant by turning him upside down that night--by dosing him to that degree, at the most sensitive hour of his life, with the doctrine of renunciation? If Mrs. St. George was an irreparable loss, then her husband's inspired advice had been a bad joke and renunciation was a mistake. Overt was on the point of rushing back to London to show that, for his part, he was perfectly willing to consider it so, and he went so far as to take the manuscript of the first chapters of his <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>out</b> of his table-drawer, to insert it into a pocket of his portmanteau. This led to his catching a glimpse of certain pages he hadn't looked at for months, and that accident, in turn, to his being struck with the high promise they revealed--a rare result of such retrospections, which it was his habit to avoid as much as possible: they usually brought home to him that the glow of composition might be a purely subjective and misleading emotion. On this occasion a certain belief in himself disengaged itself whimsically from the serried erasures of his first draft, making him think it best after all to pursue his present trial to the end. If he could write as well under the rigour of privation it might be a mistake to change the conditions before that spell had spent itself. He would go back to London of course, but he would go back only when he should have finished his book. This was the vow he privately made, restoring his manuscript to the table-drawer. It may be added that it took him a long time to finish his book, for the subject was as difficult as it was fine, and he was literally embarrassed by the fulness of his notes. Something within him warned him that he must make it supremely good--otherwise he should lack, as regards his private behaviour, a handsome excuse. He had a horror of this deficiency and found himself as firm as need be on the question of the lamp and the file. He crossed the Alps at last and spent the winter, the spring, the ensuing summer, in Italy, where still, at the end of a twelvemonth, his task was unachieved. [...] "Stick to it--see it through": this general injunction of St. George's was good also for the particular case. He applied it to the utmost, with the result that when in its slow order the summer had come round again he felt he had given all that was in him. This time he put his papers into his portmanteau, with the address of his publisher attached, and took his way northward.|$|E

5000|$|In London, André Paine {{writing for}} London Evening Standard gave the show {{three out of}} five stars, calling the show uneven yet {{ultimately}} enjoyable. He continues, [...] "It was all over in 70 minutes and while Cheryl did just enough to justify her solo career, you suspect she's {{looking forward to being}} part of a girl group again". At the same concert, Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave Cole's performance three out of five stars, saying the singer's performance was surprising flat. He says, [...] "The flashes of brilliance in 'Under The Sun', '3 Words' - which featured a surprise appearance by friend and mentor will.i.am - and 'Fight for This Love' proved that she is capable of holding her own in front of a larger crowd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this book is to develop those ethical traditions. For example, Horkheimer’s books Eclipse of Reason and Critique of Instrumental Reason, and his early and now classic essay Materialism and Morality ask for a reformation of Kantian ethics. The reform sought is that {{categorical}} imperative in an individualism capitalism serves to worsen the difference between business ethics and moral philosophy. That is, {{it is not enough}} to try to be good or ethical as individuals when it is the systemic processes that must be dealt with. Therefore, Horkheimer asks that the maxim that would be made universal be done at the level of people organizing with others to change the social system that is producing the unethical behaviors. The book is organized into several sections. The first section sets the stages, beginning with a challenge to the field of social responsibility in business and public administration (Jones, Ten bos, & Parker have a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>out</b> that is smashing). Then, we turn to Carr and to Zanettic who each have done critical theory work in public administration. This is followed by Heather Hopfl, who edited an issue on ethics of goodness, and does the kind of writing that makes deep connections. The next set of chapters make topic connections: rhizomatics, dialogics of co experience, story/narrative, and postmodern. The third set of topics focus on application: technofuturist, international business, economics, university, environment, accounting, spirituality, strategy, and ending with Mills’ work on silence of race/ethnicity in business (and public administration) ethics writing...|$|E
40|$|IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT, nowadays, that {{whenever}} I see a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>out</b> with “libertarian ” or “libertarianism ” in the title, I cringe. It {{is not because}} I don’t think that on net balance, they are not all forces for the good. They are. Given that they at least spell {{the name of this}} philosophy correctly, they do more good than harm. The more publications of this sort the better. If we are to promote libertarianism, it cannot be done without continually keeping the concept of liberty in the public mind, and there are few better ways to do this than by publishing more and more volumes on this topic. But, on the other hand, and, believe me, there is another hand, I still cringe when I peruse such titles. For example, consider Murray, 1997. Gordon’s 1997 title of the review of this book says it all: “Nationalize Education and Other Libertarian Ideas. ” To claim that libertarianism requires public schools, let alone vast new public expenditures on education is enough to register a high value on my cringe-o-meter. Tucker, 1997 reviews Boaz, 1997 and says: On health care, Social Security, education, and foreign policy, we don’t get principled theorizing so much as we get half-way and halfbaked policy plans for vouchers, Medical Savings Accounts …, the line-item veto, and revenue diversions of Social Security from bonds to stocks …. In short, Boaz presents libertarianism not as a radical and fundamental challenge to the socialist and social-democratic consensus that has dominated this century and erected the largest and most intrusive governments in human history...|$|E
