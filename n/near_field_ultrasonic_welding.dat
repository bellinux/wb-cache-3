In this mini-review, we highlight the development of imaging and ancillary techniques that have allowed SPM to permeate many key areas of contemporary research. We begin by examining the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by Binnig and Rohrer in 1982 and discuss how it served to team biologists with physicists to integrate high-resolution microscopy into biological science. We point to the problems of imaging nonconductive biological samples with the STM and relate how this led to the evolution of the atomic force microscope (AFM) developed by Binnig, Quate, and Gerber, in 1986. Commercialization in the late 1980 s established SPM as a powerful research tool in the biological research community. Contact mode AFM imaging was soon complemented by the development of non-contact imaging modes. These noncontact modes eventually became the primary focus for further new applications including the development of fast scanning methods. The extreme sensitivity of the AFM cantilever was recognized and has been developed into applications for measuring forces required for indenting biological surfaces and breaking bonds between biomolecules. Further functional augmentation to the cantilever tip allowed development of new and emerging techniques including scanning ionconductance microscopy (SICM), scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM), Kelvin force microscopy (KFM) and scanning <b>near</b> <b>field</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> holograph...|$|R

During <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding,</b> intensive material interactions occur {{due to the}} severe plastic deformation (SPD) and frictional heat generation, {{which leads to the}} microstructural change. Different grain microstructures have been observed after different <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> conditions. Theory of the microstructural evolution was for the first time hypothesized as three regimes, namely SPD, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and grain growth according to the material thermomechanical loading conditions. A novel metallo-thermo-mechanically coupled model was developed to model the temperature-dependent mechanical deformation and microstructural evolution during the <b>ultrasonic</b> spot <b>welding</b> process. The numerical analysis was carried out with a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model using DEFORM 11. 0.

Firstly, we showed that for thermoplastic composites, a simple flat energy director shape, made of a loose film of neat resin, can be used to produce welds of high quality. Furthermore, for single lap shear coupons, it was shown that the use of a microprocessor-controlled welder allows for in-situ monitoring through power and sonotrode displacement data. As a result, a smart <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> procedure was designed in which the feedback from the ultrasonic welder was used to define the processing parameters that yield optimum weld quality, significantly decreasing development times. Based on the knowledge developed at a lab-scale level, a welding strategy was developed to demonstrate the assembly of small and medium-sized components. Experimental comparison between ultrasonically spot-welded and mechanically fastened joints into double-lap shear and pull-through configurations further outlined the potential application of this technology, as well as its limitations. While <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> is an efficient technique to join thermoplastic composites components, another potential application was shown to be the welding of thermoplastic and thermoset composites, enabled through the very short heating times in the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> process.
