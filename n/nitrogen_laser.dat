25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm <b>nitrogen</b> <b>laser</b> for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A brief {{definition}} of tunable lasers is given. Detailed results on tunable dye lasers and on tunable diode lasers are presented, as obtained from 1975 – to date. First, the <b>nitrogen</b> pulsed <b>laser</b> was presented {{which is used}} to pump dye lasers: operation, main constructive elements, pulse time shapes and structure and beam power characteristics. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>lasers</b> designed and engineered by the group in the years 70 ’s – 90 ’s are also introduced. Secondly, results on dye lasers are presented: operation, laser cavities/optical resonators, spectral characteristics of the tunable laser radiation (tunability in the visible and near UV), time structure of the dye laser pulses, beam power evolution function of working parameters. The dye lasers engineered in-house in the years 70 ’s – 90 ’s are introduced, as well. The main applications developed using dye/tunable lasers are presented for two main fields: pollution control and biomedicine. Finally, tunable semiconductor lasers studies are introduced: tunable diode laser systems (emitting in the visible and NIR) mounted in Littrow extended cavities, beat note detection to measure emitted wavelengths stabilities for two tunable diode laser systems and the investigation of chaotic dynamics of an external-cavity semiconductor laser emitting in the regime of low-frequency fluctuations.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of certain properties of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>lasers</b> on various parameters {{have been examined}} and the design of two original <b>nitrogen</b> <b>lasers</b> is presented. The output characteristics of these lasers have been studied {{as a function of}} gas pressure, gas flow rate and direction, applied potential, repetition rate, electrode geometry, drive circuitry including the effects of preionization, and the effect of optical feedback by the addition of an optical cavity. The operation of these two lasers in a master oscillator/power amplifier configuration is described and the optimization of this system by varying the drive circuit parameters has been achieved. In the optimized state this configuration produced as much energy per pulse as did the amplifier when operating separately as an oscillator. However, the oscillator/amplifier system produces an output with some additional useful characteristics, such as lower beam divergence and a high degree of polarization. The design of a dye laser which uses a grating at grazing incidence and three mirrors is described. This laser utilizes the polarized output from the oscillator/amplifier system to generate simultaneously two independently tunable wavelengths. A novel pumping arrangement is used which ensures that there is no mode competition between the two wavelengths, that they can have any polarization ratio, that the linewidth of each wavelength can be independently varied and allows the two wavelengths to be generated in different dyes. <p...|$|R
5000|$|The intense {{discharge}} {{is reported}} to distort oscilloscopes nearby. This can be reduced by building the laser symmetrically into a grounded cylinder with the spark gap at the bottom, the laser at the top,capacitor 1 left and right, and capacitor 2 left and right stacked onto capacitor 1.This has the further advantage of reducing the inductance.And this has the disadvantage that the laser channel cannot be inspected for sparks anymore. Secondly, transmission line theory and waveguide theory is applied to achieve a traveling wave excitation.Measured <b>nitrogen</b> <b>laser</b> pulses are so long that the second step is unimportant.From this analysis it follows that: ...|$|E
50|$|The gas {{pressure}} in a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>laser</b> ranges {{from a few}} mbar {{to as much as}} several bar. Furthermore, air provides significantly less output energy than pure nitrogen or a mixture of nitrogen and helium. The pulse energy ranges from µJ to mJ (a commercial version using a spark gap delivers 300 microJ) and a peak power in the range of kW to more than 3 MW can be achieved. The pulse temporal width is between a few hundred picoseconds (typically at 1 atmosphere partial pressure of nitrogen) and a maximum of approximately 30 nanoseconds at reduced pressure (typically some dozens of Torr), though fwhm pulsewidths of 6 to 8 ns are typical.|$|E
50|$|Laserspray inlet {{ionization}} (LSII) is {{a subset}} of MAII and uses a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) method. It was originally called atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization however was renamed as LSII to avoid confusion with MALDI and as it {{was found to be}} a type of inlet ionization. As all inlet ionization techniques, highly multiply charged ions are produced. A <b>nitrogen</b> <b>laser</b> is used to ablate the solid matrix/analyte into the heated inlet tube, the observed ions are generated at the surface of the matrix/analyte and so the laser is not directly involved in the ionization as was originally thought. LSII can determine protein molecular weights and has been found to detect masses of proteins up to 20,000 Da. The sensitivity of LSII, for protein detection, is higher by an order of magnitude compared to ESI.|$|E
