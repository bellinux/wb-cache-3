40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{tested the}} hypothesis that <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect and <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition influence receptivity to affect- and cognition-based persuasive messages. Experiment 1 found that an affective message elicited more positive attitudes among individuals high in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect and low in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition, whereas a cognitive message elicited more positive attitudes among individuals low in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect and high in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition. Experiment 2 found that individual differences in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect influenced receptivity to an affect-based (but not cognition-based) message, whereas individual differences in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition influenced receptivity to a cognition-based (but not affect-based) message. Experiment 3 found that individual differences in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect were associated with increased recognition of information from an affect-based (but not cognition-based) message, whereas individual differences in <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition were associated with increased recognition of information from a cognition-based (but not affect-based) message.

The international consumer marketing literature suggests an instrument to measure consumers’ necessity for pohysical contact, called <b>Need</b> <b>for</b> Touch (NFT). This paper analyzes whether the <b>Need</b> <b>for</b> Touch structure is empirically consistent. Based on a literature review, we suggest six hypotheses {{in order to assess}} the nomological, convergent, and discriminant validity of the phenomenon.

The results also showed the dual characterization of <b>Need</b> <b>for</b> Touch as a bi-dimensional construct.

Participants comprised 287 workers, who were administered a self-reported questionnaire. Results confirmed the negative relationship between job insecurity, performance and mental health. The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> closure was positively related to job performance and unrelated to mental health. More interestingly, the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> closure exhibited multifaceted patterns of interactions with the different components of job insecurity. Higher <b>need</b> <b>for</b> closure revealed a buffering effect in conditions of higher quantitative job insecurity. In this case, individuals high (vs low) in the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> closure reported better job performance and mental health.
