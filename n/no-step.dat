5000|$|Despite a {{very large}} {{wingspan}} for a guard of 6'11" [...] (2.11 m) and some very impressive athletic scores at the 2001 NBA pre-draft camp, such as recording the highest <b>no-step</b> vertical jump (40") and the highest maximum vertical jump (46") that have ever been measured at the camp, Gregory went undrafted in the 2001 NBA draft.|$|E
5000|$|Maker {{attended}} the 2016 NBA Draft Combine, {{where he was}} measured as the third-tallest player without shoes at 6'11.75" [...] and recorded the highest <b>no-step</b> vertical jump (32") of any player over 6'11" [...] in NBA Draft Combine history. In {{the days leading up}} to the draft, a number of teams ruled themselves out of selecting Maker in the first round over concerns that his age had been misrepresented, as some believed Maker to be between 21-23 years of age despite being officially listed as a 19-year-old. Despite those concerns set around that time, he was selected with the 10th overall pick in the 2016 draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the first high school player taken in the first round since the 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement went into effect.|$|E
40|$|The YF- 12 {{airplane}} was {{studied to}} determine the pressure characteristics associated with an aft-facing step in high Reynolds number flow for nominal Mach numbers of 2. 20, 2. 50, and 2. 80. Base pressure coefficients were obtained for three step heights. The surface static pressures ahead of and behind the step were measured for the <b>no-step</b> condition and {{for each of the}} step heights. A boundary layer rake was used {{to determine the}} local boundary layer conditions. The Reynolds number based on the length of flow ahead of the step was approximately 10 to the 8 th power and the ratios of momentum thickness to step height ranged from 0. 2 to 1. 0. Base pressure coefficients were compared with other available data at similar Mach numbers and at ratios of momentum thickness to step height near 1. 0. In addition, the data were compared with base pressure coefficients calculated by a semiempirical prediction method. The base pressure ratios are shown to be a function of Reynolds number based on momentum thickness. Profiles of the surface pressures ahead of and behind the step and the local boundary layer conditions are also presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} Hindi-English bilinguals differing {{in their}} L 2 fluency on a saccadic countermanding task which taps inhibitory control {{as well as}} monitoring. We particularly explored whether response inhibition and performance monitoring within the oculomotor domain are affected by language proficiency in bilinguals. There were two different oculomotor redirect tasks: Visually Guided Redirect (VGR) task (Experiment 1) and Memory Guided Redirect (MGR) task (Experiment 2). In this task typically a target is presented to which subject must make saccade (No step trials), unless a new target appears on the other location after some delay from the first target onset (Step trials). On such trials participants are required to inhibit and cancel the saccade to the first instead program a saccade to the new target. Using trial switch reaction time (TSRT), which is the time taken to inhibit the initiated saccade to the first target, {{as a measure of}} response inhibition, and post-stop slowing as a measure of performance monitoring, we observed two important results. It was found that high proficiency bilinguals showed more post-stop slowing on the <b>no-step</b> trials as compared to the low proficiency bilinguals for both VGR and MGR. Secondly, high and low proficiency bilingual exhibited comparable TSRT in both VGR and MGR, showing no altering effect of language proficiency on the response inhibition in bilinguals. These results suggest that bilingualism impacts performance monitoring which is modulated by language proficiency if not the inhibitory control system. Higher fluency may lead to superior cognitive flexibility, and ability to adjust behaviour that facilitates attainment of cognitive goal. These findings are in consonance with other current studies that suggest a top-down effect of bilingualism on action control systems...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{characteristics}} play {{an important}} role in the selection of young basketball players and the progress in their playing performance. The aim of the study was to analyze differences in chosen physical characteristics of Slovak U 17 female basketball players with respect to their playing positions. We assumed, that there will be statistically significant differences between playing positions in each performance tests results. Chosen characteristics were analyzed for 14 players (mean/SD, age 16. 34 ± 0. 82; body height 179. 72 ± 8. 04 cm; body weight 67. 62 ± 7. 10 kg; body fat 16. 59 ± 2. 04 %; VO 2 max 46. 20 ± 4. 71 ml. kg− 1. min− 1) according to their playing positions (guard, forward, center). Five specific performance tests for each player were conducted as a 3 / 4 Basketball court sprint, 10 × 5 m Shuttle test, Lane agility drill, <b>No-step</b> vertical jump and Maximum vertical jump. The differences in tests results by playing positions were evaluated by one-way ANOVA. There were no significant differences found in results of chosen performance tests between playing positions (p>. 05). In spite of fact, that there were no significant differences, we found interesting results between playing positions in physical characteristics. Guards had better results in speed (3. 73 ± 0. 16 s), quickness (17. 43 ± 0. 56 s) and both lower-body power tests (47. 16 ± 3. 06 cm; 57. 00 ± 3. 40 cm) than forwards and centers. Forwards had the best results in agility test (12. 54 ± 0. 43 s). The results of this study produce useful information about physical characteristics of young basketball players according to their playing position and help to diagnose and improve their performance...|$|E
40|$|Five {{patients}} with lesions involving intra-parietal cortex (IPCx) {{were tested in}} a rapid version of the double step paradigm to investigate {{the role of the}} IPCx in the rapid, online, updating of a saccade program. Saccades were executed to a single target in either the contra- or the ipsilesional visual field. In two thirds of the trials, a step change in target position required that the saccade shifted to a new location within the same field but in the contra- or the ipsilesional direction, allowing us to investigate whether patients are able to update their saccade program given new exogenous information about the required endpoint of the saccade. This set-up resulted in three types of initial saccades: saccades to the target on <b>no-step</b> trials, uncorrected saccades to the original target location on step trials and corrected saccades to the new target location on step trials. Furthermore, if the updating of the original eye movement program failed, patients performed a second saccade to the new target location that required a rapid error correction. The analysis of the double-step task on a group level indicated that latencies for all trial types were longer when saccades were directed to the contralesional versus the ipsilesional field. Furthermore, longer latencies were required for patients to initiate a corrective second saccade after making an uncorrected first saccade in their contralesional compared to ipsilesional field. There were no differences in the ultimate landing positions of the eye movements for such corrected saccades. These results reveal that deficits in updating of saccade programs only seem to be present if the updating must occur after the gaze has shifted to a new location, pointing to a role of intra-parietal cortex in the processes involved in updating information when the current reference frame has to be updated. In conclusion, the paradigm deployed in the current study allows for a refinement {{of the role of the}} intra-parietal cortex in the updating of saccade programs...|$|E
