40|$|Crystallization of {{supersaturated}} liquids usually starts by heterogeneous nucleation. Mounting {{evidence shows}} that even homogeneous nucleation in simple liquids takes place in two steps; first a dense amorphous precursor forms, and the crystalline phase appears via heterogeneous nucleation in/on the precursor cluster. Herein, we review recent results by a simple dynamical density functional theory, the phase-field crystal model, for (precursor-mediated) homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of nanocrystals. It will be shown that the mismatch between the lattice constants of the <b>nucleating</b> <b>crystal</b> and the substrate plays a decisive {{role in determining the}} contact angle and nucleation barrier, which were found to be non-monotonic functions of the lattice mismatch. Time dependent studies are essential as investigations based on equilibrium properties often cannot identify the preferred nucleation pathways.

40|$|Abstract Background In IRCU it is {{uncertain}} whether variation of urinary protein, especially non-albumin protein (NAlb-P), {{is due to the}} presence of stones or reflects alteration of oxidative metabolism. Aims To validate in a tripartite cross-sectional study of 187 ambulatory male patients, undergoing a standardized laboratory programme, whether stones impact on N-Alb-P or the state of oxidative metabolism interferes with IRCU pathophysiology. Methods In part 1 the strata low and high of fasting urinary excretion rate per 2 h of N-Alb-P, malonedialdehyde, hypoxanthine, xanthine, pH and other urine components were compared, and association with renal stones in situ evaluated; in part 2 the co-variation of oxidatively modulated environment, fasting urinary pH, calcium (Ca) salt crystallization risk and the number of patients with stones in situ was examined; in part 3, the nucleation of Ca oxalate and Ca phosphate was tested in undiluted postprandial urine of patients and related to the state of oxidative metabolism. Results In part 1, N-Alb-P excretion > 4. 3 mg was associated with increase of blood pressure, excretion of total protein, hypoxanthine (a marker of tissue hypoxia), malonedialdehyde (a marker of lipid peroxidation), sodium, magnesium, citrate, uric acid, volume, pH, and increase of renal fractional excretion of both NAlb-P and uric acid; when stones were present, urinary pH was elevated but other parameters were unaffected. Significant predictors of N-Alb-P excretion were malonedialdehyde, fractional N-Alb-P and hypoxanthine. In part 2, urine pH > 6. 14 was associated with unchanged blood pressure and plasma vasopressin, increase of blood pH, urinary volume, malonedialde hyde, fractional excretion of N-Alb-P, uric acid, Ca phosphate, but not Ca oxalate, supersaturation; this spectrum was accompanied by decrease of concentration of urinary total and free magnesium, total and complexed citrate, plasma uric acid (in humans the major circulating antioxidant) and insulin; the number of stone-bearing patients was increased. Significant predictors of urine pH were body mass index, plasma insulin and uric acid (negative), and urinary xanthine (positive). In part 3 low plasma uric acid, not high urinary malonedialdehyde or high ratio malonedialdehyde/uric acid was significantly associated with diminished Ca but not oxalate tolerance, with the first <b>nucleating</b> <b>crystal</b> type being mostly Ca phosphate (hydroxyapatite), in the rest Ca oxalate dihydrate; uricemia correlated marginally positively (p = 0. 055) with Ca tolerance of urine, stronger with blood pressure and insulin, and negatively with urinary xanthine, fractional N-Alb-P, volume, sodium. Conclusions In IRCU 1) not renal stones in situ, but disturbed oxidative metabolism apparently modulates nephron functionality, ending up in higher renal NAlb-P release, urinary volume, sodium and pH of fasting urine; 2) etiologically unknown decline of uricemia may represent antioxidant deficiency and cause a risk of hydroxyapatite crystallization and stone formation in a weakly acidic or alkaline inhibitor-deficient and NAlb-P-rich milieu; 3) several observations, linking oxidative and systemic metabolism, are compatible with Ca stone initiation beyond tubules. </p...|$|E

La investigación realizada detalla el estudio realizado para conseguir la cristalización controlada sobre superficies funcionalizadas de determinados compuestos quirales y sales diastereoméricas. Para ello se realizaron estudios de cristalización de mencionados compuestos sobre diferentes superficies funcionalizadas. El estudio de la cristalización controlada sobre superficies funcionalizadas comienza por la funcionalización de dicha superficie con phencyphos 4 -metilentiol, la cual proporcionara resultados muy prometedores {{debido a}} su influencia, demostrada en esta tesis, sobre el proceso de cristalización. La cristalización de phencyphos sobre SAMs de este compuesto, no es controlada y presenta diferentes orientaciones. El disolvente es crucial ya que tiene una enorme influencia en el proceso, según el disolvente empleado en la cristalización de phencyphos sobre superficies funcionalizadas, en el caso de usar isopropanol se obtienen los cristales ramificados, un crecimiento muy peculiar. El método conocido como impresión por microcontacto (microcontact printing en inglés) ofrece un sistema en la superficie que permite favorecer el transporte de masa hacia la zona deseada de la superficie. Las cristalizaciones sobre superficies micropaternadas, tanto de phencyphos como de la sal diastereomérica (p-metilphencyphos y feniletilamina) se han conseguido controlar tras un estudio detallado del efecto del disolvente, el tiempo de la superficie en la disolución, la forma del patrón en superficie, los tioles combinados en superficie y la velocidad de evaporación. The research {{presented in this}} Thesis has as the main objective of the establish the effect of chiral self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the nucleation and the crystal growth of organic compound, and find conditions which favour heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth. The possibility to control crystallization processes using self-assembled monolayers is an extremely interesting and promising approach in organic materials. This control has achieved {{by the use of}} inorganic crystalline substrates where nucleation is induced via epitaxy, although organic single crystals and SAMs have been used to control the polymorphic selectivity of the compound to crystallize, which is based on the lattice match between the molecular cluster and crystalline substrate terraces. According to this concept, SAMs have been used as controlled nucleation centres. This research describes the study in order to achieve the controlled crystallization of the compound phencyphos and diastereomeric salts on functionalized surfaces, and shows the differences between homogenous SAMs and combined SAMs (Microcontact printing method). The controlled crystallisation study starts with the formation of SAMs on gold with a novel chiral thiol, which has potential for <b>nucleating</b> <b>crystal</b> growth, (phencyphos 4 -methylenthiol, PMT), and the crystallisation of phencyphos on them. The functionalisation of gold with monolayers of this compound has provided significant results due to its demonstrated influence in the crystallisation process. Thus, the successful functionalisation of the gold substrate by this resolving agent type molecule provided the chiral property to the self-assembled monolayer on gold. Phencyphos crystallises on PMT monolayer following different orientations and grow off the surface; depending on the solvent used these crystals grow as branched crystals (in isopropanol) on the functionalised surface. The microcontact printing method favours the mass transport to the desired thiol, minimizing evaporation effect at small scale. The surface combined of PMT and dodecanethiol has been the key for the development of surfaces which can induce the nucleation process on surface. On micropatterned surfaces, phencyphos crystallizes following a preferential orientation. Crystal growth is highly depending on the solvent used to crystalize phencyphos. The same enantiomer of phencyphos crystallized in different solvent (Chloroform and Isopropanol), yield different crystal growth, because the heterogeneous nucleation is effective when the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly from the surface, allowing good mass transport to the desired regions. The diastereomeric salt most studied and presented here is the one formed by a phencyphos derivate, p-methyl phencyphos which provides a pair of crystalline salts with chiral amines. X-ray crystal structure of this diastereomeric salt reveal 10 -membered rings constructed through hydrogen bonds, in which two ammonium groups formally replace phencyphos molecules seen in the phencyphos hydrate structure. The hydrogen bonds are strong and provide several polar faces to the crystalline structure, thus diastereomeric salts should have their crystals templated easily on polar SAM. There are several parameters that also have a dramatic influence on the crystallisation process such as the pattern shape and size which are critical. Thus the motif size which presents better results of favour the nucleation is for dots of 5 μm diameter spaced by 10 μm, for both crystallisation systems. The Dutch resolution has been also studied on micropatterned surfaces. The complexity of the family type crystallisation will require the development of specific additives to favour heterogeneous nucleation...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} and temperature dependence {{of both the}} nucleation and crystal growth rates in lithium diborate glass were determined in the temperature range, 490 to 520 °C. Comparison of the nucleation rates predicted by Classical Nucleation Theory and those found experimentally shows that the predicted classical nucleation rates are about 95 orders of magnitude smaller than the experimentally determined values. In addition, Classical Nucleation Theory does not predict the temperature dependence found experimentally. Comparison is also made with silicate glass systems which {{have been shown to}} exhibit homogeneous nucleation. Crystal nucleation in the lithium diborate glass almost certainly proceeds by a homogeneous mechanism. Comparisons are made between experimentally obtained values of the crystal growth rate in lithium diborate glass and those computed using surface <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystal</b> growth theory. Although the temperature dependence of the experimental growth rates at large undercoolings appears to be described well by the latter model, the computed values of the growth rates are about 60 orders of magnitude too small.

The cooling crystallization of INA from five different solvents resulted in two different polymorphs depending on the initial concentration of the solution.

Modeling of the evolution of the fringe patterns exposes the time dependence of the increasing crystal thickness. The initial diffusion-driven linear growth is followed by ripening-driven growth.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{nucleation}} in crystallization processes is a challenging task {{due to the}} often lacking knowledge on the process kinetics. Inflexible (predetermined) control strategies fail to grow the <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystals</b> to the desired quality because of the variability in the process conditions, disturbances, and the stochastic nature of crystal nucleation. Previously, the concept of microwave assisted direct nucleation control (DNC) was demonstrated in a laboratory setup to control the crystal size distribution in a batch crystallization process by manipulating the number of particles in the system. Rapid temperature cycling was used to manipulate the super(under) saturation and hence the number of crystals. The rapid heating response achieved with the microwave heating improved the DNC control efficiency, resulting in halving of the batch time. As an extension, this work presents a novel design in which the microwave applicator is integrated in the crystallizer, hence avoiding the external loop though the microwaves oven. DNC implemented in the 4 L unseeded crystallizer, at various count set points, resulted in strong efficiency enhancement of DNC, {{when compared to the}} performance with a slow responding system.

To explore isotopic equilibration rates as a function of illite growth, we studied B-isotope changes during illitization of smectite. Montmorillonite ( 2. 0 mm) fractions. The isotopic composition of B in the tetrahedral sheet was then measured for comparison with the predicted equilibrium values. The fine fraction showed equilibrium isotope ratios within 10 days, indicating that small, newly <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystals</b> precipitate in equilibrium with the fluid under supersaturated, closed conditions. These fine-fraction minerals did not re-equilibrate when the fluid was changed. The medium fraction gradually equilibrated with the initial fluid as illite grew to values> 50 %, but did not re-equilibrate with the later fluid. The coarse fraction was slow to begin recrystallization, perhaps due to dissolution kinetics of large crystals or the presence of detrital contaminants. However, it showed the fastest rate of isotopic change with crystal growth after R 1 ordering. We conclude that at 300 ëC, the initial BÿO bonds formed in illite are stable, and isotopic re-equilibration only occurs on new crystal growth. Therefore, different isotope ratios are preserved in different crystal size fractions due to different rates of crystal growth. Large crystals may reflect equilibrium with recent fluid while smaller crystals may retain isotope compositions reflecting equilibrium with earlier fluids...|$|R

Measurement of solubility {{as a function}} of temperature reveals less than ideal behaviour, consistent with strong solute-solute interactions, particularly in the case of acetonitrile. The crystal growth rates of the { 001 } and { 011 } faces of spontaneously <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystals</b> are precisely measured in situ using optical microscopy revealing that their respective growth rates increase with increasing supersaturation to different extents, depending on the solvent type, with concomitant impact on the crystal habit.

Analysis of the growth rates versus supersaturation is consistent with a 2 -D surface nucleation (Birth and Spread) model for both faces and at both scale sizes. The growth rates of the { 001 } and { 011 } faces exhibit much less growth rate dispersion when compared to literature data for a stirred batch crystallizer.

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} in the literature that for effective grain refinement some solute is required in the melt to restrict {{the growth of the}} solid even if potent nucleating particles with a favourable physical nature are present. In this paper, we investigate the effect of solute on grain initiation in an isothermal melt, and an analytical model is developed to account for the effect of solute elements on the grain size. This study revealed that the solute elements in the liquid ahead of the growing crystals reduce the growth velocity of the <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystals,</b> and increase the maximum undercooling achievable before recalescence. This allows for more particles to be active for nucleation, and consequently increases the number density of active particles, giving rise to a finer grain size. The analytical model shows that the final grain size can be related to the maximum undercooling, average growth velocity and solid fraction at the moment of the recalescence. Further analysis using the free growth model and experimental data in the literature revealed that for a given alloy system solidified under similar conditions the grain size can be empirically related to 1 /Q (Q is the growth restriction factor) to a power of 1 / 3, which is considerably different from the empirical linear relationship in the literature.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether PtdCho species modulate the metastable-labile limit and equilibrium solubility of cholesterol in the micellar phase of bile, thereby altering the distribution of cholesterol to biliary lipid carriers and thus influencing cholesterol crystallization. Supersaturated model bile (with a cholesterol saturation index of 2. 0 and a total lipid concentration of 10 g/dl) was prepared with various PtdCho/(bile salt+PtdCho) ratios (0. 1 - 0. 5) using egg yolk or soya bean PtdCho. Subsequently, the following features were determined: metastable-labile limit, equilibrium solubility of cholesterol, metastable zone, and cholesterol crystallization process. Less hydrophobic PtdCho species destabilized bile cholesterol to induce rapid crystallization, because of a broad integrated metastable zone, whereas more hydrophobic species stabilized bile cholesterol with a less integrated metastable zone and thus retarded cholesterol crystallization. Cholesterol crystallization was accelerated by a decrease in the PtdCho/(bile salt+PtdCho) ratio, whereas the final <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystal</b> mass was increased by an increase in this ratio. With decreasing hydrophobicity of the PtdCho species, the intermixed micellar/vesicular concentration of bile salts decreased in association with less formation of vesicles and increased formation of micelles, and a variety of crystal forms were detected. In conclusion, PtdCho species directly influenced the cholesterol crystallization process in model bile by remodelling the bile mesophase, and also had an indirect influence by altering the balance between bile salt micelles and vesicles...|$|R

This equilibrium concentration for each crystal facet can be characterized by Clausius–Clapeyron relation with regard to its surface energy. The diagram of atmospheric {{ice crystals}} morphology in dependence from absolute and relative vapor supersaturation of atmosphere is developed. It is determined that the relation of height H and diameter D of atmospheric crystals increases at a growth of relative supersaturation, Δ c i /c i, but increases at a growth of absolute supersaturation, Δ c i = c i  – c a. The alteration of H/D occurs gradually, which explains conditional character of delimitation on types on the base of this index. The field of absolute and relative supersaturation it is possible to subdivide relatively index H/D value in two parts: columnar forms area, where index H/D > 0. 89 and lamellar forms area, where H/D < 0. 89. Columnar and needle forms it is possible to characterize as low temperature forms, but lamellar, short-columnar and irregular forms – as high temperature forms. The variety of atmospheric crystal forms is subdivided on four basic groups: solid lamellar, solid columnar, dendrite lamellar and hollow columnar. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a deeper {{understanding}} of the solidification of metals from their melts, colloidal model systems were established which facilitate a much simpler observation and analysis of the processes involved, due to their nanoscopic spatial scale and their decelerated temporal dynamics. The samples studied consist of aqueous suspensions of high X-ray scattering contrast, spherical silica particles of distinct diameter in the nanometer range which exhibit a tunable interaction via a screened Coulomb potential. Upon confinement their mutual repulsion due to negatively charged silanol surface groups favours crystallization into body-centered cubic colloidal crystals which may be molten by applied shear. Previous experiments focused on the phase behaviour and the nucleation kinetics of single-component charged colloidal silica spheres. Here we report on corresponding experiments particularly devoted to binary mixtures, thus allowing for systematic variation of size (and thereby charge) as well as composition ratios. A set of three mono-, bi- and polydisperse samples where investigated by means of time-resolved ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (BW 4 @ HASYLAB, DESY, Hamburg) in order to determine the phase behaviour and nucleation kinetics for homo- and heterogeneously <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystals</b> in dependence of particle number density and sodium hydroxide concentration. In addition, time-resolved in-house Bragg-microscopy together with static light scattering were used to complement the synchrotron measurements. As a first result a re-entrant crystallization was observed while steadily increasing the amount of large particles in a suspension of smaller ones (size ratio dL/dS 2). Further results show a sensitive dependence of the nucleation kinetics, regarding crystal growth and size, on the composition. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{new theory}} of ice {{nucleation}} by heterogeneous freezing of deliquescent mixed cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) presented in Part I is {{incorporated into a}} parcel model with explicit water and ice bin microphysics to simulate the process of ice nucleation under transient thermodynamic conditions. Simula-tions are conducted over the temperature range 4 ° to 60 °C, with vertical velocities varying from 1 to 100 cm s 1, for varying initial relative humidities and aerosol characteristics. These simulations show that the same CCN {{that are responsible for}} the drop nucleation may initiate crystal nucleation and can be identified as ice nuclei (IN) when crystals form. The simulated nucleation rates and concentrations of <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystals</b> depend on temperature and supersaturation simultaneously, showing good agreement with obser-vations but with noticeable differences when compared with classical temperature-only and supersatura-tion-only parameterizations. The kinetics of heterogeneous ice nucleation exhibits a negative feedback via water supersaturation, whereby ice nucleation depends on the water supersaturation that is diminished by ice crystal diffusional growth. This feedback is stronger than the corresponding feedback for drop nucle-ation, and may explain discrepancies between observed ice nuclei concentrations and ice crystal concen-trations, the very small fraction of CCN that may serve as IN, and the much smaller crystal concentrations as compared to drop concentrations. The relative importance of heterogeneous versus homogeneous nucle-ation is examined for a variety of cloud conditions. Based on these calculations, a simple parameterization for ice crystal concentration is suggested for use in cloud models and large-scale models. 1...|$|R

Published by Elsevier LtdIt is well accepted in the literature that for effective grain refinement some solute is required in the melt to restrict the growth of the solid even if potent nucleating particles with a favourable physical nature are present. In this paper we investigate the effect of the solute on grain initiation in an isothermal melt, and an analytical model is developed to account for the effect of solute elements on grain size. This study revealed that the solute elements in the liquid ahead of the growing crystals reduce the growth velocity of the <b>nucleated</b> <b>crystals</b> and increase the maximum undercooling achievable before recalescence. This allows more particles to be active in nucleation and, consequently, increases the number density of active particles, giving rise to a finer grain size. The analytical model shows that the final grain size can be related to the maximum undercooling, average growth velocity and solid fraction at the moment of recalescence. Further analysis using the free growth model and experimental data in the literature revealed that for a given alloy system solidified under similar conditions the grain size can be empirically related to 1 /Q (Q is the growth restriction factor) to a power of 1 / 3, which is considerably different from the empirical linear relationship in the literature. It is demonstrated that the 1 / 3 power law can describe the experimental data more accurately than a linear relationship.
