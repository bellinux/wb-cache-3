500|$|Because of {{the varied}} {{reception}} to Kilmer's poem and its simple rhyme and meter, {{it has been}} the model for several parodies written by humorists and poets alike. [...] While keeping with Kilmer's iambic tetrameter rhythm and its couplet rhyme scheme, and references to the original poem's thematic material, such parodies are often immediately recognizable, as is seen in [...] "Song of the Open Road" [...] written by poet and humorist Ogden Nash: [...] "I think that I shall never see / A billboard lovely as a tree. / Indeed, unless the billboards fall, / I'll <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> tree at all." ...|$|E
500|$|The Room has {{received}} negative reviews for its acting, screenplay, dialogue, production values, score, direction, and cinematography. The film {{is described as}} one of the worst films ever made by several publications. By 2017, the film had a score of 32% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews with an average rating of 3.3 out of 10. The critical consensus states [...] "A bona-fide classic of midnight cinema, Tommy Wiseau's misguided masterpiece subverts the rules of filmmaking with a boundless enthusiasm that renders such mundanities as acting, screenwriting, and cinematography utterly irrelevant. You will <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> football the same way again." [...] Despite the criticism, the film {{has received}} a positive reception from audiences for the same reasons, with some viewers calling it the [...] "best worst movie ever".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the film}} was complete, {{producer}} Dauman told Resnais that he was [...] "delighted to have produced the film", but that he guaranteed that [...] "It will <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> theatrical release". In December 1955, French censors wanted some scenes cut from Night and Fog. The {{end of the film}} showed scenes of bodies being bulldozed into mass graves, which some censors considered too horrifying to be allowed in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Within a few months, {{the band}} {{convinced}} rising star Trent Reznor {{to produce the}} album instead. The abrasive sonic [...] "rawness" [...] that Mosimann's production had brought to such groups as Swans had failed to materialize on The Manson Family Album; Reznor and all the band's members thought it [...] "sucked", and was poorly representative of Marilyn Manson's dynamic live performances. In October 1993, Reznor agreed to fully commit to the project, taking them and their tapes to various studios in Los Angeles. With the help of Reznor and numerous live members of his band, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson re-recorded and reworked their old material until they were satisfied and released it under the name Portrait of an American Family. [...] "Snake Eyes and Sissies" [...] would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> single release and in the album's credits Mosimann is credited as an engineer with no mention of his production work.|$|E
