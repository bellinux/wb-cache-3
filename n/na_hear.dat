40|$|Self-compassion is {{the ability}} to be kind and {{understanding}} towards oneself in times of distress or failure (Neff, 2003 a). Self-compassion in adulthood is linked to childhood experiences of care and compassion (Gilbert 2005), and is associated with a number of positive outcomes. Experimental studies show that self-compassion increases in response to explicit instruction (Leary et al., 2007); however, the implicit effect of one’s current social interactions on self-compassion remains unknown. This study examined whether hearing someone talk self-compassionately about an academic failure would unconsciously increase the listener’s self-compassion levels when recalling their own personal failure. Participants were 90 female undergraduates. In session 1, they completed the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965) and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) (Neff, 2003). In session 2, participants recalled a personal academic failure. They then listened to an audio clip of someone describing her academic failure in a self-compassionate, self-esteem preserving, or factual way. Participants subsequently completed measures of affect and state self-compassion vis-à-vis their failure. Results showed that controlling for trait self-compassion and self-esteem, there was a significant effect of condition on state self-compassion such that those in the self-compassion condition reported significantly higher state self-compassion compared to the other two conditions. There was also a main effect of condition on negative affect (NA). Contrasts revealed that controlling for pre-manipulation NA, those in the self-compassion condition had significantly lower <b>NA</b> after <b>hearing</b> the audio clip than those in the other two conditions. Findings are the first to indicate that exposure to another person’s display of self-compassion has a significant effect on one’s own self-compassion levels and affect. These findings also suggest that raising self-compassion may not require targeted individual interventions; rather, modeling self-compassionate behavior may be sufficient to quickly yield higher self-compassion in others. Additional implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|O progresso das pesquisas relacionadas à perda auditiva genética tem provocado um importante avanço do entendimento dos mecanismos moleculares que governam o desenvolvimento, a função, a resposta ao trauma e o envelhecimento do ouvido interno. Em países desenvolvidos, mais de 50 % dos casos de surdez na infância é causada por alterações genéticas e as perdas auditivas relacionadas à idade têm sido associadas com mecanismos genéticos. OBJETIVO: O objetivo desta revisão é relatar as informações mais recentes relacionadas às perdas audtivas de origem genética. FORAMA DE ESTUDO: Revisão sistemática. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: A revisão da {{literatura}} inclui artigos indexados à MEDLINE (Biblioteca Nacional de Saúde, NIH-USA) e publicados nos últimos 3 anos, além das informações disponíveis <b>na</b> Hereditary <b>Hearing</b> Loss Home Page. CONCLUSÃO: Os recentes avanços no entendimento das perdas auditivas de origem genética têm favorecido a nossa compreensão da função auditiva e tornado o diagnóstico mais apurado. Possivelmente, no futuro, este conhecimento também proporcionará o desenvolvimento de novas terapias para o tratamento das causas genéticas das perdas auditivas. The {{progress in}} the research of genetic hearing loss has advanced {{our understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms that govern inner ear development, function and response to injury and aging. In the developed world, over 50 % of childhood deafness is attributable to genetic causes and even age-related hearing loss has been associated with genetic mechanisms. AIM: The objective of this review is to summarize recent knowledge in genetic hearing loss. STUDY DESIGN: Sistematic review. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature review included articles indexed at MEDLINE (The National Library of Medicine, The National Institute of Health - USA) focusing on publications from the past 3 years plus the information available at the Hereditary Hearing Loss Home Page. CONCLUSION: Advances in the genetics of hearing loss have enhanced our comprehension of auditory function and have enabled more accurate diagnosis. Hopefully, as we further understand the molecular elements of the auditory system, this knowledge will help in the development of new therapies for the treatment of the underlying genetic defects...|$|R
500|$|Life Is Good {{features}} nostalgic {{and adult}} themes, including aging and maturity. Nas' rapping {{is characterized by}} internal rhymes, a relaxed, plainspoken flow, and transparent lyrics addressing moments in his life, including his youth and the personal {{events leading up to}} the album. Erika Ramirez of Billboard observes [...] "stories of internal and external battles, some of which he won and some he lost." [...] David Dennis of The Village Voice writes that his lyrics address hip hop's [...] "golden era" [...] and [...] "the trials and tribulations of adult relationships". Brandon Soderberg from Spin asserts that his lyrics [...] "constantly remind nostalgics that the good ol' days were often chaotic and desperate". Slant Magazines Manan Desai finds Nas' comparison of his album to Gaye's Here, My Dear apropos. [...] "Like Nas, Gaye was pushing 40 when he recorded his album", Desai wrote. [...] "He'd cemented his position as one of R's greatest, and yet, he never sounded more anguished about where all that fame was leading him. There's something similar going on throughout Life Is Good; the more we <b>hear</b> <b>Nas</b> repeat that titular refrain, the less convincing he sounds." [...] AllMusic's David Jeffries said the lyrics about his divorce were [...] "unfiltered carpet bombing of love and marriage"; both Jeffries and Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic characterize the content as [...] "venomous". Conversely, Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone views that Nas [...] "cuts his rhymes with midlife realism and daring empathy". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe writes that the songs [...] "mix anger, nostalgia, and insight." ...|$|R
