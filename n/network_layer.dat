25|$|For {{multi-access}} {{links with}} their own addressing systems (e.g. Ethernet) an address mapping protocol is needed.

40|$|This study {{extends the}} SIS {{epidemic}} model for single virus propagation over an arbitrary graph to an SI 1 SI 2 S epidemic model of two exclusive, competitive viruses over a two-layer network with generic structure, where <b>network</b> <b>layers</b> represent the distinct transmission routes of the viruses. We find analytical results determining extinction, mutual exclusion, and coexistence of the viruses by introducing {{the concepts of}} survival threshold and winning threshold. Furthermore, we show the possibility of coexistence in SIS-type competitive spreading over multilayer networks. Not only do we rigorously prove a region of coexistence, we quantitate it via interrelation of central nodes across the <b>network</b> <b>layers.</b> Little to no overlapping of layers central nodes is the key determinant of coexistence. Specifically, we show coexistence is impossible if <b>network</b> <b>layers</b> are identical yet possible if the <b>network</b> <b>layers</b> have distinct dominant eigenvectors and node degree vectors. For example, we show both analytically and numerically that positive correlation of <b>network</b> <b>layers</b> {{makes it difficult for}} a virus to survive while in a network with negatively correlated layers survival is easier but total removal of the other virus is more difficult. We believe our methodology has great potentials for application to broader classes of multi-pathogen spreading over multi-layer and interconnected networks...|$|R

25|$|Some of the {{protocols}} carried by IP, such as ICMP {{which is used}} to transmit diagnostic information, and IGMP {{which is used to}} manage IP Multicast data, are layered on top of IP but perform internetworking functions. This illustrates the differences in the architecture of the TCP/IP stack of the Internet and the OSI model. The TCP/IP model's internet layer corresponds to layer three of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, where it {{is referred to as the}} <b>network</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
25|$|This type {{of attack}} {{involves}} massive <b>network</b> <b>layer</b> DDoS attacks through to focused application layer (HTTP) floods, followed by repeated (at varying intervals) SQLi and XSS attacks. Typically, the perpetrators can simultaneously use from 2 to 5 attack vectors involving {{up to several}} {{tens of millions of}} requests per second, often accompanied by large SYN floods that can not only attack the victim but also any service provider implementing any sort of managed DDoS mitigation capability. These attacks can persist for several weeks- the longest continuous period noted so far lasted 38 days. This APDoS attack involved approximately 50+ petabits (50,000+ terabits) of malicious traffic.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions {{and access to}} databases. It requires less resources and often accompanies <b>network</b> <b>layer</b> attacks. An attack is disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets. The attack on the {{application layer}} can disrupt services such as the retrieval of information or search function as well as web browser function, email services and photo applications. In order to be deemed a distributed denial of service attack, more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks should be used; using fewer than 3–5 nodes qualifies as a Denial-of-service attack and not a DDoS.|$|E
30|$|Traditional layered design cannot provide QoS for mobile {{multimedia}} {{because of its}} limited adaptation to the dynamic wireless channels and interaction between layers. The goal of a cross-layer design {{is to improve the}} overall performance of the {{mobile multimedia}} applications, including the quality of video and power consumption. Cross-layer design jointly adjusts the parameters of different <b>network</b> <b>layers,</b> but the computation is complicated. Cross-layer optimization is very complex since it requires the optimization of multiple parameters across the <b>network</b> <b>layers.</b> One of the challenges of cross-layer design is the difficulty to model the complex cross-layer interactions among the parameters at different <b>network</b> <b>layers.</b> In general, there is a trade-off between the performance and complexity in the cross-layer optimization. A low-complexity cross-layer design is desired.|$|R
