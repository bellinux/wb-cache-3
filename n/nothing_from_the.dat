5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E

25|$|Middlesbrough were on top {{for much}} of the game at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, but {{ultimately}} came away with <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2–0 defeat. Mido was set to start, but was injured in the warm-up and was replaced by the initially-benched Alves. Downing and Alves created a host of good chances but none were converted. With sixteen minutes to go before the final whistle, Aliadière was brought down in the penalty area, but Downing sent his penalty kick flying over the bar for his second penalty miss of the season. The visitors were punished for their inability to score when Michael Chopra scored two goals in the final ten minutes.|$|E

Sherrod says that she immediately notified the USDA about the videos, saying that they did not convey the entire or accurate story. She heard <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> USDA until Monday, July 19, 2010, when she was put on administrative leave and then asked to resign. Released White House emails show the Obama administration was aware of the situation, but {{there was no evidence that}} the dismissal of Sherrod was under orders of the White House.|$|E

25|$|Detention {{could take}} three forms. First, the Gelinder Arrest (“mild detention”) {{of up to}} nine weeks simply {{involved}} locking up the prisoner, but theoretically with no further deprivation. Second was the Mittelarrest, lasting up to three weeks. The prisoner could receive <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside except 10000 g of potato bread and a supplement {{on the fourth day}} of captivity. Finally, the Strenger Arrest, lasting two weeks, was similar to the Mittelarrest but included light deprivation. If no detention cell was available in the camp, standing at a post was used as punishment, in which case German military regulations specified that prisoners punished with Strenger Arrest must also stand at a post for two hours a day.|$|E
25|$|Venice, Southern Italy and Sicily {{served as}} {{outposts}} of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy. Venice's close mercantile {{links to the}} Byzantine empire resulted in the architecture of that city and its vicinity being a blend of Byzantine and northern Italian influences, although <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ninth and tenth centuries has survived except for {{the foundations of the}} first St. Mark's Basilica. This building was presumably similar to Justinian's Church of the Holy Apostles based on its layout, but how it was roofed is unknown. That southern Italy was reconquered and ruled by a Byzantine governor from about 970 to 1071 explains the relatively large number of small and rustic Middle Byzantine-style churches found there, including the Cattolica in Stilo and S. Marco in Rossano. Both are cross-in-square churches with five small domes on drums in a quincunx pattern and date either to the period of Byzantine rule or after. The church architecture of Sicily has fewer examples from the Byzantine period, having been conquered by Muslims in 827, but quincunx churches exist with single domes on tall central drums and either Byzantine pendentives or Islamic squinches. Very little architecture from the Islamic period survives on the island, either.|$|E

500|$|Philitas {{was thin}} and frail, and may have {{suffered}} and died from a wasting disease. He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280sBC. His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a plane tree {{by the people of}} Cos, depicting him as [...] "frail with all the glosses". His contemporary Posidippus wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus, which [...] "included <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> physique of heroes. No,... he cast the old man full of cares." [...] The 3rd centuryAD Roman author Aelian skeptically passed along a story that Philitas was so thin that he put lead weights in the soles of his shoes to avoid being blown away by a stiff wind.|$|E
500|$|The Cavalier Parliament {{opposed the}} Declaration of Indulgence on {{constitutional}} grounds {{by claiming that}} the king {{had no right to}} arbitrarily suspend laws passed by Parliament. Charles withdrew the Declaration, and also agreed to the Test Act, which not only required public officials to receive the sacrament under the forms prescribed by the Church of England, but also later forced them to denounce certain teachings of the Catholic Church as [...] "superstitious and idolatrous". Clifford, who had converted to Catholicism, resigned rather than take the oath, and committed suicide shortly after. By 1674 England had gained <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Dutch War, and the Cavalier Parliament refused to provide further funds, forcing Charles to make peace. The power of the Cabal waned and that of Clifford's replacement, Lord Danby, grew.|$|E
500|$|Francis, however, had no {{intentions}} of {{complying with the}} remaining provisions of the Treaty of Madrid. [...] On 22 March, with the Pope's blessing, he proclaimed {{that he would not}} be bound by the Treaty of Madrid because it had been signed under duress. [...] Clement VII, who had meanwhile become convinced that the Emperor's growing power was a threat to his own position in Italy, sent envoys to Francis and Henry VIII suggesting an alliance against Charles. [...] Henry, having received <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Madrid, was receptive to the offers. [...] In May, Francis and the Pope launched the War of the League of Cognac in an attempt to reclaim the territory the French had lost; Henry, rebuffed in his attempt to have the alliance signed in England, would not join until 1527. [...] The war would prove unsuccessful; but Francis and his successor, Henry II, would continue to assert their claims to Milan through the remainder of the Italian Wars, only relinquishing them after the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on the game's presentation. IGN called its {{graphics}} and audio [...] "decent", and felt its interface and menu system worked well, though they lacked polish. GameSpot felt that the graphics, while colorful, were bland and only a small improvement over sixth-generation games, a sentiment echoed by 1UP.com. Game Informer and Eurogamer made note of several graphical glitches. The latter also criticized the decision to continue the Sonic Adventure (1998) style of gameplay, believing that Sonic Team had learned <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> criticisms of past games. Reviewers found fault with the game's camera system, loading times, controls, level designs, and glitches. GameSpot claimed the level design was worsened by the frustrating camera system, and Game Informer noted the game's high difficulty, citing the camera as causing most deaths. Some reviewers were unhappy {{that the majority of}} the game was not spent playing as Sonic; playing as Tails, GameSpot wrote, made a level boring. Similar criticism was offered by Eurogamer, which found that the supporting cast annoyed rather than fleshed the game out, and considered the camera system to be the worst they had ever seen in a video game. 1UP felt that despite the control and level design problems, the game still played like a Sonic game.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the truth}} of the {{accounts}} has been disputed by some historians; in 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches which failed due to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to [...] "kick-about" [...] matches with [...] "made-up footballs" [...] such as a bully-beef tin. Chris Baker, former chairman of The Western Front Association and author of The Truce: The Day the War Stopped is also sceptical, but says that although there is little hard evidence, the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: [...] "There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Germans. If somebody one day found a letter from a German soldier who was in that area, then we would have something credible." [...] In fact, there is a German reference. Leutnant Kurt Zehmisch of Germany's 134th Saxons Infantry Regiment said that the English [...] "brought a soccer ball from their trenches, and pretty soon a lively game ensued. How marvelously wonderful, yet how strange it was". In 2011, Mike Dash concluded that [...] "there is plenty of evidence that football was played that Christmas Day—mostly by men of the same nationality, but in at least three or four places between troops from the opposing armies".|$|E
500|$|The Eagle {{had been}} stocked with safety {{equipment}} such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in {{the form of a}} bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the basket but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care, or with any acknowledgement of adopting indigenous peoples' techniques for dealing with the extreme environment. In this, Andrée contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers. Sven Lundström points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for the team due to Andrée's mistaken design of the sleds, with a rigid construction that borrowed <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> long proven Inuit sleds, and were so impractical for the difficult terrain. Andrée called it [...] "dreadful terrain", with channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over melt ponds. The men's clothes included no furs but were woollen coats and trousers, plus oilskins. They wore the oilskins but the explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. Danger was everywhere, as it would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{argued that}} the album was their most {{consistent}} and strongest album to date. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone felt that the album was [...] "experimental and expansive". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt that the album lacked [...] "freshness or spontaneity" [...] that {{was found in the}} band's debut album, calling only two songs on the album [...] "very visionary". Jim Farber of the Daily News criticized Williams, saying [...] "Even aided by studio correction, the guy can't sing", calling it [...] "bad singing at its engaging best". Cohen of Pitchfork Media bashed the lyrics, saying that the writing was [...] "far down the list of what N.E.R.D. is actually good at". Hoard of Rolling Stone felt he learned <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lyrics except that Williams was sexually aroused. Henriques of PopMatters noted that Williams is not a [...] "technically gifted rapper", he [...] "does not have a beautiful voice" [...] and his lyrics are [...] "typically inconsequential in a 'saying shit just to sound cool' sort of way", but found strengths in his choruses, which he pointed out [...] "typically use a catchy phrase or recognizable melody as an anchor for his nonsensical verses". Dan Charnas of The Washington Post commended N.E.R.D for their songwriting, writing that Seeing Sounds [...] "combines the adolescent and clever". The Times writer Priya Elan gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that band is [...] "pushing the boundaries of the popular song". [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention (...) and stated, [...] "Beats of course, songs usually, singing barely--especially sincere-type singing"; he also picked out two songs from the album: [...] "Anti-Matter" [...] and [...] "Everyone Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)".|$|E
500|$|The Australians toured England in 1905, but Bosanquet {{played only}} three games {{before the first}} Test. He scored 93 against Nottinghamshire, while against Sussex, he scored centuries in each innings {{for the second time}} in his career. His first innings century took 105 minutes and his second took 75 minutes. He also took eight for 53 in the second innings to bowl Middlesex to victory and give him 11 wickets in the game. He became the first player in {{first-class}} cricket to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same match; only two further players have since achieved the feat, as of 2015. Bosanquet was selected for the opening Test match, his first such appearance in England. In England's first innings, he assisted in a recovery, making his highest Test score of 27. Australia took a first innings lead, but despite a failure by Bosanquet, England scored 426 for five declared in their second innings. Australia were set 402 to win, which was considered unlikely in the time available so the tourists had to bat until the end of the game to achieve a draw. The pitch remained good for batting and Australia reached 62 without losing a wicket. Subsequently, Bosanquet took five quick wickets, including a good catch from his own bowling to dismiss Hill, to reduce Australia to 100 for five. Although the tourists managed a partial recovery, Bosanquet continued to take wickets. With very little time remaining owing to poor light—if play had stopped, Australia would have achieved a draw—he took the last wicket to fall, giving England a 213-run victory. Bosanquet had taken his best Test figures of eight for 107. Wisden reported: [...] "The Englishmen owed everything to Bosanquet... He gained <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> condition of the ground, the pitch remaining firm and true to the end." ...|$|E
