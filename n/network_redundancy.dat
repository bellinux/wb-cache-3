Sometimes an ally, sometimes a foe, redundancy is an inherent feature of sensor networks that has to be very carefully examined in order to improve important aspects of their functioning. Moreover, this paper presents two methodologies: one that implies both components of spatial redundancy and one that implies the use of temporal redundancy for achieving the objective of fault-tolerant and safe operation. In the end, the fields in which the redundancy could be applied with significant results are highlighted.

40|$|Abstract—Due to {{frequent}} link failures in multi-hop wireless <b>networks,</b> <b>redundancy</b> {{can be an}} important feature. For example, when planning the structure of a backhaul mesh network for public access, it is common to introduce redundant nodes in the mesh network. These are called redundant, because they do not increase the network capacity under normal operation, due to the shortest-path metric of the routing protocol. Instead, their sole purpose is to increase the network reliability by providing failover links when a link in the shortest-path fails. This paper shows how to estimate the optimal number of redundant nodes for a given topology. In order to do so, a method to calculate the additional network reliability that results from introducing a redundant node to a given topology is also proposed. I...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} electroencephalographic correlates in chronically depressed patients compared to healthy controls using intracutaneously applied electrical pain stimulus, {{to better understand}} the interaction between pain processing and depression. A close interaction between pain and depression is generally recognized although the precise mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The present study focuses on the hypothesis that effective brain connectivity in major depression patients is altered. Multifunctional interactions between brain regions represent a robust index of effective interactions within the brain, and can be quantified by <b>network</b> <b>redundancy.</b> Thus, structural network differences between 18 normal controls and 18 major depression patients before as well as during the processing of moderately painful intracutaneous electrical stimuli were investigated on the basis of <b>network</b> <b>redundancy</b> differences. In our sample, both patients and control subjects exhibit comparable network redundancies before stimulus application. Caused by the stimulus, there is a global increase of <b>network</b> <b>redundancy</b> in both groups. This increase is diminished in the group of major depression patients.

40|$|The paper {{critically}} {{discusses the}} widespread literature focusing on informal post-communist “clans,” “networks,” or “fiefdoms. ” Often self-described as determinedly empirical, the “clan” paradigm is crucially shaped by {{its origins in}} the analysis of East Asia, as well as by its use as an ideal-typical opposite of Western-style hands-off market contracting in the “markets and hierarchies” literature. To counter such deficiencies, the paper proposes an alternative argument. Although interactions are indeed personalized, interpersonal trust in many post-communist countries has failed to compensate for missing institutional safeguards. Rather, confronted with an environment of low trust and high uncertainty, actors have developed two main coping strategies: on the one hand vertical integration, on the other hand a hedging strategy of purposeful <b>network</b> <b>redundancy.</b> Even though trust and enforcement remain low, actors can minimize the consequences of default by maintaining multiple ties. The consequences of such organizational strategies are ambiguous. By compensating for defaults, <b>network</b> <b>redundancy</b> has cushioned the impact of economic crisis.

Furthermore, effective measures of <b>network</b> <b>redundancy</b> are important to policy makers in understanding the current resilience and future planning to mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gases. The proposed junction indices cover the static aspect of redundancy, i. e. alternative paths, and the dynamic feature of redundancy reflected by the availability of spare capacity under different network loading and service level.

Furthermore, the developed redundancy indices responded well to demand variation under the same network conditions and supply variations.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the structure and}} function of gene regulatory networks, {{it is important to}} first catalogue the components. Measurable constituents of networks include cis-regulatory elements, identified by their conservation and ability to drive expression; transcription factor binding motifs, identified by protein binding; transcription factors, identified by their necessity in network function; and target genes, identified by their conditional expression. The heart of a regulatory network is the transcription factor, which is dedicated to its role in the network. Transcription factors must be activated and regulate downstream targets in a discrete and reproducible fashion. Any deviation in network function may result in the collapse of the network and death of the animal. Thus, a network must be robust enough to function under a variety of biological conditions. However, <b>network</b> <b>redundancies</b> are inefficient in terms of fitness and lost during the course of evolution. The network structure and function reflects these evolutionary realities: strong sequence conservation of cis-regulatory elements coupled with widespread stochastic transcription factor binding, and ancient transcription factor conservation coupled with overlapping activation of targets. The evolution of functional transcription factor networks therefore must be a balance between conservation and flexibility...|$|R
