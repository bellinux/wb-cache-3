The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{widespread}} use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE NO) as a biomarker of airways inflammation, there are no published papers describing normal FE <b>NO</b> <b>values</b> in a large group of healthy adults. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} establish adult FE <b>NO</b> reference <b>values</b> according to the international guidelines. Methods FE NO was measured in 204 healthy, non-smoking adults with normal spirometry values using the on-line single-breath technique, and the results were analysed chemiluminescently. Results The main result of the study was the significant difference in FE <b>NO</b> <b>values</b> between men and women, thus indicating that gender-based reference FE <b>NO</b> <b>values</b> are necessary. The FE NO levels obtained at expiratory flows of 50 ml/s ranged from 2. 6 to 28. 8 ppb in men, and from 1. 6 to 21. 5 ppb in women. Conclusion We propose reference FE <b>NO</b> <b>values</b> for healthy adult men and women that could be used for clinical and research purposes. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation {{of the story}} that might {{have been made in the}} 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon that specific manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of <b>no</b> <b>value</b> for reconstructing the original text.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of <b>no</b> <b>value</b> to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{agencies}} predicted above-average activity, citing forecasts for slower-than-average trade winds, warmer-than-normal {{sea surface}} temperatures, abnormally low wind shear, and the unlikelihood of an El Niño developing {{prior to the}} peak of the season. On December5, 2012, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast. In its report, the organization called for 15.4 (±4.3) named storms, 7.7 (±2.9) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and a cumulative Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 134. While <b>no</b> <b>value</b> was placed on the number of expected landfalls during the season, TSR stated that the landfalling ACE index was expected to be above average. Four months later, on April5, Tropical Storm Risk issued its updated forecast, continuing to call for an above-average season with 15.2 (±4.1) named storms, 7.5 (±2.8) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 131; the landfalling ACE index was once again forecast to be higher than normal.|$|E

5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 {{established}} full Norwegian {{sovereignty over}} the archipelago. The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, {{a part of}} the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is <b>no</b> <b>value</b> added tax. There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance. Svalbard is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fishery surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard as the treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment.|$|E

NO concentrations differed substantially between both methods. Mean NO concentrations were higher with the SE than with the TB method in nonsmoking and in smoking asthmatics and especially so with the higher <b>NO</b> <b>values.</b> Furthermore, <b>NO</b> <b>values</b> with both methods were higher in nonsmoking asthmatics than in nonsmoking healthy subjects, NO was not significantly different between exsmokers with COPD and healthy exsmokers, In conclusion nitric oxide values of the single-breath and tidal-breathing methods are not interchangeable. Both methods can be used to measure differences between groups...|$|R
