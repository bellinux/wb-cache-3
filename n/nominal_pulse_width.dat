40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} operation of multiple high power X-band RF test facilities for high gradient acceleration and deflecting structures at CERN, as re-quired for the e+ e- collider research programme CLIC (Compact Linear Collider). Signif-icant improvements to the control system and operation of the first test stand, Xbox- 1 are implemented. The development of the second X-band test stand at CERN, Xbox- 2 is followed from inception to completion. The LLRF (Low Level Radio Frequency) system, interlock system and control algorithms are designed and validated. The third test stand at CERN, Xbox- 3 is introduced and designs for the LLRF and control systems are pre-sented. The first of the modulator/klystron units from Toshiba and Scandinova is tested. CLIC will require crab cavities to align the bunches {{in order to provide}} effective head-on collisions. An X-band travelling wave cavity using a quasi-TM 11 mode for deflection has been designed, manufactured and tested at the Xbox- 2 high power test stand. The cavity reached an input power level in excess of 50 MW, at pulse widths of 150 ns with a measured breakdown rate (BDR) of better than 10 - 5 breakdowns per pulse (BDs/pulse). At the <b>nominal</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> of 200 ns, the cavity reached an input power level of 43 MW with a BDR of 10 - 6 BDs/pulse. These parameters are well above the nominal design pa-rameters of an input power of 13. 35 MW with a 200 ns pulse length. This work also de-scribes surface field quantities which are important in assessing the expected BDR when designing high gradient structures...|$|E

Fifth-order WENO scheme and third-order TVD Runge-Kutta method are employed to discretize Euler equations with chemical reaction source {{in space and}} time respectively, and parallel high resolution code is developed. Applying this code, the influence of incident pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> on the run distance to detonation is investigated. The numerical results show that incident pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> govern the initiation process. If appropriate values are taken for incident pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>width,</b> the pressure will increase with the enlarging of the shock wave propagation distance, and finally the explosives reach steady detonation. The run distance to detonation is also influenced by those two factors, and it gets shorter with the increase of <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> and incident pressure.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying the feedback ratios in a buck converter with <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> modulation and an inert output filter, with {{the ultimate goal of}} minimizing the duration of the transient processes.

In the presence of an inert output filter or large input ripple, however, a <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> modulator operates in saturation mode for a prolonged period of time (with a duty cycle of 0 or 1), which leads to losses in the estimated performance and to slowing down the transient processes.
