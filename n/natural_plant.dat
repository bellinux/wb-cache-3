5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle also spelled Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (4 February 1778 – 9 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines {{launched}} de Candolle's botanical {{career by}} recommending him at an herbarium. Within {{a couple of}} years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.|$|E
5|$|RNAi {{has been}} used to genetically {{engineer}} plants to produce lower levels of <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E

25|$|Heinrich Gustav Adolf Engler (25 March 1844 – 10 October 1930) was a German botanist. He {{is notable}} {{for his work}} on plant {{taxonomy}} and phytogeography, such as Die natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien (The <b>Natural</b> <b>Plant</b> Families), edited with Karl A. E. von Prantl.|$|E
25|$|Her {{research}} {{focused on}} plant hormones, seed biology and plant DNA repair. She {{is best known}} for her work on the gas ethylene, in particular for demonstrating that ethylene is a <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> hormone, and that it is the major regulator of ageing and the shedding of leaves and fruits. She also originated the concept of the target cell as a model for understanding plant hormone action.|$|E

25|$|Ethylene {{is widely}} used in the {{chemical}} industry, and its worldwide production (over 150 million tonnes in 2016) exceeds {{that of any other}} organic compound. Much of this production goes toward polyethylene, a widely used plastic containing polymer chains of ethylene units in various chain lengths. Ethylene is also an important <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> hormone, and is used in agriculture to force the ripening of fruits. Ethylene's hydrate is ethanol.|$|E

Distinctly {{from the other}} L. bulgaricus, GLB44 grows very well in vegetable juices, given its <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> habitat. Since all probiotics carry some of the organic matter {{in which they are}} grown, GLB44 carries traces of vegetable juice. GLB44 is currently grown in the European Union, in vegetable juice sourced from European farms that are GMO free.|$|E
25|$|Chemically {{defined as}} {{oligosaccharides}} occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as carbohydrates, or more specifically as fructans, a polymer of the <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> sugar, fructose. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant {{sources such as}} chicory roots or Jerusalem artichokes for use in prepared foods. Subtly sweet, {{it can be used}} to replace sugar, fat, and flour, is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered nutritional supplements, and has significant potential health value as a prebiotic fermentable fiber.|$|E

25|$|Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien (The <b>Natural</b> <b>Plant</b> Families), edited with Karl A. E. Prantl, {{with the}} {{collaboration}} of many notable experts, 1887–1915, 23 volumes: This enormous series {{is one of}} the very few detailed works (since Linnaeus) to attempt the classification of plants from algae to flowering plants, and constitutes an invaluable work. A second, incomplete edition was produced (1924–1980) in 28 parts by Duncker und Humblot Verlag, Berlin). Some volumes have been re-issued in English. The second edition was hard to use for many years because no part of it was indexed until 1984, when an index was published in the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden.|$|E
25|$|As an arid island, Niihau was barren {{of trees}} for centuries — Captain James Cook {{reported}} it treeless in 1778. Aubrey Robinson, grandfather of current owners Bruce Robinson and Keith Robinson, planted 10,000 trees per year {{during much of}} his ownership of the island; Robinson's afforestation efforts increased rainfall in the dry climate. Island co-owner Keith Robinson, a noted conservationist, preserved and documented many of Niihau's <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> resources. The island is designated as a critical habitat for the ōlulu, an endemic and endangered species of Hawaiian lobelioid. Aylmer robinsonii, a Pritchardia palm tree named for Keith Robinson's uncle Aylmer Robinson, is an endangered species native to Niihau.|$|E

25|$|The {{hormonal}} {{control of}} growth, differentiation {{and development in}} plants was Osborne's lifelong interest. She is particularly known for her work establishing that the gas ethylene is a <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> hormone, rather than a by-product or pollutant, and for demonstrating that ethylene, rather than abscisic acid, is the major regulator of senescence (ageing) and abscission (shedding of parts such as leaves). She conducted extensive research into interactions between ethylene and auxin (another key plant hormone) in controlling numerous aspects of plant development. This work led her to develop {{the idea of the}} target cell as a model for how a small number of plant hormones can exert many different effects, a concept she expounded in her 2005 book, Hormones, Signals and Target Cells in Plant Development (co-authored with Michael McManus).|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E
25|$|European earwigs {{spend the}} day time in cool, dark, {{inaccessible}} places such as flowers, fruits, and wood crevices. Active primarily at night, they seek out food ranging from plant matter to small insects. Though they are omnivorous, they are considered scavengers rather than predators. Often they consume plant matter, though they have also been known to feed on aphids, spiders, insect eggs, and dead plants and insects, among other things. Their favorite plants include the common crucifer Sisymbrium officinale, the white clover Trifolium repens, and the dahlia Dahlia variabilis. They also like to feed on molasses, {{as well as on}} nonvascular plants, lichens and algae. They prefer meat or sugar to <b>natural</b> <b>plant</b> material even though plants are a major natural food source. European earwigs prefer aphids to plant material such as leaves and fruit slices of apple, cherry and pear. Adults eat more insects than do nymphs.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, in 1988, Yellowstone was overdue {{for a large}} fire, and, in the {{exceptionally}} dry summer, {{the many}} smaller [...] "controlled" [...] fires combined. The fires burned discontinuously, leaping from one patch to another, leaving intervening areas untouched. Intense fires swept through some regions, burning everything in their paths. Tens of millions of trees and countless plants {{were killed by the}} wildfires, and some regions were left looking blackened and dead. However, {{more than half of the}} affected areas were burned by ground fires, which did less damage to hardier tree species.
