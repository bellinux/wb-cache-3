5|$|Acupuncture is <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific {{acute pain}} or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more}} than no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E

5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain.

For chronic low back pain massage therapy was <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E

Under the influence of these socialist luminaries, she joined the Fabian Society and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP).|$|E
5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.|$|E

Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to qualify for a bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> 3–9.|$|E

5|$|General Amherst, the British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, was {{in overall}} charge of administering policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and {{regulation of the}} fur trade. Amherst believed that with France out of the picture, the Native Americans would have no other choice than to accept British rule. He also {{believed that they were}} incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> slaves or dogs.|$|E
5|$|The Third Test of the 1948 Ashes {{series was}} one of five Tests in a cricket series between teams {{representing}} Australia and England. The match was played at Old Trafford in Manchester from 8–13 July, with a rest day on 11 July. The match was drawn after {{the whole of the}} fourth day and {{the first half of the}} fifth day was washed out due to rain; England had the upper hand before the weather intervened. The draw maintained Australia's 2–0 lead in the series, which was established through victories in the first two Tests. As Australia were the holders of The Ashes, the draw meant that England could do <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> level the series 2–2 by winning the last two Tests, and thus Australia retained The Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed at the Clemson 26-yard line, {{where the}} Tigers began their second {{offensive}} possession. It began <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the first, as Dantzler was tackled for a three-yard loss by defensive tackle Lamar Cobb. A rush for no gain {{and a short}} pass forced Clemson to again punt before gaining a first down. Somaini's second punt was kicked cleanly, and the Hokies returned the punt to their 42-yard line. Two rushes and a pass to the 50-yard line were not enough for a first down, and Tech punted to the Clemson 17-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the starting line. In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he could do <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State touchback allowed Vick {{to start}} at his 20-yard line for Virginia Tech's second {{possession}} of the game. The possession began <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the first one, as Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty on the first play. On subsequent plays, however, the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success. Vick completed a 12-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, and the offense was aided by a 15-yard Florida State penalty, which gave the Hokies an automatic first down. Following the first down, Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game, throwing the ball 35yards downfield to Justin Harper, who caught it in Florida State territory. Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech {{to the edge of}} the Florida State red zone, but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further. Virginia Tech was forced to send in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45-yard field goal. The kick was good, and Virginia Tech had tied the game 33 with 1:00 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E
