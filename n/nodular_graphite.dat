When nucleation occurs on all the possible substrates, the graphite nodule density, NV,n or eutectic cell density NV after solidification equals Ns.

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the microstructures of different matrix samples and correlate to the wear system response by varying matrix microstructure. SG iron {{is used for the}} production of different automobile parts such as camshaft and gears. SG iron is most important member among different members of cast iron family due to its high strength, toughness together with ductility. The main reason of this high ductility is presence of <b>nodular</b> structure of <b>graphite</b> that is present in it unlike present in grey cast iron as the flakes. In grey cast iron, stress concentration is high at the corners of these flakes but has been removed in the case of spheroidal graphite cast iron with the nodular shape. As a result of this its ductility increases along with toughness. In order to obtain the optimum wear resistance of SG cast iron, the current investigation involves annealing, normalizing, quench & tempering and austempering heat treatments leading to transformation of as-cast matrix to ferritic, pearlitic, tempered martensitic and coarse upper bainitic matrices respectively. Specimens having different alloying elements were austenitized to 1000 °C for soaking time 90 min, followed by furnace cooling, air cooling, oil and salt bath quenching followed by air cooling for respective heat treatments. Vickers hardness test was conducted over the samples under 20 Kg followed by wear test was carried over DUCOM TR- 208 M 1 ball on plate type wear monitor under 10 N, 30 N and 50 N loads respectively in dry sliding condition for the sliding distance of 7. 54 m with the speed 0. 063 m/s. The hardness was maximum for quenched & tempered specimen in case of SG- 02 samples due to presence of tempered martensitic matrix phase while, in case of SG- 01, normalized specimen has maximum hardness due to presence of pearlitic matrix phase. The lowest hardness was observed to be for annealed sample with ferritic matrix phase. On the other hand hardness of ferritic, pearlitic and bainitic matrices was observe to be in between these range, also marginal difference was observed in as-cast and tempered martensitic matrices. The cause of this difference is that in as-cast specimen of iv SG- 01 has bull’s eye ferritic/pearlitic matrix which may cause its hardness increases, whereas in case of as-cast sample of SG- 02 fully ferritic phase is obtained as a result of which hardness decreases. For quench & tempered as well as austempered specimens of SG- 01 has lower hardness value in comparison of that of in SG- 02 because of more percentage of C, Mn, Ni, Cr, Mo and Si in SG- 02 specimens that has tendency of strengthening solid solution of ferrite in ductile cast iron. It was observe that when sample of as-cast specimen subjected to load in between 10 N- 20 N it lost its weight continuously, while with increase in load to 30 N subsequently weight gain was observe. This weight gain is due to the formation of oxide layer. There was no weight loss or gain observe for normalized specimen however in case of austempered specimen weight gain was observe for 20 N and 30 N due to formation of oxide which can be investigated by means of EDAX analysis. Finally it has been concluded that for the samples having ferritic, pearlitic, bainitic matrices phase, adhesive wear is main wear mechanism along with shallow pits are produced due to delamination and deposited over the sites where graphite nodules have already formed before...|$|R

G Cast iron {{is defined}} as a high carbon containing, iron based alloy in which the {{graphite}} is present in compact, spherical shapes rather than in the shape of flakes, the latter being typical of gray cast iron. As <b>nodular</b> or spheroidal <b>graphite</b> cast iron, sometimes referred to as ductile iron,constitutes a family of cast irons in which the graphite is present in a nodular or spheroidal form. The graphite nodules are small and constitute only small areas of weakness in a steel-like matrix. Because of this the mechanical properties of ductile irons related directly to the strength and ductility of the matrix present—as is the case of steels. One reason for the phenomenal growth in the use of Ductile Iron castings is the high ratio of performance to cost that they offer the designer and end user. This high value results from many factors, one of which is the control of microstructure and properties that can be achieved in the ascast condition, enabling a high percentage of ferritic and pearlitic structure. Heat treatment is a valuable and versatile tool for extending both the consistency and range of properties of Ductile Iron castings beyond the limits of those produced in the as-cast condition. Thus, to fully utilize the potential of Ductile Iron castings, the designer {{should be aware of the}} wide range of heat treatments available for Ductile Iron, and its response to these heat treatments. The most important heat treatments and their purposes are:Stress relieving - a low-temperature treatment, to reduce or relieve internal stresses remaining after casting Annealing - to improve ductility and toughness, to reduce hardness and to remove carbides Normalizing - to improve strength with some ductility Hardening and tempering - to increase hardness or to give improved strength and higher proof stress ratio Austempering - to yield bainitic structures of high strength, with significant ductility and good wear resistance Surface hardening - by induction, flame,or laser to produce a local wearresistant hard surface 1 Although Ductile Iron and steel are superficially similar metallurgically, the high carbon and silicon levels in Ductile Iron result in important differences in their response to heat treatment. The higher carbon levels in Ductile Iron increase hardenability, permitting heavier sections to be heat treated with lower requirements for expensive alloying or severe quenching media. These higher carbon levels can also cause quench cracking due to the formation of higher carbon martensite,and/or the retention of metastable austenite. These undesirable phenomena make the control of composition, austenitizing temperature and quenching conditions more critical in Ductile Iron. Silicon also exerts a strong influence on the response of Ductile Iron to heat treatment. The higher the silicon content, the lower the solubility of carbon in austenite and the more readily carbon is precipitated as graphite during slow cooling to produce a ferritic matrix. Although remaining unchanged in shape, the graphite spheroids in Ductile Iron play a critical role in heat treatment, acting as both a source and sink for carbon. When heated into the austenite temperature range, carbon readily diffuses from the spheroids to saturate the austenite matrix. On slow cooling the carbon returns to the graphite "sinks",reducing the carbon content of the austenite. This availability of excess carbon and the ability to transfer it between the matrix and the nodules makes Ductile Iron easier to heat treat and increases the range of properties that can be obtained by heat treatment. Austempered Ductile Irons (ADI) are the most recently developed materials of the DI family. By adapting the austempering treatment initially introduced for steels to DI, it has been shown that the resulting metallurgical structures provide properties that favorably compare to those of steel while taking advantage of a near-net-shape manufacturing process...|$|R
