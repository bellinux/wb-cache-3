25|$|With the {{introduction}} of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as seasonality in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on February 29, there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did <b>not</b> <b>peak</b> on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.|$|E
25|$|The first Canadian wolf bounty {{was offered}} in 1793 in Ontario and Quebec. Wolves became rare in Eastern Canada by the 1870s, {{becoming}} extinct in New Brunswick by 1880, in Nova Scotia by 1900 and had disappeared from Newfoundland by 1913. Full-scale eradication programs did <b>not</b> <b>peak</b> in western and northern Canada until the 1950s, when resource development brought more people into originally sparsely populated wilderness. A government-backed wolf extermination program was initiated in 1948 after serious declines in caribou herds in the Northern Territories and a rabies concern due to wolves migrating south near populated areas. 39,960 cyanide guns, 106,100 cyanide cartridges and 628,000 strychnine pellets were distributed. Up to 17,500 wolves were poisoned in Canada between 1955 and 1961. In the mid-1950s, wolf bounties were {{dropped in the}} western provinces in favor of hiring provincial hunters. Quebec's wolf bounties ended in 1971 and Ontario in 1972. Overall, 20,000 wolves were bountied between 1935 and 1955 in British Columbia, 12,000 between 1942 and 1955 in Alberta and 33,000 between 1947 and 1971 in Ontario.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{determine}} whether simple luminance profiles are located by their peaks or centroids we performed a three element alignment task where the central element's degree of luminance asymmetry was randomly chosen from a flat distribution (skew noise). The central element with its randomly chosen skew was either positioned using the peak or centroid of its distribution. Accuracy is invariant with {{the magnitude of the}} skew noise for the centroid but <b>not</b> the <b>peak</b> condition. We conclude that the human visual system assigns position tags using centroids <b>not</b> <b>peaks</b> of luminance distributions for gabors. However {{this is not the case}} for Gaussian blobs, where a measure closer to the midpoint is used for our stimulus arrangement. Copyright © 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
