5|$|Pulsars are {{rotating}} {{neutron stars}} {{that have a}} magnetic field. A <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> of electromagnetic radiation is emitted from the poles of rotating pulsars. If the beam sweeps past {{the direction of the}} Solar System then the pulsar will produce a periodic pulse that can be detected from the Earth. The energy radiated by the magnetic field gradually slows down the rotation rate, so that older pulsars can require as long as several seconds between each pulse.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties of the shadow produced by a <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Narrow</b> <b>beams</b> {{are offered}} by the three Inmarsat-4 satellites. <b>Narrow</b> <b>beams</b> vary in size, tend to be several hundred {{kilometers}} across. The <b>narrow</b> <b>beams,</b> while {{much smaller than the}} global or regional beams, are far more numerous and hence offer the same global coverage. <b>Narrow</b> spot <b>beams</b> allow yet smaller antennas and much higher data rates. They form the backbone of Inmarsat's handheld (GSPS) and broadband services (BGAN). This coverage was introduced with the I-4 satellites. Each I-4 satellite provides around 200 <b>narrow</b> spot <b>beams.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Side Scan Sonar systems produce images {{by forming}} angular “beams”. Beam width is {{determined}} by length of the sonar array, <b>narrower</b> <b>beams</b> resolve finer detail. Longer arrays with <b>narrower</b> <b>beams</b> provide finer spatial resolution.|$|R
25|$|The Type 965M and 965P had a <b>narrower</b> <b>beam</b> (12° horizontal) {{than the}} {{preceding}} Type 960 (35° horizontal). The <b>narrower</b> <b>beam</b> {{was needed for}} air direction. The Type 965Q and 965R were improvements on the 965M and 965P respectively; these had a moving target indicator (MTI) mode to suppress clutter; though Friedman states that they lacked any provision for moving target indication.|$|R
25|$|The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, (both <b>narrow</b> <b>beam)</b> and the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal {{join the}} Severn at Stourport, Worcester and Gloucester respectively. The Droitwich Barge Canal, a broad beam canal, joins the Severn at Hawford, {{near to the}} River Salwarpe, and connects to the Droitwich Canal (<b>narrow</b> <b>beam)</b> in the name town, which then forms {{a link to the}} Worcester and Birmingham Canal. The two Droitwich canals re-opened in 2010 after major restoration.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well ballasted keel, low centre of gravity, and <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> of traditional English cutters, but has a fin keel characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length keel, a fin keel creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the lateral stability of a full keel, and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional lateral resistance to the hull aft producing directional stability, its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|E
25|$|The lights used by most halogen {{rechargeable}} {{systems are}} cheap, bright but fairly simple: they project a cone of light (wide and <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> options are available) {{which is good}} for off-road use but not ideal for road use as it can dazzle oncoming road users. This is why rechargeable halogen lights do not meet legal requirements in some jurisdictions.|$|E

40|$|The PhD {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of second {{harmonic}} generation of <b>narrow</b> <b>beams</b> in photonic crystals. The basic idea is that if both frequencies, the fundamental and second harmonics are in the region of self-collimation, then the second harmonics of <b>narrow</b> <b>beams</b> can be very efficient. The beams do not spread diffractively during propagation and interaction. The phase matching is ensured for all components of the interacting beams. This allows to enhance the nonlinear interaction efficiency several times. The thesis rewises the theory of self-collimation of <b>narrow</b> <b>beams</b> in photonic crystals, and presents the theory of second harmonics in photonic crystals. Calculations in photonic crystals of different configurations are presented, and the recommendations to experimental realisations are given.

30|$|Scatter {{correction}} (SC) for SPECT data {{is necessary}} with AC because the mu-value calculated from {{this method is}} for <b>narrow</b> <b>beams.</b> A triple energy window (TEW) [13] method {{was used in the}} present study.|$|R
25|$|The {{other large}} use of {{parabolic}} antennas is for radar antennas, {{in which there}} is a need to transmit a <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> of radio waves to locate objects like ships, airplanes, and guided missiles, and often for weather detection. With the advent of home satellite television receivers, parabolic antennas have become a common feature of the landscapes of modern countries.|$|E
25|$|After some {{massive stars}} have ceased {{thermonuclear}} fusion, {{a portion of}} their mass collapses into a compact body of neutrons called a neutron star. These bodies retain a significant magnetic field from the original star, but the collapse in size causes the strength of this field to increase dramatically. The rapid rotation of these collapsed neutron stars results in a pulsar, which emits a <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> of energy that can periodically point toward an observer.|$|E
25|$|Optical SETI {{supporters}} have conducted paper {{studies of the}} effectiveness of using contemporary high-energy lasers and a ten-meter diameter mirror as an interstellar beacon. The analysis shows that an infrared pulse from a laser, focused into a <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> by such a mirror, would appear thousands of times brighter than the Sun to a distant civilization in the beam's line of fire. The Cyclops study proved incorrect in suggesting a laser beam would be inherently hard to see.|$|E

5000|$|Width (beam): a wider boat {{provides}} more stability {{at the expense}} of speed. A canoe cuts through the water like a wedge, and a shorter boat needs a <b>narrower</b> <b>beam</b> to reduce the angle of the wedge cutting through the water.|$|R
50|$|Stiles and Crawford {{subsequently}} measured {{this effect}} more precisely by observing the visual stimulus of <b>narrow</b> <b>beams</b> of light selectively passed through various {{positions in the}} pupil using pinholes. Using similar methods, the Stiles-Crawford effect has been verified by the scientific community.|$|R
25|$|The locks {{are usually}} manned during the {{cruising}} season from Easter to October and padlocked outside operating hours. This {{is done to}} prevent water shortages due to misuse and to ensure a balance between those wishing to ascend and descend. There can be lengthy delays at busy times but the actual transit should take approximately 45 minutes to one hour to complete; it is made quicker {{by the fact that}} the locks are <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> and the gates are light.|$|E
25|$|By 1897, the Grand Junction Canal Company had {{acquired}} {{several of the}} canals comprising the Leicester line, and was keen to meet demand from carriers seeking to use wider beam (14ft) craft, rather than the traditional <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> boats, which were the only type the locks could accommodate. Their solution was to build an inclined plane {{to the side of}} the locks. Initially, the company had planned for the plane to replace the locks, rather than having it act as a second, faster option. Construction began in 1898 and was finished by 10 July 1900.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{addressed}} in the Mk. II {{was one of the}} signal being so wide that multiple aircraft would appear on the display. This was solved simply by adding a second transmission antenna system. One had a fairly narrow horizontal antenna spread, which caused the transmission to be similar to the Mk. I's 20 degrees. The other had a much wider antenna array, narrowing the pattern and making it much easier to pick out individual targets. The wide-pattern antenna would be used during initial pickup, and once a target was selected a switch was thrown to move the transmission to the <b>narrow</b> <b>beam.</b> Images exist that show both antennas combined on a single cabin.|$|E
50|$|Greater {{directionality}} can {{be obtained}} using beam-forming techniques such as a parabolic reflector or a horn. Since high directivity in an antenna depends on it being large compared to the wavelength, <b>narrow</b> <b>beams</b> of this type are more easily achieved at UHF and microwave frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Scaffie {{but with}} a <b>narrower</b> <b>beam,</b> the Skiff was {{designed}} in 1970 and John Watkinson built the first three boats of around 30 that were built in wood by Doug Elliott at John Elliott Boatbuilders. A GRP version wasn't available until 1996.|$|R

25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a <b>narrow</b> <b>beam,</b> or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E
500|$|Brilliants {{principal}} armament {{consisted of}} 26 cast iron twelve-pound cannons, located along her upper deck.

500|$|To keep Ryūjōs {{weight to}} 8,000 metric tons, the hull was lightly built and no armor could be provided, {{although}} some protective plating was added abreast the machinery spaces and magazines. She was also designed {{with only a}} single hangar, which would have left an extremely low profile (there being just [...] of freeboard amidships and [...] aft). Between the time the carrier was laid down in 1929 and launched in 1931, however, the Navy doubled her aircraft stowage requirement to 48 {{in order to give}} her a more capable air group. This necessitated the addition of a second hangar atop the first, raising freeboard to [...] Coupled with the ship's <b>narrow</b> <b>beam,</b> the consequent top-heaviness made her minimally stable in rough seas, despite the fitting of Sperry active stabilizers.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, the Regia Marina began design studies for cruisers that would {{adhere to the}} {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to a displacement of [...] and an armament of [...] guns. The design for what became the Trento class was prepared by General Filippo Bonfiglietti in 1923. In 1924, the French Navy laid down the first of two s, prompting the Regia Marina to order two vessels to match their rival. The designers emphasized very high speed, which required a significant reduction in armor protection to keep the ships within the displacement limit. In addition, they were designed with a <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> to help them reach high speeds, which reduced their stability. This would be the general pattern for Italian cruisers and destroyers built in the 1920s and 1930s, {{with the exception of the}} later s and some of the later s.|$|E
500|$|Because {{their energy}} is {{strongly}} focused, the gamma rays emitted by most bursts {{are expected to}} miss the Earth and never be detected. When a gamma-ray burst is pointed towards Earth, the focusing of its energy along a relatively <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> causes the burst to appear much brighter {{than it would have}} been were its energy emitted spherically. When this effect is taken into account, typical gamma-ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 1044J, or about 1/2000 of a Solar mass (...) energy equivalent—which is still many times the mass-energy equivalent of the Earth (about 5.5×1041J). This is comparable to the energy released in a bright type Ib/c supernova and within the range of theoretical models. Very bright supernovae have been observed to accompany several of the nearest GRBs. Additional support for focusing of the output of GRBs has come from observations of strong asymmetries in the spectra of nearby type Ic supernova and from radio observations taken long after bursts when their jets are no longer relativistic.|$|E
500|$|To improve {{confidence}} in the approach, the project made a prototype {{in the form of}} a counter-illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers [...] at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level [...] away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine's conning tower. It was fitted with sealed beam lamps made by General Electric. The lamps had reflectors to give them a <b>narrow</b> <b>beam</b> of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps' brightness was controllable with a variable resistor. During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above 2 miles and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers could clearly see the [...] thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was [...] "completely invisible" [...] with the lamps correctly adjusted.|$|E

40|$|Direct-drive-implosion {{experiments}} on the OMEGA laser [T. R. Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997) ] have showed discrepancies between simulations of the scattered (non-absorbed) light levels and measured ones that {{indicate the presence}} of a mechanism that reduces laser coupling efficiency by 10 %- 20 %. This appears to be due to crossed-beam energy transfer (CBET) that involves electromagnetic-seeded, low-gain stimulated Brillouin scattering. CBET scatters energy from the central portion of the incoming light beam to outgoing light, reducing the laser absorption and hydrodynamic efficiency of implosions. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including CBET show good agreement with all observables in implosion {{experiments on}} OMEGA.
