We describe P. knowlesi fatalities in Sabah, Malaysia, during 2012 - 2014 and report species-specific fatality rates based on 2010 - 2014 case notifications. Sixteen malaria-associated deaths (caused by PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi [7], P. falciparum [7], and P. vivax [1] and microscopy-diagnosed "P. malariae" [1]) were reported during 2012 - 2014. Six patients with severe P. knowlesi malaria received intravenous artesunate at hospital admission. For persons > 15 years of age, overall fatality rates during 2010 - 2014 were 3. 4, 4. 2, and 1. 0 deaths/ 1, 000 P. knowlesi, P. falciparum, and P. vivax notifications, respectively; P. knowlesi-associated fatality rates fell from 9. 2 to 1. 6 deaths/ 1, 000 <b>notifications.</b> <b>No</b> P. knowlesi-associated deaths occurred among children, despite 373 notified cases.

40|$|In many {{fields of}} activity, working in teams is {{necessary}} for completing tasks in a proper manner and often requires visual context-related information to be exchanged between team members. In such a collaborative environment, awareness of other people’s activity is an important feature of shared-workspace collaboration. We have developed an augmented reality framework for virtual colocation that supports visual communication between {{two people who are}} in different physical locations. We address these people as the remote user, who uses a laptop and the local user, who wears a head-mounted display with an RGB camera. The remote user can assist the local user in solving a spatial problem, by providing instructions in form of virtual objects {{in the view of the}} local user. For annotating the shared workspace, we use the state-of-the-art algorithm for localization and mapping without markers that provides “anchors” in the 3 D space for placing virtual content. In this paper, we report on a user study that explores on how automatic audio and visual notifications about the remote user’s activities affect the local user’s workspace awareness. We used an existing game to research virtual colocation, addressing a spatial challenge on increasing levels of task complexity. The results of the user study show that participants clearly preferred visual notifications over audio or <b>no</b> <b>notifications,</b> <b>no</b> matter the level of the difficulty of the task.
