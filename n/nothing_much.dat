5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes <b>nothing</b> <b>much</b> to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E
5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing <b>nothing</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} Surekill and inquire {{as to the}} company's client, Carlton Chase. Doggett asks if Dwight did time, and he {{responds}} that he did. Doggett asks why Chase would have called Surekill just before his death. After the agents leave, Dwight confronts Tammi about the message, and she lies. Meanwhile, Randall watches Tammi through a wall. Tammi returns to Surekill {{early the next morning}} and rushes in to get the deposit book showing she has taken from the Surekill account out of her desk, but is caught by Dwight and Randall. Dwight is interrupted by the FBI, who have a search warrant. Doggett opens the box Tammi was trying to dispose of, which contains <b>nothing,</b> <b>much</b> to her surprise. Dwight claims he runs a clean business, but Scully pulls out several folders containing invoices for Chase.|$|E

While the Hall was adapted for use by the new college in 1547, its walls are now hidden behind the 18th-century ashlaring of the kitchens and combination rooms south of the present Dining Hall.|$|E

The tribes tended to make alliances as {{and when it}} suited them. Different Pawnee subtribes could make treaties with warring European powers without disrupting their underlying unity; the Pawnee were masters at unity within diversity.|$|E

25|$|Symbolism {{continued}} to have a hold {{on the minds of}} Anglo-Saxon people into the Christian eras. The interiors of churches would have glowed with colour, and the walls of the halls were painted with decorative scenes from the imagination telling stories of monsters and heroes like those in the poem Beowulf. Although <b>nothing</b> <b>much</b> is left of the wall paintings, evidence of their pictorial art is found in Bibles and Psalters, in illuminated manuscripts. The poem, 'The Dream of the Rood', is an example how symbolism of trees was fused into Christian symbolism.|$|E
25|$|Orazio died {{suddenly}} in 1639. Artemisia {{had her own}} commissions to fulfill after her father's death, {{although there are no}} known works assignable with certainty to this period. It is known that Artemisia had already left England by 1642, when the civil war was just starting. <b>Nothing</b> <b>much</b> is known about her subsequent movements. Historians know that in 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of Sicily, who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period. The last known letter to her mentor is dated 1650 and makes clear that she still was fully active.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, {{changes were}} in place, {{but in one}} respect, <b>nothing</b> <b>much</b> had happened. Desegregation was still only tolerated, not embraced, by the general public.

By the early 1960s, he was {{on the board of the}} Salesmanship Club, and by 1965, he was president of the Salesmanship Club and a member of the Citizens Council. In 1968, he was entrusted with leadership of the Greater Dallas Council of Churches and then the Community Relations Commission, both of which pushed him into the center of local race relations.|$|E

25|$|The fort lies off the Mahim Causeway which {{links the}} suburbs to the city. The fort is heavily encroached by slums, {{and parts of}} the fort have caved in due to tidal erosion and neglect. Though the site is {{classified}} as a Grade I heritage structure, <b>nothing</b> <b>much</b> has been done to maintain it. Large boulders are strewn on the sand and crevices as high as three metres (fifteen feet) are visible. Responsibility of the fort is shuffled between the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, although the fort lies of state government land. In 2004, rupees five lakhs had to be returned as the encroachments were not removed by local authorities. Later, in 2008, Jairaj Phatak, the Municipal Commissioner had proposed a makeover to the fort.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{following}} the Kargil War, all Indian channel broadcasts were limited or banned in Pakistan and after Pervaiz Musharraf's coup d'état, {{the media was}} privatised. To cater {{to the needs of}} thousands who watched the Indian channels with regularity, programmes were broadcast to match the Indian content. Seeing this as an opportunity, bands returned on the music scene and started producing videos with a much richer content. In 2002-03, Ghazanfar Ali, producer and CEO of the Indus Media Group started his very first venture into the music industry with Indus Music, a channel dedicated to music {{following the}} formats used by Western Music Channels. The channel started {{as a part of the}} Indus Vision channel and was later started as separate channel in 2003. With <b>nothing</b> <b>much</b> to watch than a few Pakistani channels, the youngsters in the country would settle in for Indus Music and would become interested in music once again. In 2006 Indus TV Network in an agreement with MTV Intn;l converted Indus Music into MTV Pakistan which continued till 2011 to again become Indus Music.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{relations}} with France started to deteriorate, also. Since {{the days of}} Henry IV, France had been an important ally of the Republic. In 1635 during the Republic's war with Spain, Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII's chief minister, concluded a treaty with the Republic in which the parties agreed to attack the Spanish Netherlands on two fronts in that year. Those provinces were to be granted the status of free Cantons on the Swiss model, if they cooperated, but in case of resistance {{there was to be}} a partition of the country in which the French would receive the French-speaking provinces and western Flanders, and the Dutch Antwerp, the Scheldt Estuary, and Ghent, Bruges, and Mechelen. The States Party of the time was not happy with this arrangement, because the reintegration of Antwerp in the Republic would upset the cosy arrangement that kept Antwerp's trade bridled in favor of Amsterdam's. However, this partition treaty was pushed through by stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and the Orangist regents, many of whom were generously bribed by Richelieu. <b>Nothing</b> <b>much</b> came of these plans. The formidable Spanish Army of Flanders checked the attack by putting up a strategic defense against France, and vigorously attacking the Dutch. The offensive of 1635 almost turned into a disaster for the Dutch, after their invasion was repelled, and the Spaniards successfully counterattacked. The French were too weak to make a large impression.|$|E
