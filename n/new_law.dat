40|$|AbstractIntroductionIn 2010, British Columbia (BC) {{introduced}} <b>new</b> traffic <b>laws</b> {{designed to}} deter impaired driving, speeding, and distracted driving. These laws generated significant media attention and {{were associated with}} reductions in fatal crashes and in ambulance calls and hospital admissions for road trauma. ObjectiveTo understand the extent and type of {{media coverage of the}} <b>new</b> traffic <b>laws</b> and to identify how the laws were framed by the media. MethodsWe reviewed a database of injury related news coverage (May 2010 –December 2012) and extracted reports that mentioned distracted driving, impaired driving, or speeding. Articles were classified according to: (i) Type, (ii) Issue discussed, (iii) ‘Reference to new laws’, and (iv) ‘Pro/anti traffic law’. Articles mentioning the <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> were reread and common themes in how the laws were framed were identified and discussed. ResultsOver the course of the study, 1848 articles mentioned distraction, impairment, or speeding and 597 reports mentioned the new laws: 65 against, 227 neutral, and 305 supportive. Reports against the <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> framed them as unfair or as causing economic damage to the entertainment industry. Reports in favor of the <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> framed them in terms of preventing impaired driving and related trauma or of bringing justice to drinking drivers. Growing evidence of the effectiveness of the <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> generated media support. ConclusionsBC’s <b>new</b> traffic <b>laws</b> generated considerable media attention both pro and con. We believe that this media attention helped inform the public of the <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> and enhanced their deterrent effect...|$|R

50|$|The {{priest of}} Hispaniola and former encomendero Bartolomé de las Casas {{underwent}} a profound conversion {{after seeing the}} abuse of the native people. He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the encomienda system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an important debate, where he pushed for {{the enactment of the}} <b>New</b> <b>Laws</b> and an end to the encomienda system. The Laws of Burgos and the <b>New</b> <b>Laws</b> of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the <b>New</b> <b>Laws</b> were postponed in the Viceroyalty of Peru. When Blasco Núñez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the <b>New</b> <b>Laws,</b> which provided for the gradual abolition of the encomienda, many of the encomenderos were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.|$|R
5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the <b>new</b> <b>law</b> caused these hospitals to close.
