2500|$|Between 20 and 50% of all pet gerbils {{have the}} seizure {{disorder}} epilepsy. The seizures {{are thought to}} be caused by fright, handling, or a new environment. The attacks can be mild to severe, but do not typically appear to have any long-term effects, except for rare cases where death results from very severe seizures. A way to prevent a gerbil from having a seizure is to refrain from blowing in the animal's face (often used to [...] "train" [...] the pet <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite).</b> [...] This technique is used in a lab environment to induce seizures for medical research.|$|E

[...] When they were in the field, from home, out of the sight, and far from the help of his father: Subtle persecutors love <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite,</b> till they can make their teeth to meet; for which they observe their time and place. Joseph was also hated of his brethren, but they durst not meddle till they found him in the field (Gen 37:15). Here it is also that the holy virgin falleth: He found her in the field,--and there was none to save her (Deut 22:27).|$|E

60|$|The boys {{remained}} here an hour, {{but they}} caught no eels. Either {{there were none}} there, or for some reason or other they chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite.</b> They had some talk about going to another place, but before they decided upon that plan, Marco's attention was arrested {{by the sight of}} {{what appeared to be a}} large log floating down the river. He pointed it out to the other boys, and, on closer examination, they saw that it was an old canoe, of the kind that are formed by hollowing out a log. It was not of very large size and it appeared to be rather old and decayed. Still, the boys wanted to get it very much. They gathered in their lines, and ran along the bank, keeping pace with the boat as it floated down.|$|E
60|$|At this point, Jacky's eye fell on a shaggy little cow {{which had}} strayed {{near to the}} party, and stood {{regarding}} him with a stern inquisitive glance. Remembering the fright he had received so recently from a similar creature, he uttered a tremendous roar, and again sought refuge in his father's knees. The discussion on Paley was thus cut short; for the dogs--whose chief delight was to bark, though <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite,</b> as has been libellously asserted of all dogs by Dr Watts--sprang to their feet, divided their forces, and, while two of the oldest kept frisking round and leaping upon the party in a promiscuous manner, as if to assure them of protection {{in the event of}} danger, the remainder ran open-mouthed and howling at the cow. That curly-headed, long-horned creature received them at first with a defiant look and an elevated tail, but ultimately took to her heels, to the immense delight of Jacky, whose soul was imbued with a deep and altogether unutterable horror of cattle, especially black cows.|$|E
60|$|ANDROCLES (quaking, {{but keeping}} between the lion and Megaera) Don't you come near my wife, do you hear? (The lion groans. Androcles can hardly stand for trembling). Meggy: run. Run for your life. If I take my eye off him, its all up. (The lion {{holds up his}} wounded paw and flaps it piteously before Androcles). Oh, he's lame, poor old chap! He's got a thorn in his paw. A frightfully big thorn. (Full of sympathy) Oh, poor old man! Did um get an awful thorn into um's tootsums wootsums? Has it made um too sick to eat a nice little Christian man for um's breakfast? Oh, a nice little Christian man will get um's thorn out for um; and then um shall eat the nice Christian man and the nice Christian man's nice big tender wifey pifey. (The lion {{responds}} by moans of self-pity). Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, now (taking the paw in his hand) um is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> and not to scratch, not even if it hurts a very, very little. Now make velvet paws. That's right. (He pulls gingerly at the thorn. The lion, with an angry yell of pain, jerks back his paw so abruptly that Androcles is thrown on his back). Steadeee! Oh, did the nasty cruel little Christian man hurt the sore paw? (The lion moans assentingly but apologetically). Well, one more little pull {{and it will be}} all over. Just one little, little, leetle pull; and then um will live happily ever after. (He gives the thorn another pull. The lion roars and snaps his jaws with a terrifying clash). Oh, mustn't frighten um's good kind doctor, um's affectionate nursey. That didn't hurt at all: not a bit. Just one more. Just to show how the brave big lion can bear pain, not like the little crybaby Christian man. Oopsh! (The thorn comes out. The lion yells with pain, and shakes his paw wildly). That's it! (Holding up the thorn). Now it's out. Now lick um's paw to take away the nasty inflammation. See? (He licks his own hand. The lion nods intelligently and licks his paw industriously). Clever little liony-piony! Understands um's dear old friend Andy Wandy. (The lion licks his face). Yes, kissums Andy Wandy. (The lion, wagging his tail violently, rises on his hind legs and embraces Androcles, who makes a wry face and cries) Velvet paws! Velvet paws! (The lion draws in his claws). That's right. (He embraces the lion, who finally takes the end of his tail in one paw, places that tight around Androcles' waist, resting it on his hip. Androcles takes the other paw in his hand, stretches out his arm, and the two waltz rapturously round and round and finally away through the jungle).|$|E

50|$|The {{essential}} {{aspect of}} fellatio {{is for a}} man's sex partner to take his penis into their mouth, and then move their mouth {{up and down the}} penis to a rhythm set by them mimicking the thrusting motion of vaginal or anal intercourse, with saliva acting as a lubricant, and being careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> or scratch with the teeth. The man receiving fellatio can slow the rhythm of the stimulation by holding his partner's head. The man's partner may also orally play with his penis by licking, sucking, kissing or otherwise playing with the tongue and lips. Fellatio may also include the oral stimulation of the scrotum, whether licking, sucking or taking the entire scrotum into the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Found in thinly forested areas, often {{entering}} human habitation, {{and usually}} hides under leaf litter, at elevations up to 1200m. Active {{during the day}} {{as well as at}} dusk.

50|$|The {{species is}} quite tame. It only attack humans when their nest is molested. Even though, the {{aggressive}} behavior lasts {{only for a}} few minutes, and after that the bees calm down and do <b>not</b> try <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> anymore.

50|$|Wild house snakes {{are often}} very nervous, but are <b>not</b> prone <b>to</b> <b>biting.</b> Their first {{defensive}} reaction is to flee. They are frequently found {{in and around}} human dwellings, where they consume rodents, small lizards, and even birds. House snakes are prolific breeders and lay clutches averaging eight to 12 eggs that hatch after around two months of incubation. Hatchlings are typically around 20 cm long.|$|R
50|$|Modern dogs learn bite {{inhibition}} for {{the same}} reason that their ancestors, the wolves, did: in order to establish an effective dominance hierarchy. It allows for tranquility in large groups when each individual knows its place. Dominance hierarchies may be formed in groups of canines through intense displays of aggression. However, this type of vying for dominance has only been observed in forced groupings of captive wolves. In the wild, this trend is less common, as wolves tend to group off into family units instead of unrelated adults. Therefore, the alpha male and alpha female would simply be the parents, and the offspring would submit readily. Bite inhibition, then, naturally occurs as the pups learn <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> their siblings and parents too hard.|$|E

Mills Lane was interviewed, and said he knew the bites were intentional through his experience and told Tyson <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> anymore and Tyson asked for his disqualification by disobeying the order. Holyfield left the ring seconds after the interview which gave the fans and audience the hint that {{the fight was}} over.

50|$|The Whitworth rifle was {{designed}} by Sir Joseph Whitworth, a prominent British engineer and entrepreneur. Whitworth had experimented with cannons using polygonal rifling instead of traditional rifled barrels, which was patented in 1854. The hexagonal polygonal rifling meant that the projectile did <b>not</b> have <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> into grooves as was done with conventional rifling. In 1856, this concept was demonstrated {{in a series of}} experiments using brass howitzers.|$|R
5000|$|S. hespera, {{the western}} bud spider. This species is {{commonly}} found in the western United States and Canada, where it is an effective predator of the hobo spider.

5000|$|Dracula {{appears in}} Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode [...] "Days of Future Smash: Dracula," [...] voiced again by Corey Burton. When Hulk follows Leader to London in 1890 during the Victorian era, Leader plans to ally himself with Dracula as his train starts to arrive near Hulk and Leader. Dracula even thought that Hulk {{was another one}} of Dr. Frankenstein's creations as he unleashes his vampires on him.
