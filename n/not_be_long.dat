He predicted that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before the Poles would themselves be handing Teschen over to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{existing}} large-scale photovoltaic power stations are {{owned and operated by}} independent power producers, but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing. To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits, but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before external incentives cease to exist.|$|E
25|$|The 122PW of {{sunlight}} reaching the Earth's surface is plentiful—almost 10,000 {{times more than}} the 13TW equivalent of average power consumed in 2005 by humans. This abundance leads to the suggestion that it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before solar energy will become the world's primary energy source. Additionally, solar electric generation has the highest power density (global mean of 170W/m2) among renewable energies.|$|E

25|$|It would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> {{before all}} {{activity}} was halted in Italian football for World War II. After several mergers in 1945, including one between US Passamonte and AP Messina, the club AS Messina subsequently {{emerged as a}} post-war representative of Messina. This was not a clean cut merger however, some players and officials formed the rival club Giostra Messina; both Giostra and AS Messina reached the finals of the Southern League but eventually finished fourth and fifth respectively.|$|E
25|$|It would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long,</b> however, before Troma would {{once again}} {{experience}} financial hardship, this {{time after the}} expensive botched funding of a low-budget video feature titled Tales from the Crapper, which cost $250,000 despite most of the footage being unusable. Lloyd supervised a reshoot {{in an attempt to}} salvage the film, dividing the footage into two parts and recasting the film as a double-feature. Tales from the Crapper was released on DVD in September 2004.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} {{transportation}} improvements {{during the early}} nineteenth century, industry paved the way within individual states. After successful canal development projects further east in the United States, it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> until canals would soon be dug across the Midwest. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 {{paved the way for}} improvement projects across the United States and changed the course of American transportation history. The Erie Canal was an immediate financial success. This really set the precedent for future canals and proved canals could provide a viable contribution to local economies.|$|E

25|$|The {{period of}} {{stagnation}} {{brought about the}} crisis of the Soviet system and reforms could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> delayed. The new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and responded with glasnost and perestroika. They were attempts to reform the Soviet system from above to avoid revolution from below. The reforms failed to take into account that the USSR was held together by military force by repressing all forms of nationalism. The freedoms of Glasnost released long suppressed feelings of nationalism in the Baltic republics, in a development known as the Singing Revolution. The first major demonstrations against the system were in Riga in November 1986 and the following spring in Tallinn. Small successful protests encouraged key individuals {{and by the end of}} 1988 the reform wing had gained a decisive position in the Baltic republics.|$|E

500|$|Eyschen was {{not alone}} in letting his {{principles}} obstruct government business. [...] In the summer of 1915, Eyschen pushed to further reduce the role of the Catholic Church in the state school system. [...] Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde objected. [...] A fervently religious Catholic (as was most of the country, but not her late father, who was Protestant), she was reputed to have said, [...] "I will not allow their most precious heritage [...] to be stolen while I have the key." [...] Marie-Adélaïde refused to budge, inviting Eyschen to resign if he could not accept her decision. [...] Eyschen nearly did, but decided to control himself. [...] Nevertheless, he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> in the job.|$|E
500|$|At Indianapolis, Hogan led at the bat, and {{contemporary}} sources indicate his performance improved. [...] "Marty Hogan, who is playing temporarily in middle {{field for the}} Indianapolis team of the western league...is covering himself in glory with his superb playing", the Vindicator reported on June 4, 1895. [...] "The Indianapolis Sentinel of May 31st says: Hogan made a great record at the bat yesterday morning", the newspaper added. [...] "One of the drives was for a home run {{and three of the}} hits were bunts". [...] In addition, the article credited Hogan with four runs, five base hits, and two put outs in a late morning game against a rival team from St. Paul, Minnesota. [...] The Vindicator went on to quote the Indianapolis Journal as follows: [...] "Among the features of the forenoon game was Hogan's batting. [...] He got five hits, one a home run, and his bunting was even cleverer than usual, and that is saying a great deal". [...] The article concluded, [...] "If he keeps up this gait, it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before [...] Von der Ahe reclaims his pet".|$|E

2500|$|Before {{taking up}} the post of Assistant Professor at the Rice Institute, Huxley {{spent a year in}} Germany {{preparing}} for his demanding new job. Working in a laboratory just months before the outbreak of World War I, Huxley overheard fellow academics comment on a passing aircraft [...] "it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before those planes are flying over England". In 1913 Huxley had a nervous breakdown after the break-up of his relationship with 'K', and rested in a nursing home. His depression returned the next year, and he and his brother Trevelyan (two years his junior) ended up in the same nursing home. Sadly, Trevelyan hanged himself. Depressive illness had afflicted others in the Huxley family.|$|E
2500|$|One year later, when Macarthur reached England, {{the courts}} {{ruled that the}} matter should be tried in Sydney, where all the {{evidence}} and witnesses were. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, rebuked King for failing {{to deal with the}} matter himself, but confirmed that King's orders releasing Macarthur and transferring him to Norfolk Island stood. To avoid the posting, Macarthur resigned his commission, eventually returning to Sydney in 1805 after an absence of nearly four years to run his businesses as a private citizen. Governor King had declared while Macarthur was in London that, [...] "if Captain Macarthur returns here in any official character, it should be that of Governor, as one-half the colony already belongs to him, and it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before he gets the other half." ...|$|E
2500|$|A tribute of 3,000 gold pieces {{each year}} must have proven {{too much for}} the {{revenues}} of the Empire, because either John or David approached their relative by marriage Uzun Hasan about transferring the allegiance of Trebizond from the Ottomans to him. Uzun Hasan agreed to this, and sent envoys to Mehmed II. However, these envoys not only asked for the tribute to be transferred to the Aq Qoyunlu, they demanded on behalf of their master that Mehmed resume payment of tribute Mehmed's grandfather was said to have sent to the Aq Qoyunlu. The sources disagree on exactly how Mehmed II answered, but both versions were ominous. In one version, he told the envoys [...] "that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before they learned what they ought to expect from him." [...] In the other, Mehmed's response was, [...] "Go in peace, and next year I will bring these things with me, and I will clear up the debt." ...|$|E

He was buried five days after his death – {{on the eve of}} his 45th wedding anniversary – at the Dissenter's burial ground in Bunhill Fields, in what is today in the Borough of Islington, London. His parents were interred in the same grounds. Present at the ceremonies were Catherine, Edward Calvert, George Richmond, Frederick Tatham and John Linnell. Following Blake's death, Catherine moved into Tatham's house as a housekeeper. She {{believed}} she was regularly visited by Blake's spirit. She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings, but entertained no business transaction without first [...] "consulting Mr. Blake". On the day of her death, in October 1831, she was as calm and cheerful as her husband, and called out to him [...] "as if he were only in the next room, to say she was coming to him, and it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> now".|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{deal with}} First National expired in 1929, {{after which he}} signed an {{agreement}} with RKO. When there was a management shake-up at the studio in the beginning of 1931, Rogers was named head of production for the studio in January of that year. His tenure at RKO would not last long, his last picture with that studio being 1932's Carnival Boat, which was released in March. It would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before he had signed a deal with Paramount Pictures to provide them with independent films through his own company. [...] The first of those released would be 70,000 Witnesses in September 1932. [...] While at the studio, his production unit would be housed in the historic Mary Pickford bungalow, which would be slated for demolition after his departure. He would make sixteen films for Paramount over the next four years, the last of which was released in September 1935, and was titled The Virginia Judge.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{evening of}} August 1 and early on August 2 IDF Commandos were {{reported}} {{to be engaged in}} fighting around Dar al-Hikma Hospital in Baalbek, an area described as a [...] "Hezbollah stronghold".

Last month the IAF bombed his house in Baalbek. [...] It was unclear whether Yazbek had been captured by IDF but it was reported that he was not in the hospital {{at the time of the}} raid. [...] The IDF denied Yazbek was the intended target of the raid on the hospital but three unidentified POW described as [...] "Hizbullah officials" [...] were captured.
