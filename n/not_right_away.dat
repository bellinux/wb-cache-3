In 2002 he released an acoustic solo album, E(a)rnest, where {{he used a}} Yamaha G55 and spent 18 months recording {{it in his own}} studio. He then commenced a country music group, Darling Downs, with former Died Pretty singer, Ron Peno. Their debut album, How Can I Forget This Heart of Mine?, was released in 2005. It appeared in the US market in May 2006 and Dan Raper of PopMatters noted [...] "these are subtle, slow-hitting songs.

50|$|In 1853, Peter Gideon {{moved to}} Minnesota {{for health reasons}} and took a {{homestead}} with his family {{on the shores of}} Lake Minnetonka, near Excelsior. He had learned fruit-growing as a child, and when he arrived on his new land, he planted a bushel of apple seeds he had brought with him from his former home in Illinois. In the years that followed, Gideon experimented with apple and fruit growing, planting thousands of trees, but most of his trees died within a few years, if <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>away,</b> and none of them bore much fruit.|$|E

50|$|After the Napoleonic Wars, {{which brought}} {{changing}} occupations and annexations of the Duchies of Bremen and Verden (for more details see Bremen-Verden), Bremen-Verden was restored in 1813 to the Electorate of Hanover, which {{transformed into the}} Kingdom of Hanover in 1814.

50|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1853. Powers was {{confident}} enough to cease his banditry and come into the open, and he seized the Mission Santa Inés along with the adjacent Rancho San Marcos. This fertile and profitable operation was leased to prominent local rancher Nicolas A. Den, coincidentally a fellow Irishman who had come to California during Mexican times. Powers attempted to steal the cattle from the ranch but Den caught them during the attempted roundup, and with an armed force he humiliated Powers, making him run for his life, and recovering all the cattle in the process. Powers, not one to turn the other cheek, came back for Den - but <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dromes {{have the}} unique ability to project and control dreams, {{trapping}} their victims within. If someone were to eat {{anything in the}} dream, they would be trapped forever until they starve to death. Once dead, the drome eats its victim (but <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>away,</b> as they have no teeth). Within a dream, dromes can shapeshift {{to blend in with}} their environment, but the one thing they cannot mimic is speech, which sounds like muffled gibberish. When several dromes gather together their powers increase and anyone nearby can be trapped within dreams within dreams within dreams until they are unsure of what is truly real or not. The only {{way to get out of}} a drome's dream is to slice off its head.|$|E

5000|$|The {{clues that}} they chiefly uncover {{are in the}} manner of {{character}} evidence, and Tey supplies a colourful variety. Examples include the facts that Betty has an eidetic memory; when Betty returns home after the alleged kidnapping, the only item she has with her is lipstick; she tells the Wynns about her abduction <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>away,</b> but in various details over a few days; Betty's mother was promiscuous, [...] "a bad mother and a bad wife", according to a neighbour; Mrs. Tilsit, the aunt, tells Blair that Betty spent most of her holiday time not with her aunt and uncle, but in unsupervised freedom: going to the cinema, using buses, and eating lunch away from home; Betty had befriended a teenage girl who had once worked for the Sharpes as a cleaner, whom Betty had bullied. She is described by a couple of people as demure and looking as though [...] "butter wouldn't melt in her mouth"; one of them, a restaurant waiter, tells Blair that Betty came in for tea several times, looking wholesome: [...] "And then one day she picked up the man at the next table. You could have knocked me over with a feather." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ryu is also {{member of}} Sawako's group of friends. He {{is the son}} of the ramen shop owner of Chizuru Yoshida's {{favourite}} ramen shop. He is quiet most of the time and rarely talks, but still can communicate well with Sawako, as they both don't talk much anyways. Ryu and Kazehaya became friends when they were on the baseball team during middle school. He is also close childhood friends with Chizuru and does not deny having feelings for her, such as simply smiling when Sawako asks if he and Chizuru are dating. He later confirms his love when he confesses that he likes Chizuru to Sawako. While his love is one-sided, he is very patient with Chizuru realizing that Chizuru probably won't like him in a romantic sense, at least <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>away.</b> He's more than willing to comfort Chizuru if she's depressed, though he would rather have her mad at him as he knows Chizuru can vent out her emotions better. Ryu also seems to like animals a lot; when Shota was going to walk [...] "Maru", his adopted puppy, home with Sawako, Chizuru pulled Ryu away telling him he's going to walk with Ayane and her instead. While being pulled away from Shota's puppy, he cried out for it. A running gag in the series is that he has a very hard time remembering a person's name (with the exception of Kazehaya and Chizuru as he's known them for a long time, and after some time later Sawako and Ayane). In chapter 43, he casually tells Chizuru that he loves her and she is totally shocked. However, in chapter 59, he truly confesses his love for her, but she replies saying, [...] "I have never looked at you in that way". In response, he smiles and says, [...] "I know." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} a term-by-term scaling {{of the second}} order energy correction obtained by perturbation theory (PT) based on a multiconfiguration wavefunction. The total second order correction is decomposed into several terms, based on the level and spin pattern of the excitations. In particular, same spin and different spin double excitations are grouped separately {{in the spirit of}} spin component scaling (SeS). Identification of the excitation level is facilitated by the pivot determinant underlying the multiconfiguration PT framework. Scaling factors of the individual terms are determined from the stationary condition of the total energy calculated up to order three. In the single reference framework this procedure has been shown to result scaling factors similar to those applied in Grimme's SeS-M 011 er-Plesset method. Several decomposition schemes are tested numerically on the example of bond dissociation profiles. We conclude, that the success of spin component scaling at around equilibrium geometries is <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>away</b> transferable to the entire potential surface, even if adopting a multireference based PT formulatio...|$|E
40|$|Harry Holzer and Karin Martinson {{propose to}} {{spend up to}} $ 5 billion a year of new federal money on {{creating}} “state-level advancement systems ” to promote higher skills and earnings among low-income working parents. I find their proposals attractive but premature. I would rather spend new money first on promoting higher work levels among these adults and on developing better programs. The {{time for a new}} advancement system will come, but <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>away.</b> In table 1 of “Helping Poor Working Parents Get Ahead, ” Holzer and Martinson show that higher incomes are strongly associated with higher educational levels. Incomes are even more strongly linked, however, simply to higher work levels. Among adults age 16 and older with incomes under the poverty level, only 37 percent claimed any earnings at all in 2006, and only 12 percent worked full time year-round. Even among those with incomes under 200 percent of the poverty level, only 47 percent worked at all, and only 24 percent full time year-round. For the population as a whole, the equivalent figures were 68 and 46 percent. For heads of family with children living under the poverty level, only 54 percent worked, 22 percent full time year-round. Looking at heads of families with incomes under 200 percent of the poverty level, the comparable figures were 69 and 41 percent. Among the U. S. population, they were 83 and 62 percent. 1 For the low-income group to work at levels typical of the population would do more to raise family income than anythin...|$|E
