5|$|The {{concept of}} Żydokomuna was widely {{illustrated}} in Polish interwar politics, including publications by the <b>National</b> <b>Democrats</b> and the Catholic Church that expressed anti-Jewish views. During World War II, the term Żydokomuna {{was made to}} resemble the Jewish-Bolshevism rhetoric of Nazi Germany, wartime Romania and other war-torn countries of Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{elections}} to the First Duma (legislative assembly in the late Russian Empire), which were boycotted by the PPS, the <b>National</b> <b>Democrats</b> won 34 of the 55 seats allotted to Poland. Dmowski himself was elected a deputy to the Second and Third Dumas (beginning on 27 February 1907) and was president of the Polish caucus within it. He was seen as a conservative, and despite being a Polish caucus leader, he often had more influence on the Russian than the Polish deputies.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Communist Party {{immediately}} attacked Piłsudski as {{a fascist}} and capitalist, though fascists themselves {{did not see}} {{him as one of}} them. Other opponents of the Sanation regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as Ignacy Daszyński and Tomasz Arciszewski) and Christian Democrats (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, Stanisław Wojciechowski and Władysław Grabski) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions (Wincenty Witos voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but Maciej Rataj and Stanisław Thugutt being supportive), while Roman Dmowski's <b>National</b> <b>Democrats</b> expressed a toned-down criticism.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{actively}} campaigned in {{his district}} on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he lost New Hampshire. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed {{as chairman of the}} House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the <b>national</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw {{the emergence of}} a strong peasant faction. Another notable change over time included {{the emergence of a}} Ruthenian (modern Ukrainian) bloc, changing the balance of power within the body. Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during a time in which it waned in the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition, and saw the emergence of the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the <b>National</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and the Polish socialists, had their political blocs in the diet around that time.|$|E

40|$|<b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> {{is one of}} {{many public}} {{organizations}} in Indonesia. It was grounded on a disappointment to the reformation movement initiated in 1998. The challenges it faces presently are how its communication strategy should be applied for persuading and attracting the people and how to build a good and positive image of its own in order to get more sympathy and to regain trust from the public. The issues of boredom and disappointment, on the part of many members of the societies, to the disappointing performances of the Government might result in bad image for the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party. Another challenge concerns with how to socialize the visions and missions of the Party, through a notion of restoration, in which the objective is, by applying the concepts of proper communication strategies in both marketing and political fields, to transform Indonesia to a nation capable of building its own strength. This is so because <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization is an embryo of political party in Indonesia. The main objective of this research was to analyze the communication strategies used by the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization. Specifically, this research intends to describe the communication strategies used by the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization for socializing its name, tagline and symbol. Proper communication strategies should be selected carefully {{in order to get the}} sympathies from the general public. This selection process is so crucial particularly because of the possibility that the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization might become a new political party. To answer the problems and to reach the research objectives, <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> uses theory of strategic communication and gives an emphasis on action, practice, and communication planning, aided by case study. The research object was the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization. The analyses showed that the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization, in interpreting its notion of Indonesian Restoration, uses three communication strategies: thematic, mediated and non-mediated approaches. The thematic approach is used during declaration programs; its presence in any locality always adapts to the local customs and cultural values in order to show that the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization always wants to be a part of the general members of the locality. The mediated approach makes use of electronic media (radios, TVs), advertising, waiting tones in cellular phones, BlackBerry, mars, hymns, printed media (newspapers, magazines), online media (facebook, website, twitter) and others. (leaflets, banners, ballyhoos, and brochures). The non-mediated approach is manifested in the forms of declaration programs in many localities, national symposiums, off-air activities (focus group discussions, public service programs, special training programs, human service programs, programs for environmental cares, responsiveness to natural disasters through <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Rescue Teams, green programs, farming programs, seminars and commemorations of national religious events). In applying the communication strategy using the mediated approach, the <b>National</b> <b>Democrat</b> Public Organization frequently makes use of an electronic group medium, namely Metro TV. Actually, a television station is not a media for the interests of any partial group, but it’s a public room. Therefore, it’s recommended that the group medium should maintain its neutral position as a medium merely using the public room.

25|$|Piłsudski's {{seizure of}} Vilnius in October 1920 (known as Żeligowski's Mutiny) was a {{nail in the}} coffin of the already poor Polish–Lithuanian {{relations}} that had been strained by the Polish–Lithuanian War of 1919–20; both states would remain hostile to one another {{for the remainder of}} the interwar period. Piłsudski's planned Intermarium (an East European federation of states inspired by the tradition of the multiethnic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that would include a hypothetical multinational successor state to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and thus became incompatible with his assumption of Polish domination and encroachment on neighboring peoples' lands and aspirations at the time of rising national movements. It soon ceased to be a feature of Poland's politics. A larger federated structure was also opposed by Dmowski's <b>National</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Their representative at the Peace of Riga talks, Stanisław Grabski, opted for leaving Minsk, Berdychiv, Kamianets-Podilskyi and the surrounding areas on the Soviet side of the border, since the <b>National</b> <b>Democrats</b> did not want to permit population shifts that they considered politically undesirable, especially if the transfers would result in a reduced proportion of citizens who were ethnically Polish.|$|E
25|$|On May 12, 1926, Piłsudski staged the May Coup, a {{military}} {{overthrow of the}} civilian government mounted against President Stanisław Wojciechowski and the troops loyal to the legitimate government. Hundreds died in fratricidal fighting. Piłsudski was supported by several leftist factions who ensured {{the success of his}} coup by blocking the railway transportation of government forces. He also had the support of the conservative great landowners, a move that left the right-wing <b>National</b> <b>Democrats</b> as the only major social force opposed to the takeover.|$|E

25|$|After {{the peace}} {{negotiations}} Poland did not maintain all the territories it had controlled {{at the end}} of hostilities. Due to their losses in and after the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas, closely resembling the border between the Russian Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth before the first partition of 1772. Polish resources were exhausted, however, and Polish public opinion was opposed to a prolongation of the war. The Polish government was also pressured by the League of Nations, and the negotiations were controlled by Dmowski's <b>National</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Piłsudski might have controlled the military, but parliament (Sejm) was controlled by Dmowski: Piłsudski's support lay in the territories in the East, which were controlled by the Bolsheviks {{at the time of the}} elections, while the National Democrats' electoral support lay in central and western Poland. The peace negotiations were of a political nature. <b>National</b> <b>Democrats,</b> like Stanisław Grabski, who earlier had resigned his post to protest the Polish–Ukrainian alliance and now wielded much influence over the Polish negotiators, cared little for Piłsudski's vision of reviving Międzymorze, the multicultural Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This post-war situation proved a death blow to the Międzymorze project. More than one million Poles, living mostly in the disputed territories, remained in the Soviet Union, systematically persecuted by Soviet authorities because of political, economic and religious reasons (see the Polish operation of the NKVD).|$|E
25|$|For Piłsudski, this {{alliance}} {{gave his}} campaign for the Międzymorze federation the legitimacy of joint international effort, secured part of the Polish eastward border, and laid a foundation for a Polish-dominated Ukrainian state between Russia and Poland. For Petlura, this was the final chance to preserve the statehood and, at least, the theoretical independence of the Ukrainian heartlands, even while accepting the loss of West Ukrainian lands to Poland. Yet {{both of them were}} opposed at home. Piłsudski faced stiff opposition from Dmowski's <b>National</b> <b>Democrats</b> who opposed Ukrainian independence. Petlura, in turn, was criticized by many Ukrainian politicians for entering a pact with the Poles and giving up on Western Ukraine.|$|E
