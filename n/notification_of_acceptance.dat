2500|$|Once {{an offer}} is made, {{the general rule}} is the offeree must {{communicate}} her acceptance {{in order to have}} a binding agreement. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> must actually reach a point where the offeror could reasonably be expected to know, although if the recipient is at fault, for instance, by not putting enough ink in their fax machine for a message arriving in office hours to be printed, the recipient will still be bound. This goes for all methods of communication, whether oral, by phone, through telex, fax or email, except for the post. Acceptance by letter takes place when the letter is put in the postbox. The postal exception is a product of history, and does not exist in most countries. It only exists in English law so long as it is reasonable to use the post for a reply (e.g. not in response to an email), and its operation would not create manifest inconvenience and absurdity (e.g. the letter goes missing). In all cases it is possible for the negotiating parties to stipulate a prescribed mode of acceptance. It is not possible for an offeror to impose an obligation on the offeree to reject the offer without her consent. However, it is clear that people can accept through silence, firstly, by demonstrating through their conduct that they accept. In Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company, although the Metropolitan Railway Company had never returned a letter from Mr Brogden formalising a long term supply arrangement for Mr Brogden's coal, they had conducted themselves for two years as if it were in effect, and Mr Brogden was bound. Secondly, the offeror may waive the need for communication of acceptance, either expressly, or implicitly, as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Here a quack medicine company advertised its [...] "smoke ball", stating that if a customer found it did not cure them of the flu after using it thrice daily for two weeks, they would get £100. After noting the advertisement was serious enough to be an offer, not mere puff or an invitation to treat, the Court of Appeal held the accepting party only needed to use the smokeball as prescribed to get the £100. Although the general rule was to require communication of acceptance, the advertisement had tacitly waived the need for Mrs Carlill, or anyone else, to report her acceptance first. In other cases, such as where a reward is advertised for information, the only requirement of the English courts appears to be knowledge of the offer. Where someone makes such a unilateral offer, they fall under a duty to not revoke it once someone has begun to act on the offer. Otherwise an offer may always be revoked before it is accepted. The general rule is that revocation must be communicated, even if by post, although if the offerree hears about the withdrawal from a third party, this is as good as a withdrawal from the offeror himself. Finally, an offer can be [...] "killed off" [...] if, rather than a mere inquiry for information, someone makes a counter offer. So in Hyde v Wrench, when Wrench offered to sell his farm for £1000, and Hyde replied that he would buy it for £950 and Wrench refused, Hyde could not then change his mind and accept the original £1000 offer.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Track A: Algorithms, Complexity and Models of ComputationInternational audienceWe {{consider}} the online scheduling of unit length jobs with two models of commitment. In immediate <b>notification,</b> the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a job must be decided {{as soon as}} it is released. In immediate decision, the actual time slot allocated to the job must also be fixed at the job’s arrival as well. Failure to honour a commitment will result in a penalty. The non-commitment version has been extensively studied. In this paper we give algorithms and lower bounds for the two models of commitment. For immediate decision, we give an O(m(1 [*]+[*]ρ) 1 /m) -competitive algorithm where m is the number of machines and ρ is the penalty factor, and when m is large we give an O(log(1 [*]+[*]ρ)) upper bound. This is matched by a lower bound of Ω(logρ) on the competitive ratio. For immediate notification we give a lower bound of Ω(logρ/loglogρ). We also give some better bounds when m[*]=[*] 1 or when ρ is small. Finally we give considerations to the case of separate arrival and start times...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R

40|$|The {{algorithms}} in {{the current}} sequential numerical linear algebra libraries (e. g. LAPACK) do not parallelize well on multicore architectures. A new family of algorithms, the tile algorithms, has recently been introduced. Previous {{research has shown that}} it is possible to write efficient and scalable tile algorithms for performing a Cholesky factorization, a (pseudo) LU factorization, and a QR factorization. In this extended abstract, we attack the problem of the computation of the inverse of a symmetric positive definite matrix. We observe that, using a dynamic task scheduler, it is relatively painless to translate existing LAPACK code to obtain a ready-to-be-executed tile algorithm. However we demonstrate that non trivial compiler techniques (array renaming, loop reversal and pipelining) need then to be applied to further increase the parallelism of our application. We present preliminary experimental results. Comment: 8 pages, extended abstract submitted to VecPar 10 on 12 / 11 / 09, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> received on 02 / 05 / 10.

The ERB inventory has reached a level where it can now be used by scientists interested in exchanging and analysing research results. This offers wide opportunities to perform comparative basin studies. The conference will therefore focus on methods of hydrological comparison and regionalization used for basin studies. Approaches for physical, chemical, biological and ecological comparisons are welcome. Topics may include methods of comparing basins before and after modifications, how to detect and quantify changes, use of GIS etc [...] Intending participants should have submitted an extended abstract in English of not more than two pages by 13 March 1992, indicating their preference for oral or poster presentation, and will receive <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> by 1 May 1992.

Acronym: NWM: NON-WORD MORPHOLOGY SEMINAR The seminar ‘Non-words, Nonce-words and Morphology Teaching’ {{will be held}} {{within the}} 12 th ESSE Conference in Košice, Slovakia. CONVENORS Silvia Cacchiani, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy; Christoph Haase, Purkyně University, Ústí nad Labem, Czech Republic DESCRIPTION While psycho- and neurolinguistics (e. g. Marslen-Wilson 1987, 2007, Kielar et al. 2008, Rastle et al. 2008, Crepaldi 2010) have shown increasing interest in the representation of non-words, nonce-words or nonsensical words in the mental lexicon, their potential as a yardstick for the morphological competence of L 2 learners has not been widely explored. The aim of this seminar is to bring together theoretical and applied research on non-words, nonce-words, and the teaching of English morphology. Suggested topics include (but are not restricted to) : –	morphological processes in language comprehension, also models of word recognition; –	analogy in morphology and analogy in L 2 learning; –	best practice in morphology teaching; –	learner access to lexical strata, feature percolation and permissibility, and related performance.
