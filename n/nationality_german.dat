50|$|For private correspondence, {{language}} choice {{tends to}} reflect social class. Member {{of the upper}} middle and upper classes tend to prefer French, although Luxembourgish {{may be used to}} convey a sense of close identification with one's <b>nationality.</b> <b>German</b> tends to be viewed negatively among the upper class, with the assumption that anyone writing in German has a poor mastery of French. In spite of this, a minority of members of the upper class do prefer standard German when corresponding with close relatives. Use of German becomes more prominent the lower down the social scale one goes, followed by Luxembourgish, with French tending to be the least popular among the lower classes.|$|E

40|$|The Canary Islands have {{traditionally}} been a destination for mass tourism, a fact that is not, however, necessarily incompatible with a growing trend towards segmentation in tourist markets. In fact, the experience of other traditional destinations, like the Balearic Islands, shows that the two trends can {{take place at the}} same time. This article presents the results of a segmentation study carried out on a representa-tive sample of the tourist market for the island of La Palma (Canary Islands) in early 2002. More specifi-cally, we cross demand segments and services to study a possible imbalance between tourist expectations for the services offered and the services that are actually contracted in the destination. The segments studied were: <b>nationality</b> (<b>German</b> and Spanish), income and type of establishment; and the services studied: excur-sions, recreational activities in general and sports activities in particular. The results show that the best posi-tive response to the destination is found for excursions for both nationalities. For the other services offered, however, (recreational activities and more specifically sports activities), the response differs substantially from one nationality to another, suggesting that the destination in general is {{in a better position to}} cover the contracting expectations of Spanish domestic tourism. In summary, the results of the study lead us to con-clude that the cultural factors associated with nationality have the strongest influence on defining tourist service consumer behaviou...|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{the bulk}} of the {{production}} depended on the rubber. But with the modernization of the infrastructure of the state at the hands of Tubman, Liberia started to use its other national resources. Several Americo-Liberian <b>nationalities,</b> <b>German</b> and Swedish companies became involved in the exploitation of iron mines, making Liberia the first source of iron in Africa and the fourth worldwide. Tubman wanted to diversify the economy rather than basing it on rubber and iron resources which made 90% of exports, so he encouraged the development of coffee plantations, palm oil, sugar cane and especially rice cultivation in 1966 with the help of Taiwan.|$|R
