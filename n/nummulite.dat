The nummulites of the limestone are the only known means we have of forming an approximate estimate {{of the age of}} the Khasia coal, which is the most interesting feature in the geology of the range: these fossils have been examined by MM. Archiac and Jules Haines,* ["Description des Animaux Fossiles des Indes Orientales;" [...] p. 178. These species are Nummulites scabra, Lamarck, N. obtusa, Sowerby, N. Lucasana, Deshayes, and N.

60|$|Hearing {{that the}} gold-hilted {{official}} swords of the King of Béin were for sale, and wishing {{to inspect the}} place, we set off at 3.30 P.M. to cover the 4,769 yards measured along the sands by Mr. Graham. Reaching our destination, eighteen miles distant from Axim, we were carried up the long straight street-road {{which leads to the}} old English fort. It is the normal building, a house on bastions, both well and solidly made of stone and lime. Amongst the materials I found a fine yellow sandstone-grit and a <b>nummulite</b> so weathered that the shells stood out in strong relief. Both were new to us on this trap-coast, and no one could say where they were quarried; many thought they must have come from Europe, others that they are brought from inland. The masonry of the sea-front was pitted with seven large wounds, dealt by as many shells when we broke down our own work. Such was the consequence of sympathising with the Ashantis in 1873, when Axim also was bombarded.|$|E
60|$|The {{compressed}} {{wave of the}} Brezon, more complex in arrangement, was more clearly defined. A section of it was given, showing the reversed position of the Hippurite limestone in the summit and lower precipices. This limestone wave was shown {{to be one of}} a great series, running parallel with the Alps, and constituting an undulatory district, chiefly composed of chalk beds, separated from the higher limestone district of the Jura and Lias by a long trench or moat, filled with members of the tertiary series--chiefly <b>nummulite</b> limestones and flysch. This trench might be followed from Faverges, {{at the head of the}} lake of Annecy, across Savoy. It separated Mont Vergi from the Mont Dorons, and the Dent d'Oche from the Dent du Midi; then entered Switzerland, separating the Moleson from the Diablerets; passed on through the districts of Thun and Brientz, and, dividing itself into two, caused the zigzagged form of the lake of Lucerne. The principal branch then passed between the high Sentis and the Glarnisch, and broke into confusion in the Tyrol. On the north side of this trench the chalk beds were often vertical, or cast into repeated folds, of which the escarpments were mostly turned away from the Alps; but on the south side of the trench, the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous beds, though much distorted, showed a prevailing tendency to lean towards the Alps, and turn their escarpments to the central chain.|$|E

6000|$|In {{that state}} it will make, {{if it is}} {{crystalline}} and hard, excellent building stone. The finest white marble, like that of Carrara in Italy, of which the most delicate statues are carved, is carbonate of lime altered and hardened by volcanic heat. But to make mortar of it, it must be softened and then brought into a state in which it can be hardened again; and ages since, some man or other, who deserves to rank {{as one of the}} great inventors, one of the great benefactors of his race, discovered the art of making lime soft and hard again; in fact of making mortar. The discovery was probably very ancient; and made, probably like most of the old discoveries, in the East, spreading Westward gradually. The earlier Greek buildings are cyclopean, that is, of stone fitted together without mortar. The earlier Egyptian buildings, though the stones are exquisitely squared and polished, are put together likewise without mortar. So, long ages after, were the earlier Roman buildings, and even some of the later. The famous aqueduct of the Pont du Gard, near Nismes, in the south of France, has, if I recollect right, no mortar whatever in it. [...] The stones of its noble double tier of circular arches have been dropped into their places upon the wooden centres, and stand unmoved to this day, simply by the jamming of their own weight; a miracle of art. But the fact is puzzling; for these Romans were the best mortar makers of the world. We cannot, I believe, surpass them in the art even now; and in some of their old castles, the mortar is actually to this day harder and tougher than the stones which it holds together. [...] And they had plenty of lime at hand if they had chosen to make mortar. The Pont du Gard crosses a limestone ravine, and is itself built of limestone. But I presume the cunning Romans would not trust mortar made from that coarse <b>Nummulite</b> limestone, filled with gritty sand, and preferred, with their usual carefulness, no mortar at all to bad.|$|E

50|$|Fossils {{are present}} in high numbers and often show {{excellent}} quality of preservation. The most conspicuous fossils are the skeletons and bones of whales and sea cows, and over several hundred fossils of these have been documented. The fossils of whales vary from single bones to entire skeletons, {{and a number of}} partial skeletons are currently on display in the public part of the park. The two common whales are the large Basilosaurus, and the smaller (3 to 5 metre) Dorudon. At least two other species are known from rarer remains. The whales possess small hind limbs, that are not seen in modern whales, and a powerful skull with teeth similar to those of carnivorous land mammals.Other mammals are represented by the skeletons of three species of sirenia or sea cows. These were fully marine like the whales, and likewise show primitive features not seen in modern species and possess teeth that suggest that they grazed on seagrasses and other marine plants. Bones of the primitive elephant Moeritherium have also been recorded. Fossil reptiles are represented by fossils of crocodiles and sea turtles, and bones of sea snakes have also been recorded. There are many species of bony fish, sharks and rays represented, but most of the fossils are isolated small teeth and these are not often conspicuous. Larger fish fossils include the rostra and pegs of sawfish; a sawfish rostrum of 1.8 metres long is laid out in the park. Fossil shells are not common in the main whale-bearing rocks, but are very common in other rocks; many fallen rocks can be seen to be full {{of a wide variety of}} fossil shells. Disc-shaped <b>nummulite</b> fossils are common in places, and often coat the desert floor.A large log is present in the park, and this is full of tubular shipworm fossils. Some fossil seagrasses are also known.|$|E
40|$|Reticulate <b>Nummulites</b> are a {{widespread}} and distinctive group of <b>Nummulites,</b> frequently used in biostratigraphy, but their evolution is poorly understood. Studies from the Western Tethys suggest {{they form a}} single lineage, the <b>Nummulites</b> fabianii lineage, with an increasing proloculus size over time. This has led to their use {{as one of the}} diagnostic taxa for larger benthic foraminiferal biostratigraphy. However, outside of this region, additional taxa have been recorded. The most widely discussed example is <b>Nummulites</b> ptukhiani, which was described from Armenia, whose morphology does not fit with the N. fabianii lineage. This raises the question whether reticulate <b>Nummulites</b> are monophyletic, or the result of multiple independent convergent evolutionary lineages. Here we present data from three newly identified populations of Lutetian to Bartonian reticulate <b>Nummulites</b> from the stratigraphically well-constrained Tanzania Drilling Project records, which shed new light on the ancestry of these aberrant forms. These populations are characterized by extremely large proloculi and unusual morphology. We demonstrate that the populations are consistent with an evolutionary lineage that is morphologically distinct but contemporaneous with the N. fabianii lineage of the Tethys. These forms are remarkably similar in external and internal morphology to the Armenian <b>Nummulites</b> ptukhiani. We therefore refer to them as the N. ptukhiani lineage. The existence of a second lineage of reticulate <b>Nummulites</b> indicates that their evolution is more complex than previously thought and raises questions as to whether they evolved from a common ancestor, or independently. It also underlines the importance of carrying out thorough studies of larger benthic foraminifera with independent stratigraphical control from outside of the Tethyan region to more fully understand their evolution and to enable accurate biostratigraphy...|$|R
40|$|Larger benthic foraminifera (LBF) are {{important}} and prolific carbonate producers both in modern and ancient shallow tropical seas. During the Paleogene the genus <b>Nummulites</b> was particularly abundant with a global distribution, leading it to be frequently used in biostratigraphy. However, their evolution is poorly understood as classification is Europe-centered and mostly based on external characters and equatorial thin sections. New occurrences from regions outside the northern Tethys which poorly fit in thus reference frame, show that a more rigid framework for the classification of <b>Nummulites</b> is needed. Here we apply micro computed-tomographical scanning, a tool that recently has become available, to visualise 3 D chamber shape of <b>Nummulites</b> djokdjokartae and compare these to traditional morphometrical characters. We find that despite the regular shape in equatorial and axial thin section the irregular 3 D chamber shape is not predicted by these sections. We argue that 3 D reconstructions of <b>Nummulites</b> tests {{will be a great}} aid in improving our understanding of lineages within the genus <b>Nummulites,</b> and to elucidate its evolutionary and biogeographical history...|$|R

50|$|As {{quoted from}} Charles Lyells Principles of Geology:Strabo... enters largely, in the Second Book of his Geography, into the {{opinions}} of Eratosthenes and other Greeks {{on one of the}} most difficult problems in geology, viz., by what causes marine shells came to be plentifully buried in the earth at such great elevations and distances from the sea.He notices, amongst others, the explanation of Xanthus the Lydian, who said that the seas had once been more extensive, and that they had afterwards been partially dried up, as in his own time many lakes, rivers, and wells in Asia had failed during a season of drought. Treating this conjecture with merited disregard, Strabo passes on to the hypothesis of Strato, the natural philosopher, who had observed that the quantity of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine was so great, that its bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still continued to pour in an undiminished quantity of water. He therefore conceived that, originally, when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had by this means become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near Byzantium, and formed a communication with the Propontis, and this partial drainage had already, he supposed, converted the left side into marshy ground, and that, at last, the whole would be choked up with soil. So, it was argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for itself by the Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic, and perhaps the abundance of sea-shells in Africa, near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, might also be the deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length forced a passage and escaped.But Strabo rejects this theory as insufficient to account for all the phenomena, and he proposes one of his own, the profoundness of which modern geologists are only beginning to appreciate. It is not, he says, because the lands covered by seas were originally at different altitudes, that the waters have risen, or subsided, or receded from some parts and inundated others. But the reason is, that the same land is sometimes raised up and sometimes depressed, and the sea also is simultaneously raised and depressed, so that it either overflows or returns into its own place again. We must therefore ascribe the cause to the ground, either to that ground which is under the sea, or to that which becomes flooded by it, but rather to that which lies beneath the sea, for this is more moveable, and, on account of its humidity, can be altered with great celerity. It is proper, he observes in continuation, to derive our explanations from things which are obvious, and in some measure of daily occurrence, such as deluges, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea; for the last raise up the sea also, and when the same lands subside again, they occasion the sea to be let down. And it is not merely the small, but the large islands also, and not merely the islands, but the continents, which can be lifted up together with the sea; and both large and small tracts may subside, for habitations and cities, like Bure, Bizona, and many others, have been engulfed by earthquakes.In another place, this learned geographer Strabo, in alluding to the tradition that Sicily had been separated by a convulsion from Italy, remarks, that at present the land near the sea in those parts was rarely shaken by earthquakes, since there were now open orifices whereby fire and ignited matters and waters escaped; but formerly, when the volcanoes of Etna, the Lipari Islands, Ischia, and others, were closed up, the imprisoned fire and wind might have produced far more vehement movements. The doctrine, therefore, that volcanoes are safety valves, and that the subterranean convulsions are probably most violent when first the volcanic energy shifts itself to a new quarter, is not modern.The very first written definition/discussion on the fossil formation (mentioning <b>Nummulite</b> quoted from A.M.

40|$|Eocene <b>nummulite</b> {{deposits}} {{along the}} southern Tethys margin locally constitute important hydrocarbon reservoir rocks. In {{order to understand the}} heterogeneity of these complex reservoirs, we have carried out a detailed field study of the <b>nummulite</b> limestones which crop out at the Kesra Plateau in Central Tunisia. The main contributions of this paper can be summarised as follows: 1. Various species of Nummulites and planktonic foraminifera were identified in late Ypresian carbonates in the Kesra area and provided accurate biostratigraphic ages. Nummulitic limestones occur in the Chouabine and El Garia Formations representing deposition over a period of about 2 Ma. 2. Six depositional facies have been identified in the El Garia Formation, ranging from high-energy nummulitic grainstones to laterally-equivalent lower-energy nummulithoclastic accumulations. Variations in <b>nummulite</b> morphology (size and shape) were used to distinguish a number of subfacies which correspond to different depositional environments. We provide evidence that <b>nummulite</b> accumulations were locally sub-aerially exposed. 3. A 3 D reconstruction of the Kesra Plateau outcrop identified two stacked <b>nummulite</b> bodies, deposited under high-energy conditions, which pass laterally into two isolated bodies in more distal parts of the platform. 4. Regional-scale observations indicate that the geometry of the late Ypresian <b>nummulite</b> platform was strongly influenced by the presence of the Oued Bahloul anticline structure, which formed a major environmental barrier between openmarine and more restricted settings. Facies distribution in the Kesra area was strongly controlled by the inherited topography, which reflects the reactivation of NW-SE trending faults during the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene. 5. A tentative 3 D facies model illustrates the relationship between facies and fault distributions in the Kesra area. The facies map shows that the best reservoir potential is associated with palaeo-highs, and consists of <b>nummulite</b> limestones deposited in very shallow waters (a few metres) under high-energy conditions...|$|E
40|$|The "nummulite bank" is an {{accumulation}} of <b>nummulite</b> tests, mainly monospecific, with both microspheric and megalospheric generations of the same species. Moreover, it usually contains more tests of larger B forms {{as compared with the}} normal nummulite-bearing limestones. Previous works on <b>nummulite</b> banks have resulted in the proposition of two models. The first, by Arni, suggests that <b>nummulite</b> test accumulations form autochthonous or in-situ banks acting as an effective barrier, analogous to present-day coral reefs. On the other hand Aigner, based upon several evidences of physical transportation shown in sedimentary structure and biofabrics of Nummulites deposits, considered them as allochthonous. So far there is no quantitative data available about the taxonomic composition of <b>nummulite</b> banks. Here we present the preliminary results of a quantitative examination on a case-study from the Middle Eocene of Northern Italy. The samples were collected in Pederiva di Grancona (Vicenza Province, Veneto area). The Nummulites lyelli from this well-known site were described and figured by Schaub in his monograph. The present work is based upon the preliminary examination of 50 grams from a washed sample of the <b>nummulite</b> bank. In this fraction, 509 individuals (A forms) of Nummulites have been counted. The dominant species is N. lyelli accounting for approximately 77. 1 %, followed by N. striatus with 10. 5 %. The rest are the accessory species including N. biarritzensis (5. 9 %), N. discorbinus (4. 9 %), and N. beaumonti (1. 6 %). According to the dominance of N. lyelli and the stratigraphic distribution of the other Nummulites species the sample is assigned to the SBZ 17 (early Bartonian). N. lyelli A in this sample has a mean diameter of 5. 75 mm, whereas that of N. striatus Ais 4. 20 mm. The two most abundant species display a clear difference in size: N. lyelli mean diameter exceeds about + 37 % in comparison with N. striatus. Given that N. lyelli is also more inflated than N. striatus, they probably had a quite different hydrodynamic behaviour. The taxonomic composition of the bank in this case study shows that it is not strictly monospecific, as in the models from the literature: even if there is a strong dominance of N. lyelli, N. striatus cannot be discarded as negligible. Moreover, there are three more species of the same genus which are present in significant percentages, pointing to an unexpectedly rich <b>nummulite</b> assemblage. This in turn casts serious doubts on the allochthonous model for <b>nummulite</b> bank accumulations...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the “nummulite bank”concept, there has been a lively debate regarding its interpretation as an authochthonous structure or an allochthonous accumulation of the tests. Even if the hydrodynamic models confirmed the possibility that large B tests could be quite easily transported and accumulated far from the original life environment, some recent observations on the taxonomic composition of different banks questioned the transport and suggest in situ accumulation as a valid alternative. A new approach to the problem could come from the new techniques available {{for the study of the}} molecular fossils. A <b>nummulite</b> bank from the Monte Saraceno (Gargano, southern Italy) has been selected to be examined with respect to the possible content of organic matter. This <b>nummulite</b> bank, dominated by large B forms of Nummulites gizehensis and N. puigsecensis (SBZ 16 - 17, upper Lutetian-lower Bartonian, Middle Eocene), develops clinostratified thick beds, interbedded with skeletal calcarenites, with an original slope angle estimated to be about 20 ° (Adams et al., 2002). Selected samples were collected from both <b>nummulite</b> bank and skeletal calcarenite beds. To verify the possible influence of early cementation we analysed the interparticle micrite matrix to characterize its nanomorphology and geochemistry. A careful examination showed that generally the original micrite has been recrystallised into aggrading microsparite. Optical observations revealed the micrite peloidal nature and showed also high epifluorescence due to its organic matter content. The presence of organic matter remains is confirmed by the epifluorescence of <b>nummulite</b> tests whose pattern follows the wall microstructure and the canal system. The epifluorescent micrites, in SEM observation, display the characteristic peloidal pattern with smaller crystal size in comparison with organic matter depleted areas. The Si distribution detected by EDS analyses allows to differentiate detritic micrite from automicrite. The former is present in the skeletal calcarenites and the latter in the bank facies. The geochemical characterization of extracted organic matter has been performed through the functional group analyses by FT-IR. Infrared spectra show a strong prevalence of the aromatic fraction over the aliphatic and carboxylic ones, confirming the thermal maturation of the organic compounds. This result would exclude the presence of preserved biomarkers, but the general pattern of the chromatogram could indicate peculiar assemblages of carbonatogenic microbes. Preliminary data on the micrite preserved in the <b>nummulite</b> bank allow hypothesizing induced biomineralization processes probably were linked to bacterial activity. The syndepositional cementation of the micrite could have influenced the stabilization of the <b>nummulite</b> bank, preventing the remobilization of <b>nummulite</b> tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} Tethys margin {{constitutes an}} important hydrocarbon reservoir. It is formed mainly of <b>Nummulite</b> rich facies of the Jdeir Formation deposited during the Eocene epoch (Late Ypresian age) in the giant El-Bouri oil field-Sabratah Basin-NW Libya. Deposits of the Jdeir Formation directly overlay the Jirani dolomite and Bilal Formation, and unconformably underlay the Tellil Group and Ghallil Formation. ^ <b>Nummulite</b> accumulations are good indicators for hydrocarbon studies {{and they have}} been targets for numerous studies around the world. <b>Nummulite</b> 2 ̆ 2 Large foraminifera 2 ̆ 2 tests are usually identified by two forms: A-form and B-form. Previous studies have highlighted many different aspects of foraminifers including taxonomy, test structure, test transport, abrasion, biofabric, climate, and ecological studies, and test morphology. However, previous studies have not studied in detail the distribution of A-form and B-form. This present study aims to use A/B Ratio distributions within facies and relate that to two aspects; depositional environments and physical processes. The present study will use a Minas 2 ̆ 7 s chart which summaries the relationship between A/B ratio, depositional environment, and physical processes. In addition, classification of death assemblages will be evaluated to distinguish the physical processes. ^ This could provide insight into the vertical and lateral distribution of porosity and permeability, as well as understanding the relationships between <b>Nummulite</b> biofabrics and the physical processes.

40|$|Settling {{velocities}} of 58 well-preserved {{tests of}} fossil Nummulites were experimentally determined using a settling tube. The tests {{were collected from}} the <b>nummulite</b> banks of Pederiva di Grancona (A forms of N. lyelli and N. striatus, Middle Eocene) and San Germano dei Berici (A and B forms of N. fabianii, Late Eocene), both in the Berici Mts. (Veneto, northern Italy). The data were compared with estimated settling velocities that the same specimens might have had in life conditions. This was done by reconstructing their densities simulating water- lled condition and, to simulate post-diagenetic effects, under calcite- lled condition. These simulations show that A and B forms, even if they greatly diverge in shape, volume and size, still possess comparable settling velocities, and that each <b>nummulite</b> bank is characterized by speci c hydrodynamic parameters. The use of settling velocity as a parameter to quantify the hydrodynamic behaviour of particles in seawater enables estimation of palaeoenvironmental conditions such as depth, substrate and the energy scenario. Such information is useful in obtaining further insights into the genesis of <b>nummulite</b> banks, the autochthony or allochthony of which is still being debated.

40|$|The macroforaminiferal assemblages (mostly Nummulitidae, Discocyclinidae and Orbitoclypeidae) {{from the}} Middle-Upper Eocene {{boundary}} at Mossano (Berici Mts., Veneto, Italy) are investigated in detail. The paleoecological approach, mainly based on microfacies analysis, allowed {{the reconstruction of}} the paleoenvironments at different times. During the late Middle Eocene, the studied area was on the southeastern margin of the Lessini Shelf. In the latest Middle Eocene the sea depth was reduced to a few meters, probably during a lowstand, allowing deposition of carbonate sands with large <b>nummulites</b> (mainly <b>Nummulites</b> biedai). The global regressive event of about 39. 5 Ma B. P. is therefore also recognized in this region.

A correlation between the first marls of Mossano and the transgressive sediments of the lowermost part of the Priabona stratotype is proposed.
