40|$|Recent, {{unprecedented}} {{increases in}} wind penetration pose new challenges to maintaining good control performance in power systems. The stochastic nature of wind power creates {{an incentive to}} treat control resources as stochastic. This work presents a stochastic, time-dependent model of <b>contingency</b> <b>reserve</b> (CR) activation {{that is based on}} system behavior expected by the NERC and WECC disturbance control performance standards. The model quantifies CR activation as a statistical combination of probability density functions (PDFs) that represent CR response deficiencies and generation outage probabilities. This work also formulates an algorithm for determining the CR response deficiency PDFs in real time from observed energy management system data. The proposed model has multiple applications such as a deterministic or stochastic unit commitment, system adequacy evaluation, <b>contingency</b> <b>reserve</b> margins, and <b>contingency</b> <b>reserve</b> allocation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDetermining {{the budget}} is a {{fundamental}} process {{for the development of}} infrastructure projects for three main reasons: a) it establishes a cost baseline that integrates project scope and quality requirements along with sponsor's funding limits, b) it constitutes a performance measure during the whole project's life-cycle, and c) it affects the competitiveness of the bid. Budgeting and cost estimation methods vary in terms of complexity and accuracy, but, most important, in the way they address <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> in the total budget. The aim of this research is to explore the most applicable budgeting methods for infrastructure projects with regard to the inclusion of risks related costs to the overall budget and demonstrate the capacity of stochastic processes for optimizing overall budgets. Case- based reasoning, multiple regression analysis, Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic methods are briefly presented in terms of theoretical approach, requirements, accuracy and integration of risks. Two prevailing budgeting methods, namely the deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation are applied on a real case of reinforced concrete works for a building project; the comparison of the results highlights the two major findings of this research: a) stochastic processes provide more accurate justification of the <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> required for inclusion of risks in budgets of infrastructure projects, and b) stochastic processes are optimum for the definition of realistic <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> that, in turn, results to more competitive bids.

In assessing various options, the experience of pesticide regulation is informative—a front-end regulatory framework like that employed in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act could address many of the shortcomings of federal emergency spill response.

40|$|Keeping a <b>contingency</b> <b>reserve</b> {{in power}} systems is {{necessary}} to preserve the security of real-time operations. This work studies two different approaches to the optimal allocation of energy and reserves in the day-ahead generation scheduling process. Part I presents a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model to co-optimize energy and the locational reserves required {{to respond to a}} set of uncertain generation contingencies, using a novel state-based formulation. The model is applied in an offer-based electricity market to allocate <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> throughout the power grid, in order to comply with the N- 1 security criterion under transmission congestion. The objective is to minimize expected dispatch and reserve costs, together with post contingency corrective redispatch costs, modeling the probability of generation failure and associated post contingency states. The characteristics of the scheduling problem are exploited to formulate a computationally efficient method, consistent with established operational practices. We simulated the distribution of locational <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> on the IEEE RTS 96 system and compared the results with the conventional deterministic method. We found that assigning locational spinning reserves can guarantee an N- 1 secure dispatch accounting for transmission congestion at a reasonable extra cost. The simulations also showed little value of allocating downward reserves but sizable operating savings from co-optimizing locational nonspinning reserves. Overall, the results indicate the computational tractability of the proposed method. Part II presents a distributed generation scheduling model to optimally allocate energy and spinning reserves among competing generators in a day-ahead market. The model is based on the coordination between individual generators and a market entity. The proposed method uses forecasting, augmented pricing and locational signals to induce efficient commitment of generators based on firm posted prices. It is price-based but does not rely on multiple iterations, minimizes information exchange and simplifies the market clearing process. Simulations of the distributed method performed on a six-bus test system showed that, using an appropriate set of prices, it is possible to emulate the results of a conventional centralized solution, without need of providing make-whole payments to generators. Likewise, they showed that the distributed method can accommodate transactions with different products and complex security constraints...|$|R
