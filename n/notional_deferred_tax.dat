40|$|This study {{provides}} value relevance analysis of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> on companies that revalued its fixed assets {{for the period}} of 2008 - 2015. Selection of these companies is because fixed assets revaluation is one of the components of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Fixed Assets Revaluation will cause <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> asset or liability depend on the comparison of the company recorded value and the market value. When the company recorded value is larger than the market value of assets would cause <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liability, and in contrast if the company recorded value is lower than the market value of assets would cause <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> asset. 120 firms are the total sample of this study. This study uses Feltham & Ohlson’s price model in order to regress the value relevance of the sample. Dependent variable that used in this study is closed price per share. Independent variables that used in this study are <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and liabilities and other components of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> (net <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets, net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities, and net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> based on quintile distribution).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and liabilities for a sample of large U.

In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and 48 reported net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities. Firms differ substantially in the composition of their <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and liabilities. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while total <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement.

The importance of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities as a key marker of efficiency of the tax policy of the agricultural organizations is emphasized. Its inefficiency can be judge by excess of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets over <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities, which is seen as a temporary diversion of funds from the market, which has zero profitability.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on the signalling function of accounting and financial information by investigating the information content of the adoption of a certain accounting practice, namely the recognition of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> in the financial statements. Specifically, we examine whether (1) the decision to recognise a certain accounting practice, and (2) the timing of the recognition supplement one another as signalling devices. The new accounting law on <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> (Royal Decree of December 30, 1991) requires all Belgian firms to recognise <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> for all grants on the balance sheet as of 30 / 12 / 91. The results show that the recognition and the timing of the recognition supplement one another as signalling tools. The immediate recognition of positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> signals good news: firms that report positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> typically perform better at the time of adoption and in the near future thereafter. Within the class of recognisers, early recognisers perform better than late recognisers. However, this second signal, the timing of the recognition is only used as a second signal for the class of tax-paying firms. Our findings also indicate that the impact on the balance sheet is a significant determinant of the decision to report <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Firms where the adoption of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> would lead to a high increase in the debt/equity ratio are less likely to adopt, or, if they do report <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> do so later. These results suggest that firms decide not to recognise positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> in order to limit the decrease in their solvency position. Indeed, firms that have already experienced a decline in their solvency position are more likely to postpone the recognition of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Accounting; Law; Solvency;...|$|R
40|$|The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has {{undertaken}} research on accounting for income taxes. The IASB {{research suggests that}} a fundamental change from International Accounting Standard 12 : Income Taxes (IAS 12), the balance sheet method, to another method may be considered. Other methods for accounting for <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> include the taxes payable method, the comprehensive basis under the income statement method, and the partial basis under the income statement method. This thesis provides evidence on this issue by using non-United States data to examine these <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> methods. This thesis examines the research question “are <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> methods, relative to the taxes payable method, information relevant?” Information that is ‘information relevant’ has two components: predictability and value relevance (Ohlson, 1995). The predictability of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> methods is measured by its ability to predict future tax payments relative to the taxes payable method. The value relevance of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> methods is measured by its association with share price relative to the taxes payable method. Literature examining <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> predominately uses United States US data and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), and only partially examines <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> methods. This thesis {{contributes to the literature}} by examining all three <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> line items: <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities, <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> expense. The data is collected from the financial information for firms listed on the NZ Stock Exchange. Two samples of firms are examined: from 2000 to 2004 (pre IFRS) and 2008 to 2012 (post IFRS). The results show that the comprehensive basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future tax payments and is value relevant relative to the taxes payable method. This indicates that it is information relevant. The partial basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future tax payments relative to the taxes payable method however it is only value relevant for firms in the highest three deciles of mean increases in tax paid over the period. The balance sheet method is not a better predictor of future tax payments relative to the taxes payable method. The balance sheet method is, however, value relevant. The balance sheet method using disaggregated <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> is also value relevant relative to the balance sheet method...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether the <b>Deferred</b> <b>Tax</b> Expenses analysis can be employed to detect earnings management in Indonesian Capital Market. This study also compares the <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> expenses method and the accrual method as the proxy of Earnings Management. This study finds that <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> expenses and the accrual measures (using Total Accruals model, Modified Jones Model and Forward Looking Model) have positive and significant impacts on the probability of earnings management to avoid losses. It means that the bigger the value of Accrual and <b>Deferred</b> <b>Tax</b> Expenses the bigger the probability of earnings management practices. Of the three models used, the deferred Jax expenses variable has similar significances compared to total accrual model and higher significances compared to the discretionary accrual models. This shown that <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> expenses can be used as an alternative to Accrual Models in explaining the earnings management phenomena around the earnings threshold. In the additional study, we find that factors affected earnings management can 2 ̆ 7 t explain the variation of <b>Deferred</b> <b>Tax</b> Expenses.

I find significantly negative coefficients for both <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> items, indicating that higher recognized <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets are associated with lower future tax payments and higher non-usable tax loss carryforwards with lower future performance. Additionally, I compare the tax accounts' predictive ability for a matched German and US sample and find no significant differences between firms reporting under IFRS and US-GAAP. Taken together, the evidence suggests that <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> items for tax loss carryforwards reported under IFRS provide useful information about future outcomes and that this predictive ability does not differ significantly from firms reporting under US-GAAP...|$|R
