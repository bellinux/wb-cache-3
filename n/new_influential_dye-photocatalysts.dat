5000|$|In {{the year}} 1749, {{thirteen}} enterprising families, twelve from Camargo {{and one from}} Reynosa, decided to invest and begin a <b>new,</b> <b>influential</b> cattle industry in the area. [...] Former landowners were reluctant that this new investment would be successful, since the frequent overflows from the Rio Grande caused severe floods, and because ranches were occasionally attacked by Indians. Nonetheless, these thirteen families effectively carried out their business plan and structuralized 113 cattle-raising sites. In the year 1774, they officially named the area San Juan de los Esteros Hermosos, known today as Matamoros.|$|R

The period is divided in three parts : the destruction of the old society and its values from 1970 to 1983, the installation of <b>new</b> <b>influential</b> and nonelected powers such as Canal + or public organisations from 1984 to 1992 and the contradictions of a system organized in the European Union and the globalization since 1992 and the ratification of the treaty of Maastricht.|$|R

Over the next hundred years, the family added to its land holdings in Surrey and his father, Peter Atte Wode, purchased the 220 acre estate known as 'Wood Place' in 1279. The Atte Wodes emerged as one of the <b>new</b> <b>influential</b> class of yeomen who were becoming substantial land owners in England.

While Ian Baker identifies the problems {{of higher education in}} Melbourne's west, his proposals for a new university of technology fall far short of solving them. For years educational administrators used an excuse that for some reason the workers do not need the same breadth and depth of education, denying Footscray a high school; then they denied it a fully autonomous technical college. Now the same excuse is being used to justify a narrow university of technology instead of the kind of fully fledged institution which has been established in Sydney, Brisbane and even Perth...|$|R
40|$|We {{ask what}} kinds of sources Wikipedians value most and compare Wikipedia’s stated policy on sources to what we observe in practice. We find that primary data sources de-veloped by {{alternative}} publishers are both popular and per-sistent, despite policies that present such sources as inferior to scholarly secondary sources. We also find that Wikiped-ians make almost equal use of information produced by as-sociations such as nonprofits as from scholarly publishers, with a significant portion coming from government informa-tion sources. Our findings suggest the rise of <b>new</b> <b>influential</b> sources {{of information on the}} Web but also reinforce the tra-ditional geographic patterns of scholarly publication.

She became involved with powerful and influential men, such as the Anglo-Irish Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, (1868-1940), who ran influential newspapers in London and promoted support for Germany. Princess Stephanie fled England after war was declared, joining a former lover in the United States.

25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} Egyptian records are from the 1350 BC Amarna letters, when Damascus (called Dimasqu) was ruled by king Biryawaza. The Damascus region, {{as well as the}} rest of Syria, became a battleground circa 1260 BC, between the Hittites from the north and the Egyptians from the south, ending with a signed treaty between Hattusili and Ramesses II where the former handed over control of the Damascus area to Ramesses II in 1259 BC. The arrival of the Sea Peoples, around 1200 BC, marked the end of the Bronze Age in the region and brought about new development of warfare. Damascus was only the peripheral part of this picture which mostly affected the larger population centres of ancient Syria. However, these events had contributed to the development of Damascus as a <b>new</b> <b>influential</b> center that emerged with the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.|$|R
