A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E

5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E

25|$|Dnyaneshwar's moral {{philosophy}} {{comes out in}} his exposition of the 13th of Bhagavad Gita, in his commentary on the book Dnyaneshwari. He considers humility; non–injury in action, thought and words; forbearance {{in the face of}} adversity; dispassion towards sensory pleasures; purity of heart and mind; love of solitude and devotion towards one's Guru and God as virtues; and their corresponding moral opposites as vices. A pessimistic view of one's life is considered as a necessary condition for spiritual growth in Dnyaneshwari. Dnyaneshwar writes that saints do <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> distinctions and are humble because they identify all objects, animate or inanimate, with their own Self.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{recurrent}} {{themes of}} these painstakingly detailed new theories {{was the idea}} that humans may <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> colours in isolation but rather, that one colour may be seen to interfere with another colour neighbouring it. In this way, colour perception was explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data. Seurat’s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most obviously in such areas as those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.|$|E

The report concludes that the Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at the family members, as they could <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> any danger from the house, its occupants or the surroundings. The report bases its conclusion on the premise that the family, consisting of a man, a young and an elderly woman and three small girls, some of them waving white flags, stepped {{out of the house and}} stood still for several minutes waiting for instructions from the soldiers.|$|E

25|$|A common anime {{character}} design {{convention is}} exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime {{can be traced}} back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes. The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used. Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign. However, not all anime have large eyes. For example, the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.|$|E
25|$|The Northern and Western {{parts of}} the city, which are closer to the Fijeh springs, receive better service than the Southern and Eastern parts {{that are at the}} end of the {{distribution}} network. Service is also better in winter when the yield of the spring is highest. During winter residents in the Northwestern parts of Damascus typically receive a continuous flow of water, while residents in the Southeastern {{parts of the}} city receive water for only a few hours per day or even every couple of days during summer. For example, the town of Sahenya, 16km south-west of Damascus, was for 10 days without water in 2006. Most houses in Damascus have rooftop tanks to store water during periods of supply. Many houses have dual plumbing systems, with one tap for water that comes directly from the network and another tap for water that comes from the rooftop tank. As a consequence, many residents do <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> a water crisis during most of the year, because they have sufficient water either from the network or from their rooftop tanks.|$|E
25|$|The live-shows {{began with}} the Top-15 show to {{determine}} the contestants that would make up the Top 10 in the mottoshows. As done in the previous seasons, the Top 10 were contestants put through from the public vote and the jury's vote. However, 7 (instead of 5) contestants were put through with the public votes and 3 (instead of 5) would be put through by the jury; which ultimately became the contestants that ranked with the next three largest number of votes. In the first live show, Steffi Landerer, who was known for her sex appeal, was eliminated. Marcel Pluschke, who was eliminated on the second live-show, did <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> an excellent audience respect because of his weak voice and country music roots (which was a first in DSDS). Though criticized for his song selection in the third live show, Nelson Sangaré was surprisingly eliminated after ranking {{as one of the}} top contestants throughout the first and second live-shows. After being in the bottom groups every week, Ines Redjeb was eventually eliminated in the fourth live-show. Though proving to be a favorite in the competition despite ranking in the bottom half of the voting, Manuel Hoffmann was eliminated in the fifth show against Helmut Orosz. Orosz, who was a Top 50 contestant in the second season, became criticized for his problems with singing correct texts; immediately after Hoffmann's elimination, the producers of DSDS had found a video of Orosz with a friend using cocaine recently, to which Orosz confessed. Because of this, Orosz was disqualified from the contest and Hoffmann returned to the live-shows surpassing crowd favorite Thomas Karaoglan in the sixth-live show and Kim Debkowski in the seventh live-show. However, Hoffmann's journey ended in the semi-final leaving the finale in the hands of the season's front-runners Menowin Fröhlich and Mehrzad Marashi. Fröhlich, a local DJ, successfully auditioned for the show in the third season making it to the Top-20 live-shows; he later became disqualified due to battery and fraud. Both friends throughout the recall, tensions rose throughout the competition between fans and themselves. After the final vote, Marashi won though only ranking in first place in the Top-15 and the finale as Fröhlich ranked first every week.|$|E

500|$|Finally, the {{successor}} of Djedkare, Unas, {{is thought to}} have been his son in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question. The main argument in favor of this filiation is that the succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth, as suggested indirectly, for example, by the Abusir papyri. Indirect evidence also comes from the reliefs of Unas' causeway, which show many officials bearing names incorporating [...] "Isesi", suggesting at the very least that Unas did <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> Djedkare as an antagonist.|$|E
500|$|In test {{screenings}} {{prior to}} its premiere, reaction to the show was sharply divided. According to executive producer Stephanie Sills, the strongest negative reaction came from male executives. [...] "They didn't mind being portrayed by women.

[...] Feminists were uncertain how {{to react to the}} series, with some being concerned that audiences would <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> the show as satire but as an attempt to represent how a female-dominated society would actually operate.
