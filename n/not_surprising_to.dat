Increased expression was also correlated with more malignant and metastatic tumors, consistent with the role of Ephs in governing cell movement.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{contrasts}} {{between the}} two men was that Newton was primarily a pioneer in mathematical analysis and its applications as well as optical experimentation, while Hooke was a creative experimenter of such great range, that it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> find that he left some of his ideas, such as those about gravitation, undeveloped. [...] This in turn makes it understandable how in 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, Alexis Clairaut, mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation. [...] "One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory", Clairaut wrote; [...] "The example of Hooke" [...] serves [...] "to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".|$|E
2500|$|In 20th century {{mainstream}} economics, {{the term}} [...] "utility" [...] {{has come to}} be formally defined as a quantification capturing preferences by assigning greater quantities to states, goods, services, or applications that are of higher priority. [...] But marginalism and the concept of marginal utility predate the establishment of this convention within economics. [...] The more general conception of utility is that of use or usefulness, and this conception {{is at the heart of}} marginalism; the term [...] "marginal utility" [...] arose from translation of the German [...] "Grenznutzen",Natural Value] (1889), Bk I Ch V [...] "Marginal Utility" [...] (...) [...] which literally means border use, referring directly to the marginal use, and the more general formulations of marginal utility do not treat quantification as an essential feature. [...] On the other hand, none of the early marginalists insisted that utility were not quantified, some indeed treated quantification as an essential feature, and those who did not still used an assumption of quantification for expository purposes.

[...] Filmmaker François Porcile later said [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> find, in the sudden explosive tension and somber conviction of his acting, a direct echo of Jaubert's style, with its gathering momentum and sudden restraint, its reticence and violence." [...] Truffaut explained: [...] "I realized that his music, full of clarity and sunlight, was the best to accompany the memory of all these dead." [...] However, an infrequent use of music throughout the final film sees a consistent quietness take place, which is regarded to have masked [...] "an exploration of human isolation in an inhuman society and of the strength and limitations of moral and aesthetic purity."

Science fiction and fantasy was popular on television with Doctor Who, The Avengers, Thunderbirds, The Man from UNCLE and Lost in Space all notable hits at the time. Out of the Unknown, however, would offer more adult, cerebral fare. Initial audience and critical reaction was mixed but improved as the series went on with “Andover and the Android” (“It's not until intelligence, humour and gaiety break into television that you notice what tasteless pap we've been living on” - Daily Mail) and “Some Lapse of Time” (“It was <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> hear from Late Night Line Up {{that there had been}} many complimentary telephone calls after the play [...] it left the viewer with the disconcerting feeling that there was more than a grain of truth in its fantasy” - Birmingham Evening Mail and Dispatch) proving particularly popular with audiences and critics alike. BBC2 Controller David Attenborough praised the “overall professionalism that has become a hallmark of the series”. By the end of its first run, Out of the Unknown was the most popular drama on BBC2 after the imported Western The Virginian.|$|E
2500|$|As Fisher was Barker's choice, it {{is likely}} that the two men had similar views from the outset, so it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> find Fisher taking up the Puritan cause during his {{incumbency}} at Upton Magna. He seems to have followed controversies in Shrewsbury, which was very close. In a preface to some sermons he published in the 1650s, Fisher denounced those who had endangered his liberty by traducing his doctrine. While this might have applied to several phases of his career, he added in the margin: [...] "Mr Studley and some others." [...] At the time of Fisher's appointment Studley had become mired in a controversy over his book, The Looking-glasse of Schisme in which he sought to explain a sensational murder at Clun as the result of the Puritan principles of the killer. The book was published in London in 1634 and reissued in an expanded edition in 1635. Under Thorough, the experiment in absolute monarchy then in force, a reasoned reply by Richard More, a layman of St Chad's parish, could not be published and it did not appear until 1641. After the furore, Studley resigned from St Chad's and moved a few miles to a living at Pontesbury. Whether his offence to Fisher was more personal than the contents of his polemic is unknown. Certainly Fisher was not one to ignore intemperate abuse of his faith. He wrote to Sir Robert Harley, then serving as MP for Herefordshire in the Long Parliament, to report some anti-Puritan banter that might have serious implications.|$|E

60|$|The poet's ancestry and {{parentage}} are chiefly {{interesting as}} explaining {{some of the}} complexities of his character. His father, David Poe, was of Anglo-Irish extraction. Educated for the Bar, he elected to abandon it for the stage. In one of his tours through the chief towns of the United States he met and married a young actress, Elizabeth Arnold, member of an English family distinguished for its musical talents. As an actress, Elizabeth Poe acquired some reputation, but became even better known for her domestic virtues. In those days the United States afforded little scope for dramatic energy, so it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> find that when her husband died, {{after a few years}} of married life, the young widow had a vain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones, William Henry, Edgar, and Rosalie. Before her premature death, in December, 1811, the poet's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the charity of her neighbors.|$|E

She might, therefore, be left to believe what she liked to believe, without fear of a day of reckoning. Verena committed herself to nothing more confirmatory than a kiss, however, which the old lady's displaced head-gear enabled her to imprint upon her forehead and which caused Miss Birdseye to exclaim, [...] "Why, Verena Tarrant, how cold your lips are!"

That is, unless something which might possibly produce sound is evident to the eye, the absence of sound is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> the ear, and, therefore, not impressive. Let it be observed, for instance, how much the stillness of a summer's evening is enhanced by the perception of the gliding and majestic motion of some calm river, strong but still; or of the high and purple clouds; or of the voiceless leaves, among the opening branches. To produce this impression, however, the motion must be uniform, though not necessarily slow. One of the chief peculiarities of the ocean thoroughfares of Venice, is the remarkable silence which rests upon them, enhanced as it is by the swift, but beautifully uniform motion of the gondola. Now, there is no motion more uniform, silent or beautiful than that of smoke; and, therefore, when we wish the peace or stillness of a scene to be impressive, it is highly useful to draw the attention to it.|$|E
