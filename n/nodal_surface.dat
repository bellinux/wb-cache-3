40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} three-dimensional topological semimetals with <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> protected by crystalline symmetries. Different from the well-known nodal-point and nodal-line semimetals, in these materials, the conduction and valence bands cross on closed <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the Brillouin zone. We propose different classes of <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> {{both in the}} absence and {{in the presence of}} spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the absence of SOC, a class of <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be protected by spacetime inversion symmetry and sublattice symmetry, and characterized by a Z_ 2 index, while another class of <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> are guaranteed by a combination of nonsymmorphic two-fold screw-rotational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. We show that the inclusion of SOC will destroy the former class of <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> but may preserve the latter provided that the inversion symmetry is broken. We further generalize the result to magnetically ordered systems and show that protected <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> can also exist in magnetic materials without and with SOC, given that certain magnetic group symmetry requirements are satisfied. Several concrete nodal-surface material examples are predicted via the first-principles calculations. The possibility of multi-nodal-surface materials are discussed.

40|$|Using {{a rapidly}} {{convergent}} composite basis of Frankowski-Pekeris and Frankowski functions, we have accurately calculated the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of low-lying excited {{states of the}} helium atom to investigate Bressanini and Reynolds’ conjecture D. Bressanini and P. J. Reynolds, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 110201 2005 that these <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> are rigorously independent of the interelectronic angle 12. We find that in fact there is a slight dependence of the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> on 12, {{but it is so}} small that the assumption of strict independence may well yield extremely useful approximations in fixed-node quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We explain how Kato’s cusp conditions determine the qualitative features of these <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which can accurately be modeled using the familiar ansatz of a symmetric or antisymmetric linear combination of products of hydrogenic orbitals, with some adjustments of the parameters. We explain why a similar near independence of the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the angular variables can be expected for the ground and singly excited states of the lithium atom, but generally not for larger atoms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of orbitals, in {{particular}} {{of the highest}} occupied one, play a special role in Kohn-Sham density-functional theory. The exact Kohn-Sham exchange potential, for example, shows a protruding ridge along such <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> leading to the counterintuitive feature of a potential that goes to different asymptotic limits in different directions. We show here that <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> can heavily affect the potential of semilocal density-functional approximations. For the functional derivatives of the Armiento-Kummel (AK 13) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 036402 (2013) ] and Becke 88 [Phys. Rev. A 38, 3098 (1988) ] energy functionals, i. e., the corresponding semilocal exchange potentials, {{as well as the}} Becke-Johnson [J. Chem. Phys. 124, 221101 (2006) ] and van Leeuwen-Baerends (LB 94) [Phys. Rev. A 49, 2421 (1994) ] model potentials, we explicitly demonstrate exponential divergences in the vicinity of <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We further point out that many other semilocal potentials have similar features. Such divergences pose a challenge for the convergence of numerical solutions of the Kohn-Sham equations. We prove that for exchange functionals of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) form, enforcing correct asymptotic behavior of the potential or energy density necessarily leads to irregular behavior on or near orbital <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We formulate constraints on the GGA exchange enhancement factor for avoiding such divergences.

The Kummer involution has 16 fixed points: the 16 2-torsion point of the Jacobian, {{and they are the}} 16 singular points of the quartic surface. Resolving the 16 double points of the quotient of a (possibly nonalgebraic) torus by the Kummer involution gives a K3 surface with 16 disjoint rational curves; these K3 surfaces are also sometimes called Kummer surfaces.|$|E

40|$|The factors {{influencing}} {{the quality of}} the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> namely, the atomic basis set, the single-particle orbitals, and the configurations included in the wave-function expansion, are examined for a few atomic and molecular systems. The following empirical rules are found: the atomic basis set must be fairly large, complete active space and natural orbitals are usually better than Hartree-Fock orbitals, multiconfiguration expansions perform better than single-determinant wave functions, but only few configurations are effective and their choice is suggested by symmetry considerations, while too long determinantal expansions spoil the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These rules allow us to reduce the nodal error and to compute the best fixed node-diffusion Monte Carlo energies for a series of dimers of first-row atoms...|$|R

40|$|We extend {{some results}} on even sets of nodes {{which have been}} proved for {{surfaces}} up to degree 6 to surfaces up to degree 10. In particular, we give a formula for the minimal cardinality of a nonempty even set of nodes. Let S ⊂ P 3 (C) be a hypersurface of degree s with µ ordinary double points (nodes) as its only singularities. Such a surface will be called a <b>nodal</b> <b>surface</b> in the sequel. Denote by N = {P 1, [...] ., Pµ} ⊂ S the set of nodes of S. The maximum number of nodes of a <b>nodal</b> <b>surface</b> of degree d is denoted classically by µ (d). There {{is a lot of}} (old) literature on nodal surfaces and estimates for µ (d) (see [E]). For d = 1, 2, [...] ., 6 the numbers µ (d) are 0, 1, 4, 16, 31, 65 and for every k ∈ { 0, 1, [...] ., µ (d) } there exists at least one <b>nodal</b> <b>surface</b> of degree d with exactly k nodes. In the case of cubic nodal surfaces (d = 3), this follows from Cayley’s and Schläfli’s classification of singular cubic surfaces [Cay], [S]. For quartic nodal surfaces (d = 4) the fact that µ (4) = 16 is due to Kummer [K], whereas the construction of arbitrary nodal quartics goes back to Rohn [R].

We analyze the model in the two phases and prove that, in a double scaling limit, the symmetric phase corresponds to a theory of infinitely refined random surfaces, while the broken phase corresponds to a theory of infinitely refined random <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> At leading order in the double scaling limit planar surfaces dominate in the symmetric phase, and planar <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> dominate in the broken phase...|$|R

40|$|The Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) {{method is}} a {{powerful}} strategy to estimate the ground state energy E 0 of a N-body Schrödinger hamiltonian H = − 1 ∆ + V with 2 high accuracy. Briefly speaking, it consists in writing E 0 as the long-time limit of the expectation value of a drift-diffusion process with source term, and in numerically simulating this process {{by means of a}} collection of random walkers. As for a number of stochastic methods, a DMC calculation makes use of an importance sampling function ψI which hopefully approximates some ground state ψ 0 of H. In the fermionic case, it has been observed that the DMC method is biased, except in the special case when the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of ψI coincide with those of a ground state of H. The approximation arising from the fact that, in practice, the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of ψI differ from those of the ground states of H, is refered to as the Fixed Node Approximation (FNA). Our purpose in this article is to provide a mathematicial analysis of the FNA. We prove that, under some hypotheses, a DMC calculation performed with the importance sampling function ψI, provides an estimation of the infimum of the energy 〈ψ, Hψ〉 on the set of the fermionic test functions ψ that vanish on the <b>nodal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of ψI. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that 4 -body real space Jastrow factors are, {{with the right}} type of Jastrow basis function, capable of performing successful wave function stenciling to remove unwanted ionic terms from an overabundant fermionic reference without unduly modifying the remaining components. In addition to greatly improving size consistency (restoring it exactly {{in the case of}} a geminal power), real-space wave function stenciling is, unlike its Hilbert space predecessors, immediately compatible with diffusion Monte Carlo, allowing it to be used in the pursuit of compact, strongly correlated trial functions with reliable nodal surfaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in the context of a double bond dissociation by using it to extract a qualitatively correct <b>nodal</b> <b>surface</b> despite being paired with a restricted Slater determinant, that, due to ionic term errors, produces a ground state with a qualitatively incorrect <b>nodal</b> <b>surface</b> when used in the absence of the Jastrow.
