25|$|One of Microsoft's biggest {{advances}} initially {{developed for}} Windows NT {{was a new}} 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 16-bit Windows API. This API was called Win32, {{and from then on}} Microsoft referred to the older 16-bit API as Win16. The Win32 API had three levels implementations: the complete one for Windows NT, a subset for Chicago (originally called Win32c) missing features primarily of interest to enterprise customers (at the time) such as security and Unicode support, and a more limited subset called Win32s which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems. Thus Microsoft sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and Windows <b>NT,</b> <b>even</b> though the two systems had radically different internal architectures. Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel.|$|R
