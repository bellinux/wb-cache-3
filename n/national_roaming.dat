This made Three the UK's first commercial video mobile network. On 9 December 2004, Three {{announced that it was}} the first network to meet its regulatory requirement of 80% population coverage in the UK. Three's UK division is owned entirely by Hutchison Whampoa. Three operates 3G and 4G services, and maintains a <b>national</b> <b>roaming</b> agreement with Orange to provide 2G services where 3G is unavailable. Until 2006, Three partnered with O2 for 2G services. The 2G fallback coverage provided by Orange has since greatly diminished. While still available, it is being removed in some areas as Three believe 3G technology is now enough for mass adoption, and as a result, many (often at the cheaper end) phones that support only 2G networks are not compatible with the Three network.|$|E

2500|$|Three Austria started {{operations}} in May 2003. The company promised to have 95% population coverage with HSDPA end of 2007. By 2008, 3's 3G coverage reached 94% of the population. Outside {{the coverage of}} its own 3G-network (UMTS/HSDPA/HSPA+) it relies on <b>national</b> <b>roaming</b> on the network of T-Mobile Austria (before Mid-2012, the network of A1 was used for <b>national</b> <b>roaming).</b> 3 Austria {{is the first in}} Austria to offer its customers so called [...] "HD Mobile TV" [...] based on the H.264 encoding standard, and won IIR telcon awards for their eBay (2006) and X-Series Gold (2007) offerings. 3 Austria won a DVB-H license and launched the service in June 2008, with three devices and free usage of Mobile TV. In September 2010 – The number of 1 million customers were exceeded. In November 2011 – 3 Austria launched HD Voice and LTE In January 2012, 3 Austria announced its <b>national</b> <b>roaming</b> agreement with T-Mobile, which will introduce from July 2012. Customers of 3 Austria will be able to roam on T-Mobile's GSM-network where 3's GSM-network is not available. Simultaneous clients of T-Mobile (including tele.ring) will be able to roam on 3's UMTS-network where T-Mobile's UMTS-network is not available. The roaming agreement with A1 will be continued parallel until year-end. On 3 February 2012 Hutchison Whampoa announced that it had bought Orange Austria for US$1.7 billion, from France Télécom which owned a 35% stake, and private equity firm Mid Europa Partners, which held the remaining 65%. The combined business will create a mobile carrier with 2.8 million customers and more than 20 percent market share in Austria. JPMorgan Chase advised Hutchison on the deal, while Morgan Stanley advised France Télécom and Mid Europa Partners.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{local area}} {{networks}} (WLANs) {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in offices, homes, and public places. In public “hotspots ” such as airports and hotels, these networks {{can be used to}} provide broadband wireless connectivity for people on the move. In Finland, hotspot networks are operated by TeliaSonera and DNA Finland. Because of interference issues, only one WLAN network can usually be built in one hotspot site. This leads to competition between the operators of the hotspot locations. Otherwise, the barriers for operators to enter the public WLAN market are sufficiently low. A number of different players are expected to enter the market, with different kinds of backgrounds. The business models pursued by the players may vary considerably. Roaming agreements can be used to enable subscribers of one operator to access their services using networks of other operators. A number of different roaming models exist, including bilateral agreement, clearinghouse, and roaming broker models. By far, the Finnish public WLAN operators have used bilateral agreements to enable roaming with international partners. <b>National</b> WLAN <b>roaming</b> is not available, decreasing the service coverage of all operators and hindering the success of the whole public WLAN market...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the {{determinant}} factors of switching behavior in the Thai cellular market before the Mobile Number Portability (MNP) policy is implemented. Design/methodology/approach - A binary logit model and individual survey data from the National Telecommunications Commission 2009 are used to estimate the intention of mobile phone consumers to switch. Findings - The results show that subscriber characteristics, including age, government officer, self-employed, Internet use, central region, and southern region, are significant in explaining the switching behavior of Thai mobile subscribers. They also indicate that the mobile operators’ customers are confronted with different switching costs. The subscribers of the largest mobile operator have the highest switching costs. This study also shows that the largest mobile operators will gain more switching subscribers than smaller operators. The implementation of MNP will help to lower the switching costs of smaller mobile operators rather than of larger operators, as the subscribers of smaller operators are more likely to switch and move to larger mobile operators, as the larger operators provide better quality network coverage. The study shows that the expected impact of implementing MNP without <b>national</b> mobile <b>roaming</b> regulations would be worse for smaller mobile operators. The smaller operators need to compete on both price and quality improvement. In the short run, it would not be possible for the smaller operators to compete with the larger operators due to the inequality in the quality of network coverage. Originality/value - The result is useful to developing countries considering implementing MNP regulation. Paper type – Research pape...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid double taxation, {{non-taxation}} or the distortion of competition, an EU member state may, in accordance with Article 9(3)(a) of Council Directive 77/388 ("the Sixth VAT Directive"), include {{within the scope of}} its national VAT any telecommunications services used within its territory but billed outside the EU VAT area. When opting to do so, it must also exempt from its <b>national</b> VAT any <b>roaming</b> services supplied by home networks within its territory but used outside the EU VAT area. The inclusion of telecommunications within the scope of Article 9 was requested by the United Kingdom, which subsequently enacted the change under Article 19 of the Value Added Tax (Place of Supply of Services) Order 1992. Consequently, when an EU member state makes this VAT exemption, roaming on networks in the Åland Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, the Canary Islands, Ceuta, Melilla and French overseas departments is subject to the price caps with no VAT applied, because these countries and territories are within the EEA but outside the EU VAT area.|$|R

50|$|This type of roaming {{refers to}} the ability to move from one mobile {{operator}} to another in the same country.For example, a subscriber of T-Mobile USA who is allowed to roam on AT&T Mobility's service would have <b>national</b> <b>roaming</b> rights.For commercial and license reasons, this type of roaming is not allowed unless under very specific circumstances and under regulatory scrutiny. This has often taken place when a new company is assigned a mobile telephony license, to create a more competitive market by allowing the new entrant to offer coverage comparable to that of established operators (by requiring the existing operators to allow roaming while the new entrant has time to build up its own network).In a country like India, where the number of regional operators is high and the country is divided into telecom circles, this type of roaming is common.
