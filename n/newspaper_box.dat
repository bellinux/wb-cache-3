500|$|The South Park Blocks, {{especially}} near Portland State University, {{have been}} home to protests and marches. A workers' rights protest on May 1, 2000, organized by the May Day Coalition, gathered 300–400 people. Police chief Mark Kroeker said 19 people, some [...] "dressed like anarchists and (carrying) gas masks" [...] were arrested, and Portland Police used bean bag rounds, with fears of repeating the 1999 WTO riots in Seattle unless sufficient force was shown early. The police declared emergency at 3:45pm after a lit <b>newspaper</b> <b>box</b> was thrown at officers, then the police corralled the marchers into a smaller space with mounted officers and ordered them to disperse. A protest march against the police action was held on May 4, 2000, stating that the show of force was excessive and contrary to the city's community policing ethos. 23 complaints of excessive police force led to a large citywide hearing on June 28, 2000. The 2009 May Day rally, supporting immigration reform, attracted 1500 people.|$|E

Targeted at evening public transit commuters on GO Transit and TTC (Toronto Transit Commission), its main distribution channels were {{through the use of}} newsies, <b>newspaper</b> <b>boxes</b> and PATH billboards throughout Toronto’s downtown core, and through <b>newspaper</b> <b>boxes</b> across the TTC. The publication name was originally stylized with periods as [...] "t.o.night" [...] - a tongue-in-cheek reference to Toronto (often shortened in passing reference as T.O.) {{and the fact that it}} is produced Tuesday and Thursday evenings. The newspaper was unique in Canada, with its magazine size and format, making for easy transit reading.|$|R

50|$|Rotisserie league baseball, nicknamed roto, {{proved to}} be popular, even in the 1980s when full {{statistics}} and accurate reporting were often hard to come by. The traditional statistics used in early Rotisserie leagues were often chosen because they were easy to compile from <b>newspaper</b> <b>box</b> scores and then from weekly information published in USA Today. Okrent, based on discussions with colleagues at USA Today, credits Rotisserie league baseball {{with much of the}} early success of USA Today, since the paper provided much more detailed box scores than most competitors and eventually even created a special paper, Baseball Weekly, which almost exclusively contained statistics and box scores. Local papers soon caught up with USA Todays expanded coverage.|$|E
