Now she is dead. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> her effects were auctioned off at the Hotel Drouot.

25|$|Hepialidae are {{distributed}} on ancient landmasses worldwide except Antarctica {{but with the}} surprising exceptions of Madagascar, the Caribbean islands and in Africa, tropical West Africa. It remains to be borne out if these absences are real as Aenetus cohici was <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> discovered in New Caledonia. In the Oriental and Neotropical regions hepialids have diversified in rainforest environments, but this not apparently {{the case in the}} Afrotropics. Hepialids mostly have low dispersive powers and do not occur on oceanic islands with the exception of Phassodes on Fiji and Western Samoa and a few species in Japan and Kurile Islands. Whilst the type locality of Eudalaca sanctahelena is from the remote island of St Helena, this is thought to be an error for South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Tolstoy's actions became {{instrumental}} {{in the life of}} the Seventh. Stalin read Pravda closely and he generally trusted Tolstoy's comments. He remained highly suspicious of spontaneous outpourings of mass enthusiasm both before and after the war, seeing them as veiled instances of oppositionist feelings. However, he also realized squelching such mass expressions in wartime could be unwise, and he had Tolstoy's comments to give them credence in the case of the Seventh Symphony. Tolstoy's interpretation of the Seventh, in fact, lined up with Stalin's stated support of nationalism and patriotism. At least as important was that without the help of the United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union would not overcome Nazi Germany. The Soviets had been seen <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> in the Western press as godless villains and barbarians. Now the Americans and British had to believe that the Soviet Union was helping protect the values those countries cherished from fascism for the Soviets to continue receiving those countries' support.|$|E
25|$|A {{wild and}} dreary country; {{there is a}} great deal of poor land in it, covered with broom, and several wastes or little commons, with cottages {{interspersed}} among them. The soil of it is in general a stiff clay, and in some parts mixed with gravel, the water throughout it is very brackish. The southern part of it is mostly coppice woods, a considerable quantity of which belong to the archbishop. and are in his own occupation. There are thirty-seven teams kept in this parish. There are about seventeen acres of hops in it, and <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> double that number, and these are continually displanting. It also produces much canary-seed, of which it has sometimes had one hundred acres... Northward from (Herne) is Underwood farm, and opposite to it the parsonagehouse, formerly the residence of the Milles's. These are within the hamlet of Eddinton, in which, further on upon the road, is a new-built house, belonging to Mr. Edward Reynolds.|$|E

At that time the Atlantic continental margin was lifted up and formed a barrier between the basin and the sea.

[...] It's not a classic, but it remains an above average program." [...] The San Jose Mercury Newss Daniel Brown said NFL gambling [...] "seems to be a crew-wide addiction, which is why 'Lisa the Greek' is filled with sophisticated gags about point spreads and bookies."

James claimed Collier's incompetence had allowed the Constitution to escape from Boston, while his failure to bring her to action when his squadron later sighted her was attributed to what amounted to cowardice on his part. [...] James summed up the episode with Most sincerely do we regret...that this last and most triumphant escape of the Constitution, the first frigate of the United States that had humbled the proud flag of Britain, had, <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> been brought under the scrutiny of a court-martial.

Once there, Maria realises upon sight of Kelsey that Davey had discovered Sarah and tries to run into Sarah Jane's house. Eventually realising their intent, Sarah Jane brings them inside, with Davey, now as a Bane, giving chase. Sarah Jane is able to repel Davey and then, upon discovery of the attic by Kelsey, tells the teenagers about aliens: years ago, she met the Doctor, a man like no other, who took her through time and space.

During the late 1980s Starr helped Carey secure a record contract while she worked as Starr's backup singer. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote {{that the purpose of}} the song was solely paying tribute to her. According to Carey, the song [...] "reminds me of the fact that <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> I was a teenage girl with nothing to my name but a demo tape, my voice, and my ability to write songs.

500|$|Although Jackson {{has reached}} superstar {{status in the}} United States, she has yet {{to achieve the same}} level of {{response}} internationally. According to Nacy Berry, vice chairman of Virgin Records, Janet marked the first time the label [...] "had centrally coordinated and strategized a campaign on a worldwide basis" [...] which ultimately brought her to a plateau of global recognition. Her historic multimillion-dollar contract made her the highest-paid artist in history, until brother Michael renegotiated his contract with Sony Music Entertainment only days later. Sonia Murry noted that she remained [...] "the highest-paid female in pop... a whirlwind of fashion, personality and slick musical packaging rivaled only by Madonna and Whitney Houston in today's pop pantheon." [...] James Robert Parish, author of Today's Black Hollywood (1995) wrote: [...] "She confirmed her status as today's Queen of Pop when, <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> she signed a $35-$40 million recording contract with Virgin Records." [...] Music critic Nelson George noted that while surpassing Michael would be next to impossible, Janet had assuredly reached iconic status. He explained: [...] "What worked for Michael 10 years ago is working for her now... Michael was clearly the voice of the '80s, those that grew up with him since Motown. And with the themes (independence, social consciousness and up-front yet responsible sexuality) that she's addressing in her albums and the popularity she's enjoying, she could very well be the voice of the '90s." ...|$|E

500|$|Folk {{tradition}} {{has it that}} Bajo first left Piva for Drobnjaci, and eventually Drobnjaci for Morača. Bajo was originally engaged to Milica, daughter of a local knez Bogdan Papović from Kazanci. Bogdan was, however, pressured by the recently appointed Pasha of Gacko to hand his daughter to him. Pasha, originally Tepavčević, was taken through devshirme, islamized, educated and served in Constantinople and Travnik. They arranged for a meeting on which Milica was supposed to break the engagement, and choose Pasha instead of Bajo. Bajo, who prepared himself for a wedding, came to the meeting, and after questioning the girl about her choice, asked for his ring back. Milica handed it to him, at which moment Bajo killed her as well as Pasha {{and two of his}} bodyguards. Knez Bogdan took shelter in his house, which Bajo burned, together with a mosque Pasha erected <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> killing with his kinsmen and grooms all the Ottomans who served the Pasha in the process. This action caused him to abandon his tribe, losing all his wealth, and relocate to Drobnjaci, where he planned to lay low for a certain amount of time. There, he presented himself as Spasoje Sokolović, and found a job as an employee of Knez Tomić. [...] Since it was the mowing part of the year, Hasan-Aga Kopčić ordered all of the local knez's to send him their workforces to Bukovica. Bajo was among these people, and he broke his mowing blade [...] one day while working. Taking a break to fix it, he enraged the Agha, who started hiting him with a whip. Bajo then decapitated him with his fixed blade, took his horse and weapons and ran to Morača, which at the time was hajduk's nest and the most defiant of all the Montenegrin Highland tribes towards Ottomans. Bajo lived in Morača for several years, his exploits from this period (like the killing of Hafiz-bey, saving his sister Jela from Muslim maruders and protecting his cousin Sekula from wealthy and vain Pejović family) are preserved in collective memory of the population of North Montenegro. Morača was razed by the Ottomans sometime in the late 1640's, after which Bajo took shelter in Venetian controlled territories.|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{the life}} of the WR, members were met with some degree of resentment and crude language.

For her stewardship of the WR, the Marine Corps presented Ruth Cheney Streeter with the Legion of Merit.
