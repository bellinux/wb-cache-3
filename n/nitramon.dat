50|$|Nitramex and <b>Nitramon</b> Explosives are {{compositions}} {{of various}} chemical compounds. They are explosives based on ammonium nitrate, with other ingredients such as paraffin wax, aluminum and dinitrotoluene. The inclusion of these additional ingredients creates {{a more stable}} explosive. Nitramex and <b>Nitramon</b> have in modern times been replaced by more advanced high explosives based on ammonium nitrate, such as ANFO.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>nitramon</b> formula {{contains}} approximately 92 percent ammonium nitrate, 4 percent dinitrotoluene and 4 percent paraffin wax.|$|E
50|$|Nitramex {{has much}} the same formula as <b>nitramon</b> but with the {{addition}} of trinitrotoluene (TNT). This explosive was used in the removal of Ripple Rock. Large quantities of Nitramex 2H (over a thousand tonnes) were packed into tunnels. The explosion, in 1958, was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history.|$|E
