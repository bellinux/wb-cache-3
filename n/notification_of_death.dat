This study explored {{the perspectives of}} relatives regarding the request for consent for donation in cases without donor registration. METHODS: A content analysis of narratives of 24 bereaved relatives (14 in-depth interviews and one letter) of unregistered, eligible, brain-dead donors was performed. RESULTS: Relatives of unregistered, brain-dead patients usually refuse consent for donation, even if they harbour pro-donation attitudes themselves, or knew that the deceased favoured organ donation. Half of those who refused consent for donation mentioned afterwards {{that it could have}} been an option.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine clerkship students' {{perspective}} towards delivering death notifications. An additional purpose of the study was to identify the learning needs of students following a role play exercise in delivering death notifications. Methods: Participants in this study were fourth-year medical students (N= 86) ranging in age from 22 - 43 years with a mean age of 27. 1 years. There were 28 women and 58 men. Questionnaires, consisting of open-ended questions and a visual analogue scale (VAS), were administered before and after the "Marathon Death" role play exercise. Results: Six categories emerged from the analysis of the questionnaire: communication, emotions, self-development, exercise-related, learning opportunities and tools and strategies. Results from the visual analogue scale showed that the majority of students (60 needed to practice how to deliver difficult messages in death notifications. After taking part in the role-playing activity with video playback, where the students had an opportunity to view, discuss and reenact scenarios, seventy-six out of 78 (97. 4 stated that they had received training in communication skills.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether emergency department staff met {{the needs of}} the next of kin and close friends ("survivors") of patients dying in an emergency department and to assess the effectiveness of a program to improve care of survivors. DESIGN: Mail survey before and after program implementation. SETTING: Emergency department of a tertiary care, adult teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of survivors, identified through a review of emergency department records of deaths during two 6 -month periods. In the first group, surveyed in 1987, before program implementation, 26 (53 %) of 49 responded; in the second group, surveyed in 1990, after program implementation, 40 (70 %) of 57 responded. INTERVENTIONS: A structured, multidisciplinary protocol for notifying next of kin of death and supporting the survivors was implemented. An educational program was provided to all emergency department staff. An information pamphlet was created and provided to survivors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaire responses regarding the adequacy and timeliness of information provided, the support and actions by emergency department staff and the survivors' desire to be present during resuscitation efforts. RESULTS: Comparison of responses before and after program implementation showed that adequate information was provided before <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in 32 % and 83 % of cases respectively (p < 0. 001), lengthy delays in receiving medical information occurred in 60 % and 15 % of cases (p < 0. 01), adequate medical information concerning the events of death was provided in 53 % and 88 % (p < 0. 05), the presence of emergency department staff was sufficient in 40 % and 79 % (p < 0. 01), survivors spent less than 2 hours in the emergency department in 50 % and 81 % (p < 0. 05), and survivors expressed a desire to be present during resuscitation efforts in 95 % and 11 % of cases (p < 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Therapies that deplete {{lymphocytes}} often {{improve symptoms}} {{in patients with}} otherwise refractory autoimmune disease but may result in long-term lymphopenia, the consequences of which are uncertain. To {{assess the impact of}} prolonged lymphopenia on morbidity and mortality, we studied patients who had previously received lymphocytotoxic monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Fifty-three patients who received the lymphocytotoxic mAb CAMPATH- 1 H between 1991 and 1994 in the United Kingdom were assessed for mortality and infectious and malignant morbidity, by interview and case-note review. In addition, patients were monitored via the National Health Service Central Registry, to verify <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. A retrospective, matched-cohort study of mortality was also performed with 102 control subjects selected from the European League Against Rheumatism database, which comprises patients with rheumatic disorders who have received immunosuppressive drugs. RESULTS: There was profound and persistent peripheral blood lymphopenia in the mAb-treated patients, affecting predominantly the CD 4 + subset. Median CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 19 + peripheral blood lymphocyte counts at 73 - 84 months after therapy were 185 cells/microl, 95 cells/microl, and 115 cells/microl, respectively. At a median followup of 71 months (range 14 - 90), 13 patients had died (24. 5 %), compared with 18 % of the matched controls, providing a mortality rate ratio of 1. 45 (95 % confidence interval 0. 65 - 3. 13). During 283 patient-years of followup, there were 36 infections classified as major (12. 7 per 100 patient-years). The causes of death and the spectrum of infections documented were similar to those expected in a hospital-based RA cohort. Patients who received more than 1 course of therapy had more severe lymphopenia than did patients who received a single course, but this did not have an impact on mortality or morbidity. CONCLUSION: Despite the occurrence of profound and long-lasting lymphopenia following treatment with antilymphocyte mAb therapy for RA, this therapy is not associated with a large excess of mortality nor with an unusual spectrum of infections, at least during a medium-term period of followup. These data are also relevant to patients receiving lymphocytotoxic mAb therapy for other indications, and to patients receiving other lymphodepleting therapies such as autologous stem cell transplantation...|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the completeness <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> by the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR) for England and Wales. DESIGN: Deaths for a birth cohort were ascertained through scanning the relevant volumes of NHSCR. Attempts {{were made to}} confirm these deaths and additional deaths were ascertained through searching local records. Logistic regression was used to investigate how the probability <b>of</b> a <b>death</b> being missed by NHSCR varied with the year of birth, age at death, sex, and social class. SETTING: Deaths {{up to the end}} of 1989 in the CA postal area among 264, 046 children born between 1950 and 1989 to mothers living in Cumbria. RESULTS: NHSCR originally ascertained 4139 deaths; local searches confirmed 3338 (81 %) of these and found an additional 342. Most deaths missed by the NHSCR were neonatal deaths in the 1950 s and 1960 s. In the 1950 s, 31 % of children who died in the neonatal period either were not entered on NHSCR or, if they were entered, there was no record <b>of</b> their <b>death.</b> For children born from 1970 onwards, ascertainment <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> through NHSCR was over 99 % complete. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSCR was started in 1948 for the administration of records of National Health Service patients. It seems that many babies who died soon after birth were not therefore recorded.

This study assesses the concordance between treating surgeons and peer reviewers in reporting clinical events and delays in management. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> in 2009 and 2010. Cases {{that went through}} the process of submission of details by the surgeon in a structured surgical case form (SCF), first-line assessment (FLA) and a more detailed second-line assessment (SLA) were included. Significant clinical events reported for these patients were categorized and analysed for concordance. RESULTS: Of the 11, 303 <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> to the ANZASM, 6507 (57. 6 %) were audited and 685 (10. 5 %) required the entire review process. Nationally, the most significant events were post-operative complications, poor preoperative assessment and delay to surgery or diagnosis. The SCF submissions reported 338 events, as compared with 1009 and 985 events reported through FLA and SLA, respectively (P[*]=[*] 0. 01). Treating surgeons and assessors attributed 29 - 30 % of events to factors outside the surgeon's control. Surgeons felt that delay to surgery or diagnosis was a significant event in 6. 6 % of cases, in contrast to 20 % by assessors (P = 0. 01). Preoperative management could be improved in 19 % of cases according to surgeons, compared with 45 and 36 % according to the assessors (P[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|O objetivo foi comparar as mortes maternas existentes no Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade (SIM/MS) com as do "Estudo da mortalidade de mulheres em idade fértil" e estimar novos fatores de correção. Analisaram-se 7. 332 declarações de óbito feminino (DO) de dez a 49 anos, de residentes nas capitais brasileiras, no 1 o semestre de 2002. Realizou-se pareamento dos conjuntos de DO (as originalmente preenchidas pelos médicos e aquelas obtidas com o resgate de dados) com as DO do SIM/MS. A subenumeração das mortes por causas maternas, no SIM/MS, foi de 21, 4 por cento e, das mortes maternas, 16 por cento. Os novos fatores de ajuste para as mortes maternas nas regiões brasileiras foram: 0, 93 (Norte), 1, 17 (Nordeste), 1, 28 (Sudeste), 1, 10 (Sul) e 1, 47 (Centro-oeste); para o pa's, foi igual a 1, 19. Os Comitês de Morte Materna investigam os óbitos femininos em idade fértil, mas, ainda, restam imprecisões que podem inviabilizar condutas preventivas eficientesThe {{objectives}} were to compare maternal deaths notified at the Ministry of Health Information System on Mortality (SIM/MS) with those {{detected in the}} "Study on the mortality of fertile women in Brazil" and to estimate a new adjustment factor. A total of 7, 332 official death certificates (DC), from the 1 st semester of 2002, of women aged 10 - 49, residents in the nation's state capitals, were analyzed. Database linkage was performed to compare the underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> at SIM/MS with the study results. Data show there was inadequate <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> due to maternal causes (21. 4 %) and to maternal deaths (16 %). The new national adjustment factor for maternal deaths was 1. 19. Committees on Maternal Mortality are efficient; nevertheless, there is lack of information on official deaths, which could {{make it difficult to}} manage adequately the situatio...|$|R
50|$|Morazan was {{captured}} in Costa Rica by the conservative party and they assassinated him on September 15, 1842), which marked the official end of the UPCA. Upon <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death,</b> greater turmoil and fights among the opposing liberal and conservative parties increased. It is said that the conservative-liberal struggles that Morazan campaigned for are still in effect today. In addition, lacking a central authority proved to be unproductive and created more disputes and distrust within the different nations. In fact, foreigners who were looking to make economic and/or political negations {{were told that they}} had to go to each individual region for consultations and found it inconvenient.The desire for power and their inability to overcome bad relations among each other led to the fall of the UPCA. Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica seceded from the union in 1838. In 1839 Guatemala seceded, and in 1840 El Salvador did the same.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{describe}} the development <b>of</b> the maternal <b>death</b> surveillance system (MDSS) in Morocco {{and discuss the}} initial results. Method The nationwide MDSS was implemented in 2009 with the involvement of health professionals and local authorities. It comprises (i) <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> all <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> women of reproductive age (from 15 to 49 years); (ii) a preliminary survey to identify pregnancy-related deaths; (iii) a confidential enquiry into all pregnancy-related deaths. The information thus obtained describes socio-demographic characteristics of the women, their obstetric and medical history, the mode of delivery, its follow-up and the medical cause <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Results From 1 st of January 2009 to 31 st of December 2009, 3814 <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> women of reproductive age were recorded, and a total <b>of</b> 436 pregnancy-related <b>deaths</b> were identified, with 73. 4 % of those occurring in health facilities. Among the 313 reviewed records, 80. 8 % were direct obstetric deaths, and 13. 5 % were classified as indirect. Haemorrhage was the first direct obstetric cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (33 %). Heart disease was the main indirect obstetric cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (39 % <b>of</b> indirect causes). Conclusion The Moroccan MDSS is {{a powerful tool for}} understanding the causes and circumstances <b>of</b> maternal <b>deaths.</b> However, challenges remain regarding the full coverage of the system, the decentralisation of the data entry and analysis and the completeness of medical records...|$|R
