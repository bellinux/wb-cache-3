We are especially interested in achieving the invisibility cloaking by completely regular and isotropic mediums. It is shown that an interior transmission eigenvalue problem arises in our study, which is the one considered theoretically in CCH. Based on such an observation, we propose a cloaking scheme that takes a three-layer structure including a cloaked region, a lossy layer and a cloaking shell. The target medium in the cloaked region can be arbitrary but regular, whereas the mediums in the lossy layer and the cloaking shell are both regular and isotropic. We establish that if a certain non-transparency condition is satisfied, then there exists an infinite set of incident waves such that the cloaking device is nearly-invisible under the corresponding wave interrogation. The set of waves is generated from the Herglotz-approximation of the associated interior transmission eigenfunctions.

Their method {{is based on the}} regression interval mapping method and allows experimenters to effectively investigate the power for detecting a QTL in a population. This paper continues to work on the power analysis of separating multiple-linked QTLs. We propose simple formulae to calculate the power of separating closely linked QTLs located in marker intervals. The proposed formulae are simple functions of information numbers, variance inflation factors and genetic parameters of a statistical model in a population. Both regression and maximum likelihood interval mappings suitable for detecting QTL in the marker intervals are considered. In addition, the issue of separating linked QTLs in the progeny populations from an F 2 subject to further self and/or random mating is also touched upon. One of the primary keys to our approach is to derive the genotypic distributions of three and four loci for evaluating the correlation structures between pairwise unobservable QTLs in the model across populations. The proposed formulae allow us to predict the power of separation when several factors, such as sample sizes, sizes and directions of QTL effects, distances between QTLs, interval sizes and relative QTL positions in the intervals, are considered together at a time in different experimental populations. <b>Numerical</b> <b>justifications</b> and Monte Carlo simulations were provided for confirmation and illustration. 1...|$|R

Fossil fuels, often used for this purposes, depending on type, pollute the atmosphere more or less.

These reasons are primarily related to cost of energy generating products, unavailability of less polluting energy sources, unavailability of adequate technologies and the lack of environmental awareness.

40|$|Research {{works on}} the {{coupling}} of incompressible surface flow with subsurface porous media flow arouse increasing interest recently. The coupled problem is a typical multi-domain problem with multi-physics. In-depth understanding of this problem requires both modeling process and numerical study. In this work, some existing surface flow models and subsurface flow models are reviewed; the interaction mechanisms of surface flow with subsurface porous media flow are discussed; numerical algorithms for solving coupled surface/subsurface flow models are proposed; in particular, preconditioning techniques and two grid algorithms are mathematically and numerically investigated. In Chapter 1, we present some existing models for describing surface fluid flow motion {{as well as those}} for subsurface porous media flow motion. Moreover, we study some coupled models including both surface fluid flow and subsurface porous media flow. The interactions of fluid flow and porous media flow are reflected by transmission conditions at the interface between surface and subsurface. Other related multimodels for incompressible flows will also be introduced. In Chapter 2, we focus on preconditioning techniques for the coupled Stokes/Darcy model, a linear model for the surface/subsurface flows coupling. Several decoupled preconditioners are proposed and analyzed. Especially, the convergence rate of GMRES method with these preconditioners is shown to be independent of meshsize. For improving the robustness with respect to physical parameters, coupled preconditioners are also theoretically and numerically investigated. In Chapter 3, a two grid algorithm for decoupling the coupled Stokes/Darcy model is studied. The two grid algorithm consists of solving a coupled coarse grid problem, then solving two sub-problems in parallel. We use coarse grid solution to supplement boundary conditions at the interface for fine grid subproblems. Theoretical analysis shows that the two grid algorithm retains optimal approximation accuracy by choosing a proper scaling between coarse grid and fine grid. Both first order discretization and second order discretization are conducted to verify the theory. Moreover, we propose a multilevel algorithm based on the two grid technique. Numerical experiments show that our algorithms are very efficient and effective. In Chapter 4, we propose several two grid algorithms for solving a coupled Navier-Stokes/Darcy model. Our two grid algorithms not only decouple the coupled problem but also linearize the nonlinear terms from Navier-Stokes equations and the interface conditions. Error analysis are given to show that our algorithms possess good approximation properties. <b>Numerical</b> <b>justifications</b> are also presented to show that our algorithms can greatly reduce the computational cost and can accurately approximate the solution of the coupled problem. In Chapter 5, we study a linearized Navier-Stokes/Darcy coupling model. This model is extracted from coarse grid approximation and Picard iteration for solving the coupled nonlinear Navier-Stokes/Darcy problem. We adopt Green function based preconditioner for Oseen equations, combined with the preconditioning techniques for the coupled Stokes/Darcy model, to speed up the convergence rate of GMRES method. Comparisons with other preconditioners are numerically studied. In the appendix, we review GMRES algorithm. Particularly, based on geometric properties of Krylov subspace methods, the convergence rate analysis of GMRES method is presented.
