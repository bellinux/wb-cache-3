50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a <b>nominal</b> <b>cross-section</b> of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm. This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual rolling radius of the tyre and rim together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.|$|E
40|$|Materials, {{including}} bone, {{often fail}} due to loading {{in the presence}} of critical flaws. The relative amount, location, and interaction of these flaws within a stressed volume of material play a role in determining the failure properties of the structure. As materials are generally imperfect, larger volumes of material have higher probabilities of containing a flaw of critical size than do smaller volumes. Thus, larger volumes tend to fail at fewer cycles compared with smaller volumes when fatigue loaded to similar stress levels. A material is said to exhibit a volume effect if its failure properties are dependent on the specimen volume. Volume effects are well documented in brittle ceramics and composites and have been proposed for bone. We hypothesized that (1) smaller volumes of cortical bone have longer fatigue lives than similarly loaded larger volumes and (2) that compared with microstructural features, specimen volume was able to explain comparable amounts of variability in fatigue life. In this investigation, waisted rectangular specimens (n= 18) with <b>nominal</b> <b>cross-sections</b> of 3 × 4 mm and gage lengths of 10. 5, 21, or 42 mm, were isolated from the mid-diaphysis of the dorsal region of equine third metacarpal bones. These specimens were subjected to uniaxial load controlled fatigue tests, with an initial strain range of 4000 microstrain. The group having the smallest volume exhibited a trend of greater log fatigue life than the larger volume groups. Each volume group exhibited a significant positive correlation between the logarithm of fatigue life and the cumulative failure probability, indicating that the data follow the two-parameter Weibull distribution. Additionally, log fatigue life was negatively correlated with log volume, supporting the hypothesis that smaller stressed volumes of cortical bone possess longer fatigue lives than similarly tested larger stressed volumes...|$|R
50|$|Out of all industries, {{construction}} has adopted metric units the least. Dimensional lumber comes in standard <b>nominal</b> inch <b>cross-section</b> sizes and lengths {{are given in}} feet. Although model building codes — such as the International Building Code — provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and zoning codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of Canada's proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to Japan, an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses Japanese units predating metrication. However, blueprints commonly signify measurements using decimals (e.g. 9.2 ft.); since feet are not divided into tenths on United States measuring tapes, builders commonly are forced to make conversions on-site that are often imprecise. In the previous example, 9.2 ft equals 9 ft 2.4 inches; slightly more than the 9 ft 2-3/8 mark on United States tape measures, though this degree of error is usually insignificant for these applications.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{designing}} the profiles of construction elements {{are defined as}} a perfect shape of line, circle or cylinder etc. Due to the production process the elements macrogeometry can be distorted in many ways. The direct measure of deviation of the real shape of a part from its nominal shape (the designed one) is a form deviation. If any additional restrictions concerning form deviations are not given in a production drawing, then the influence of these form deviations {{should be taken into}} account in allowable area of dimensions variation which is defined with tolerance zone. High values of rectilinearity deviations of a generating line, roundness deviations and cylindricity deviations can be a reason of changes of the assumed functional requirements. On the basis of saddleback shafts with oval cross-sections manufactured in three accuracy classes, i. e. IT 4, IT 6 and IT 9, the authors have presented the variation of static parameters of cooperation. The shafts were coupled with sleeves (with a <b>nominal</b> circular <b>cross-section)</b> on experimental test stand. The obtained values of friction forces and moments of friction which are necessary to disassemble the connection were compared with the results of FEM numerical analyses. The applied method also allowed to determine the values of contact pressures in a connection...|$|R
40|$|The MBE double-growth {{technique}} {{that we call}} cleaved-edge overgrowth has, {{over the past several}} years, proved itself to be especially suitable for making quantum wires of the very highest quality. We will review our recent progress in measuring the transport and quantum optics characteristics of these wires, and the MBE growth issues that arise with cleaved-edge overgrowth fabrication. Our transport experiments have resulted in 250 Å wide quantum wires with ballistic mean free paths exceeding 10 μm. We verify the prediction that in the ballistic regime the electron conductivity in a quantum wire is independent of the wire length and shows quantized steps proportional to e 2 /h. The deviation of our observed step heights from exactly e 2 /h is taken as evidence for correlated electron behaviour. The electrons are tightly confined on three sides by atomically smooth GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunctions and in the fourth direction by an electric field. This results in a quantum wire of <b>nominal</b> square <b>cross-section</b> 250 × 250 Å. Magneto-transport measurements reveal quantum wire sub-band separations in excess of 20 meV as well as the symmetries of the wave functions of the one-dimensional modes. For optics studies our quantum wires are made using cleaved-edge overgrowth to form a line junction as two quantum wells are made to intersect with the cross-section forming a letter ‘T’. This line intersection separately forms a quantum wire bound-state for holes, for electrons, and even for excitons. We have characterized our optical wires by PL, by PLE, and by scanning near-field optics. An important application of this work is our demonstration of the first quantum laser using this T-geometry...|$|R
