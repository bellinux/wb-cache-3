5|$|The {{theme of}} the {{sculpture}} reflects the subject of <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament.</b>|$|E
5|$|This was a {{reference}} to the demonstrations of the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament</b> (the Aldermaston Marches) which took the form of marches from Aldermaston to London (apart from in 1958, when the march went from London to Aldermaston). This was an annual march from 1958 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis (Octoberâ€“November 1962) {{brought the}} world closer to nuclear war than ever before. The {{aftermath}} of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament</b> and improving relations, although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, had come into force in 1961.|$|E
50|$|The {{establishment}} {{is the final}} destination for the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament's</b> annual march from Trafalgar Square, London. The first Aldermaston March was conceived by the Direct Action Committee and took place in 1958.|$|R
50|$|He is a left-winger {{within the}} Labour Party, {{and was a}} member of the Socialist Campaign Group and {{formerly}} a member of Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament's</b> national council. He is a director of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East.|$|R
5000|$|They {{published}} this {{information in a}} pamphlet, Danger! Official Secret RSG-6. Four thousand copies {{were sent to the}} national press, politicians and peace movement activists and copies were distributed on the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament's</b> Easter march from Aldermaston.|$|R
5|$|India's Foreign Policy {{has also}} {{to some degree}} been {{influenced}} by the DPSPs. India, in the past has condemned all acts of aggression and has also supported the United Nations' peace-keeping activities. By 2004, the Indian Army had participated in 37 UN peace-keeping operations. India {{played a key role in}} the passing of a UN resolution in 2003, which envisaged better co-operation between the Security Council and the troop-contributing countries. India has also been in favour of <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw {{the festival}} become an annual fixture, barring {{periodic}} fallow years. In 1981, Michael Eavis {{took control of}} the festival, and it was organised in conjunction with the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament</b> (CND). That year a new Pyramid Stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting (repurposed from materials of the Ministry of Defence), a permanent structure which doubled as a hay-barn and cow-shed during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{attended}} Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge {{and then}} the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while his future musical partner, David Gilmour, lived nearby on the city's Mill Road, and attended the Perse School. At 15, Waters {{was chairman of the}} Cambridge Youth Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament</b> (YCND), having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation.|$|E
50|$|Sir Gerard Foliott Vaughan (11 June 1923 - 29 July 2003) was a British {{psychiatrist}} and politician, who reached ministerial rank during the Thatcher administration. He was perhaps most famous for losing {{a battle of}} wills with the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament's</b> Joan Ruddock over the government's grant to the Citizens Advice Bureau, a battle that cost him his government post and permanently curtailed his political ambitions.|$|R
50|$|The issues {{addressed}} by USPID include <b>nuclear</b> arms-control and <b>disarmament,</b> <b>nuclear</b> proliferation, consequences of nuclear explosions, control of fissile material, developments of military technology, conventional disarmament, {{chemical and biological}} disarmament, problems of conflicts and conflict resolution.|$|R
5000|$|The 2000 Review Conference. States parties {{successfully}} concluded {{their agreement}} on a Final Document that assessed past performance of the treaty and {{on a number of}} key issues relating to <b>nuclear</b> non-proliferation and <b>disarmament,</b> <b>nuclear</b> safety and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.|$|R
5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. The court should abstain from interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament,</b> the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to {{the use of military force}} and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E
5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament</b> and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E
5|$|He {{wrote one}} of the first {{scientific}} treatises in the field of American sociology, and he published three autobiographies, each of which contains insightful essays on sociology, politics and history. In his role as editor of the NAACP's journal The Crisis, he published many influential pieces. DuBois believed that capitalism was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. He was an ardent peace activist and advocated <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament.</b> The United States' Civil Rights Act, embodying many of the reforms for which DuBois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted a year after his death.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Ukraine {{began its}} <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>disarmament</b> {{program in the}} early 90s. By 1 June 1996, there was no nuclear weapon in Ukraine.|$|R

500|$|The Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament's</b> first Aldermaston March, protesting {{against the}} Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), {{began in the}} square in 1958. One of the first {{significant}} demonstrations of the modern era {{was held in the}} square on [...] 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. In March 1968, a crowd of 10,000 demonstrated against US involvement in the Vietnam War before marching to the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square.|$|R
5|$|Rambhadracharya {{was one of}} {{the spiritual}} and {{religious}} Gurus from India at the Millennium World Peace Summit, organised by the United Nations in New York City from 28 to 31 August 2000. While addressing the gathering, he gave Sanskrit definitions for the words Bharata (the ancient name of India) and Hindu, and touched upon the Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God. In his speech on Peace, he called for developed and developing nations to come together to strive for the eradication of poverty, the fight against terrorism, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament.</b> At the end of his speech, he recited the Shanti Mantra.|$|E
5|$|Subject matter. First, the {{justiciability}} of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of decision-making power. This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament.</b> Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Driberg {{convened a}} group of Christian socialists that met {{regularly}} at the Lamb public house in Bloomsbury to discuss issues such as imperialism, colonialism, immigration and <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament.</b> The group's dispatches, Papers from the Lamb, led to the foundation in 1960 of the Christian Socialist Movement. Although no longer an MP, Driberg remained {{a member of the}} Labour Party's NEC and was active in party affairs. In 1957, in the face of antagonism from trade union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became Labour Party chairman, a largely ceremonial role. He travelled widely during his year in office, generally as a Reynolds News correspondent but using the party title to advantage whenever he could. Thus, in a 1958 visit to Moscow to interview space scientists, he obtained two meetings with Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E

5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament.</b> This policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983â€“84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war. This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Doctor's {{first story}} was {{originally}} intended to be the four-part Project Zeta Sigma, written by John Flanagan & Andrew McCulloch. It {{was not intended to}} follow on directly from the events of Logopolis; instead, the Doctor and his companions would have already left Earth. The story was to concern <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament.</b> Commissioned as Project '4G on 7 October 1980, the script proved unworkable, and producer John Nathan-Turner dropped the story on 19 February 1981. He then commissioned recently departed script editor Christopher H. Bidmead to write a replacement which became Castrovalva. This last minute change disrupted the shooting schedule, meaning that Castrovalva would be the fourth serial of the series filmed, though {{it would be the first}} transmitted.|$|E
5|$|Crass {{have said}} that their musical {{influences}} were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European atonality and avant-garde composers such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament</b> during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E

5|$|In 1832, the Metropolitan Police Service {{built a new}} station {{house on}} the site of No.33â€“34. This did not include the Bow Street Runners, who {{retained}} their own identity until the organisation disbanded in 1839. A new magistrates' court was designed by John Taylor at a cost of Â£38,400 (now Â£) and constructed between 1879â€“81. Oscar Wilde {{was arrested and charged with}} gross indecency at the court in 1895; following an overnight stay on remand, he ordered tea, toast and eggs from the nearby Tavistock Hotel, who delivered them to his cell. In 1961, Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, was brought to the court after demonstrating as part of the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament.</b> He later spent a week at Brixton Prison. The courts closed in July 2006 as its Grade II listing meant it was not economical to update it to modern standards. The building is planned to be converted into a boutique hotel.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy and {{his wife}} Joan {{separated}} in 1977, although they still staged joint appearances at some public events. He held Health and Scientific Research Subcommittee hearings in March 1977 that led to public revelations of extensive scientific misconduct by contract research organizations, including Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories. Kennedy visited China on a goodwill mission in late December 1977, meeting with leader Deng Xiaoping and eventually gaining permission {{for a number of}} Mainland Chinese nationals to leave the country; in 1978, he also visited the Soviet Union and Brezhnev and dissidents there again. During the 1970s, Kennedy also showed interest in <b>nuclear</b> <b>disarmament,</b> and as part of his efforts in this field even visited Hiroshima in January 1978 and gave a public speech to that effect at Hiroshima University. He became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1978, by which time he had amassed a wide-ranging Senate staff of a hundred.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament,</b> chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E
50|$|Campbell was {{fourteen}} when, in 1961, she {{took part in}} the Campaign for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Disarmament's</b> march from Aldermaston to London in protest against nuclear weapons, and was still a teenager when she joined the Communist Party. At that time the party was deeply divided over its relationship with the Soviet Union. She belonged to the party's anti-Stalinist wing that opposed the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. In London, she and Bobby Campbell joined a dissident group within the Communist Party founded by university lecturer Bill Warren that produced a critique of both Stalinism and the party's economic policy.|$|R
