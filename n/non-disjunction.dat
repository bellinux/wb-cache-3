The direct preparation showed 46,XY,dup(10) (q 11. 2 q 23. 2). CVS long-term culture and fetal tissue revealed a rare additional abnormality: 48,XXXY,dup(10) (q 11. 2 q 23. 2). This abnormality represented the major cell line (> 85 per cent in 691 cells) in an (XY) /XXY/XXXY/(XXXXY) mosaic (all cell lines presumably bearing the dup(10 q); the presence of XY and XXXXY cell lines is uncertain).

The distribution analysis gave no clear cut evidence for the induction of gonosomal trisomy XXY by chromosome association. No significant association was observed between X and X or X and Y but there was a smaller distance between X and Y in XXY karyotypes than in XY karyotypes. As far as autosomes are concerned, the XXY karyotypes were characterised by a less central location of the acrocentrics without a clear decrease of association frequencies of these acrocentrics, and the C heterochromatin rich chromosomes were more often associated than in the XX and XY control populations. These data do not support the idea that gonosomal trisomies result from chromosome associations, but favour the hypothesis that spindle degeneration as a result of intrafollicular ageing of C heterochromatin polymorphism may be responsible for <b>non-disjunctions...</b>|$|R

Here, we analyzed individuals from four Amazonian populations of Bunocephalus coracoideus by cytogenetic and molecular procedures. The geographic distribution, genetic distances and karyotype data indicate that each population represents an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). Cytogenetic markers showed distinct 2 n and karyotype formulas, as well as different numbers and locations of the rDNA sites among ESUs. One of such populations (ESU-D) highlighted an extensive polymorphic condition, with several cytotypes probably due to chromosomal rearrangements and meiotic <b>non-disjunctions.</b> This resulted in several aneuploid karyotypes, which was also supported by the mapping of telomeric sequences. Phylograms based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) analyses grouped each ESU on particular highly supported clades, with the estimation of evolutionary divergence indicating values being higher than 3. 8 – 12. 3 % among them.

Unfortunately, Egozcue {{and co-workers}} misunderstood the conclusions that were drawn. It is true that a previous study by Mroz and co-workers suggested that mouse XXY-spermatogonia may not undergo meiosis (Mroz et al., 1998). However, we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} a few 47 -XXY spermatogonia in men with non-mosaic Klinefelter’s syndrome undergo meiotic divisions for the following reasons: First, conclusions from studies in rodents cannot be unequivocally transferred to the human. It is not uncommon for the biological rules characterizing/ defining a given pathophysiology in rodents and the human to be opposite. For example, the reproducing element of the centrosome is maternally inherited in the mouse and paternally inherited in the human (Schatten et al., 1994; Sofikitis et al., 1996). Another example is that varicocele in the human means retrograde blood flow, whereas in rats with varicoceles there is no retrograde blood flow through the left testicular vein (Sofikitis and Miyagawa, 1993; Sofikitis et al., 1996). Thus we consider that the unequivocal transfer of the conclusions of Mroz and co-workers to the human may not be appropriate.

We have screened 717 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants by individually observing their cytological phenotypes at the restrictive temperature, and have newly isolated 25 cut mutants. Genetic analyses indicate that 14 of them fall into five previously identified loci, namely, top 2, cut 1, cut 5, cut 7 and cut 9, whereas nine have been mapped onto seven new loci, designated cut 13 to cut 19. The cytological phenotypes of the newly identified cut mutants can be classified into three groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Pentasomy X (49,XXXXX) {{has been}} {{associated}} with a severe clinical condition, presumably resulting from failure or disruption of X chromosome inactivation. Here we report that some human X chromosomes from a patient with 49,XXXXX pentasomy were functionally active following isolation in inter-specific (human-rodent) cell hybrids. A comparison with cytogenetic and molecular findings provided evidence that more than one active X chromosome was likely to be present in the cells of this patient, accounting for her abnormal phenotype. Results 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) -pulsed cultures showed different patterns among late replicating X chromosomes suggesting that their replication was asynchronic and likely to result in irregular inactivation. Genotyping of the proband and her mother identified four maternal and one paternal X chromosomes in the proband. It also identified the paternal X chromosome haplotype (P), indicating that origin of this X pentasomy resulted from two maternal, meiotic <b>non-disjunctions.</b> Analysis of the HUMANDREC region of the androgen receptor (AR) gene in the patient's mother showed a skewed inactivation pattern, while a similar analysis in the proband showed an active paternal X chromosome and preferentially inactivated X chromosomes carrying the 173 AR allele. Analyses of 33 cell hybrid cell lines selected in medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT) allowed for the identification of three maternal X haplotypes (M 1, M 2 and MR) and showed that X chromosomes with the M 1, M 2 and P haplotypes were functionally active. In 27 cell hybrids in which more than one X haplotype were detected, analysis of X inactivation patterns provided evidence of preferential inactivation. Conclusion Our findings indicated that 12 % of X chromosomes with the M 1 haplotype, 43. 5 % of X chromosomes with the M 2 haplotype, and 100 % of the paternal X chromosome (with the P haplotype) were likely to be functionally active in the proband's cells, a finding indicating that disruption of X inactivation was associated to her severe phenotype. </p...|$|R

The second frequent genetic abnormality (~ 25-30% of cases) is maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. The mechanism is due to maternal meiotic <b>non-disjunction</b> followed by mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 15 after fertilization. The third cause for PWS is the disruption of the imprinting process on the paternally inherited chromosome 15 (epigenetic phenomena).

Less than 20% of individuals with an imprinting defect are found to have a very small deletion in the PWS imprinting centre region, located at the 5′ end of the SNRPN gene.|$|E

40|$|Two major {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} chromosome segregation errors are <b>non-disjunction</b> and chromosome loss, both leading to aneuploidy. Previous studies in our laboratory showed {{the existence of}} thresholds for the induction of chromosome <b>non-disjunction</b> and chromosome loss and the induction of apoptosis by microtubule inhibitors. From a mechanistic point of view one can expect that apoptosis contributes to the elimination of cells with premutagenic/mutagenic lesions. If aneuploid cells were eliminated by the induction of apoptosis below the threshold concentrations for chromosome loss and <b>non-disjunction,</b> the defined thresholds would not be applicable to cells unable to undergo apoptosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether apoptosis was induced directly or indirectly as a response to aberrant chromosome segregation below the thresholds for the induction of chromosome loss and <b>non-disjunction,</b> as previously defined by us. Therefore, human lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to five concentrations of nocodazole and five concentrations of carbendazim representing the threshold concentrations for chromosome <b>non-disjunction</b> and chromosome loss, two concentrations below the lowest threshold and one concentration between the two threshold values. After 48 h exposure to the aneugens, induction of apoptosis was analysed by the annexin-V test. The frequencies of chromosome <b>non-disjunction</b> and chromosome loss were estimated in cytokinesis-blocked human lymphocytes in combination with FISH; this methodology was applied to whole cell cultures as well as to apoptotic and viable cell fractions obtained using magnetic annexin microbead cell sorting. Our results suggest that elimination of aneuploid cells does occur. However, the efficiency of disappearance of micronucleated cells is higher than for cells presenting chromosome <b>non-disjunction.</b> The correlation found between early apoptotic events and micronucleus formation could account, at least in part, for the specific elimination of aneuploid cells.

We genotyped 45 47,XXX females and 95 47,XXY males of maternal origin. Our results demonstrate that 49 % arose during MI, 29 % during MII and 16 % were postzygotic events; a further 7 % were meiotic but could not be assigned as either MI or MII because of recombination at the centromere. Among the MI cases, a majority (56 %) had no detectable transitions and so absent recombination is an important factor for X chromosome <b>non-disjunction.</b> However, similar to trisomy 15 and unlike trisomy 21, we observed {{a significant increase in the}} mean maternal age of transitional MI errors compared with nullitransitional cases. In our studies of MII errors, recombination appeared normal and there was no obvious effect of maternal age, distinguishing our results from MII <b>non-disjunction</b> of chromosomes 18 or 21.

Maternal MI trisomy 18 shows a low frequency of recombination in proximal p and medial q, but not the reduction in proximal q observed in chromosome 21 MI <b>non-disjunction.</b> Maternal MII <b>non-disjunction</b> does not fit the entanglement model that predicts increased recombination, especially near the centromere.

40|$|Introduction. Aneuploidy (the {{presence}} of extra or missing chromosomes) arises primarily through chromosome segregation {{errors in the}} oocyte at meiosis I but the details of mechanism by which such errors occur in humans {{are the subject of}} some debate. It is generally believed that aneuploidy arises primarily as a result of segregation of a whole chromosome to the same pole as its homologue (<b>non-disjunction).</b> Nonetheless, classical cytogenetic studies suggest that this model does not fully account for the patterns observed in human oocytes. An alternative model (precocious separation of sister chromatids) has thus been proposed, but recurring criticism of this model purports that technical issues may have led to interpretation errors. Materials and methods. Array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) was used on 164 human first polar bodies to distinguish between whole chromosome (<b>non-disjunction)</b> and chromatid (precocious separation) errors. Results. Single chromatid errors were over 11 times more common than whole chromosome errors, consistent with prior classical cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies. Discussion. The received wisdom that <b>non-disjunction</b> is the primary mechanism leading to human aneuploidy should be reconsidered...|$|E
