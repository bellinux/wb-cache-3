500|$|Some {{scholars}} are skeptical the afterlife {{was a major}} focus of the cult. Ramsay MacMullen says that when characters in Metamorphoses call Lucius [...] "reborn", they refers to his new life as a devotee and <b>never</b> <b>call</b> him renatus in aeternam , which would refer to the afterlife. Mary Beard, John North, and Simon Price say Metamorphoses shows that [...] "the cult of Isis had implications for life and death, but even so more emphasis is placed on extending the span of life than on the after-life—which is pictured in fairly undifferentiated terms." ...|$|E

500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go back to your people and tell them to get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will <b>never</b> <b>call</b> on you to come again." [...] Stark's forces again swelled the next day with the arrival of some Stockbridge Indians, bringing his force (excluding Warner's men) to nearly 2,000 men.|$|E
500|$|Malory informs Sterling that a {{group of}} Cuban hitmen have {{established}} a warrant against him, which makes Sterling even more irate. Burt then calls Malory and asks her out to a movie premiere that night. Later that day, however, Malory gets a letter from Reynolds, saying that he is leaving her for a younger woman and moving back [...] "to Tinseltown". However, Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) quickly figures out that the letter was written by Sterling himself (citing how no star actor uses the term [...] "Tinseltown"). She quickly figures out that Sterling visited Burt, knocking him out with knock-out gas, and taking him to his apartment. Lana, along with Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell) and Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), go to try to reason with Sterling. Once there, they encounter the Cuban hit squad, who believe Gillette is the real Sterling based on the recon photo they have (taken during the events of [...] "Honeypot") and a firefight begins. Meanwhile, Sterling holds Burt hostage, promising to never let him date his mother again, but he is interrupted by the firefight between the ISIS agents and the Cubans. As they drive off, Sterling prepares to go after them, but Burt says that Sterling won't be able to catch up to them and that he can. Sterling agrees to a bet: If Burt can't catch up to them, he will leave for Hollywood and <b>never</b> <b>call</b> Malory again, and if he does, he can be allowed to continue dating Malory.|$|E

2500|$|Turkey {{is home to}} 50,000 Uyghurs. A {{community}} of Uyghurs live in Turkey. Kayseri received Uyghurs numbering close to 360 via the UNHCR in 1966–1967 from Pakistan.

2500|$|Like {{the term}} Kadazan-Dusun, Sama-Bajau is a {{collective}} term, {{used to describe}} several closely related indigenous people who consider themselves a single distinct bangsa ("ethnic group" [...] or [...] "nation"). It is generally accepted that these groups of people can be termed Sama or Bajau, though they <b>never</b> <b>call</b> themselves [...] "Bajau" [...] in the Philippines. Instead, they call themselves {{with the names of}} their tribes, usually the place they live or place of origin. For example, the sea-going Sama-Bajau prefer to call themselves the Sama Dilaut or Sama Mandilaut (literally [...] "sea Sama" [...] or [...] "ocean Sama") in the Philippines; while in Malaysia, they identify as Bajau Laut.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{characteristic of}} Ryelandt was his modesty. Although he enjoyed hearing his works performed, {{he left it}} to others—especially his teacher Tinel and Charles Lamy (pen name of Charles Martens, meaning ‘Charles, the friend ’)—to make his works known. As he put it: “If God wants my work to be known one day, that will happen. If not, what does it matter? The task of the artist is to create, and that’s it. Success is a luxury and a pleasure, it’s not indispensable.” He never bragged about the extra-musical honors that befell him. Sometimes he gently mocked them, like when, on being made Commander {{in the order of}} Leopold, he “complained” no one had told him whom to command. When he was very old, he told his daughter: “You must <b>never</b> <b>call</b> a priest or a doctor for me at night, not before 6 in the morning. Those folk need their sleep.” ...|$|E
