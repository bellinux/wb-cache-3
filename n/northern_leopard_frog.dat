5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or {{continue to live}} in water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The <b>northern</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the <b>northern</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E

The two hypotheses tested were PCH concentrations in <b>northern</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> would be positively correlated with sediment polychlorinated hydrocarbon (PCH) levels in wetland habitats along a contamination gradient and hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity of <b>northern</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs,</b> which is presumably mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), would be positively correlated with PCH concentrations in frog carcasses (whole body minus liver) from different collection sites. In 1994 to 1995, frogs from seven sites along the lower Fox River and Green Bay, USA, were assayed for hepatic EROD activities and whole carcass concentrations of PCBs, PCDDs, and PCDFs.

5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and <b>northern</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>frog.</b> A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E

Birds {{including}} the turkey vulture, bald eagle, hawk, and meadowlark fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain.

40|$|Metacercariae {{survival}} {{patterns and}} their distribution in second intermediate odonate hosts were examined for four species of frog lung flukes. Surveys of aquatic larvae and recently emerged teneral dragonflies and damselflies indicated that prevalence and mean abundance of Haematoloechus spp. metacercariae {{were significantly lower}} in teneral dragonflies than larval dragonflies, while {{there was no significant}} difference in prevalence or mean abundance of Haematoloechus spp. metacercariae among larval and teneral damselflies. Experimental infections of dragonflies indicated that metacercariae of Haematoloechus coloradensis and Haematoloechus complexus were located in the head, thorax, and branchial basket of dragonflies, whereas metacercariae of Haematoloechus longiplexus and Haematoloechus parviplexus were restricted to the branchial basket of these hosts. Metacercariae of H. coloradensis, H. complexus, and H. longiplexus infected the head, thorax, and abdomen of damselflies, but these insects were resistant to infection with H. parviplexus. Subsequent metamorphosis experiments on experimentally infected dragonflies indicated that most metacercariae of H. longiplexus were lost from the branchial basket during metamorphosis, but most metacercariae of H. coloradensis, H. complexus, and H. parviplexus survived dragonfly metamorphosis. These observations suggest that the observed ecological host specificity of H. longiplexus in semiterrestrial <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> may be due to few metacercariae of H. longiplexus reaching these frogs in a terrestrial environment. Because of the uncertain validity of Haematoloechus varioplexus as a distinct species from its synonym H. parviplexus, their morphological characters were reevaluated. The morphological data on H. varioplexus and H. parviplexus indicate that they differ in their acetabulum length and width, ovary shape, testes length, and egg length and width. Experimental infections of plains <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs,</b> <b>northern</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs,</b> and bullfrogs with worms from bullfrogs indicate that the synonymy of H. parviplexus with H. varioplexus is not warranted, and that these flukes are distinct species, i. e., H. parviplexus in bullfrogs and H. varioplexus in plains <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> and <b>northern</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs...</b>|$|R

We found no statistical difference (t � 0. 917, df � 5, p � 0. 401) in the average 48 -h oral bioavailabilities of 0. 35 - and 5. 0 -mg/kg dosage groups, which were 84. 6 � 5. 8 % (mean � SE, n � 4) and 90. 9 � 1. 5 % (n � 3), respectively. Statistical analysis indicated that time was the only independent variable affecting the retention of whole-body 14 C content. Kinetics were apparently first order because elimination rate was independent of dose. Assuming a single pool and one elimination rate, the t 1 / 2 value for whole-body elimination of PCB-derived 14 C was 763 d. Liver, fat bodies (corpora adiposa), carcass (head, bone, cartilage materials, and residues of other tissues), skin, and muscle were the major organs for PCB 126 retention in both dosage groups. The concentrations of 14 C residue in fat bodies were relatively constant throughout the experiment. However, total residues in fat bodies declined throughout the experiment in both dosage groups in correlation with declining masses of fat bodies.
