40|$|When a {{contract}} of international {{sale of goods}} is mediated by a form of payment as the <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> exporters that initially lack financial resources to produce or obtain merchandise that then will be delivered to the importer, look as first natural possibility of financing the transfer for the <b>documentary</b> <b>credit.</b> Now not always the credit can be transferable {{in accordance with the}} Uniform Customs and Practice for <b>Documentary</b> <b>Credits</b> (UCP) – because, for example, the importer or the financial entity do not want it in that way. Given the above scenario, this article aims to provide solutions, explaining legal alternatives for the exporter that is not in the UCP-, to use the money that might correspond {{as a result of the}} <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> to finance the production or acquisition of goods against other traders, and then reselling them to the importer. It concludes that the exporter can achieve such immediate funding - similar to what encourage the transfer of <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> - using to their relations with the supplier, figures as the assignment of a future credit, banker’s acceptance and contract terms...|$|R

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this thesis is the {{exceptions}} in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> in English law. The exceptions were established during {{the development of the}} <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> system to solve drawbacks of the payment means caused by its distinctive feature of autonomy. A rationale of the research is the current decline of the market share of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> as a recognized means of settlement in international trade. This thesis aims to explore an appropriate and efficient way to apply certain necessary exceptions in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> system. And hopefully, the current high rate of the rejection of the documents by banks by relying on the strict compliance principle can be decreased by the improving of the application of exceptions in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits.</b> The research centres primary the application of the exceptions in English law. An early study of the original development of the fraud exception will cover both English and American authorities. Because there is no statute law in English law to regulate the exceptions in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits,</b> the thesis will analyse the exceptions mostly through the case law. The main exceptions analysed in the thesis are the fraud rule, the illegality exception and the nullity exception. The application pattern for the three exceptions will be worked out respectively; the specific application of the injunction rules in applying the fraud rule will be concluded during the analysis of the fraud rule; some common features in the application among the exceptions will also be summarized in the thesis. An effort is made to suggest a prospective development of exceptions, which is in consistent with the autonomy principle. And as the necessary exceptions are applied efficiently, the disputes existing in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> system currently may be settled without the appliance of any explanatory rules.

40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{and seeks}} to validate a conceptual model {{for the evaluation of}} the transnational effectiveness of terms regulating <b>documentary</b> <b>credits.</b> The standpoint of that evaluation is the commonly accepted median compromise of the contested needs of the parties who typically transact <b>documentary</b> <b>credits.</b> The model is formulated and validated by both a doctrinal study of the Uniform Customs and Practice for <b>Documentary</b> <b>Credits</b> (UCP) 600, and its previous iterations, and a functional comparative doctrinal study between English and Jordanian laws supplemented by an empirical study of Jordanian commercial practices. It is postulated that the functional elements of the substance of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> are the embedded usages of irrevocability, conformity and autonomy, and that it is only by the optimal application of these usages that the sociological value of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> can be achieved and the objective median compromise of the contested needs of the transacting parties arrived at are rationally deducted. It is contended, by adapting social systems theory, that what is termed in this thesis as embedded trade usages of transnational commercial transactions constitute socially diffuse law having a normative force to the extent of displacing even some categories of mandatory law arising under autopoietic Municipal legal orders. The socio-legal nature of the embedded usages of both conformity and autonomy is critically analysed in the conceptual model in order to evaluate the legal positions, and the legal communication, of UCP 600 terms under the English and Jordanian legal orders and Jordanian commercial practices...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} to {{what extent}} <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> and demand guarantees are, and should, be treated as autonomous or abstract from the underlying contract that leads to their issuance. This question is of vital importance to the commercial parties that utilise these instruments. The answer to it determines many of their duties, liabilities, the risks they undertake and the remedies available to them. While <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> and demand guarantees share some characteristics, both instruments serve different commercial functions. As such, the legal principles governing each instrument should be tailored to fit its functions. This point and the relevant legal and commercial issues relating to it will be examined thoroughly in Chapters 1 and 2. Chapters 3 and 4 will critically analyse the different approaches developed by the English courts when dealing with the autonomy of these instruments. It will be demonstrated that the rules they have developed {{in this area of}} law are inconsistent, in some instances contradictory, commercially unsound and do not reflect the traders' perceptions of the instruments. This unsatisfactory outcome has resulted from the English courts' (i) failure to distinguish between <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> and demand guarantees; (ii) insistence on applying to these instruments particular doctrines which developed outside their context; and (iii) failure to develop any clear framework by which they can abide when dealing with the issue of autonomy. Chapter 5 examines the autonomy principle in demand guarantees and <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> where third parties are involved. Finally, Chapter 6 examinees {{to what extent}} a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> and a demand guarantee may be affected by illegality in the underlying transaction. In addition, it will analyse whether banks issuing such instruments are entitled to exercise a right of set-off by against the beneficiary of these instruments. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the demand for}} import <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> in Lebanon. Five explanatory variables are selected that stand respectively for risk, price, size, conjecture, and availability of credit. As expected, the long run elasticities are {{significantly higher than the}} short run ones. Risk has an adverse impact. Interest rate elasticities, or price elasticities, are all negative and statistically significant except for bills for collection which are paid in cash at presentation of the shipping documents, and that do not depend on the interest rate. Size and conjectural elasticities are all positive and statistically significantly different from zero. As expected, the availability of credit is only important for opened and utilized letters of credit and not for outstanding <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> and bills for collection. In the long run risk, price, and conjectural elasticities are all statistically insignificantly different from one in absolute values, but, surprisingly, long run size elasticities are statistically significantly less than + 1. The paper concludes that the determinants of the demand for import <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> in Lebanon {{are similar to those of}} the demand for any other good or asset...|$|R

40|$|Letters of credit, {{which are}} a well-recognised payment instrument, have bridged {{international}} trade between different countries. The UCP, which is often regarded as “soft regulation” has provided a solid backing for the operation of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> and nowadays the latest revision, UCP 600 is universally incorporated into nearly all letters of credit. This thesis focuses on two vital but controversial parts in a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> operation, i. e. document examination and rejection under UCP 600. The central research question addressed by this thesis is: Has the UCP 600 provided a sufficient framework for banks to fulfil their obligations concerning document examination and rejection under <b>documentary</b> <b>credits?</b> This question {{can be divided into}} three separate issues. Firstly, what requirements should a bank fulfil during document examination and rejection as judged by the law of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> and market expectations? Secondly, what requirements have been expressly or implicitly set out in the UCP 600 regime? Finally, has the current UCP system provided a proper and sufficient framework to the addressed areas? If not, what should and can be done next? In order to answer the above questions, this thesis draws upon other ICC sources, such as the ISBP, the ICC Opinions and DOCDEX decisions, which are frequently missed in other academic works. The novelty of this thesis lies in a below-the-surface analysis of the controversial areas of UCP 600 by using the experience gained from recent case law before suggesting ways to move forward. The merits of this thesis are not limited to observing the current loopholes in the UCP system, but also in endeavouring to solve current problems by providing feasible suggestions for improvement for the next UCP revision...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the «Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits»(UCP) a collection of rules originally formulated by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 1933 and frequently revised since. The main reference text is {{the one of the}} fifth revision of UCP, being in force since 1. 1. 1994. The UCP rules are considered by the author to be a quasi legislative set of rules. Thus, they are approached by use of the typical methodology of texts with legislative character. They are examined in correlation with their frame of reference, i. e. the <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> itself. The mechanism for their drafting, amendments and adoption is thoroughly analyzed. In addition, a critical presentation of the possible methods of incorporation of the rules in individual <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> is included. The author also faces the question of the legal nature of UCP and gives an innovative, synthetic answer to it. In order to improve the understanding of the function of UCP, general principles are extracted through a thorough analysis of correlated provisions of the codification. The author has also proceeded to a comparative analysis of the existing legislative provisions on <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> in various countries (Greece, USA, Canada, Italy, and Yugoslavia) in correlation with the provisions of UCP. Finally, the thesis includes an analysis of the existing methods and trends of interpretation of UCP by the courts, the international arbitration and ICC. Concluding the summary, it must be said that the author gives an innovative, synthetic approach to the legal nature of UCP, while the rules themselves are reorganized and repositioned according to a formal legal methodology. The necessity for an internationally accepted set of rules governing the <b>documentary</b> <b>credits,</b> instead of national legislative provisions is also strongly supported. ...|$|R

40|$|For an {{international}} seller {{to be able}} to obtain clean shipping documents is a matter of considerable importance to him. Absent fraud on his part, a cif seller can demand payment of the price against tender of such documents, leaving any dispute about the goods themselves to be resolved later. If he is a beneficiary under a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> he can use clean shipping documents to obtain payment under a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> whatever disputes there may be on the underlying transaction. The position may be different where {{one or more of the}} shipping documents is so defective that it can be described as a nullity. Even if it is not a nullity, it may perhaps be rejected if it can be described as non-genuine. If so, the international seller/beneficiary may be deprived of his assurance of payment, even in the absence of any fraud or other moral culpability on his part. Though the Court of Appeal has considered the application of a nullity concept to <b>documentary</b> <b>credits,</b> it has not provided a definitive solution. The courts have been silent on whether a nullity concept should apply to international sale contracts, and on whether non-genuine documents can be rejected, under such contracts. This article examines whether the concepts of non-genuine shipping documents, and nullities, are meaningful and, if so, what is meant by a nullity and a non-genuine shipping document...|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) Applications for prohibitory {{injunctions}} or interdicts {{against payment}} under <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> are seldom awarded. However, both English and South African law provide {{alternative forms of}} relief. These alternative orders focus on how the beneficiary deals with the proceeds of the credit rather than the prevention of payment thereof. One such alternative is the Mareva injunction of English law which, through freezing the beneficiary’s assets, prevents the removal thereof from {{the area of the}} court’s jurisdiction once judgment is given. The South African equivalent of the Mareva injunction is known as the anti-dissipation interdict and has yet to be applied to the law of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> by the South African courts. However the South African attachment application has been so applied. Therefore this dissertation seeks to conduct a comparative analysis between South African and English law Marevatype injunctions on the proceeds of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits,</b> focusing especially on the judgments handed down in Intraco Ltd v Notis Shipping Corporation of Liberia and Ex Parte Sapan Trading (Pty) Ltd. Chapters Two, Three and Four will explore the nature, development, requirements and effects of the injunctions and interdicts through local and international case law as well as the prospects of a successful application under each.
