5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, <b>now</b> <b>those</b> laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|The {{single largest}} group of English castles are <b>now</b> <b>those</b> owned by English Heritage, created out of the former Ministry of Works in 1983. The National Trust {{increasingly}} acquired castle properties in England in the 1950s, and is the second largest single owner, followed by the various English local authorities and finally {{a small number of}} private owners. Royal castles such as the Tower of London and Windsor are owned by the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate on behalf of the nation. Similar organisations exist in Scotland, where the National Trust for Scotland was established 1931, and in Ireland, where An Taisce was created in 1948 to working alongside the Irish Ministry of Works to maintain castles and other sites. Some new organisations have emerged in recent years to manage castles, such as the Landmark Trust and the Irish Landmark Trust, which have restored a number of castles in Britain and Ireland over the last few decades.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversion}} of Kartli marked only {{the beginnings of}} the formation of the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the next centuries, different processes took place that shaped the Church, and gave it, {{by the beginning of the}} 11th century, the main characteristics that it has retained until <b>now.</b> <b>Those</b> processes concern the institutional status of the Church inside Eastern Christianity, its evolution into a national church with authority over all of Georgia, and the dogmatic evolution of the church..|$|E
500|$|In 1988, a [...] "veteran player category" [...] was {{established}} in order to [...] "provide a vehicle for players {{who may have been}} overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players". Eleven players were inducted into the category, but in 2000, the board of directors eliminated it, and <b>now</b> <b>those</b> inductees are considered to be in the player category.|$|E

[...] The TVTV crew interviewed different [...] "premies", or followers of Prem Rawat, throughout the film, and one teenage boy is shown stating: [...] "Before I came to the Guru I was a freak, smoking dope and dropping out – and my parents were happier then than they are with this." [...] In a later part of the film, a loudspeaker voice announces: [...] "Those premies who came in private cars can leave <b>now.</b> <b>Those</b> who came in rented buses can stay and meditate until further notice." [...] Adherents of other belief systems also appear in the documentary, including a born-again Christian who criticizes devotees for [...] "following the devil", and a Hare Krishna follower.|$|E

This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and <b>now</b> <b>those</b> children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{admitted}} {{his team}} had underachieved during the season, but took criticism of failing to challenge Manchester United {{in the league and}} progressing further in the UEFA Champions League as a [...] "compliment to the club". He spoke in favour of moving FA Cup ties midweek to prevent fixture congestion, because the current system was too demanding for the big clubs: [...] "In England a team that goes for the FA Cup automatically has a problem in the championship, especially if they play in the Champions League. There are then so many games something has to be sacrificed and I have sacrificed points in the championship to the FA Cup." [...] When asked whether reducing the number of teams in the UEFA Champions League would help, Wenger commented it [...] "...would mean less money and no one with the wages we pay can accept a drop in income. As for cutting the Premiership – they have done that in France and <b>now</b> <b>those</b> teams not involved in the cups are complaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. <b>Now</b> <b>those</b> things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But we did not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grants {{have been}} {{distributed}} across the different states {{even though the}} perceived risk is not evenly spread, leading to accusations of pork barrel politics that directs money and jobs towards marginal voting areas. The Urban Areas Security Initiative grant program has been particularly controversial, with the 2006 infrastructure list covering 77,000 assets, including a popcorn factory and a hot dog stand. [...] The 2007 criteria were reduced to 2,100 and <b>now</b> <b>those</b> facilities must make a much stronger case to become eligible for grants. While well-intentioned, some of the results have also been questioned regarding claims of poorly designed and intrusive security theater that distracts attention and money from more pressing issues or creates damaging side effects.|$|E
2500|$|In the illustrative case of Rome, Italy, in the 1920s and 1930s, suburbs were {{intentionally}} created ex novo {{in order}} to give lower classes a destination, in consideration of the actual and foreseen massive arrival of poor people from other areas of the country. Many critics have seen in this development pattern (which was circularly distributed in every direction) also a quick solution to a problem of public order (keeping the unwelcome poorest classes together with the criminals, in this way better controlled, comfortably remote from the elegant [...] "official" [...] town). On the other hand, the expected huge expansion of the town soon effectively covered the distance from the central town, and <b>now</b> <b>those</b> suburbs are completely engulfed by the main territory of the town.

2500|$|The California and Idaho Stage and Fast Freight Company soon collapsed.

Although Mullan persuaded the U.S. Army to station some troops along the line, they proved too few in number. Competition from a newly improved road between Umatilla, Oregon, and Boise (which received {{a large amount of}} freight from Oregon Steam Navigation Company steamships on the Columbia River) and from a new road (opened in September 1866) between Boise and Hunter, Nevada (which received a large amount of freight from the Central Pacific Railroad) significantly and negatively impacted Mullan's finances.

2500|$|After {{the release}} of Back to Black, record {{companies}} sought out female artists with a similar sound and fearless and experimental female musicians in general. Adele and Duffy were the second wave of artists with a sound similar to Winehouse's. A third wave of female musicians that has emerged since the album was released are led by V V Brown, Florence and the Machine, La Roux and Little Boots. In March 2011, the New York Daily News ran an article attributing the continuing wave of British female artists that {{have been successful in}} the United States to Winehouse and her absence. Spin magazine music editor Charles Aaron was quoted as saying, [...] "Amy Winehouse was the Nirvana moment for all these women [...] They can all be traced back to her in terms of attitude, musical styles or fashion."
