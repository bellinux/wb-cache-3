5|$|Besides the nucleolus, {{the nucleus}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the <b>nucleoplasm</b> is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E
5|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{the average}} {{diameter of the}} nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. The viscous liquid within it is called <b>nucleoplasm</b> (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular organelle. The composition by dry weight of the nucleus is approximately: DNA 9%, RNA 1%, Histone Protein 11%, Residual Protein 14%, Acidic Proteins 65%.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the <b>nucleoplasm</b> and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the <b>nucleoplasm</b> where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E
5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear pores, {{which provide}} aqueous {{channels}} through the envelope, {{are composed of}} multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9nm wide, due {{to the presence of}} regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.|$|E
25|$|Even snRNAs and snoRNAs {{themselves}} undergo {{series of}} modification {{before they become}} part of functional RNP complex. This is done either in the <b>nucleoplasm</b> or in the specialized compartments called Cajal bodies. Their bases are methylated or pseudouridinilated {{by a group of}} small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs), which are structurally similar to snoRNAs.|$|E
25|$|Importin {{proteins}} bind their cargo in the cytoplasm, {{after which}} {{they are able to}} interact with the nuclear pore complex and pass through its channel. Once inside the nucleus, interaction with Ran-GTP causes a conformational change in the importin that causes it to dissociate from its cargo. The resulting complex of importin and Ran-GTP then translocates to the cytoplasm, where a protein called Ran Binding Protein (RanBP) separates Ran-GTP from importin. Separation allows access to a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that binds Ran-GTP and induces the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. The Ran-GDP produced from this process now binds the nuclear transport factor NUTF2 which returns it to the <b>nucleoplasm.</b> Now in the nucleus, the Ran-GDP interacts with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which replaces the GDP with GTP, resulting again in Ran-GTP, and beginning the cycle anew.|$|E
500|$|Speckles are {{subnuclear}} {{structures that}} are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and {{are located in}} the interchromatin regions of the <b>nucleoplasm</b> of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{proteins}} localize to two {{regions of}} the nuclear compartment, the nuclear lamina—a proteinaceous structure layer subjacent to the inner surface of the nuclear envelope and throughout the <b>nucleoplasm</b> in the nucleoplasmic [...] "veil".|$|E
2500|$|Active {{transcription}} {{units are}} clustered in the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories or euchromatin. Such sites can be visualized by allowing engaged polymerases {{to extend their}} transcripts in tagged precursors (Br-UTP or Br-U) and immuno-labeling the tagged nascent RNA. Transcription factories can also be localized using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} or marked by antibodies directed against polymerases. There are ~10,000 factories in the <b>nucleoplasm</b> of a HeLa cell, among which are ~8,000 polymerase II factories and ~2,000 polymerase III factories. Each polymerase II factory contains ~8 polymerases. As most active transcription units are associated with only one polymerase, each factory usually contains ~8 different transcription units. These units might be associated through promoters and/or enhancers, with loops forming a [...] "cloud" [...] around the factor.|$|E
2500|$|Active RNA Pol II {{transcription}} holoenzymes can be {{clustered in}} the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories. There are ~8,000 such {{factories in the}} <b>nucleoplasm</b> of a HeLa cell, but only 100-300 RNAP II foci per nucleus in erythroid cells, {{as in many other}} tissue types. The number of transcription factories in tissues is far more restricted than indicated by previous estimates from cultured cells. [...] As an active transcription unit is usually associated with only one Pol II holoenzyme, a polymerase II factory may contain on average ~8 holoenzymes. Colocalization of transcribed genes has not been observed when using cultured fibroblast-like cells. Differentiated or committed tissue types have a limited number of available transcription sites. Estimates show that erythroid cells express at least 4,000 genes, so many genes are obliged to seek out and share the same factory.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the {{cytoplasm}} of a cell, {{the nucleus}} contains <b>nucleoplasm,</b> karyoplasm, or nucleus sap. The <b>nucleoplasm</b> {{is one of}} the types of protoplasm, and it is enveloped by the nuclear membrane or nuclear envelope. The <b>nucleoplasm</b> includes the chromosomes and nucleoli. Many substances such as nucleotides (necessary for purposes such as the replication of DNA) and enzymes (which direct activities that take place in the nucleus) are dissolved in the <b>nucleoplasm.</b> The soluble, liquid portion of the <b>nucleoplasm</b> is called the nucleosol or nuclear hyaloplasm.|$|E
5000|$|... hPINX1 {{is found}} {{more in the}} <b>nucleoplasm</b> during the S phase which is also when {{telomerase}} is released into the <b>nucleoplasm</b> indicating that hPINX1 may inhibit telomerase during the S phase.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{membranes}} {{are found}} in both the cytoplasm and <b>nucleoplasm.</b> In the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> they are small, irrrgular, as well as short-living. It have been established that, in some condition, ribosomes being directly connected to the annulate lamellar membrane, supposing {{a role in the}} process of protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no reason}} to expect the cell {{cytoplasm}} or <b>nucleoplasm</b> to be completely spatially uniform or isotropic.|$|E
50|$|Early studies {{suggested}} {{a minimum of}} two RNAPs: one which synthesized rRNA in the nucleolus, and one which synthesized other RNA in the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> part of the nucleus but outside the nucleolus. In 1969, science experimentalists Robert Roeder and William Rutter definitively discovered an additional RNAP that was responsible for transcription of some kind of RNA in the <b>nucleoplasm.</b> The finding was obtained by the use of DEAE-Sephadex ion-exchange chromatography. The technique separated the enzymes by the order of the corresponding elutions, Ι,ΙΙ,ΙΙΙ, by increasing the concentration of ammonium sulfate. The enzymes were named according to the order of the elutions, RNAP I, RNAP II, RNAP IΙI. This discovery demonstrated that there was an additional enzyme present in the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> which allowed for the differentiation between RNAP II and RNAP III.|$|E
50|$|Interchromatin {{granules}} are structures undergoing constant change, {{and their}} components exchange continuously with the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> active transcription sites and other nuclear locations.|$|E
50|$|It {{is located}} in the nucleolus, but it can be {{translocated}} to the <b>nucleoplasm</b> in case of serum starvation or treatment with anticancer drugs. The protein is phosphorylated.|$|E
50|$|NONO {{is found}} in the nucleus of most {{mammalian}} cells and is primarily distributed within the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> it can also be found concentrated within sub-nuclear domains known as paraspeckles.|$|E
50|$|EBER1 {{associates}} with human ribosomal protein L22 and causes this protein {{to move from}} the nucleolus to the <b>nucleoplasm.</b> EBER1 also specifically interacts with at least three host hnRNPs (A1, A2/B1 and D/AUF1).|$|E
50|$|The {{cellular}} {{composition of}} this DNA binding protein features the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> chromosomes, a telomeric region, a nuclear telomere cap complex, the cytoplasm, the spindle, the nucleus and a nucleolus and a nuclear chromosome.|$|E
50|$|The POLD1/P125 {{protein is}} {{expressed}} ubiquitously across {{a panel of}} human tissues with high levels in the heart and lung tissues. The subcellular localization of POLD1/p125 is predominantly in the nucleus and <b>nucleoplasm.</b>|$|E
5000|$|These {{proteins}} localize to two {{regions of}} the nuclear compartment, the nuclear lamina—a proteinaceous structure layer subjacent to the inner surface of the nuclear envelope and throughout the <b>nucleoplasm</b> in the nucleoplasmic [...] "veil".|$|E
50|$|The {{cells of}} {{eukaryotic}} organisms are elaborately subdivided into functionally-distinct membrane-bound compartments. Some major constituents of eukaryotic cells are: extracellular space, cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisome, vacuoles, cytoskeleton, <b>nucleoplasm,</b> nucleolus, nuclear matrix and ribosomes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{continuous}} chain {{between the}} <b>nucleoplasm</b> {{and the inner}} parts of the nucleolus exists through a network of nucleolar channels. In this way, macromolecules with a molecular weight up to 2000 kDa are easily distributed throughout the nucleolus.|$|E
50|$|Exportins, such as XPO6, recruit cargo in the <b>nucleoplasm</b> in the {{presence}} of Ran-GTP and form ternary export complexes. These complexes are transported through nuclear pore complexes to the cytoplasm, where GTP is hydrolyzed and the export complex is disassembled.|$|E
5000|$|In some definitions, it is {{a general}} term for the {{cytoplasm}} (e.g., Mohl, 1846), but for others, it also includes the <b>nucleoplasm</b> (e.g., Strasburger, 1882). For Sharp (1921), [...] "According to the older usage the extra-nuclear portion of the protoplast the entire cell, excluding the cell wall was called [...] "protoplasm," [...] but the nucleus also is composed of protoplasm, or living substance in its broader sense. The current consensus is to avoid this ambiguity by employing Strasburger's (1882) terms cytoplasm coined by Kölliker (1863), originally as synonym for protoplasm and <b>nucleoplasm</b> (term coined by van Beneden (1875), or karyoplasm, used by Flemming (1878))". The cytoplasm definition of Strasburger excluded the plastids (Chromatoplasm).|$|E
50|$|The nuclear lamina is {{associated}} with the inner face of the double bilayer nuclear envelope, whereas the outer face is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. The nuclear lamina is similar in structure to the nuclear matrix, but the latter extends throughout the <b>nucleoplasm.</b>|$|E
50|$|The in vivo model {{mentioned}} above clearly explains 3-D and 1-D diffusion along the DNA strand and the binding of proteins to target {{sites on the}} chain. Just like prokaryotic cells, in eukaryotes, facilitated diffusion occurs in the <b>nucleoplasm</b> on chromatin filaments, {{accounted for by the}} switching dynamics of a protein when it is either bound to a chromatin thread or when freely diffusing in the <b>nucleoplasm.</b> In addition, given that the chromatin molecule is fragmented, its fractal properties need to be considered. After calculating the search time for a target protein, alternating between the 3-D and 1-D diffusion phases on the chromatin fractal structure, it was deduced that facilitated diffusion in eukaryotes precipitates the searching process and minimizes the searching time by increasing the DNA-protein affinity.|$|E
50|$|Heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs) {{which include}} mRNA {{precursors}} and mature mRNAs {{are associated with}} specific proteins to form heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L is among the proteins that are stably associated with hnRNP complexes and along with other hnRNP proteins is likely {{to play a major}} role in the formation, packaging, processing, and function of mRNA. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L is present in the <b>nucleoplasm</b> as part of the HNRP complex. HNRP proteins have also been identified outside of the <b>nucleoplasm.</b> Exchange of hnRNP for mRNA-binding proteins accompanies transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Since HNRP proteins have been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, it is possible that they also have cytoplasmic functions. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.|$|E
50|$|Even snRNAs and snoRNAs {{themselves}} undergo {{series of}} modification {{before they become}} part of functional RNP complex. This is done either in the <b>nucleoplasm</b> or in the specialized compartments called Cajal bodies. Their bases are methylated or pseudouridinilated {{by a group of}} small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs), which are structurally similar to snoRNAs.|$|E
50|$|This gene {{is one of}} {{a family}} of nuclear RNA export factor genes. It encodes a protein that is {{involved}} in mRNA export, is located in the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> and is associated with the nuclear envelope. Alternative splicing seems to be a common mechanism in this gene family. Two variants have been found for this gene.|$|E
5000|$|The MIAT gene {{is located}} on Chromosome 22 and is 30,051 bases in length. MIAT's other name, gomafu, is a word in Japanese that means “spotted pattern”. The reason it is named as so is because Gomafu is {{distributed}} in the <b>nucleoplasm</b> in a spotted pattern. [...] Moreover, its orientation is a plus strand.|$|E
50|$|Karyopherins are a {{group of}} {{proteins}} involved in transporting molecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. The inside of the nucleus is called the karyoplasm (or <b>nucleoplasm).</b> Generally, karyopherin-mediated transport occurs through the nuclear pore, which acts as a gateway {{into and out of}} the nucleus. Most proteins require karyopherins to traverse the nuclear pore.|$|E
5000|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a {{component}} of the core SMN complex, which is required for pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus. The encoded protein is found in the <b>nucleoplasm,</b> in nuclear [...] "gems" [...] (Gemini of Cajal bodies), and in the cytoplasm. Three transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.|$|E
