25|$|The idea of mystical realities {{has been}} widely held in Christianity since the second century AD, {{referring}} <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> spiritual practices, {{but also to the}} belief that their rituals and even their scriptures have hidden ("mystical") meanings.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{claimed that}} he was more {{convinced}} of his method of doing philosophy than of his philosophical conclusions. Science was one of the principal components of analysis. Russell was a believer in the scientific method, that science reaches only tentative answers, that scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. He believed the same was true of philosophy. Russell held that the ultimate objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> make predictions.|$|E

The aim is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|The Penitentiary was {{intended}} <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> punish, but {{to move the}} criminal toward spiritual reflection and change. While {{some have argued that}} the Pennsylvania System was Quaker-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's Pennsylvania Prison Society) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, William White. Proponents of the system believed strongly that the criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts of their behavior and the ugliness of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{motivation}} {{refers to}} the performance of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation. Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.|$|E

500|$|Chrysippus had a {{long and}} {{successful}} career of resisting the attacks of the Academy and hoped <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> defend Stoicism against the assaults of the past, but also against all possible attack in the future. He took the doctrines of Zeno and Cleanthes and crystallized them into what became the definitive system of Stoicism. He elaborated the physical doctrines of the Stoics and their theory of knowledge and he created much of their formal logic. In short, Chrysippus made the Stoic system what it was. It was said that [...] "without Chrysippus, {{there would have been}} no Stoa".|$|E
500|$|According to Angela Vogel and Hartmut Rübner, Carl Hillmann, a typesetter and {{prominent}} trade unionist in the 1870s, was the [...] "intellectual father" [...] of the localist and anarcho-syndicalist movement. Vogel's and Rübner's claim {{is based on}} the fact that Hillmann was the first in Germany to consider unions' primary role to be the creation of the conditions for a socialist revolution, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> improve workers' living conditions. He also advocated a de-centralized trade union federation structure. Many of the later anarcho-syndicalists including Rudolf Rocker agree with this notion. Hans Manfred Bock, on the other hand, sees no evidence for Hillmann's influence on the FVdG.|$|E
500|$|According to the OECD UK {{taxation}} {{increased from}} a 39.3% share {{of gross domestic}} product in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than that of Germany. This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> the growing economy. Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing [...] "stealth taxes". A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the dividends on stock investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK. The Treasury contends that this tax change was crucial to long-term economic growth.|$|E

500|$|For {{disposing}} of existing equitable interests, the Law of Property Act 1925 provides in Section 53(1)(c) that: [...] Much {{of the debate}} {{in this area is}} over the definition of [...] "disposition", and unsurprisingly almost all of the cases involve people trying to avoid tax. In Grey v IRC, the House of Lords gave disposition its [...] "natural meaning", saying that it meant [...] "a transaction whereby a beneficiary who has a beneficial interest {{at the beginning of the}} transaction no longer has it at the end of the transaction". Under the rule established in Vandervell v IRC, if the owner of a sole beneficial interest instructs his trustees to transfer the property, and this is done to transfer the beneficial interest and <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> change the trustees, this does not fall under Section 53(1)(c) and requires no specific formalities.|$|E

[...] Dan Silver of The Observer awarded the record four stars out of five and likened it to both Bruce Springsteen's music and the avant-garde writing of Chuck Palahniuk. Rolling Stones David Fricke called 21st Century Breakdown [...] "a compound bomb of classic-rock ecstasy, no-mercy punk assault and pop-song wiles; it's like The Clash's London Calling, The Who's Quadrophenia and Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade all compressed into 18 songs". Dan Cairns of The Times concluded: [...] "Lyrically, it may succeed in capturing the contradictions, vulnerabilities and longing for harmony that thrum through Armstrong, Dirnt and Cool, their country, and humanity as a whole.
