Sales and occupancy at the mall lagged the trust's portfolio, which had averaged sales of $378 per square foot and non-anchor occupancy of 89.5 percent for the same time period.|$|R
50|$|A special {{registration}} mark obtained in an auction is not transferable, {{that is to}} say, the number can be used only on vehicles registered under the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buyer.</b> Transferring a special {{registration mark}} from one vehicle to another is permitted provided that they are both owned by the same person. Sale or transfer of vehicles bearing a special registration mark to someone else would lose that special registration mark. If the buyer is assigned the special registration mark to a vehicle, and later dies, the special registration mark cannot be transferred together with the vehicle to his heirs. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to consider in whose name one should buy a special registration mark in an auction. The use of a limited liability company as the buyer gets around the non-transferrable restriction because of its perpetual succession and the ability to transfer the company shares.|$|R

The certificate of title, which was in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buyer,</b> noted a lien by the national bank, and was at all times in the possession of the bank after the assignment of the note.

In her pursuit of the bullet, Montoya beats the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buyer</b> out <b>of</b> Corrigan. Although Allen is cleared, Montoya becomes obsessed with exposing Corrigan. Allen tries to persuade Montoya to let it go, but Montoya refuses, so Allen investigates Corrigan independently. During his investigation, one of Allen's informants is murdered shortly before Allen himself is shot and killed by Corrigan. Montoya takes it upon herself to bring Corrigan to justice. Tracking him down, Montoya beats Corrigan's girlfriend unconscious and draws a gun on Corrigan. He begs for his life, and Montoya finds she cannot pull the trigger. Montoya quits the GCPD the next day, disgusted and broken.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{regarding the}} effectiveness of signalling via brand name has focused on when and how any brand-building cost incurred, will be rewarded by future profit. In contrast to this seller-incentive perspective, this study examines how the buyer interprets the signal via brand <b>name,</b> the effectiveness <b>of</b> signalling via brand <b>name</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> value perspective, and how the buyer's reaction toward the signal impacts on the seller's decision to adopt the signalling strategy. Signalling theory and concepts from consumer-based branding research are used to suggest how to evaluate {{the effectiveness of}} signalling via brand name in the context of the consumer market, wherein information is asymmetric. Findings from online trading experiments, using the methodology of experimental economics, demonstrate that the function of brand fluctuates according to which market conditions prevail for brand and price, the extent of brand differentiation, and the magnitude of brand-building cost. This suggests an alternative way to measure the value of a brand to the buyer...|$|R
40|$|This book {{exploits}} a {{trove of}} original documents that have survived on the auctions organized by the Orphan Chamber of Amsterdam {{in the first half}} of the seventeenth century. For the first time, the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> some 2000 <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> works of art at auction in the 29 extant notebooks of the Chamber have been systematically analyzed. On the basis of archival research, data have been assembled on the occupation <b>of</b> these <b>buyers</b> (most <b>of</b> whom were merchants), their origin (Southern Netherlands, Holland, and other), their religion, their year of birth, their date of marriage, the taxes they paid and other indicators <b>of</b> their wealth. <b>Buyers</b> were found to cluster in groups, not only by extended family but by occupation, religion (Remonstrants, Counter-Remonstrants) and avocation (amateurs of tulips and of porcelain, members of Chambers of Rhetoricians, and so forth). The subjects of the works of art they bought and the artists to which they were attributed are also analyzed. The second part of the book on “Selected Buyers”, is devoted to art dealers who bought at auction and four to buyers who had special connections with artists, including principally Rembrandt. As a whole, the book offers a penetrating insight into the culture of the Amsterdam elite in the seventeenth century. In Art at Auction in 17 th Century Amsterdam Montias has created a richly patterned panorama of the interactions between artists, art lovers and art dealers who were active in one of Europe’s most important art scenes of the 17 th century...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The project was concerned {{with the role of}} international commerce and mercantile networks in the early phases of British industrialisation. Specifically, it was concerned with the operation of the market for malleable bar iron. Between 1650 and 1800 domestic ironmasters were unable to meet the growing demand for bar iron. The shortfall was made good by imports from the Baltic, first from Sweden, then from Russia. The objective of the project was to uncover the links in the global commodity chain that stretched from the mining district of central Sweden to Britain and beyond. By doing so, the destination of bar iron imports can be plotted, allowing regional markets and specialised production zones to be detected, illuminating the operation {{of one of the most}} important industrial commodity markets of the era. As a further step, the role of mercantile networks in Britain in developing new patterns of metalware manufacture, orientated upon export markets in the Atlantic world, is brought to light. Main Topics : The data collection comprises a complete record of bar iron sales by the Bristol iron merchant Graffin Prankard between 1732 and 1739. The date of the transaction, the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buyer,</b> his or her location, the type of bar iron sold, its weight, and its price (per ton) have been recorded. Each buyer is allotted a code to facilitate the sorting of this data by region...|$|R
