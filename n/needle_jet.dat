METHODS Bilateral no-scalpel vasectomy was performed in 323 patients during 2007. Of the 323 patients, 65 received LIA, 29 received LIA SCB, and 227 received anesthesia using the no-needle technique with the MadaJet device. The level of pain during anesthesia administration and the subsequent procedural pain was documented for each technique using a pain scale of 0 - 10.

50|$|Since the {{position}} of the piston controls {{the position}} of the <b>needle</b> in the <b>jet</b> and thus the open area of the jet, while the depression in the venturi sucking fuel out of the jet remains constant, the rate of fuel delivery is always a definite function of the rate of air delivery. The precise nature of the function is determined by the profile of the needle. With appropriate selection of the needle, the fuel delivery can be matched much more closely {{to the demands of the}} engine than is possible with the more common fixed-venturi carburettor, an inherently inaccurate device whose design must incorporate many complex fudges to obtain usable accuracy of fuelling. The well-controlled conditions under which the jet is operating also make it possible to obtain good and consistent atomisation of the fuel under all operating conditions.|$|R

The control aims to maximise the energy absorption from waves, adapting converter's resistance to the incoming wave size. The MGR is a near shore submerged converter that {{takes advantage of the}} oscillating water column created by the wave when it passes on the converter's platform. The wave column moves the platform, transmitting the force to a single acting cylinder, that pumps sea water to the coast, where is turbined generating electricity. The control strategy is based on adjusting the system pressure to the coming wave size to create the optimal resistance, absorbing the maximum energy from it. The pressure is controlled by the aperture of turbine <b>jet,</b> positioning <b>jet</b> <b>needle.</b> In addition, the PLC implements the synchronous generator's load (torque) {{in order to maintain the}} turbine working at the maximum efficiency rotation speed.

40|$|Needle wells are {{conventional}} well-bores {{that contain}} several hundreds of laterals, called needle holes. The reservoir contact area is increased by these holes, which enables enhanced hydrocarbon production. The needle holes {{are created by}} dedicated pipes that are equipped with nozzles. These pipes are mounted in a special liner that is lowered downhole. By pumping fluid-abrasive particle mixtures through the nozzles, the formation is eroded away and causes the needle to propagate into the reservoir. The transport of fluid-particle mixtures in the narrow annulus of a needle geometry might result in challenges with regards to hole cleaning. Also, pressure losses for these mixtures are challenging to predict. The {{purpose of this study}} was to experimentally investigate the effects of flow rate variations, needle inclinations and needle eccentricity on pressures and hole cleaning in the annulus between a needle and the hole that it creates. From a literature study was determined that the combination of water with 4 vol. % steel particles might be a good mixture for the purpose of <b>needle</b> <b>jetting.</b> Due to strong acceleration of the mixture in the nozzles of the needle, the impact of the particles cause the formation to break and the water subsequently can enter the cracks to remove the rock cuttings. Typical pressures that have to be applied over the nozzles are in the order of 350 bar. The material properties for steel particles and water were used as input for a needle system design calculation. The needle diameter was set at 10 mm and from pressure loss calculations, and the aim to apply maximum pressure drop over the nozzle, the annulus outer diameter was defined to be 16 mm. Typical flow rates needed per needle are in the order of 30 L/min. Steel particle sizes for this system were calculated to be ~ 0. 2 mm. A program of experiments was defined wherein flow rates were varied between 10 - 30 L/min in steps of 10 L/min. Steel particle concentrations were set at 4 vol. % and particle sizes ranged from 0. 2 - 0. 3 mm. These experiments were run in a specially designed setup, wherein the annulus eccentricity and inclinations can be varied over their full range. Experiments were conducted for a concentric annulus in horizontal, vertical and 45 degree critical angle setting. For a fully eccentric annulus, the transport in horizontal and critical angle setting were investigated. In the vertical and critical angle experiments, the flow-direction was set against the force of gravity. Over a small length in the annulus, movies of the particle distributions were recorded by high speed camera. Stationary beds, moving beds and an asymmetric suspension of particles only occurred at 10 L/min & 20 L/min for horizontal eccentric setting and at 10 L/min for critical angle eccentric setting. The pressure losses for water-steel particle mixtures in concentric annuli were all higher than the losses for water flow. However, for increasing flow rates, this difference decreased. During water-steel particle experiments at 10 L/min in horizontal concentric setting, the annulus plugged. This resulted in rapid particle buildup in the annulus and should therefore be avoided. When flowing at 10 L/min in vertical concentric setting, the pressure losses were lower than for flowing at 10 L/min at horizontal and critical angle concentric settings. A pressure loss model for homogeneously suspended particles matched within 10 % accuracy with the results from vertical concentric setting. Furthermore, it was expected that at the critical angle, particle beds would slide back into the hole. This was not observed during the experiments.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of needle tip design on the irrigant flow inside a prepared root canal during final irrigation with a syringe using a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. Methods A CFD model was created to simulate the irrigant flow inside a prepared root canal. Six different types of 30 -G needles, three open-ended needles and three close-ended needles, were tested. Using this CFD model, the irrigant flow in the apical root canal was calculated and visualized. As a result, the streaming velocity, the apical pressure, and the shear stress on the root canal wall were evaluated. Results The open-ended <b>needles</b> created a <b>jet</b> toward the apex and maximum irrigant replacement. Within this group, the notched needle appeared less efficient in terms of irrigant replacement than the other two types. Within the close-ended group, the side-vented and double side-vented needle created a series of vortices and a less efficient irrigant replacement; the side-vented needle was slightly more efficient. The multi-vented needle created almost no flow apically to its tip, and wall shear stress was concentrated on a limited area, but the apical pressure was significantly lower than the other types. Conclusions The flow pattern of the open-ended needles was different from the close-ended needles, resulting in more irrigant replacement in front of the open-ended needles but also higher apical pressure...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to examine the effects of {{controlled}} hemorrhage and shock on oxygenation and ventilation using <b>needle</b> cricothyroidotomy and <b>jet</b> ventilation in an animal model. Methods: Twenty-four male pigs were randomly allocated into 4 groups: SHOCK (animals in hemorrhagic shock only), CRICH (animals that underwent needle cricothyroidotomy only), SHOCK+ CRICH (animals in hemorrhagic shock + needle cricothyroidotomy), and SHAM (anesthetized animals submitted to surgical preparation only). All animals were surgically prepared and were observed for a period of 40 minutes (T 0 - T 40). Hemodynamic and blood gas variables were compared using analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc testing at a level of significance of 95 %. Results: CRICH and SHOCK+ CRICH developed respiratory acidosis, with a progressive decrease of arterial pH after T 20, and they presented a significant increase of PaCO 2 levels after T 10, when compared with SHAM and SHOCK (P <. 001). When SHOCK+ CRICH was compared with CRICH, it presented a larger increase of PaCO 2 after T 10 (P =. 036) and an even more significant increase after T 20 (P =. 009). Conclusion: Hemorrhagic shock anticipated and intensified the retention of carbon dioxide and respiratory acidosis during manual <b>jet</b> ventilation through <b>needle</b> cricothyroidotomy in comparison with animals with jet ventilation but without shock. the results found in this work should be considered in future protocols for the assistance of victims of trauma in prehospital settings.

40|$|Today’s {{microelectronics}} packaging {{especially for}} SiPs {{relies on the}} processing {{of a wide variety}} of materials. Materials for components, for substrates, for contact materials (solder & adhesives) and encapsulants. Most materials are processed as bulk material but precision dosing of pastes is key to many assembly processes. Examples are dosing of solder paste, typically done by stencil printing, Underfilling for Flip Chip encapsulation, typically done by dispensing or jetting, or Glob Top encapsulation of Chip on Board assemblies, where also dispensing is the typical process. When working with those paste materials, viscosity is one of the key parameters for processing, and viscosities too high do not allow dosing of the materials, not even to transport the material from a reservoir to the dosing head, which may be a simple <b>needle</b> or a <b>jet</b> valve. [i, ii] To overcome this obstacle, i. e. to dose materials of high viscosity precisely and homogeneously from a syringe to the dosing head, a research program has been set up, where Vermes microdispensing as a valve manufacturer and TU Berlin/IZM as a research institute are cooperating. TU Berlin is working on material rheology effects and flow models; Vermes is researching valves modifications and material flow path optimization. Core of the research is to find methods that allow a reduction of paste viscosity without leading to irreversible changes in the material, as would be the case when simply applying heat to the paste. As reference process for material dosing, FO-WLP has been chosen, materials selected for the investigations are GlobTop dam and fill material and liquid molding compound – using both rheological experiments as well as actual material dosing and processing.

40|$|Liquid needle free {{injectors}} are biomedical {{devices that}} deliver medication via {{the creation of}} high speed liquid jets {{without the use of}} hypodermic needles, have been a topic of interest in the scientific community for quite some time. This study focuses on the development and analysis of liquid jet injectors powered by air. Studies demonstrate that the majority of commercially available injectors are gas/air powered units; however there is no indication of a model that prescribes the performance characteristics of this particular type of injector. Consequently the main goal of this research is to develop and validate a model capable of predicting the behaviour of such devices. In this study, the development and analysis of a model for air-powered injectors is accomplished first by constructing a prototype injector that functions in a very similar fashion and produces jets of similar geometry and velocities as the vast majority of commercially available units. Furthermore, the injector is designed {{in such a way that}} the parameters such as, driver pressure, injection chamber length and volume as well as nozzle geometry can be varied. An initial evaluation of the prototype injector is performed to ensure it can be used to accurately conduct testing. The prototype injector is then used to validate a fluid mechanics model constructed based on previous work from Baker and Sanders [IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 46 : 235 - 242, 1999]. Experiments that map stagnation pressures of the jet through the use of a piezoelectric force transducer are performed in order to validate the performance of the model. These experiments describe the peak and average stagnation pressures of the jet based on the effect of different parameters such as driver pressure (400 - 800 kPa), nozzle size (130 - 250 μm) and injection chamber length (10 - 25 mm). The results of these tests are then compared to the behaviour prescribed by the model. An analysis of these results indicates that the present model can accurately be used to predict the performance of air-powered <b>needle</b> free liquid <b>jet</b> injectors...|$|R
