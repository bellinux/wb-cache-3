The proposed circuit consists of a voltage-to-current converter, a precision current-mode rectifier with operating in class-AB, and two current-to-voltage converters. A voltage input signal is changed into a current signal by the voltage-to-current converter. The class-AB current mode rectifiers rectify these current signals, resulting in positive and <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave</b> current signals that are converted to positive and <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave</b> voltage signals by the current-to-voltage converters. The circuit exhibits low component counts, {{high frequency}} operation, good temperature stability and suitable of IC fabrication.

Simulated rectifier performance with standard 0. 5 m CMOS technology using! 1. 2 V supply voltage shows the proposed half-wave rectifier circuit provides an operating frequency more than 250 MHz and excellent temperature stability.

40|$|AbstractA {{rectifying}} {{transformation is}} required to sense variations in texture contrast. Various theoretical and practical considerations have inclined researchers to suppose that this rectification is full-wave, rather than half-wave. In the studies reported here, observers are asked to judge which of two texture patches has higher texture variance. Textures are composed of small squares, with each square being painted with one of nine different luminances. Different texture variances are achieved by manipulating the histograms of the texture patches to be compared. When the nine luminances range linearly from 0 to 160 cd/m 2, the transformation mediating judgments of texture variance {{takes the form of}} a <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave</b> rectifier: texture variance judgments are determined exclusively by the frequencies of luminances below mean luminance in the textures being compared. However, when the nine luminances range linearly from 60 to 100 cd/m 2, two of three observers use a full-wave rectifying transformation in making texture variance judgments; the third observer continued to use a <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave</b> rectifier. The unexpectedly asymmetric roles played by low versus high luminances in texture variance judgments suggest that the off-center system may play a dominant role in human perception of texture contrast...|$|E

40|$|Slow {{oscillations}} {{originating in}} the prefrontal neocortex during slow-wave sleep (SWS) group neuronal network activity and thereby presumably support the consolidation of memories. Here, we investigated whether the grouping influence of slow oscillations extends to hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SPW) activity thought to underlie memory replay processes during SWS. The prefrontal surface EEG and multiunit activity (MUA), along with hippocampal local field potentials (LFP) from CA 1, were recorded in rats during sleep. Average spindle and ripple activity and event correlation histograms of SPWs were calculated, time-locked to half-waves of slow oscillations. Results confirm decreased prefrontal MUA and spindle activity during EEG slow oscillation negativity and increases in this activity during subsequent positivity. A remarkably close temporal link was revealed between slow oscillations and hippocampal activity, with ripple activity and SPWs being also distinctly decreased during <b>negative</b> <b>half-waves</b> and increas ed during slow oscillation positivity. Fine-grained analyses of temporal dynamics revealed for the slow oscillation a phase delay of approximately 90 ms with reference to up and down states of prefrontal MUA, and of only approximately 60 ms with reference to changes in SPWs, indicating that up and down states in prefrontal MUA precede corresponding changes in hippocampal SPWs by approximately 30 ms. Results {{support the notion that}} the depolarizing surface-positive phase of the slow oscillation and the associated up state of prefrontal excitation promotes hippocampal SPWs via efferent pathways. The preceding disfacilitation of hippocampal events temporally coupled to the <b>negative</b> slow oscillation <b>half-wave</b> appears to serve a synchronizing role in this neocorticohippocampal interplay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} simplify the device of {{modulation}} and demodulation of 2 FSK, a 2 FSK modem based on the microcontroller AT 89 C 51 was designed. This modem is mainly composed of an AT 89 C 51 microcontroller, a simple two order passive low-pass filter, and a shaping circuit. Modulation is achieved {{on the basis of}} the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM). By executing PWM signal generating program, a digital base band signal is converted into the corresponding PWM signal after it is input into an I/O port of the microcontroller. Then the PWM signal is outputted from another I/O port and sent into the two order passive low-pass filter. On the output side of the filter, the 2 FSK signal can be obtained. For demodulation, the 2 FSK signal shaped by the shaping circuit is input into microcontroller from its I/O port. Then the widths of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>half-waves</b> are measured by the microcontroller internal timer. By comparing the value of each width with the appropriate threshold value, the binary digital signal is gotten and outputted from another I/O port of microcontroller. This modem makes full use of the resources of the microcontroller. As a result, it is simple, easy to use, economical and reliable. Furthermore, it can generate and demodulate the 2 FSK signal with high good accuracy...|$|R

During thumb preload, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the ECAP increased by 0. 9 mV, to 9. 5 (SD 2. 2) mV (? < 0. 01), {{because of the}} increased height of the <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave.</b> The positive half-wave am-plitude did not change, but its duration was prolonged by 0. 7 ms, to 6. 4 (0. 7) ms (P < 0. 05).

40|$|International audienceThe spatial {{dynamics}} of the optical emission from an array of 50 times 50 individual micro cavity plasma devices are investigated. The array is operated in argon and argon-neon mixtures close to atmospheric pressure with an AC voltage. The optical emission is analysed with phase and space resolution. It {{has been found that}} the emission is not continuous over the entire AC period, but occurs once per half period. Each of the observed emission phases shows a self-pulsing of the discharge, with several bursts of emission of fixed width and repetition rate. The number of emission bursts depends on applied voltage and frequency. Spatially resolved measurements prove that the emission bursts are formed by overlapping emission pulses from single discharge cavities.

The cyclic voltammetry experiments with the nitro-PAH {{were carried out}} in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), containing 0. 1 mol L- 1 tetraethylammonium perchlorate (TEAP) using a three-compartment cell fitted with Pt working and auxiliary electrodes, and a Ag/AgI reference electrode (a silver wire in 0. 1 mol L- 1 DMF/TEAP containing 0. 05 mol L- 1 tetrabutylammonium iodide). These potentials can be ordered from the less to the more negative value, which corresponds to the same order by which the direct-acting mutagenicity decreases (3 -NF >> 1 -NP > 6 -NC >> 9 -NA). Thus, 3 -NF, which shows the less <b>negative</b> first <b>half-wave</b> potential value is the more active mutagenic amongst the nitro-PAH studied.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of reduction for chromium(III) ion to chromium(II) at the mercury cathode was studied in 0. 1 M KNO/sub 3 /. Data obtained at varying temperature and solution composition from polarograms gave values for DELTA H*, DELTA S*, and DELTA F* which indicated that two mechanisms were involved. At potentials more positive than the polarographic half-wave potential, the mechanism appeared to be simple electron transfer from the electrode to the chromium(III) ion in solution. When the potential was more <b>negative</b> than the <b>half-wave,</b> potential electron exchange between the reduced chromium ion near the electrode surface and a chromium(III) ion in solution became appreciable.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{models of}} texture {{processing}} use low level, spatially parallel computations to extract texture properties. The rapid, preattentive nature of texture segregation {{suggests that these}} computations are bottom–up in nature. However, the immunity of texture judgments to top–down influences remains to be tested. Here we investigate {{the degree to which}} judgments of texture orientation are susceptible to top–down attentional control. Observers view a brief display composed of variously luminant texture elements (line segments) alternately (in checkerboard arrangement) oriented up/right (at 71. 5 °) or up/left (at 108. 5 °), and are asked to make various judgments. In a given task, the observer attempts on each trial to judge which oriented population of line segments has an intensity histogram that best matches a given target histogram. Performance demonstrates adaptive flexibility across different tasks, suggesting that observers are able to exercise significant top–down control over texture orientation computations. Specifically, observers can attend selectively to positive contrast texture elements, to negative contrast texture elements, or to high (positive and negative) contrast texture elements. More generally, observers perform well if the target histogram can be approximated by a weighted average of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave</b> rectifiers. Performance is poor for histograms that cannot be captured in this way. These results suggest that attentional control in these tasks is limited to adjusting the relative gain of the on- and off-center systems...|$|E

40|$|Eigenmannia lineata is a {{tropical}} South American gymnotiform fish {{that is both}} electrogenic and electroreceptive. Its electric organ generates a constant-frequency wave discharge (EOD) that is sexually dimorphic in waveform and harmonic content. Eigenmannia discriminates digitally synthesized, natural male and female EOD waveforms of identical frequency and amplitude. Experiments were devised to investigate behaviourally the sensory mechanism of this discrimination. Both the content in higher harmonics (as seen in an amplitude spectrum) and the waveform (phase spectrum) could provide the cues Eigenmannia uses for discrimination. Five Eigenmannia were trained to discriminate artificially generated stimuli composed of the fundamental frequency,/!, and its harmonic, f 2, of a frequency twice that of /i and of weaker intensity (— 13 to — 3 dB re / i; a similar variation is found among the EODs of different Eigenmannia individuals). The rewarded stimulus, S+ (with a strong f 2 intensity of — 3 dB re /i), remained constant throughout the experiments. The family of negative (S—) stimuli all had a phase difference of 0 °, that is, no phase difference, between their harmonics, while the S+ stimulus had a phase difference of 90 °. Therefore, all S— stimuli differed from the S+ stimulus in waveform, while one S— stimulus had an amplitude spectrum identical {{to that of the}} S+ stimulus. All fish discriminated any S— signal tested from the S+ stimulus, including the S- stimulus with an identical amplitude spectrum, both when the test signals had identical energy contents (that is, slightly different peak-to-peak amplitudes) and when they had identical peak-to-peak amplitudes (hence, slightly different energy contents). These results arc evidence for a true waveform (time domain) sensitivity of Eigenmannia. A sensory mechanism is proposed that enables Eigenmannia to assess the P/N ratio of a wave signal, that is, the duration ratio of positive (P) and <b>negative</b> (N) <b>half-waves</b> between zero-crossings of a stimulus cycle (the S+ and all S— stimuli, as well as female and male EODs, differ in this regard) ...|$|R

Results suggested {{that it is possible to}} determine thermodynamic stability constants from half-wave potentials, as reported previously for Zn and Fe. Pseudopolarograms from culture media of three Cu stressed phytoplankton species showed very different thermodynamic stability constants, indicating the presence of chemically distinct ligands. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus produced at least two strong Cu chelators.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of energy, electricity, and transportation industries {{has created a}} market for steel pipes; however, buried steel pipelines near high-voltage transmission lines and electrified railways often experience alternating current (AC) corrosion at the damaged coating of pipelines; such phenomenon is mostly due to the resistance between the capacitance and inductance coupling, especially for long-distance pipelines in parallel operation. AC corrosion can cause pipeline corrosion perforation and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in some cases, {{which has been a}} vital threat to the pipeline safety. In this work, the influence of AC on corrosion behavior of X 80 pipeline steel was investigated in NS 4 near-neutral solution by data acquisition technique, electrochemical test, immersion tests and surface analysis techniques. Results show that with the increasing of AC density, corrosion morphology changed from uniform corrosion to localized corrosion with many pits. Under the full AC interference, X 80 steel occurred cathodic and anodic polarization which resulted in iron dissolution and hydrogen precipitation. The negative half wave AC would lead to hydrogen evolution and hydrogen induced anodic dissolution, the pits in X 80 steel surface present sharp. However, under disturbance of positive half-wave AC, only anodic dissolution occurred and the pitting appeared spill shape and smoothly.

40|$|Monophonic tele-conferencing systems employ {{acoustic}} echo cancellation (AEC) to reduce echoes {{that result from}} coupling between loudspeaker and microphone. Acoustic echo cancellation is simple to develope {{as there is a}} single channel. But future tele conferencing systems are expected to have multi channel communication which is necessary in hands-free multi user tele communication systems. Stereophonic echo cancellation (SEC), has been studied since the early 1990 s, in hands-free tele communication applications such as tele conferencing, multi user desktop conferencing, and tele video gaming. To enhance the sound realism in order to increase the speech intelligibilty it is necessary to use two channel (stereo) audio systems. This requires SEC systems. In SEC there is a fundamental problem that the adaptive algorithm used can not identify correct echo path responses due to strong correlation between stereo signals and also the convergence is slow. In this case it is necessary to identify two echo paths for each channel thus there are four echo paths to identify which is very difficult. In this thesis, the problems with stereo echo cancellation is explained and echo cancellation with emphasis on two channel affine projection algorithm (APA) is studied. The signal de-correlation techniques are reviewed and compared. The idea behind signal decorrelation techniques is to introduce nonlinearity into each channel. This can be done by using half-wave rectifiers or time varying all-pass filters. Three methods were developed to reduce correlation between stereo signals. One, is to use two positive half-wave rectifiers on both channels considered as NLP 1. Second, is to use positive and <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave</b> rectifiers on each channel (NLP 2). Third, is to use time varying all-pass filters (TV-APF) on both channels with delays. Experiments were performed using MATLAB and observed echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) and misalignment(MIS) with different scenarios. The euclidean norm distance calculation has been used to find out MIS between filter coefficients and true echo path models. It is observed that NLP 1 and NLP 2 lack signal perception even though ERLE was good. The MIS falls down below 25 dB with decorrelated stereo signals.

40|$|The pyrazinoporphyrazine macrocycles having formula [Py 8 TPyzPzH 2], (Figure 1 B) and its metal {{complexes}} [Py 8 TPyzPzM], with M = bivalent first transition {{series and}} non transition series metal ions, were extensively investigated by our group [1]. Structural and electronic features were studied by single crystal X-ray work, spectral (IR, UV-visible, NMR) and electrochemical investigations, and contributed by detailed theoretical DFT and TDDFT studies. The {{important role of}} the external pyridine rings has been examined by considering their capability of electronic contact with the central pyrazinoporphyrazine core. Their ability to coordinate metal centers [2] or to undergo quaternization processes at the N atoms [1 b,c] has also been studied. The attention for applicative aspects has been particularly devoted to learn about their behavior as photosensitizers in PDT and their potentialities as multimodal anticancer agents [3, 2 b-d]. The present thesis work has selected as the main subject the synthesis of two novel types of porphyrazine macrocycles, strictly related to the above considered “pyrazinoporphyrazines”, but showing a narrower (“restricted” macrocycle) or more extended porphyrazine core (“expanded” macrocycle”). The two compounds, {{in the form of}} unmetalated species are schematically shown in Figures 1 A and 1 C respectively. The targets of the present project were to explain: a) how the change in the expansion or contraction of the central planar or quasi-planar -conjugated skeleton, with respect to that of the pyrazinoporphyrazine core, will modify stability, solubility, tendency to aggregation, general physicochemical and redox behaviour of the new species and their applicative potentialities, with attention centered on their photoactivity properties; b) how the presence of the external pyridine rings, directly attached to the porphyrazine core (“restricted” macrocycle; Figure 1 A) or more far away than in the already studied “pyrazinoporphyrazine” macrocycle (“expanded” macrocycle; Figure 1 C) added of local metal coordination or quaternization processes, can produce consistent effects on the structural and electronic features of the new macrocyclic skeletons; c) how do the data concerning the response of the new species as photosensitizers compare with those already known for the original “pyrazinoporphyrazine” macrocycles. UV-visible spectral data in the low-donor nonaqueous solvents indicate that there is a progressive highly remarkable bathochromic shift of the barycentre of the overall spectrum in the direction pyridylporphyrazines  pyrazinoporphyrazines  quinoxalinoporphyrazines, in line with the parallel enhanced extension of the -conjugated system of the macrocycles in the order given. The eight external pyridines allow the accomplishment of exocyclic coordination and formation of pentanuclear species carrying externally PdCl 2 and PtCl 2. Figure 2 shows the pentametallic species for the pyridyl- (A) and quinoxalinoporphyrazines (B). Data at hand indicate that coordination of the PdII or PtII units takes place in all cases at the pyridine N atoms, and sites of the type N 2 (pyr) MCl 2 (M = PdII, PtII; “py-py” coordination) are generated, displaying a square planar geometry and directed nearly perpendicularly to the plane of the central -conjugated macrocyclic system. External ligation modifies the UV-visible spectrum of the initial mononuclear species, the effect evidencing a bathochromic shift of the original main Q band by an average value of 15 - 20 nm. This remarkable shift is surprising if account is taken that exocyclic coordination of PdII and PtII, particularly for the pyrazino- and even more for the quinoxalinoporphyrazine compounds, takes place at the extreme periphery of the macrocycle and progressively more far away from the central metal. Further extension of the work focused on the synthesis of supercharged macrocycles for the pyridyl- and quinoxalinoporphyrazines. The new octacationic compounds which are moderately water soluble, were prepared from the mononuclear species upon reaction with CH 3 I, a process which results in the full N-methylation of the pyridine rings (Figure 3). The UV-visible spectra in water solution and in the low-donor solvents pyridine, DMSO and DMF show interesting effects which parallel those determined by the external metalation. The spectra evidence in the process from neutral to octacationic species a bathochromic shift of the Q bands about of the same order observed for the change mononuclear  pentanuclear species. This means that the charged macrocycles enhance their electron deficiency; a fact that should be confirmed by the electrochemical behaviour in terms of the expected less <b>negative</b> <b>half-wave</b> potentials with respect to those pertinent to the neutral mononuclear species. The final challenge of some of the pyridyl- and quinoxalinoporphyrazines, especially those carrying centrally ZnII and MgII (closed shell metal ions) is their measured photoactivity for the generation in DMF of singlet oxygen, 1 O 2, the cytotoxic agent in the photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT). The quantum yields of 1 O 2 measured, particularly for the two pyridylporphyazines having centrally ZnII and MgII, qualify these compounds as excellent photosensitizers. A combination of purity of the samples, water solubility, stability under the appropriate irradiation (600 - 750 nm), absence of aggregation in solution may be profitable for application in the PDT curative modality. The species carrying outside PtCl 2 units may open perspectives for applications as bimodal PDT/cis-platin anticancer agents. Concomitant work was conducted on “pyrazinoporphyrazine” macrocycles carrying externally thienyl rings (Figure 4). The work on the thienyl pyrazinoporphyrazines involved modifications of the peripheral part of the macrocycle, focusing on the coordination properties of the S atoms inserted in the external 2 -thienyl rings, in an interesting comparison with those seen for the pyridine rings in the pyridinated “pyrazinoporphyrazines” [4]. On the other hand the singlet oxygen and fluorescence response of the mono- and pentametallic complexes open perspectives for their potential use in PDT of cancer and for medical imaging and diagnosis.
