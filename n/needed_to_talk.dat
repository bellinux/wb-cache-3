500|$|After the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, with Stephen {{in captivity}} in Bristol, Theobald did not {{immediately}} join the Empress. [...] He claimed that he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Stephen before switching his oath of fealty. After consulting in person with Stephen, he secured permission to accept the current conditions, and then joined Henry of Blois, who had switched sides, at Winchester in April for a legatine council held to depose Stephen and crown Matilda as queen. Attendance at the council was sparse however, and the Empress could not be crowned {{because she did not}} hold London. After the unsuccessful attempt to crown Matilda, those gathered at Winchester had to flee before Stephen's forces; one of Matilda's chief supporters, her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, was captured. During their flight Theobald and his fellow bishops were robbed of their horses and ecclesiastical vestments. Theobald then took a leading part in the negotiations that led to the exchange of Robert for Stephen, which happened in November 1141. Henry of Blois, having switched sides again, then held another legatine council in Westminster, which reaffirmed Stephen as king. Theobald ceremonially crowned Stephen at Canterbury during the Christmas court held there.|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally {{be able to talk to}} her. They claimed that they started by talking to {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started to realize it [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E

500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people}} who are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|Hearst was {{reluctant}} to play a character similar to herself, commenting, [...] "I'd never gone in and done as cameo as myself or anything, and I wouldn't do that. Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind of thing. I almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

Maggie worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce, Gary, and John. Griffin {{described}} herself during her early years as [...] "a kid who <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> all the time." [...] She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and {{the place where she}} learned [...] "the power of juicy material." [...] After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours alone in the house and developed a binge eating disorder. She explained that even though eating disorders were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can. In her 2009 autobiography Official Book Club Selection, Griffin confessed that she [...] "still suffers [...] " [...] but has learned to [...] "deal with them." [...] In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was [...] "afraid of him until the moment he died" [...] due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and [...] "whisper" [...] into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or {{be in the same room}} as him for years but didn't tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.|$|E
