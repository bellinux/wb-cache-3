25|$|Like most of {{the worlds}} of Dungeons & Dragons, the Order of the Stick {{universe}} contains a verifiable afterlife—a series of planes to which dead souls are drawn. The afterlife in the OOTS world resembles the Great Wheel cosmology, with separate planes for the departed of each alignment. To enter the afterlife, a planar being must assess whether or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>soul</b> has fulfilled the tenets of their alignment throughout their life. Some Dwarves might be exempt from this rule, as {{those who do not}} die honorably in battle (or from liver failure due to alcohol poisoning) are sent to the plane of Hel upon death, regardless of alignment.|$|E

2500|$|In his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes {{embarked}} upon a quest {{in which}} he called all his previous beliefs into doubt, {{in order to find}} out of what he could be certain. In so doing, he discovered that he could doubt whether he had a body (it could be that he was dreaming of it or that it was an illusion created by an evil demon), but he could not doubt whether he had a mind. This gave Descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different things. The mind, according to Descartes, was a [...] "thinking thing" [...] (...) , and an immaterial substance. This [...] "thing" [...] was the essence of himself, that which doubts, believes, hopes, and thinks. The body, [...] "the thing that exists" [...] (...) , regulates normal bodily functions (such as heart and liver). According to Descartes, animals only had a body and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>soul</b> (which distinguishes humans from animals). The distinction between mind and body is argued in Meditation VI as follows: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and a clear and distinct idea of body as an extended and non-thinking thing. Whatever I can conceive clearly and distinctly, God can so create.|$|E
2500|$|Leaving {{his wife}} and son, Clark began {{the first of his}} diaries a month before the First Fleet {{departed}} Portsmouth, on 13 May 1787. The writing in the diaries is very personal and informal, and was never intended for publication. Clark was extremely homesick, and longed to see {{his wife and}} son, writing as early as {{the second day of the}} voyage: [...] "Oh my God all my hoppes [...] are over of seeing my beloved wife and son". Like many of his fellow officers, he was aggrieved at the level of comfort and support offered to the convicts, noting [...] "I believe few Marines or Soldiers going out on a foreign Service under Government were ever better, if so well provided for as these Convicts are". On arrival in Botany Bay, Clark was dismayed at the unsuitable conditions, which were far from what had been promised in England: [...] "if we are obliged to settle here there will <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>soul</b> be alive in the course of a year". With the site for settlement subsequently moved to Sydney Cove, Clark remained distressed by the living conditions experienced by himself and his fellow officers, expressing in a letter to his family in England: [...] "I never slept worse, my dear wife, than I did last night, what with the hard cold ground, spiders, ants and every vermin you can think of was crawling over me". During the colony's early years, little food was produced, and the rations brought from England were soon consumed, leaving the colony in near starvation. Clark wrote [...] "God help us. If some ships dont [...] arrive, I dont know what will". Supplies finally arrived in June 1790, on Lady Juliana.|$|E
50|$|Rene Descartes, {{a famous}} French philosopher, {{contributed to the}} field of {{psychology}} while also keeping the Catholic church's beliefs in mind. Descartes' beliefs were controversial during the 17th-century because some of his beliefs went against Christian teachings. Contrary to Christian teachings, Descartes believed that animals could be understood as a machine that did <b>not</b> have <b>a</b> <b>soul.</b> Although he did not specifically say that humans did <b>not</b> have <b>a</b> <b>soul,</b> Christians found this statement to be controversial because human beings resembled animals. These beliefs were written in his work titled The World. The World was never published because Descartes feared the Catholic church would punish him for his controversial beliefs.|$|R
