25|$|Computed {{tomography}} angiography is a fast, <b>noninvasive</b> <b>test</b> {{that gives}} an accurate three-dimensional {{view of the}} aorta. These images are produced by taking rapid, thin-cut slices of the chest and abdomen, and combining them in the computer to create cross-sectional slices. To delineate the aorta to the accuracy necessary to make the proper diagnosis, an iodinated contrast material is injected into a peripheral vein. Contrast is injected and the scan performed using a bolus tracking method. This type of scan is timed to an injection to capture the contrast as it enters the aorta. The scan then follows the contrast as it flows though the vessel. It has a sensitivity of 96 to 100% and a specificity of 96 to 100%.

40|$|SUMMARY To {{assess the}} impact of <b>noninvasive</b> <b>testing</b> of the carotid vessels upon patient management, we {{analyzed}} the angiographic findings in 494 patients studied between 1978 and 1983 for suspected extracranial cerebrovascular disease. This longitudinal study revealed two changes in the pattern of angio-graphic results after introduction of <b>noninvasive</b> <b>testing</b> in the final months of 1979. The proportion of examinations that revealed less than 49 % stenosis decreased significantly from 49 % in 1978 to 19 % in 1983 (p < 0. 001). During the same time, the proportion of examinations identifying 75 - 99 % stenosis increased from 20 % to 62 % (p < 0. 001). The referring physicians and their patient population appeared to remain unchanged over these years. We believe the decline in patients with little or no disease is a consequence of better patient selection due to screening with <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests.</b> We credit the increase in patients with 75 - 99 % disease to additional patients identified by <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests.</b> This study also points out that the role of noninvasive studies will necessarily be restricted because of inherent limitations in the techniques and that clinical judgement will remain the final arbiter with regard to the management of patients at risk for stroke.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of two <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests,</b> the nonstress test (NST) and Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery, in predicting fetal acidemia or hypoxia demonstrated by funipuncture, and to determine any association between acidemia or hypoxia and perinatal outcome. Methods: The study included 112 consecutive growth-restricted fetuses diagnosed by ultrasonography between 26 - 39 weeks' gestation. For Doppler sonograms, the absence of end-diastolic flow was considered pathologic. Acidemia and hypoxia were defined as a pH and an oxygen pressure (PO 2) below the fifth percentile at the given gestational age. The fetuses were classified according to the results obtained by the different tests (Doppler velocimetry, NST, cord blood gases). Results: Fetuses with one or both <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests</b> abnormal (group A, N = 32) had a significantly lower mean gestational age at sampling than those fetuses with both <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests</b> normal (group B, N = 80). Mean pH and PO 2 values for groups A and B were significantly different. Obstetric and perinatal data were collected, and {{a statistically significant difference}} was demonstrated between those with a pH and/or PO 2 below the fifth percentile and those with a pH and PO 2 above the fifth percentile for all indices except birth weight below the tenth percentile. Conclusion: Fetal growth restriction is a benign condition in physically normal fetuses if both <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests</b> and pH and PO 2 measured by funipuncture are normal in the absence of maternal pathology.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the appropriateness of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in Japan and clarify the association between trends of pre-procedural <b>noninvasive</b> <b>testing</b> and changes in appropriateness ratings. BackgroundAlthough PCI appropriateness criteria are widely used for quality-of-care improvement, they have not been validated internationally. Furthermore, the correlation of appropriateness ratings with implementation of newly developed <b>noninvasive</b> <b>testing</b> is unclear. MethodsWe assigned an appropriateness rating to 11, 258 consecutive PCIs registered in the Japanese Cardiovascular Database according to appropriateness use criteria developed in 2009 (AUC/ 2009) and the 2012 revised version (AUC/ 2012). Trends of pre-procedural <b>noninvasive</b> <b>testing</b> and appropriateness ratings were plotted; logistic regression was performed to identify inappropriate PCI predictors. ResultsIn nonacute settings, 15 % of PCIs were rated inappropriate under AUC/ 2009, and this percent increased to 30. 7 % under AUC/ 2012 criteria. This was mostly because of the focused update of AUC, in which the patients were newly classified as inappropriate if they lacked proximal left anterior descending lesions and did not undergo pre-procedural <b>noninvasive</b> <b>testing.</b> However, these cases were simply not rated under AUC/ 2009. The amount of inappropriate PCIs increased over 5 years, proportional to the increase in coronary computed tomography angiography use. Use of coronary computed tomography angiography was independently associated with inappropriate PCIs (odds ratio: 1. 33; p = 0. 027). ConclusionsIn a multicenter, Japanese PCI registry, approximately one-sixth of nonacute PCIs were rated as inappropriate under AUC/ 2009, increasing to approximately one-third under the revised AUC/ 2012.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Findings {{from the}} Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) {{indicate}} that carotid endarterectomy can be beneficial in symptom-free patients with 60 % to 99 % carotid artery stenosis. However, patients in ACAS who underwent contrast angiography (CA) before carotid endarterectomy {{were exposed to}} an additional 1. 2 % risk of stroke. Methods: We used the methods of decision analysis to assess whether the overall 5 -year stroke risk in symptom-free patients with suspected carotid artery disease can be reduced by preoperative imaging with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or duplex ultrasonography (DU). We compared four strategies for the preoperative evaluation of carotid artery stenosis in symptom-free patients: 1) CA alone, 2) MRA alone, 3) DU alone, and 4) MRA and DU with CA when {{the results of these}} tests disagree. Accuracies of MRA and DU were estimated from 81 patients exposed to all three procedures; stroke risks for patients with 60 % to 99 % carotid artery stenosis were obtained from ACAS. Results: For predicting 60 % to 99 % carotid stenoses, sensitivity and specificity for <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests,</b> optimized to reduce morbidity, were as follows: DU (0. 96, 0. 66), MRA (1. 00, 0. 76), DU/MRA (1. 00, 0. 86; 26 % would require CA). The 5 -year stroke risk of these four strategies in order of decreasing benefit was MRA, 6. 17 %; MRA/DU, 6. 34 %; DU, 6. 35 %; and CA, 7. 12 %. In sensitivity analyses, <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests</b> were advantageous even if the stroke rate with CA diminished to 0. 4 %, or if the sensitivity and specificity of <b>noninvasive</b> <b>tests</b> fell to 70 %.
