5|$|Julius Mutekanga was {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round of the 800 metres while Abraham Kiplimo and Geofrey Kusuro similarly were unable to advance to final of the 5000 metres after finishing in a <b>non-qualifying</b> position. Jacob Araptany also did not progress to the final in the 3000 metres steeplechase while Kiplagat advanced to the later stages of the same event before being disqualified for changing to the track's inside line after being knocked over by another athlete. Kispiro made it to the 5000 metres final as the slowest qualifier and secured a fifteenth-place finish, and took a tenth-position result in the 10,000 metres despite falling onto the track's surface. Thomas Ayeko finished in sixteenth in the same event. Kiprotich won the men's marathon, securing Uganda's first gold medal since 1972.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{unprecedented}} re-run {{occurred in}} the women's 4 × 100 metres relay heats: Brazil's second leg runner Franciela Krasucki accidentally obstructed American Allyson Felix during the baton exchange, causing Felix to drop the baton.

Whenever a <b>non-qualifying</b> vehicle is raced, the time is compared to the official Power Laps but then removed from the board, for example - the Ferrari FXX owned by Michael Schumacher (1:10.7) was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres.|$|E

Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their ISO codes). In 2005, the votes from the <b>non-qualifying</b> semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance. Between 2006 and 2010, a separate draw was held to determine the order in which countries would present their votes. In 2011, the voting order was determined by the results of a jury the day before the final so as to create as much suspense as possible when the votes were revealed.|$|E

40|$|The private {{security}} industry is experiencing great prosperity. Despite the job {{opportunities in the}} industry, however, there are various problems endemic to employment as a security guard. Wages are usually low and risks can be high. While union membership has increased among security guards, collective bargaining has been unsuccessful in alleviating the occupation 2 ̆ 7 s problems. Section 9 (b) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act specifically prevents the Board from finding a unit appropriate if it includes both guards and non-guards. This section cannot be applied properly without first considering the Act 2 ̆ 7 s overall policies and Congress 2 ̆ 7 specific intention in passing this section. Meanwhile, voluntary recognition has also been {{an important factor in}} the security industry. Section 9 (b) (3) does not state how, or if, it affects bargaining relationships commenced voluntarily by employers and <b>non-qualified</b> unions. Thus, Congress should clarify the statutory rule regarding the withdrawal of voluntary recognition of <b>non-qualified</b> unions. Congress could either add a proviso to the section stating that it should not be construed to affect bargaining relationships voluntarily commenced by employers and <b>non-qualified</b> unions, or it could prohibit voluntary recognition altogether. The Board should modify the Bally 2 ̆ 7 s rule (where the Board adopted a broad rule allowing all unions, qualified and <b>non-qualified,</b> incumbent and non-incumbent, to appear on the ballot, provided the petition was filed by a qualified union) by recognizing a thirty percent showing of interest by <b>non-qualified</b> unions which seek to intervene. The Board should also affirm the Wells Fargo decision (saying the Board has discretion to allow <b>non-qualified</b> unions to participate in its election processes) as it would not be inconsistent to continue to hold voluntary recognition of <b>non-qualified</b> unions permissible while allowing employers to end the bargaining relationship unilaterally...|$|R

2500|$|After the semi-final, {{the voting}} method {{used during the}} show was commented upon, with the <b>non-qualifying</b> artists finding the results [...] "weird and not right". The voting method saw the televotes of 10 regions of Lithuania being {{converted}} into points, 1 point for the least favoured and 12 for the most preferred. Alanas, who failed to qualify to the final, said that she found the voting [...] "very bizarre", {{and that she would}} like to know how many people voted for her. Augustė, who also failed to qualify, called it [...] "nonsense", commentating on the difference in the amount of votes cast in Vilnius in comparison to smaller towns in Lithuania: [...] "I don't understand how can we compare points of Vilnius and of some small city in Lithuania. In Vilnius we need thousands of votes to get 12 points. Meanwhile in a small city a hundred votes can be enough".|$|E
2500|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission is {{responsible}} for interpreting and enforcing Section 28(e). In Section 28(e) the definition of qualifying services is detailed and explicit, but Section 28(e) is not a rule {{it is just a}} [...] "safe harbor". The use of client commissions to pay for services which are not within the safe harbor of Section 28(e) is not within the safe harbor. A fiduciary who [...] "pays up" [...] in client commissions to receive <b>non-qualifying</b> services must be able to defend this practice under applicable law. [...] For pension plans subject to ERISA, a fiduciary can use client assets only for the exclusive benefit of clients and cannot use the client assets for the fiduciary's benefit. [...] Most public pension plans have similar prohibitions. [...] For registered investment companies (such as mutual funds), Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 generally prohibits a fund affiliate—such as the fund adviser—receiving compensation when purchasing or selling property for a registered fund. [...] As a result, for all practical purposes, brokerage arrangements for pension plans and registered investment companies must come within the Section 28(e) safe harbor or run afoul of these restrictions.|$|E
2500|$|Qualified by her L.A. Marathon run, she {{ran in the}} 1988 Olympic Marathon trials, darting to {{a minute}} and a half lead in the early stages.

In 1992, she again made the Olympic Trials in the 10000metres, just missing the team by finishing in the deadly fourth place. 1996 looked to be her year. She qualified for the 10000metres in her personal record of 31:54.03, set in the cool evening at the Mt.
