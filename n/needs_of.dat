40|$|Introduction: Most {{children}} survive childhood cancer, however parenting a child {{diagnosed with}} cancer is a major challenge. The main aim {{of the current study}} was to describe Swedish parents’ need, opportunity and benefit of support from healthcare professionals and significant others after end of a child’s successful cancer treatment. Material and methods: Data was collected from approximately one week after end of successful treatment/six months after transplantation (T 4, n ¼ 212) up to five years thereafter (T 7, n ¼ 137). Parents answered questions via telephone about need, opportunity and benefit of talking to psychologists, social workers, partners and friends. Results: The proportion reporting <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support from healthcare professionals varied between 73 % (mothers’ <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support from social workers, T 4) and 7 % (fathers’ <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support from psychologists/social workers, T 7). <b>Need</b> <b>of</b> support from significant others varied between 99 % (mothers’ and fathers’ <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support from partners, T 4) and 27 % (fathers’ <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support from friends, T 7). The proportion reporting <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support decreased over time (p <. 001), no decrease occurred from three months after end of treatment/nine months after transplantation (T 5) to one year after end of treatment/ 18 months after transplantation (T 6). More mothers than fathers reported <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support from friends at T 5 (p <. 001) and T 7 (p <. 05) and from psychologists at T 7 (p <. 05). Opportunities for support from healthcare professionals varied, most reported opportunity for support from significant others. Almost all reported benefit from received support. Conclusion: A declining number reports a <b>need</b> <b>of</b> support over time, however subgroups report an unmet need and almost every parent perceive support from healthcare professionals as beneficial. More parents should get access to psychosocial support services after end of a child’s cancer treatment/transplantation...|$|R
