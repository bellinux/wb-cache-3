50|$|<b>Nitrostarch</b> {{was invented}} by H. Barconnot in 1833.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitrostarch</b> is a {{secondary}} explosive similar to nitrocellulose {{made by the}} nitration of starch by a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Mk 2 grenade had a 3/8-inch (9.6 mm) {{threaded plug}} in its base, which covered the opening used {{to place the}} explosive filling, either 1.85 oz (52 g) of TNT, 2.33 oz (66 g) of Trojan explosive (a mixture of 40% <b>nitrostarch,</b> ammonium nitrate, and sodium nitrate), 1.85 oz (52 g) of a 50/50 amatol/nitrostarch mixture, or 1.85 oz (52 g) of Grenite (a mixture of 95% <b>nitrostarch</b> and binders). Some early Mk 2 grenades were filled with 0.74 oz (21 g) of smokeless EC powder. The improved [...] "Mk 2A1" [...] (a designation used informally by armorers, historians, and collectors but was never officially by the US military) introduced in 1942 was filled through the fuse well instead. The Mk 2A1 was initially filled with 0.74 oz (21 g) of EC powder. In 1944, the EC powder filling was replaced with 1.85 oz (52 g) of TNT.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTwo prototypes of microstructured {{capillaries}} (MSCs) were designed, manufactured, {{and used}} to carry out different experiments. MSC- 1 consisted of six holes of ≈ 28 μm id whereas MSC- 2 consisted of 85 holes of ≈ 7. 7 μm id. A fundamental study on the hydrodynamic injection through a commercial CE equipment was conducted. Experimental times to flush specific volumes were approximately three {{times larger than the}} theoretical values. Then, the detection of starch was carried out by using the MSCs and conventional capillaries, and the electropherograms were compared on the basis of analytical parameters employed in CE. An improvement in peak asymmetry was obtained for the MSC- 1 compared to the conventional capillaries. S/N was one order of magnitude increased with the MSC, improving ten times the sensitivity. Considering this advantage, the separation and detection of <b>nitrostarch</b> was performed as a first application of the MSC- 1. Minimal sample amounts of <b>nitrostarch</b> (1. 7 μg) were detected. Results present a real interest in forensics since this substance had not been previously detected through CE, leading to new investigations in the design of new capillaries capable of enhancing CE performance...|$|E
