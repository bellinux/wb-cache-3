It compares {{the performance of}} both approaches when data is categorical. To that end, a distance over ordinal and <b>nominal</b> <b>scales</b> is defined.

Prior to this exploration, the definition of the calibration process is analysed then extended to a more general form compatible with weak scales. The opportunity to apply such process to <b>nominal</b> <b>scales</b> and ordinal scales is presented. Then the calibration of metrical scales is proposed.

The paper shows that, for categorical data, distance-based and probabilistic-based record linkage lead to similar results.

In the case of archaeological sites, data and information of structures on the territory and related objects, represented in territorial scale, must be managed, processed and represented in an integrated way since they all together constitute a complex unit that {{can be difficult to}} break down. The ability to manage data in a comprehensive way emerges from the possibility to create multi-resolution models, namely, models that can be used on several <b>nominal</b> <b>scales</b> of representation. The various scales generally arise from survey at several different <b>nominal</b> <b>scales</b> of objects that traditionally need a different detailed definition, such as an entire archaeological site or a monument on the site or fragments of architecture. If these territorial objects (the site, architectures, and specific objects) cohabit within complex models which have to be managed and consequently uniformly represented on diverse scales, we have to identify strategies for survey as well as integration, with a view to achieving multi-resolution.
