5|$|The picture {{he painted}} {{of his father}} was of a pious {{religious}} man who {{was not interested in}} the affairs of this world. He would spend most of his time reading the Quraan, fasting and hunting during the day and at <b>night</b> <b>would</b> copy the Quraan. He also recounted a few battles his father joined against the crusaders in his autobiography Kitab al Itibar.|$|E
5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that <b>night</b> <b>would</b> be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and <b>night</b> <b>would</b> necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
50|$|Hadhrat Abul Wafa {{would have}} only a few morsels at night and his <b>nights</b> <b>would</b> be spent supplicating Allah Most High.|$|R
50|$|At <b>night</b> he <b>would</b> devour {{the works}} of John Milton, Shakespeare and Alexander Pope by candlelight and when his mother confiscated his candles, he made his own from a mustard pot, a cotton cord for a wick and olive oil to burn. Literary {{appreciation}} was his only shared ideal with his father, Thomas Nicholson, who on wild winter <b>nights,</b> <b>would</b> read the collected works to his family beside the fireplace.|$|R
5000|$|With Football Park having lights {{installed}} by the 1984 SANFL season, {{this would be}} the final time that the <b>night</b> competition <b>would</b> be held at the suburban grounds of Thebarton and Norwood Oval's. From 1984 all <b>night</b> competition games <b>would</b> be held at the league's headquarters. <b>Night</b> football <b>would</b> not return to suburban grounds until the early 2000s when some [...] home games were scheduled to be held under lights at Norwood Oval.|$|R
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the <b>night</b> <b>would</b> have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused by}} these rearguards may have seriously {{compromised}} the British Empire advance {{as there was}} not much time to conclude military engagements in southern Palestine. The winter rains were expected to start {{in the middle of the}} month and the black soil plain which was currently firm, facilitating the movements of large military units would with the rains become a giant boggy quagmire, impassable for wheeled vehicles and very heavy marching for infantry. With the rains the temperatures which were currently hot during the day and pleasant at <b>night</b> <b>would</b> drop rapidly to become piercingly cold. In 1917 the rains began on 19 November just as the infantry began their advance into the Judean Hills.|$|E
5|$|Where battle {{could not}} be avoided, the late army broadly {{followed}} traditional practice as regards array. Heavy infantry would be drawn up in a main line, normally straight and several ranks deep. Mounted archers were stationed, together with light-armed slingers, {{in front of the}} main infantry line. Cavalry would be posted on the wings (light cavalry on the outside). Foot archers would form the rear rank(s) of the main infantry line. There would be a reserve line of infantry and cavalry of variable strength, {{to the rear of the}} main line, in order to deal with breaches in the main line and to exploit opportunities. At a distance of a mile or so to the rear of the army, its fortified camp of the previous <b>night</b> <b>would</b> contain its assistants and baggage, guarded by a small garrison. The camp could act as a refuge if the army was put to flight. Roman armies in the field never camped overnight without constructing defences. A ditch would be dug around the perimeter of the camp, and the spoil used to erect a rampart, which would then be topped with a palisade of sharpened wooden stakes arranged cross-hatched to form an impenetrable screen. Such defences, systematically patrolled, effectively precluded surprise attacks and enabled the troops to get a good night's sleep.|$|E
5000|$|Other <b>nights</b> <b>would</b> see a {{range of}} jazz, rhythm-and-blues and soul groups on the stage, {{including}} a [...] "duel" [...] between tenor saxophonists Teddy Edwards and Dick Morrissey in the 1980s. Other giants of jazz, including Sonny Stitt, Lee Konitz and Archie Shepp have also appeared at the club.|$|R
50|$|Night Slugs was {{originally}} {{started as a}} London-based club night by DJs/producers Alex Sushon and James Connolly after the two met on Myspace in 2008. The first Night Slugs party was staged at the Redstar in Camberwell in March 2008, though the <b>nights</b> <b>would</b> eventually move to the more centrally located East Village.|$|R
5000|$|The Big 3: Kannon {{plays the}} three most {{requested}} songs of the night. After this, there is usually one more song played afterwards and then the show ends. This segment is only on the Saturday show. In this case, Long Distance Nighty <b>Nights,</b> <b>would</b> be airing at this time, on the Sunday show.|$|R
25|$|However, {{a problem}} arose {{that would have}} caused a major issue had CBS elected {{to go ahead with}} a September {{expansion}} of As the World Turns. The network's contract with Procter and Gamble was not due to expire until December 1975. This meant that no new episodes of The Edge of <b>Night</b> <b>would</b> air for three months, and ABC wanted to keep the series' continuity intact. CBS decided to hold off on the expansion and continue airing The Edge of Night until ABC could find a space for the serial. In November 1975, ABC announced the cancellation of the game show You Don't Say!, which had been airing in the network's 4:00 pm timeslot. The final episode was scheduled to air on November 28, 1975, after which The Edge of <b>Night</b> <b>would</b> be free to leave CBS and As the World Turns would be free to expand to 60 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{breakout}} {{was planned}} for 09:00 on Sunday, July 3. This seemed {{the most logical}} time: the Americans would be at religious services, and waiting until <b>night</b> <b>would</b> only serve to make the escape that much more treacherous. By noon on Saturday, July 2, the fleet had {{a full head of}} steam and had fallen into position for the breakout.|$|E
25|$|Israeli media {{discussed}} the strategic {{significance of the}} satellite, {{particularly with regard to}} Iran. It was reported that TecSAR's ability to produce images in adverse weather and at <b>night</b> <b>would</b> allow Israel to obtain more information about the suspected Iranian nuclear weapons program. It was also reported that it would be capable of producing images of Iranian activities which previous satellites were unable to view.|$|E
5000|$|A new single {{entitled}} [...] "I'll Be There" [...] {{was released}} on digital format on 8 June 2009. The song {{was released on}} promo several years earlier via Smitten-Downes' previous alias of Amesha. The inlay to the promo of the Stunt version stated that a new album entitled Neon <b>Nights</b> <b>would</b> be released by the group in the future.|$|R
60|$|That very <b>night</b> I <b>would</b> {{seek out}} Cavalcanti ere I retired to sleep.|$|R
60|$|And he {{knew the}} unutterable misery of her <b>nights</b> that <b>would</b> not go.|$|R
25|$|The stadium {{attendance}} {{records were}} repeatedly broken throughout the 2006 and 2007 football seasons as the football program experienced a drastic resurgence. On October 18, 2007, a record 44,267 spectators attended {{a game in}} which the Scarlet Knights played against the then #2 ranked South Florida Bulls. The Scarlet Knights would go on to win that game, and the attendance on that <b>night</b> <b>would</b> be the highest ever prior to the 2008-2009 stadium expansion.|$|E
25|$|Triplemanía XIX {{opened with}} an in-ring segment, where Konnan first {{introduced}} announcer Arturo Rivera, {{who made his}} return after recently spending 20 days in coma {{as a result of}} a lung infection, and then proclaimed that the <b>night</b> <b>would</b> prove the superiority of American wrestling to Mexican lucha libre, before he was interrupted by Joaquin Roldán. At the conclusion of the segment, the two agreed that anyone who interfered in the evening's matches would be immediately suspended from AAA.|$|E
25|$|Cuyahoga County {{lifted the}} ban on alcohol sales outside of Cleveland {{on the morning of}} July 26, and Mayor Stokes {{announced}} that the curfew that <b>night</b> <b>would</b> begin at midnight (to allow the public to attend a Cleveland Indians home baseball game). In the afternoon, 35 Cleveland Police and 100 National Guardsmen surrounded the Esquire Hotel at 10602 Superior Avenue after police received a tip that several gunmen from the July 23–24 shootout were hiding there. No gunmen were found.|$|E
50|$|Almost every <b>night,</b> {{the cinema}} <b>would</b> be flooded. Some claimed you could catch a fish during the screening. Most <b>nights,</b> people <b>would</b> leave {{to find the}} street outside submerged. Men took this in their stride, {{carrying}} women to higher ground, no matter who they were.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} it was late and growing dark. But that <b>night</b> there <b>would</b> be a moon.|$|R
60|$|His companions only smiled wearily, {{for they}} knew that to-morrow <b>night</b> he <b>would</b> {{be back at the}} table.|$|R
25|$|On 3 April 2011, Beady Eye headlined a Japan Tsunami Disaster relief {{concert at}} the Brixton Academy. Liam Gallagher {{organised}} this multi star-studded event as a fundraiser for the devastating event that happened on 11 March 2011. The event raised over £150,000 for the British Red Cross working in the earthquake and tsunami hit country. Liam also announced that Beady Eye's version of The Beatles' 'Across the Universe', which they performed on the <b>night,</b> <b>would</b> be released as a charity single, to further benefit the fundraising.|$|E
25|$|Between 9 and 10 p.m. on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the king's troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that <b>night</b> <b>would</b> be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E
25|$|In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, {{the end of}} {{the world}} would be preceded by the release of Gog and Magog, whose {{destruction}} by God in a single <b>night</b> <b>would</b> usher in the Day of Resurrection. Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but the needs of the modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as the Jews and Israel, or the Ten Lost Tribes, or sometimes as Communist Russia and China. One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not to be found in the modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.|$|E
50|$|Because rock {{movement}} {{relies on}} a very rare set of circumstances, namely the usually-dry playa being flooded, and cold conditions to allow the water to freeze, drier winters and warmer winter <b>nights</b> <b>would</b> cause such circumstances to occur less often. A statistical study by Ralph Lorenz and Brian Jackson examining published reports of rock movements suggested (with 4:1 odds) an apparent decline between the 1960s-1990s, and the 21st century.|$|R
50|$|Owned {{by world}} Heavyweight boxing champion, Jack Dempsey, it was {{considered}} by many as an American institution. The restaurant originally opened for business as Jack Dempsey's Restaurant on Eighth Avenue and 50th Street, directly across from the third Madison Square Garden, in 1935. Most <b>nights</b> <b>would</b> find Dempsey's famous proprietor on hand to greet guests, sign autographs, pose for pictures, and hold court with {{people from all walks}} of life.|$|R
50|$|Opening {{two nights}} a week (Saturday mainly for clubbers from all over Ireland and Wednesday for local University of Ulster students), the venue does not use {{external}} promoters or host club nights, being a self-contained operation. The promoter, and manager of the club, Col Hamilton, is also the resident DJ. Music on resident-played <b>nights</b> <b>would</b> generally be house music, but the regular guest DJs {{are more likely to}} play trance music.|$|R
25|$|On September 12, Styles {{debuted in}} Maximum Pro Wrestling (MXPW), {{successfully}} challenging MXPW Television Champion Chris Sabin and Christopher Daniels in a three-way {{match for the}} title. On October 4, Styles debuted in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), unsuccessfully challenging PWG Champion Frankie Kazarian and Christopher Daniels for the title. On November 7, Styles returned to IWA: Mid-South {{to take part in}} the promotions annual Ted Petty Invitational, which saw Styles defeating Todd Sexton is his first round match. The following night, he defeated Jerry Lynn in the quarter-finals, but later that <b>night</b> <b>would</b> be eliminated by Danny Daniels in the semi-finals. On March 20, 2004, Styles returned to IWC, entering the promotions Super Indy Survivor Showdown tournament. Styles' first match in the tournament was in the semi-finals due to unknown reasons, in which he defeated CM Punk. Later that night, Styles faced IWC Super Indy Champion Colt Cabana in the final in a winning effort, capturing the title. On April 17, Styles successfully defended the title against Homicide, and on May 8 he did so again against Christopher Daniels.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a clash between the Los Villanos brothers, Villano III, Villano IV, and Villano V and several wrestlers from the La Lagunero area of Mexico, the trio of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther, and Black Warrior who had {{developed}} a rivalry with the brothers {{over the last several}} months and who would have repeated clashes over the years following the 2000 Sin Piedad show. The fifth match of the <b>night</b> <b>would</b> see the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors"; Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero) defend their CMLL World Tag Team Championship against the team of El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas. Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas were the previous holders of the championship, but were forced to vacate the title when Hijo del Santo stopped working for CMLL on a full time basis in mid-2000. Los Guerreros del Infierno had won a tournament for the vacant titles only a month earlier when the two defeated Mr. Niebla and Villano IV at CMLL's Entre Torre Infernal show. Hijo del Santo returned to CMLL during the tournament, immediately challenging the new champions for a title match since they never defeated the duo of Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas for the championship.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} the {{artillery}} continued to fire on likely Viet Cong forming-up points, although 11 Platoon's final position was avoided for fear of hitting any survivors. Meanwhile, US aircraft bombed likely withdrawal routes to the east. Forming a defensive position ready to repulse an expected attack the Australians remained overnight, enduring the cold and heavy rain. Although they were now {{in a better position}} to hold off any subsequent attack, further reinforcement from 1 ATF at <b>night</b> <b>would</b> be difficult and was therefore unlikely. Yet with the Viet Cong spent no further attack was mounted. Smith and Townsend spent the night in the back of one of the carriers planning the clearance of the battlefield and follow-up of the Viet Cong, which was scheduled for the following day under the codename Operation Smithfield. Jackson stipulated the force was to remain within artillery range, but would otherwise have freedom of action to complete the exploitation over the next two to three days. Townsend requested the remaining APCs bring out 6 RAR headquarters, C Company and a section of mortars the following morning, while D Company, 5 RAR would also be placed under his command for the operation. However, with a company from 5 RAR still in Binh Ba, the bulk of 1 ATF's remaining combat power would be deployed as part of the clearance, leaving just two infantry companies from 5 RAR to defend Nui Dat. Smith was determined to recover the missing from 11 Platoon, and despite its losses, D Company would lead the assault.|$|E
50|$|The {{format of}} the <b>nights</b> <b>would</b> {{generally}} be a specialty support act followed by the headline act, and all would be held together by a compère. The regular compère at Batley Variety Club was Jerry Brooke. Headline artists would be booked for a week-long run, from Sunday night to the following Saturday, sometimes longer. The biggest draw to the club, Shirley Bassey, was sometimes booked for three-week runs.|$|R
5000|$|Quiet <b>Nights</b> <b>would</b> {{continue}} to tour and perform during {{the remainder of}} the 1990s, although Cronsholm left after the first tour to start a family. She was replaced by another Swedish jazz singer, Josefine Lindstrand, about whom Bates has commented [...] "She's a quite different singer to Josefine Cronholm, more lively and right on the beat compared to the very relaxed thing we'd done on Quiet Nights with standards and ballads." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the pilgrimage}} season, which lasted forty <b>nights,</b> he <b>would</b> {{slaughter}} ten camels {{every day to}} feed the pilgrims.|$|R
