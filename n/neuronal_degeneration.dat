5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of <b>neuronal</b> <b>degeneration</b> in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E

The cDNA array is a recently developed molecular biological method that can detect the differential expression of several hundreds of genes simultaneously {{and is therefore}} advantageous {{in the study of}} trace metal intoxication effect at the genetic level. Using this technology, we discovered 5 genes in the mouse striatum and 9 genes in SN changed by more than 50 % following Mn exposure. Depression were observed in two genes (neural cell adhesion protein BIG 2, heavy neurofilament subunit genes) in striatum and three genes (light neurofilament subunit, brain acyl-CoA synthetase II, heavy neurofilament subunit genes) in the SN. However three genes (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, S 100 β, and synaptonemal complex protein I genes) in striatum and six genes (noggin, striatin, Ost oncogene, S 100 β, calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase kinase beta, and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I genes) in SN were elevated following Mn exposure. Immunohistochemical study revealed that protein levels of S 100 β also increased following Mn treatment. Activated astrocytes overexpressing S 100 β are invariably and intimately associated with decreased expression of heavy and light neurofilament subunits which is a distinguishing feature of neurodegeneration by Mn exposure.

40|$|Rabies virus {{infection}} of {{dorsal root ganglia}} (DRG) was studied in vitro with cultured adult mouse DRG neurons. Recent in vivo studies of transgenic mice that express the yellow fluorescent protein indicate that <b>neuronal</b> process <b>degeneration,</b> involving both dendrites and axons, occurs in mice infected with the challenge virus standard (CVS) strain of rabies virus by footpad inoculation. Because of the similarities of the morpho-logical changes in experimental rabies and in diabetic neuropathy and other diseases, we hypothesize that <b>neuronal</b> process <b>degeneration</b> {{occurs as a result}} of oxidative stress. DRG neurons were cultured from adult ICR mice. Two days after plating, they were infected with CVS. Immunostaining was evaluated with CVS- and mock-infected cultures for neuron specific -tubulin, rabies virus antigen, and amino acid adducts of 4 -hy-droxy- 2 -nonenal (4 -HNE) (marker of lipid peroxidation and hence oxidative stress). Neuronal viability (by trypan blue exclusion), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, and axonal growth were also assessed with the cultures. CVS infected 33 to 54 % of cultured DRG neurons. Levels of neuronal viability and TUNEL staining were similar in CVS- and mock-infected DRG neurons. There were significantly more 4 -HNE-labeled puncta at 2 and 3 days postinfection in CVS-infected cultures than in mock-infected cultures, and axonal outgrowth was reduced at these time points in CVS infection.

We examined hair from mummified humans from South America, extinct mammals and modern animals and people, both healthy and diseased, and teeth of hominins. We also monitored heart-rate variability, a measure of a biologic rhythm, in some living subjects and analyzed it using power spectra. The samples were examined to determine variations in stable isotope ratios {{along the length of the}} hair and across growth-lines of the enamel in teeth. We found recurring circa-annual periods of slow and fast rhythms in hydrogen isotope ratios in hair and carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in teeth. The power spectra contained slow and fast frequency power, matching, in terms of normalized frequency, the spectra of heart rate variability found in our living subjects. Analysis of the power spectra of hydrogen isotope ratios in hair from a patient with neurodegeneration revealed the same spectral features seen in the patient’s heart-rate variability. Our study shows that spectral analysis of stable isotope ratios in readily available tissues such as hair could become a powerful diagnostic tool when effective treatments and neuroprotective drugs for neurodegenerative diseases become available.

40|$|Photoreceptor {{apoptosis}} and resultant visual deficits {{occur in}} {{humans and animals}} with inherited and disease-, injury-, and chemical-induced retinal degeneration. A clinically relevant mouse model of progressive rod photoreceptor-selective apoptosis was produced by low-level developmental lead exposure and studied in combination with transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl-xL only in the photoreceptors. A multiparametric analysis of rod apoptosis and mitochondrial structure-function was performed. Mitochondrial cristae topography and connectivity, matrix volume, and contact sites were examined by using 3 D electron tomography. Lead-induced rod-selective apoptosis was accompanied by rod Ca 2 + overload, rhodopsin loss, translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria, decreased rod mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase- 3 activation, {{and an increase in}} the number of mitochondrial contact sites. These effects occurred without mitochondrial matrix swelling, outer membrane rupture, caspase- 8 activation, or Bid cleavage. Bcl-xL overexpression completely blocked all apoptotic events, except Ca 2 + overload, and maintained normal rod mitochondrial function throughout adulthood. This study presents images of mitochondrial contact sites in an in vivo apoptosis model and shows that Bcl-xL overexpression blocks increased contact sites and apoptosis. These findings extend our in vitro retinal studies with Pb 2 + and Ca 2 + and suggest that developmental lead exposure produced rod-selective apoptosis without mitochondrial swelling by translocating cytosolic Bax to the mitochondria, which likely sensitized the Pb 2 + and Ca 2 + overloaded rod mitochondria to release cytochrome c.

40|$|AbstractOxaliplatin, an anticancer drug {{commonly}} used to treat colorectal cancer and other tumors, {{has a number of}} serious side effects, most notably neuropathy and ototoxicity. To gain insights into its ototoxic profile, oxaliplatin was applied to rat cochlear organ cultures. Consistent with it neurotoxic propensity, oxaliplatin selectively damaged nerve fibers at a very low dose 1 μM. In contrast, the dose required to damage hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons was 50 fold higher (50 μM). Oxailiplatin-induced cochlear lesions initially increased with dose, but unexpectedly decreased at very high doses. This non-linear dose response could be related to depressed oxaliplatin uptake via active transport mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that axonal degeneration involves biologically active processes which can be greatly attenuated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). To determine if NAD+ would protect spiral ganglion axons and the hair cells from oxaliplatin damage, cochlear cultures were treated with oxaliplatin alone at doses of 10 μM or 50 μM respectively as controls or combined with 20 mM NAD+. Treatment with 10 μM oxaliplatin for 48 hours resulted in minor damage to auditory nerve fibers, but spared cochlear hair cells. However, when cochlear cultures were treated with 10 μM oxaliplatin plus 20 mM NAD+, most auditory nerve fibers were intact. 50 μM oxaliplatin destroyed most of spiral ganglion neurons and cochlear hair cells with apoptotic characteristics of cell fragmentations. However, 50 μM oxaliplatin plus 20 mM NAD+ treatment greatly reduced <b>neuronal</b> <b>degenerations</b> and hair cell missing. The results suggested that NAD+ provides significant protection against oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity and ototoxicity, which may be due to its actions of antioxidant, antiapoptosis, and energy supply...|$|R
