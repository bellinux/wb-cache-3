5|$|At the ten-minute mark, Sinden <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviets {{had changed}} their style, playing defence {{to protect the}} lead, rather than pressing.

5|$|During the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new {{telescope}} to discover spots and colorful bands on Jupiter and {{observed that the}} planet appeared oblate; that is, flattened at the poles. He was also able to estimate the rotation period of the planet. In 1690 Cassini <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere undergoes differential rotation.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} Albany, the ship {{carrying}} Montgomery up the Hudson River ran aground near Clermont Manor, {{seat of the}} politically powerful Livingston family. While the ship was refloated, the Livingstons played host to the officers who were aboard the vessel. Montgomery was at this time introduced to Robert Livingston's 20-year-old daughter Janet. While it has never transpired exactly what happened between them at this time, Janet <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young Montgomery was not with the regiment (having been given leave to return to England early) when it returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of news {{trucks and}} members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press {{immediately}} <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident. Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent.|$|E
5|$|McDiarmid <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{script for}} Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his {{character}} {{than in previous}} films. Lightsaber combat was {{a challenge to the}} 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.|$|E

5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-seven {{officers}} and crew of the two ships were at their stations, and various support personnel were present such as the three-man civilian train crew and a Marine sentry. Nine Navy {{officers and}} 29 armed guards watched over the procedure. A Coast Guard fire barge with a crew of five was docked at the pier. An officer who left the docks shortly after 10p.m. <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quinault′s propeller was slowly turning over and that the men of Division Three were having trouble pulling munitions from the rail cars {{because they had been}} packed so tightly.|$|E

5|$|While {{awaiting}} the first delivery of stone, Simson <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battlefield landscape features {{were beginning to}} deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.|$|E

Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, Serbian king Peter I wanted Tatiana as a bride for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E

5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, Baldwin <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Norwalk Seminary, {{located in}} Norwalk, Ohio, was {{dissolving}} {{due to lack}} of funds. He approached Thomas Thompson, who was the elder of the Norwalk District (which included Cleveland and Berea), and asked him to visit Berea. At Baldwin's Old Red House, an agreement was made where Baldwin would create a campus on his farm similar to the Norwalk Seminary. Baldwin Institute officially opened on April 9, 1846. It was meant to open in 1845, but the process was delayed until the completion of a building on Baldwin's farm, which was erected by Baldwin himself, made of stone quarried on his farm and brick made of clay. The institute was open to people of all races, male or female, as Baldwin wanted. It became Baldwin University and was given a charter in 1855. The university later became Baldwin–Wallace College in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Ranjith {{announced}} plans to produce a film for Aashirvad Cinemas, starring Mohanlal and Manju Warrier, which was scheduled for a 2014 release coinciding with the annual Vishu festival held in Kerala, India. Production was slated to begin in December 2013. The announcement of Loham received considerable media attention as it was Manju Warrier's return to the screen after leaving the film industry to marry actor Dileep. The media coverage was further heightened when Prithviraj Sukumaran joined the cast. However, the film was shelved soon after its official announcement. Ranjith explained it was dropped because the film's story resembled that of another film in the same language released during its pre-production time. It was Prithviraj who <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ending sequence of the planned script {{was similar to that}} of Thira (2013).|$|E

5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when he bent under the table to retrieve it <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house was on fire. He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
