5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, <b>no</b> <b>long-term</b> neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E
5|$|Immediate {{treatment}} with 100% oxygen, followed by recompression in a hyperbaric chamber, will {{in most cases}} result in <b>no</b> <b>long-term</b> effects. However, permanent long-term injury from DCS is possible. Three-month follow-ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS, and 7% from Type I DCS. Long-term follow-ups showed similar results, with 16% having permanent neurological sequelae.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{contained}} suggestive dialogue {{and the female}} cast wore revealing clothes, the production was considered highly risqué at the time. The script alluded to a contemporary scandal involving actor Fatty Arbuckle, and one scene featured actresses stripping {{as part of a}} card game. Reviewers generally panned the play as unfunny and vulgar, and local authorities attempted to censor it. A New York City magistrate ruled the Broadway production was obscene, and obscenity charges were brought against Woods, but a grand jury declined to indict him. The city's Commissioner of Licenses attempted to revoke the theater's license, but this effort was blocked in court. Woods promoted the controversy to increase ticket sales, and the play {{was one of the most}} successful of the season. It had <b>no</b> <b>long-term</b> literary impact and was never published, but it did stimulate arguments over censorship of theatrical performances.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. <b>No</b> <b>long-term</b> study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally <b>no</b> <b>long-term</b> pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

5|$|Abi {{moves to}} Albert Square {{with her parents}} Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), and sister Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan), where she befriends Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones). Abi is hit by Dean Wicks's (Matt Di Angelo) car, {{suffering}} a broken wrist, cuts and bruises, but she recovers with <b>no</b> <b>long-term</b> impairment. Abi later learns that Ben's father, Phil Mitchell's (Steve McFadden), girlfriend Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson) is abusing him, so due to this, Abi and Ben plan to run away, but fail as they are caught by their parents. Abi then stands up to Stella and tells Ben to do the same, leading Stella to kill herself when Ben reveals the abuse. In December 2007, she chooses the name for her newborn baby brother, Oscar. Soon after, when Max's affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) is revealed, Max and Tanya separate. Abi begins to live sporadically with each parent, frequently defending Max to Tanya and Lauren, until Max and Tanya reunite in 2009, however Abi leaves with Tanya after learning of Max's financial problems. In September 2009, Abi and Jordan Johnson (Michael-Joel David Stuart) find Jordan's mother Trina Johnson's (Sharon Duncan Brewster) body in the summerhouse at the allotments having been accidentally killed by Jordan's father, Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet).|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of August 16, 12hours before the storm arrived in St. Lucia, power outages began {{in some of the}} island's neighborhoods. The night saw heavy rains, 1.58in (40mm) at St. Lucia's Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane force winds peaked at 90mph (145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Saint Lucia's capital, Castries, was flooded by the storm surge which left boulders and fishing boats on the streets. One person drowned in Sarrot after being swept away by a rain-swollen river while trying to recover a cow. Hurricane Dean damaged the roofs of two of the island's hospitals, but no one was injured. Several other buildings were damaged, mostly on the island's northern coast which was most exposed to the hurricane. The Ministry of Education reported that 11 schools had sustained a combined total of EC$300,000 of damage, and nationwide damage to housing and buildings totaled EC$800,000. The Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities reported that most of the country's major infrastructure remained functional, and <b>no</b> <b>long-term</b> disruptions occurred.|$|E
5|$|Tragic {{though they}} were for the Byzantines at the time, the defeat at Anzen and the {{subsequent}} sack of Amorion were militarily of <b>no</b> <b>long-term</b> importance to the Empire, since the Abbasids failed {{to follow up on}} their success. They did, however, {{play a crucial role in}} discrediting iconoclasm, which had always relied on military success to maintain its validity. Shortly after Theophilos's sudden death in 842, the veneration of icons was restored as part of the Triumph of Orthodoxy throughout the Empire. The Battle of Anzen is also notable for illustrating the difficulties faced by the Byzantine military of the time against horse-archers, a remarkable change from the army of the 6th–7th centuries, when such skills formed a core part of Byzantine tactical doctrine. It is also remarkable for being the first confrontation of the middle Byzantine army with the Turkic nomads from Central Asia, whose descendants, the Seljuq Turks, would emerge as Byzantium's major antagonists from the mid-11th century on.|$|E
