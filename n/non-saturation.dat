40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{proliferation}} of broadband wireless services, {{it is of}} paramount importance to understand how fast data can be sent through a wireless local area network (WLAN). Thanks to a large body of research following the seminal work of Bianchi, WLAN throughput under saturated traffic condition has been well understood. By contrast, prior investigations on throughput performance under unsaturated traffic condition was largely based on phenomenological observations, which lead to a common misconception that WLAN can support a traffic load as high as saturation throughput, if not higher, under <b>non-saturation</b> condition. In this paper, we show through rigorous analysis that this misconception may result in unacceptable quality of service: mean packet delay and delay jitter may approach infinity even when the traffic load is far below the saturation throughput. Hence, saturation throughput is not a sound measure of WLAN capacity under <b>non-saturation</b> condition. To bridge the gap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and safe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network capacity users can enjoy when they require finite mean delay and delay jitter, respectively. Our earlier work proved that in a WLAN with multi-packet reception (MPR) capability, saturation throughput scales super-linearly with the MPR capability of the network. This paper extends the investigation to the <b>non-saturation</b> case and shows that super-linear scaling also holds for SBMD and SBDJ throughputs.

Both models extend, in a simple manner, the analysis for saturated stations with the decoupling approximation.

We extend the analysis of this model to calculate more accurately the throughput seen by a station in <b>non-saturation</b> conditions, by considering alternating ON/OFF periods. The second model uses this ON/OFF process structure for calculating attempt and collision probabilities, and subsequently performance measures, based on regenerative process theory. By comparison with simulation results, this model is shown {{to be more precise}} for low load conditions.
