5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered all}} the Muslim armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya. This maneuver gave a decisive blow to Heraclius' plan, as he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where the Muslim light cavalry could be effectively used against the heavy and less mobile Byzantine cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the Vietnam War {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because {{of opposition to}} United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to assist in making anti-war films.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Guillermo del Toro {{revealed}} he {{had been}} interested in directing the film, as the Japanese arc was his favorite Wolverine story.

Leopold I, <b>not</b> <b>wishing</b> to face the Turks alone, summoned the Imperial Diet in January 1663.|$|R

5|$|On 23 June, {{the ship}} was present when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an {{abortive}} attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.|$|E
5|$|Ross and Emily's {{marriage}} was originally planned to last, but Helen Baxendale did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> {{to remain in}} America while pregnant. The writers could not script a convincing story for why Emily would not be seen, despite being married to Ross, so Baxendale was written {{out in the next}} season, making only three cameo appearances after the season premiere.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Third Reich, Hess was {{nominated}} to serve again as a judge in Düsseldorf but declined, as he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to work alongside former colleagues who {{had been part of the}} Nazi judicial system.

5|$|Although Gregory had {{intended}} London {{to be the}} southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his episcopal see to London, and instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there. After Augustine's death in 604, Canterbury continued to {{be the site of}} the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have been that the Kentish king did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Although Jewish, Levi's {{family did}} not {{practise}} their religion, {{and were not}} part of the Jewish community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E
5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely {{for the sake of}} her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E

In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature, as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past. However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E
5|$|British Expeditionary Force {{commander}} General Douglas Haig and Second Army commander General Herbert Plumer both {{believed it}} necessary to expel the Germans from the captured positions.

Support was limited {{to a number of}} additional artillery units and an infantry brigade from the 20th (Light) Division. It was suggested that the next counterattack be carried out with the infantry available, with a particularly large emphasis placed on artillery.|$|E
