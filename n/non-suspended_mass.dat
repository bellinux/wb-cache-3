40|$|This {{paper will}} try to present some of the causes which resultin {{vibrations}} during the train movement. Vibrations originateat the contact point between the undercarriage and thetracks. Theoretical analysis has been done of determining thespectral density of the acceleration process - vibrations of thenon-suspended and suspended locomotive mass, and then thevibrations of diesel electric locomotive type Hi 2061 weremeasured in different morphological conditions and geometricalstate of the track at different speeds. Based on the correlationand spectral analysis of the measured accelerations- vibrations,conclusions can be made {{about the condition of}} the trackand of the <b>non-suspended</b> <b>mass</b> of the locomotive. It should bestressed that determining the nature of vibrations is in the functionof determining the system reliability. If it refers to the trainand track in exploitation, the life time can be predicted, i. e. theoverhaul can be planned, and if it refers to the development,then we can use the results as the basis to determine modificationsand improvements. The efficiency of applying fuzzy logic in controlling the trainride with various input variables has been presented, where specialemphasis is put on the input variable which provides uswith the data on vibrations parameter. The analysis of vibrationsacting on the system, and the processing of the vibrationsparameter and the use of fuzzy logic provide us with the possibilityof controlling the train power plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{motion of}} a railway vehicle {{on the rail}} running table is a forced {{oscillation}} with a forcing excitation (force), and damping expressed by a random, non-periodic function. The motion is described by formulas and it is illustrated through diagrams which have {{the form of a}} "signal". The railway vehicle has the Suspended (Sprung) and the Non Suspended (Unsprung) Masses. The track defects/ faults are the random excitation for the rolling wheels of the vehicle. In the case of the Sprung Masses of the vehicles, the forces resulting from the excitation (track defects) are not large and have small effect on the rolling of the wheel. In the case of the Unsprung Masses the forces resulting from the excitation (track defects) are large and have grate effect on the rolling of the wheel. The track, is simulated (with the observer situated on the wheel) as an elastic means with damping. The general equation that describes the problem is the second order differential equation of motion. In this paper the aforementioned equation is presented for the case of a railway vehicle rolling on a railway track and its solution is presented for the Unsprung (<b>Non-Suspended)</b> <b>Masses</b> of the vehicle that act directly on the track without the presence of any spring or damper...|$|R
40|$|The {{railway track}} is modeled as a {{continuous}} beam on elastic support. Train circulation is a random dynamic phenomenon and, according to the different frequencies of the loads it im-poses, there exists the corresponding response of track superstructure. At the moment when an axle passes from {{the location of a}} sleeper, a random dynamic load is applied on the sleeper. The theoretical approach for the estimation of the dynamic loading of a sleeper demands the analysis of the total load acting on the sleeper to individual component loadsactions, which, in general, can be divided into: • the static component of the load' and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper) • the dynamic component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper) The dynamic component of the load of the track depends on the mechanical properties (stiffness, damping) of the system "vehicle-track", and on the excitation caused by the vehicle's motion on the track. The response of the track to the aforementioned excitation results in the increase of the static loads on the superstructure. The dynamic load is primarily caused by the motion of the vehicle's <b>Non-Suspended</b> (unsprung) <b>Masses,</b> which are excited by track geometry defects, and, to a smaller degree, by the effect of the Suspended (sprung) Masses. In order to formulate the theoretical equations for the calculation of the dynamic component of the load, the statistical probability of exceeding the calculated load-in real conditions should be considered, so that the corresponding equations refer to the standard deviation (variance) of the load. In the present paper the dynamic component is investigated through the second order differential equation of motion of the Non Suspended Masses of the Vehicle and specifically the transient response of the reaction/ action on each support point (sleeper) of the rail. The case of a deformed or bent joint or welding is analyzed through the second order differential equation of motion and the solution is investigated...|$|R
