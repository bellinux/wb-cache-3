Bristol sleeve valve engines were used however during the post-war air transport boom, in the Vickers Viking and related military Varsity and Valetta, Airspeed Ambassador, used on BEA's European routes, and Handley Page Hermes (and related military Hastings), and Short Solent airliners and the Bristol Freighter and Superfreighter. The Centaurus was also used in the military Hawker Sea Fury, Blackburn Firebrand, Bristol Brigand and the Fairey Spearfish.

Up to that point, the single sleeve valve had won every contest against the poppet valve in comparison of power to displacement.

This results are a manifold increase in tool life. Relying on this knowledge, new surface layers for tools and components were systematically developed with the help of theoretical thermochemical models. On extrusion die tools the strain is very high due to the long contact time at a high temperature. For these tools a surface modification by molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), cobalt (Co) and vanadium (V) offers interesting combinations. For example, the additional alloying With Mo and vanadium carbide (VC) through alloying significantly increases the tool hardness retention, high temperature-hardness and hot wear resistance.

40|$|The {{paper was}} {{analyzes}} {{an application of}} vacuum equipment for heat and thermo-chemical treatment of aviation gear wheals, small bearings for aircraft equipment parts, and high strength stamps. The generalization of designed vacuum technologies of heat and thermo-chemical treatment results compared with traditional processes is accepted as objective of the paper. The practical use of vacuum processes (low pressure ones) has been first discussed {{in the specific context}} of the problem solution to design hardening technologies for critical parts from complex alloyed steels with exclusive operational properties. To solve this problem by traditional methods is impossible. The research techniques included the complex combination of experimental studies conducted using an industrial universal vacuum furnace of SECO/WARWICK S. A. company (Poland), and of metallographic exams and mechanic tests as well as of numerical simulations accomplished by original vacuum carburizing (nitrocarburizing) models. The study objects were as follows: a) steels containing chromium, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium, which were used for gear wheals. In particular, a precipitation-hardening steel 13 Kh 3 N 3 M 2 VFB was for the first time applied at carburized (nitrocarburized) condition; b) Steel 8 Kh 4 V 9 F 2, which was used for bearing rings; c) Steel Kh 12 MF, which was used for stamps. The following operation properties are critical for gears: high contact fatigue endurance on the pitch circle; high bending fatigue endurance on the gears tooth-root; wear resistance on entire surface. Designing the technological operating conditions is complicated due to need to combine high values of all these properties, which stipulate the little-compatible requirements for physical and phase composition of the diffusion layers. Due to the advantages of thermo-chemical vacuum processes in oxygen-free atmosphere, namely technological flexibility and high reproducibility, the aperiodic cycles of carburization and nitrocarburization have been developed to ensure the increase of shear strength by 30 %, of contact fatigue resistance by 50 % as compared with the gas processes results. The bearing rings operability is determined by high strength of both the surface and the core. These strength properties are provided owing to use of vacuum heat and thermo-chemical treatments, which enable us to obtain the thin nitrocarburized layers and produce the high-speed quenching in the gas flow. As the result of treatment we have obtained the surface strength at the level of 68 - 70 HRC and the strength of core at the level of 59 - 61 HRC. Using the vacuum heat treatment for stamps enables us to choose the high carbon steel instead of the medium-carbon alloyed tool steel subjected to <b>nitride</b> <b>hardening.</b> The high viscosity of core was achieved owing to the non-isothermal processes of heat treatment, which are extremely difficult for implementation using the usual thermal equipment. Excluding the long <b>nitride</b> <b>hardening</b> procedure results in twice reduced total time of process. Results of the study justify the extended introduction of vacuum technology of heat and thermochemical treatment instead of traditional and outdated processes. The paper shows that using the specific innovative technologies increases an efficiency of vacuum thermal and thermo-chemical treatment. Generalizing the fundamentally different examples for practical implementation of technological capabilities of thermal vacuum equipment allows us to come to conclusion that it is universal. The technological capabilities of vacuum technology for various applications of complex alloyed steels were shown providing a predetermined complex of properties for a specific product. It has been found {{that it is possible to}} develop the technology heat or thermo-chemical treatment in a low-pressure atmosphere for any steel, so that the potential of this material may be completely revealed. The use of the information technologies greatly intensifies the heat treatment process design. </p...|$|E

However, the hardnesses of many cobalt-base wear alloys are significantly lower than conventional PVD hard coatings, and mechanical support of the hard coating is a concern.

40|$|One {{potential}} {{approach for}} reducing the level of nuclear plant radiation exposure that results from activated cobalt wear debris {{is the use of}} a wear resistant coating. However, large differences in stiffness between a coating/substrate can result in high interfacial stresses that produce coating de-adhesion when a coated substrate is subjected to high stress wear contact. Scratch adhesion and indentation tests have been used to identify four promising coating processes [1, 2]: (1) the use of a thin Cr-nitride coating with a hard and less-stiff interlayer, (2) the use of a thick, multilayered Cr-nitride coating with graded layers, (3) use of the duplex approach, or <b>nitriding</b> to <b>harden</b> the material subsurface followed by application of a multilayered Cr-nitride coating, and (4) application of nitriding alone.

If {{the contact}} {{pressure}} between mating flanks of a gear set is increased, the {{lubricant film thickness}} in between is reduced to a level where the asperities of the flanks start to touch. This case where the surface roughness is of similar value as the EHD film thickness is called “mixed friction”. Due to the metallic contact of the asperities {{and the movement of}} the flanks with respect to each other, the flanks are damaged. The damaged flanks appear dull or greyish, hence the name “grey-staining” (or “Graufleckigkeit ” in German), see e. g. [4] or [1]. Micropitting are small cracks {{on the surface of the}} gears (as opposed to pitting, where the cracks form below the surface), which grow into the material.

40|$|Fatigue {{strength}} of mechanical components can be greatly enhanced by generating compressive residual stress, increasing the hardness {{and reducing the}} grain size. It {{is well known that}} while the use of mechanical treatments is able to generate an effective field of compressive residual stresses and, if severe parameters are used, to cause grain refinement, thermochemical treatments are able to increase the surface hardness. This justifies the interest in developing combined treatments, able to achieve all the just mentioned factors. In this study, the effect of combination of severe shot peening and nitriding on the fatigue limit of a low-alloy steel is investigated. Severe shot peening was conducted by using particular processing parameters to obtain ultra-fine/nano-structured surface layers. Micro-structural observation, micro-hardness, surface roughness and XRD measurement of residual stress were performed on single and hybrid surface treated specimens including nitrided, severely shot peened, nitrided plus severely shot peened and severely shot peened plus nitrided specimens. The fatigue limit of all series was experimentally determined and compared with the as-received specimens. Severe shot peening and Nitriding improved the fatigue limit by 11. 6 % and 51. 3 % respectively. Combination of severe shot peening and <b>nitriding</b> improved <b>hardening,</b> residual stress and nitrogen diffusion with respect to the single treatment.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{examines}} the effect of mean stress on the fatigue behaviour of very hard (Rockwell C 60) steels (AISI 8822, 8620, 9310, and cold-worked pre-stressing wire). In the mean stress tests, the minimum stress in the fatigue cycle was varied from test to test over a range from - 1200 MPa to a value approaching the true fracture stress of each material. The results are not adequately explained by current theories for the effect of mean stress on fatigue behaviour {{in the region of}} compressive mean stresses. All current theories suggest that the maximum stress at the fatigue limit decreases with decreasing minimum stress. The results of this study shows that instead of continuing to decrease with decreasing minimum stress the maximum stress at the fatigue limit remains constant indicating an insensitivity to the minimum stress in the fatigue cycle for minimum stresses below the value in a fully reversed fatigue test. The theory proposed by the author corrects this error by maintaining the maximum stress at the fatigue limit constant with decreasing minimum stress in the region of negative mean stresses. The results are of interest to designers of components in which high negative residual stresses are introduced into materials hardened by, for example, carburizing, <b>nitriding,</b> or induction <b>hardening</b> to improve the fatigue strength of components.

40|$|Intragranular {{chromium}} nitrides is {{a phenomenon}} with detrimental effects on material properties in superduplex stainless steels which have not received much attention. Precipitation of nitrides occurs when the ferritic phase becomes supersaturated with nitrogen and there is insufficient time during cooling for diffusion of nitrogen into austenite. Heat treatment was carried out at between 1060 &# 9702;C and 1160 &# 9702;C to study the materials susceptibility to nitride precipitation with varying heat treatment temperature, nitrogen content and microstructure. Microhardness tests and Charpy v-notch tests were also carried out to investigate the nitrides effect on material properties. No standard method of quantification of nitrides exist. A method of quantifying the precipitation based on area fraction of nitrides was therefore introduced. The results show an increased amount of nitride precipitation with increased heat treatment temperature. A coarse microstructure with a large austenite spacing was found to promote higher fractions of nitride precipitation while nitrogen content was found to affect the amount of precipitation in less extent.

Using the higher density <b>nitride</b> fuel <b>hardens</b> the neutron energy spectrum and results in higher breeding ratios. The state-of-the-art high conversion light water reactor, the Resource-renewable Boiling Water Reactor (RBWR), served as the template core upon which comparative studies between nitride and oxide fuels were performed. A 1 / 3 core reactor physics model was developed for the RBWR using the stochastic transport code MCNP. The code was coupled with a lumped channel thermal-hydraulics 5 -channel model for steady-state analyses. The depletion code MCODE, which links MCNP with ORIGEN, was used for all burnup calculations. Select physics parameters were calculated and {{with the exception of}} the void coefficients, agreed with reported data. The void coefficients of the coupled core were calculated to be slightly positive using two different methods (10 % power increase and 5 % flow reduction). The standard RBWR assembly designs, which use tight lattice hexagonal fuel rod arrays, with oxide fuel were then replaced with various nitride fuel assembly designs to determine the potential increase in breeding ratio, the potential to breed with pressurized water, and the potential to improve the critical power ratio with a wider pin pitch. Without changing the assembly geometry or discharge burnup, using nitride fuel resulted in a breeding ratio of 1. 14. Using single-phase liquid water, the nitride fuel RBWR assembly resulted in a conversion ratio of 1. 00. Another nitride fuel assembly design with boiling water maintained a 1. 04 breeding ratio while increasing the pitch-to-diameter ratio from 1. 13 to 1. 20. This modification increased the hot assembly critical power ratio from 1. 22 to 1. 36, as calculated using the Liu- 2007 correlation. A high-porosity nitride fuel is recommended for high burnup conditions, to accommodate the nitride fuel’s higher swelling and less favorable mechanical properties compared to the oxide fuel. The high porosity allows additional volume for pressure-induced densification, alleviating swelling and subsequent cladding strain. To predict the performance of high-porosity nitride fuel, fission gas and fuel behavior mechanistic models were developed for high burnup and low-temperature conditions. These models were validated with reported irradiation data and implemented, along with fuel material properties, into the steady-state fuel behavior code FRAPCON-EP.
