5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the completion of Astronomia Nova, most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the dating {{of events in the}} life of Jesus, and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of Helisaeus Roeslin.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the American Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E
5|$|After a 91-minute rain delay, the offenses {{fought back}} and forth, scoring run after run in an up-and-down affair in Philadelphia. Ryan Howard ended his home run drought, hitting his first round-tripper {{since the end}} of September. Chase Utley and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Phillies, while Carl Crawford and Dioner Navarro contributed a double each for the Rays. Philadelphia starter Jamie Moyer turned in his first strong {{performance}} of the post-season, allowing three runs over 6⅓ innings. His counterpart Matt Garza allowed four runs over six innings, but <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> factor in the decision. After the Rays tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a dribbling ground ball down the third base line to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E

5|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} {{after the}} 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, {{where the two}} drivers had an agreement that <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> get in each other's way to the first corner (cf. 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in Senna's way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, it was Prost this time that got away the better of the two; but Senna forced his way past Prost in the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement {{at the start of}} the race, leaving the Frenchman furious with Senna. Senna argued it was the restart. Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda, so he announced mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{subsequent}} French {{effort to reach}} Martinique, launched in February 1809 before news of the British invasion had reached Europe. Three ships {{of the line and}} two disarmed frigates were sent with soldiers and supplies towards the island, but learned of Villaret de Joyeuse's surrender in late March and instead took shelter in the Îles des Saintes, blockaded by Cochrane's squadron. On 14 April, Cochrane seized the Saintes and the French fled, the three ships of the line drawing away Cochrane's forces so that the frigates could slip away and reach Guadeloupe. During the ensuing Action of 14–17 April 1809, the French flagship Hautpoult was chased down and captured, but two escaped and the frigates reached Guadeloupe, although <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> ever return to France.|$|E
5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring {{from the top of the}} cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of the cage and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges {{through the pages of}} the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who was found to be receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” <b>Neither</b> <b>would</b> have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E

25|$|Tres Zapotes and {{eventually}} Cerro de las Mesas were the largest Epi-Olmec centers though <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> reach {{the size and}} importance of the great Olmec cities before them nor El Tajín after them.

25|$|Traffic {{started to}} increase, {{to the extent}} that a {{timetable}} for the transit of the Oxenhall tunnel had to be introduced in 1849. This was not always successful, as the Hereford Times carried articles in May 1851 about an incident in which boats travelling in opposite directions had met in the middle, and <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> give way. There was deadlock for a period of 58 hours.|$|E

25|$|Following {{their arrival}} at Halifax, {{it was found}} that the two {{submarines}} both need an engine overhaul and that <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> be available until mid-August 1918. However, the Admiralty insisted that the submarines be made ready for duty in Europe and ordered them to refuel and proceed to the Mediterranean Sea. Only after the Admiralty was informed of their dire condition did they rescind that order and then ordered them for use as coastal defence on the east coast.|$|E

25|$|The {{provision}} that Brandenburgian envoys {{were to be}} sent to the inauguration of subsequent Polish kings was followed until 1698, before Brandenburg-Prussia ceased to send delegations. The treaty of Bromberg was superseded by the Treaty of Warsaw (1773), which followed the First Partition of Poland in 1772. In Warsaw, the terms of Bromberg were cancelled, including the guarantees for the Catholic Church and the nobles, and the Polish crown renounced all rights on Lauenburg and Bütow Land, which accordingly was no longer a fief and <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> be inherited by the Polish king in case the Hohenzollern line became extinct.|$|E

25|$|Brentford and Waller were {{excellent}} strategists of the 17th century type, and <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> fight a pitched battle without {{every chance}} in his favour. Eventually on 29 June, the Royalists {{were successful in}} a series of minor fights about Cropredy Bridge. The result was, in accordance with continental custom, admitted to be an important victory, though Waller's main army drew off unharmed. In the meantime, on 15 June, Essex had relieved Lyme Regis and occupied Weymouth, and was preparing to go farther. The two rebel armies were now indeed separate. Waller had been left to do as best he could, and a worse fate was soon to overtake the cautious earl.|$|E
25|$|Several {{events leading}} up to TripeManía XVII put the {{participation}} of Jack Evans, Konnan and Silver King in question. The Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission had suspended both Evans and Konnan {{as a result of a}} backstage fight between the two and Juventud Guerrera and it looked like <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to appear at the show. While AAA kept promoting Evans as a participant the plans to have Konnan wrestle in the main event were changed early on, giving him a less active role on the show in case the Commission suspended him. The suspension was lifted on both wrestlers in the weeks leading up to Triplemanía XVII.|$|E
25|$|Minsky {{was working}} at the M.I.T. Lincoln Labs and {{published}} his work there; his paper was received for publishing in the Annals of Mathematics on August 15, 1960 but not published until November 1961. While receipt occurred a full year before the work of Melzak and Lambek was received and published (received, respectively, May and June 15, 1961 and published side-by-side September 1961). That (i) both were Canadians and published in the Canadian Mathematical Bulletin, (ii) <b>neither</b> <b>would</b> have had reference to Minsky's work because it was not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, but (iii) Melzak references Wang, and Lambek references Melzak, leads one to hypothesize that their work occurred simultaneously and independently.|$|E
