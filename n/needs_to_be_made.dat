5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E

In severe renal insufficiency (GFR<30), the EMB dose should be halved (or avoided altogether).

25|$|The dye {{molecules}} {{are quite}} small (nanometer sized), {{so in order}} to capture a reasonable amount of the incoming light the layer of dye molecules <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> fairly thick, much thicker than the molecules themselves. To address this problem, a nanomaterial is used as a scaffold to hold large numbers of the dye molecules in a 3-D matrix, increasing the number of molecules for any given surface area of cell. In existing designs, this scaffolding is provided by the semiconductor material, which serves double-duty.|$|E

Conversely, the evil choice can bring benefits, albeit {{at the expense of other}} civilizations or the player's own population. A neutral choice is also presented as a compromise. To keep the game's ethics uncontroversial, the choices are made very clear-cut.|$|E
25|$|Verbal {{morphology}} in Nobiin {{is subject}} to numerous morphophonological processes, including syllable contraction, vowel elision, and assimilation of all sorts and directions. A distinction <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> between the verbal base and the morphemes that follow. The majority of verbal bases in Nobiin end in a consonant (e.g. nèèr- ‘sleep’, kàb- ‘eat’, tíg- ‘follow’, fìyyí- ‘lie’); notable exceptions are júú- ‘go’ and níí- ‘drink’. Verbal bases are mono- or disyllabic. The verbal base carries one {{of three or four}} tonal patterns. The main verb carries person, number, tense, and aspect information.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinction}} <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{between the}} destruction of houses as an incidental effect of military necessity, the wanton destruction of houses during a military advance, and the deliberate targeting of houses during a military occupation. In the former case, it is commonplace for civilian homes {{to be used by}} armed forces as places of shelter or as firing positions. As a result, civilian dwellings become a legitimate military target and property damage is often inevitable as forces seek to expel their opponents from buildings. This can result in {{the destruction of}} houses on a massive scale as a side-effect of urban warfare. Following World War II, for instance, the United States occupation authorities in Germany found that 81 percent of all houses in the American Zone had been destroyed or damaged in the fighting.|$|E

[...] It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds, which, in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody. [...] Another criticism of having a joint legal custody arrangement {{is that it is a}} frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child's life (regardless of what the decree of joint legal custody states), which generally leads to conflict. Additionally, in a joint legal custody arrangement, if the parents of the children do not get along, this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> about their children, which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved, but also for the parents.|$|E
