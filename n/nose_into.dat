5|$|On February 7, 2016, the Florida Panthers' mascot, Stanley C Panther, {{blew his}} <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> a Terrible Towel, with the Pittsburgh Penguins down 0-2 with around 6 mins {{left in the}} 3rd period. After this, the Penguins then tied the game in regulation, and won it in overtime. According to Elias Sports Bureau, {{this was the first}} time in Pittsburgh Penguins {{franchise}} history that they have overcome a 2-0 deficit to win with 6 mins left in the game. Kris Letang scored the OT winner, and Sidney Crosby tied the game with the goaltender pulled late in regulation. The Panthers went on to lose in the first round of the playoffs while the Penguins went on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
25|$|A small {{flexible}} tube (nasogastric tube) may be inserted through the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the stomach to help decompress the dilated bowel. This tube is uncomfortable but does relieve the abdominal cramps, distention, and vomiting. Intravenous therapy is utilized and the urine output is monitored with a catheter in the bladder.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} may {{be treated}} conservatively or with surgery. Typically intravenous fluids are given, a tube is placed through the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the stomach to decompress the intestines, and pain medications are given. Antibiotics are often given. In small bowel obstruction about 25% require surgery. Complications may include sepsis, bowel ischemia, and bowel perforation.|$|E

Ní Mháille informed Elizabeth and her court that, in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was destroyed. Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as Ní Mháille spoke no English and Elizabeth spoke no Irish.|$|E
25|$|When the diver descends {{the ambient}} {{pressure}} rises {{and it becomes}} necessary to equalise the pressure inside the mask with the ambient pressure to avoid the barotrauma known as mask squeeze, This is done by blowing sufficient air out through the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the mask to relieve the pressure difference. This requires that the nose {{is included in the}} airspace of the diving mask. Equalisation during ascent is automatic as excess air easily leaks past the seal from inside.|$|E
25|$|Sturges {{took the}} screwball comedy {{format of the}} 1930s to another level, writing {{dialogue}} that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations. It {{is not uncommon for}} a Sturges character to deliver an exquisitely turned phrase and take an elaborate pratfall within the same scene. A tender love scene between Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck in The Lady Eve was enlivened by a horse, which repeatedly poked its <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> Fonda's head.|$|E

25|$|In the midline of the nose, the septum is a {{composite}} (osseo-cartilaginous) structure that divides the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> two (2) similar halves. The lateral nasal wall and the paranasal sinuses, the superior concha, the middle concha, and the inferior concha, form the corresponding passages, the superior meatus, the middle meatus, and the inferior meatus, on the lateral nasal wall. The superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid bone cells and the sphenoid sinus; the middle meatus provides drainage for the anterior ethmoid sinuses and for the maxillary and frontal sinuses; and the inferior meatus provides drainage for the nasolacrimal duct.|$|E
25|$|Early model diving masks had {{a single}} {{elliptical}} pane of glass. These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom {{on either side of}} the <b>nose,</b> <b>into</b> which the diver can insert a thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.|$|E
25|$|A {{half mask}} is not {{directly}} connected to the scuba air supply. the only available source of air to displace {{the water in the}} case of a leak or flood is through the diver's nose. The procedure involves exhaling through the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the mask until the water has all been displaced by air. During this process, the air must be prevented from escaping at a high point, or the water will not be expelled. If the mask does not fit in such a way that this happens automatically, it must be sealed at the high point by the diver pressing it against the face.|$|E

60|$|Early as I was, {{the wood}} folk were ahead of me. Their tracks were everywhere, eager, hungry tracks, that poked their <b>noses</b> <b>into</b> every {{possible}} hiding place of food or game, showing how the two-days' fast had whetted their appetites {{and set them}} to running keenly the moment the last flakes were down and the storm truce ended.|$|R
25|$|The human nose is a sensory organ that is {{structurally}} {{composed of}} {{three types of}} tissue: (i) an osseo-cartilaginous support framework (nasal skeleton), (ii) a mucous membrane lining, and (iii) an external skin. The anatomic topography of the human nose is a graceful blend of convexities, curves, and depressions, the contours of which show the underlying shape of the nasal skeleton. Hence, these anatomic characteristics permit dividing the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> nasal subunits: (i) the midline (ii) the nose-tip, (iii) the dorsum, (iv) the soft triangles, (v) the alar lobules, and (vi) the lateral walls. Surgically, {{the borders of the}} nasal subunits are ideal locations for the scars, whereby is produced a superior aesthetic outcome, a corrected nose with corresponding skin colors and skin textures.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} nasal defects and deformities divides the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> six (6) anatomic subunits: (i) the dorsum, (ii) the sidewalls (paired), (iii) the hemilobules (paired), (iv) the soft triangles (paired), (v) the alae (paired), and (vi) the columella. Surgical correction and reconstruction comprehend the entire anatomic subunit {{affected by the}} defect (wound) or deformity, thus, the entire subunit is corrected, especially when the resection (cutting) of the defect encompasses more than 50 per cent of the subunit. Aesthetically, the nose—from the nasion (the midpoint of the nasofrontal junction) to the columella-labial junction—ideally occupies one-third of the vertical dimension of the person’s face; and, from ala to ala, it ideally should occupy one-fifth of the horizontal dimension of the person's face.|$|E
25|$|Smelt-whitings {{are a major}} link in {{the food}} chain of most systems, and {{frequently}} fall prey {{to a variety of}} aquatic and aerial predators. Their main aquatic predators are a wide variety of larger fish, including both teleosts and a variety of sharks and rays. Marine mammals including seals and dolphins have been reported to have taken sillaginids as a main food source. Seabirds are also another major predator of the family, with diving species such as Cormorants taking older fish in deeper waters while juvenile fish in shallow water fall prey to wading birds. Sillaginids are often called 'sandborers' due to their habit of burying themselves in the substrate to avoid predators, much {{in the same way as}} they forage, by ploughing their <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the substrate. This defense is even used against human fishermen, who frequently wade barefoot to feel for buried fish. The Sillaginidae are also host to a variety of well studied internal and external parasites, which are represented prominently by the groups Digenea, Monogenea and Myxosporea, Copepoda and Nematoda.|$|E

This other family, The Dumps, consisted of a trailer trash entrepreneur father; Bernie, his conniving daughter Harmony, and his annoying nephew Darren. The Dumps would often try to use the events that fell upon the Mellops for their own selfish gain.|$|R

2500|$|The {{production}} team {{consisted of a}} large group of make-up artists and costume designers who worked to recreate the Maya look for the large cast. Led by Aldo Signoretti, the make-up artists daily applied the required tattoos, scarification, and earlobe extensions to all of the on-screen actors. According to advisor Richard D. Hansen, the choices in body make-up were based on both artistic license and fact: [...] "I spent hours and hours going through the pottery and the images looking for tattoos. The scarification and tattooing was all researched, the inlaid jade teeth are in there, the ear spools are in there. There is a little doohickey that comes down from the ear through the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the septum – that was entirely their artistic innovation." [...] An example of attention to detail is the left arm tattoo of Seven, Jaguar Paw's wife, which is a horizontal band with two dots above – the Mayan symbol for the number seven.|$|E

50|$|Operations of the RB-47H and ERB-47H {{were often}} {{classified}} Top Secret, with the ten-hour missions generally flown at night.

This reply was often believed.|$|R
2500|$|The skirt {{material}} may {{be almost}} transparent, translucent or opaque. A nearly transparent skirt provides a greater peripheral vision, though somewhat distorted, and {{may reduce the}} feeling of claustrophobia in some divers, {{but in some cases}} the light entering through the sides may cause distracting internal reflections. The skirt also encloses the nose, usually by means of a nose pocket, so that air can be exhaled through the <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the mask to equalise the internal pressure during descent and thereby avoid possible barotrauma of the enclosed area of the face. [...] The section of the mask covering the nose must allow the wearer to block the nostrils while equalising pressure in the middle ear. All diving masks have means to keep them in position, usually an elastomer strap of similar material to the skirt, but occasionally an expanded neoprene pad with velcro straps is used. Mask straps are usually wider at the back or split into an upper and lower strap {{at the back of the}} head for stability and comfort.|$|E
2500|$|Former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his 1990 book By Way of Deception, {{has accused}} the Mossad of knowing the {{specific}} time {{and location of}} the bombing, but only gave general information to the Americans of the attack, information which was worthless. According to Ostrovsky, then Mossad head Nahum Admoni decided against giving the specific details to the Americans {{on the grounds that}} the Mossad's responsibility was to protect Israel's interests, not Americans. Admoni denied having any prior knowledge of the attack. Ostrovsky further claimed that among the high level officers of the Mossad there was a view that if the Americans [...] "wanted to stick their <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> this Lebanon thing, let them pay the price." [...] Benny Morris, in his review of Ostrovsky's book, wrote that Ostrovsky was [...] "barely a case officer before he was fired; most of his (brief) time in the agency was spent as a trainee" [...] adding that due to compartmentalization [...] "he did not and could not have had much knowledge of then current Mossad operations, let alone operational history." [...] Benny Morris wrote that the claim regarding the barracks was [...] "odd" [...] and an example of one of Ostrovsky's [...] "wet" [...] stories which were [...] "mostly fabricated." ...|$|E
2500|$|L’Express Flight 508 was {{operated}} with a Beech C99 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. Seating on {{the plane}} was five rows of two seats, {{one on each side}} of a central aisle. A single seat was located across from the left passenger loading door and a double seat {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. Passengers boarded through the rear passenger door. The flight left New Orleans, LA with one passenger, at 4:05 pm CDT, landing in Mobile, AL, at 4:50 pm CDT. After changing crews and boarding 12 passengers, the flight departed for Birmingham Municipal Airport at 5:05 pm CDT. As the flight approached Birmingham, strong thunderstorms developed in the vicinity of the airport. Around the same time four other aircraft either diverted to other airports or delayed their approach and entered a holding pattern until the weather improved. The crew of Flight 508 was aware of the thunderstorm activity but elected to continue the approach. Francis Fernandes, the L'Express captain at the controls of Flight 508, later said the plane experienced a [...] "significant roll to the left" [...] on landing approach. Fernandes told investigators that while he and the first officer tried to level the aircraft, it experienced an [...] "extreme updraft" [...] that pushed the plane's <b>nose</b> <b>into</b> the air. After entering a severe thunderstorm cell southwest of the airport, the crew lost directional control and was unable to recover the aircraft prior to impacting two houses in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham at 6:11:27 pm CDT. The airplane struck one home, crossed a tree lined residential street, and slammed into a second home, immediately erupting into flames. The lone surviving passenger was encountered in the home by the residents before all fled the burning home. The captain was taken to UAB Hospital, passenger Mabry Rogers to Carraway Methodist Medical Center, and three residents to Baptist Princeton. Twelve passengers and the first officer perished in the crash; the captain, one passenger, and four residents were injured.|$|E
