40|$|Effective coastal risk {{management}} often involves {{the selection and}} appraisal of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures. Such measures, however, are rarely implemented in isolation and their (inter) dependencies {{need to be considered}} to assess the overall contribution to risk reduction. This paper presents a framework that utilises a pathway-based approach to consider such (inter) dependencies. The framework identifies measures that have the potential to directly influence risk reduction (primary measures) at the individual/household level and how these relate to the implementation of other measures (non-primary). These two types of measures are linked using intermediate pathway factors, which aggregate to the effective uptake and/or operation of primary measure(s) and subsequently represent the direct influence on risk reduction when included in a risk assessment. The approach is demonstrated utilising two coastal risk examples. The case of Varna Bay, Bulgaria highlights a pathway, which explores how developing a coastal Early Warning System (EWS), can enable assets to be moved and saved prior to an event. The Praia de Faro, Portuguese application provides an example of how local risk awareness meetings can support the uptake of property raising to protect against erosion. Past experience, poor trust in authorities, house type/ feasibility, transient population and strong community networks are identified as key influencing variables across both cases. The process of considering the (inter) dependencies between measures has potential to lead to improved decision-making and strategy building. The framework developed is flexible in nature and can be applied in many different situations; however, it is one step towards accounting for these (inter) dependencies at the individual/household level. Ex-ante or ex-post survey data, expert judgement and literature have been used to estimate these factors. However, in many cases this good quality data is not available, and is something that <b>national</b> <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> strategies, along with the research community, must address...|$|E

UNISDR - in collaboration with leading experts in related fields - is developing a proposal for new system of DRM indicators, which will contribute to discussions on HFA 2 and WCDRR. This initiative follows the fourth session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, held in May 2013 in which 3, 500 participants from 172 countries called for an immediate start of work to be led by the UNISDR to develop targets and indicators to monitor the reduction of risk and the implementation of HFA 2. The successor framework will address the challenges posed by increasing disaster risk. The development of effective monitoring system is crucial for building a successful post 2015 framework. The indicator system not only informs the need for continued monitoring on the key remaining issues of the HFA implementation, including the priority area of action 4 (reducing underlying risk factors), it will fundamentally shape the way international community understands and interprets the key challenges of disaster risk management agendas over the next 20 - 30 years. Also, the <b>national</b> <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> framework will likely inform local and community level DRM interventions, influencing the way we operationalize concepts such as disaster risk, vulnerability, resilience and its linkages with climate change and development goals. As the WCRR coincides with other important milestones of development and climate change agendas including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Post-Kyoto framework for climate change mitigation and adaptation, finding a holistic yet focused and manageable set of indicators - or what some refer to as the Holy Grail - has been a key focus of discussion surrounding the development of new monitoring system...|$|E

40|$|The {{health and}} {{productivity}} of global land resources are declining, while demand for those resources is increasing. The aim of land degradation neutrality (LDN) {{is to maintain}} or enhance land-based natural capital and its associated ecosystem services. The Scientific Conceptual Framework for Land Degradation Neutrality has been developed to provide a scientific approach to planning, implementing and monitoring LDN. The Science-Policy Interface of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) led {{the development of the}} conceptual framework, drawing in expertise from a diverse range of disciplines. The LDN conceptual framework focuses on the supporting processes required to deliver LDN, including biophysical and socio-economic aspects, and their interactions. Neutrality implies no net loss of the land-based natural capital relative to a reference state, or baseline. Planning for neutrality involves projecting the likely cumulative impacts of land use and land management decisions, then counterbalancing anticipated losses with measures to achieve equivalent gains. Counterbalancing should occur only within individual land types, distinguished by land potential, to ensure “like for like” exchanges. Actions to achieve LDN include sustainable land management (SLM) practices that avoid or reduce degradation, coupled with efforts to reverse degradation through restoration or rehabilitation of degraded land. The response hierarchy of Avoid > Reduce > Reverse land degradation articulates the priorities in planning LDN interventions. The implementation of LDN is managed at the landscape level through integrated land use planning, while achievement is assessed at <b>national</b> <b>level.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> LDN status involves quantifying the balance between the area of gains (significant positive changes in LDN indicators) and area of losses (significant negative changes in LDN indicators), within each land type across the landscape. The LDN indicators (and associated metrics) are land cover (physical land cover class), land productivity (net primary productivity, NPP) and carbon stocks (soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks). The LDN conceptual framework comprises five modules: A: Vision of LDN describes the intended outcome of LDN; B: Frame of Reference clarifies the LDN baseline; C: Mechanism for Neutrality explains the counterbalancing mechanism; D: Achieving Neutrality presents the theory of change (logic model) articulating the impact pathway; and E: Monitoring Neutrality presents the LDN indicators.

40|$|Linnell, J. D. C. 2005. Spatial {{aspects of}} {{managing}} {{natural resources and}} conserving biodiversity. Integrating the global and the local - NINA Report 62. 38 pp. The issue of scale has recently attracted much importance in ecology. It is also of crucial importance {{in the context of}} managing nature. The question that constantly appears is ·at what level should we manage our natural resources?" From {{the point of view of}} the social sciences, there is a trend to move resource management to the local level, to satisfy objectives such as the desire for social equity, social justice and local empowerment. However, from the point of view of ecology, the recent development of ecosystem thinking calls for management to be moved up to larger spatial scales such that holism can be maintained. This apparent contradiction of the "local ecosystem" is actually imbedded in the Convention on Biological Diversity's Malawi principles. Finding ways to include both the local and the global is clearly a key need for improving natural resource management. The first part of the report presents some concrete analyses where the importance of scale issues for Norwegian natural resource management is highlighted. The examples include (1) an analysis of the various spatial scales at which ecological processes operate, (2) using data on movement of radiocollared lynx to improve <b>national</b> <b>level</b> <b>monitoring,</b> (3) using data on wolf dispersal and Baltic sea ice conditions to explore the potential for wolves having re-colonised Scandinavia from Finland on their own, (4) drawing up principles for the spatial aspects of planning large carnivore recovery in Norway that combine both ecological. administrative and social aspects. and (5) a set of analyses to see to what extent scale varies within and between species, and the identification of ways of predicting scale. The main message from this section is that all scales need to be considered. At least when it comes to large carnivores, where each individual uses several municipalities, "local" management must be considered on scale of 10 s or 100 s of square kilometres. The second part of the report is a review of the scientific literature dealing with the issues of scale and resource management from the viewpoints of many different disciplines. We firstly look at the experience with community based conservation. various decentralization or devolution projects, and co-management systems especially those that nave Men conducted in tropical countries and the arctic. The experiences from these attempts to pass greater resource management responsibility to the local level are mixed. Many of those from tropical countries are negative, with the comanagement tradition from the arctic offering the most optimistic outcomes. Problems with lack of capacity, elite capture, and corruption often led to a decline in the sustainability of resource use. and often a decrease in equity as well. Secondly, we examined the literature dealing with democracy and environmental justice. which provided many insights into the issue of scale, NIMBYism (Not In My Back Yard) and decision making within the context of public goods and local costs. Again, the experience at the local level is poor. especially when the costs and benefits of resource conservation are felt at different scales. Thirdly we look at some of the characteristics of different resources in light of how suitable they might be for more local - or less local - level management. and develop some guiding principles. Finally, we attempted to gather these various inputs together and come up with a conceptual framework for future thinking. It is apparent that resource management cannot be conducted at a single scale - be it local or national or global or someplace in between. There is a need to consider all scales - with different decisions being appropriate for different scales. Management should be viewed as a nested hierarchy, where upper levels set general frameworKs of guidelines and principles, and the lower levels make increasingly detailed, and locally adapted, decisions. within the framework set by the upper levels. This approach shOuld in principle allow "freedom within limits", and follows the principle of subsidarity. The challenge for the future is to ensure the effective coordination of management at multiple scales and to ensure democratic representation of the lower (local) levels in the upper level decision making processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this PhD is to {{demonstrate}} how routinely collected de-identified patient information {{can be used for}} basic science, clinical science and population science health research. Examples are provided on how routinely collected information from people living with HIV- 1 (PLHIV) can provide strategic health information, enabling stakeholders to develop and implement strategies to improve the use, cost, outcome and impact of HIV- 1 service provision. As more PLHIV are on combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), the increasing number of PLHIV requiring long-term use of health services has long-term resource implications. De-identified personal information that are systematically collected and analysed can provide information to monitor and evaluate the use, cost, outcome and impact of HIV- 1 service provision. The basic science study identified PLHIV who were long-term non-progressors and HIV controllers managed in a HIV referral centre and determined factors that contributed to their atypical prolonged asymptomatic infection. The clinical science study assessed the impact of HIV- 1 infection, cART and age on renal insufficiency in PLHIV managed at the referral centre. The population science study used information from an established national multicentre prospective monitoring system to report changing use and population cost of HIV- 1 services in the UK, and estimated future population costs arising from projected increases in the number of PLHIV using NHS services. Despite recognised problems associated with observational data, the utility of de-identified personal information for such research was demonstrated. Personal health information needs to be collected longitudinally to ensure development of good electronic medical records nationally and globally requiring appropriate information technology aswell as analytic expertise.
