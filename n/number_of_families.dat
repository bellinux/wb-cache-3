40|$|Melamine {{is a new}} risk of urinary stones. Gansu {{province}} is {{a heavily}} affected area and has large population and underdeveloped economy. We hypothesized that <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members and family income may play significant roles {{in the formation of}} urinary stones. A case-control study was performed among 190 infants. Results showed that the case group had less <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members than the control (4. 4 vs. 5. 6, respectively). The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members was an independent influencing factor associated with urinary stones (OR, 0. 606; 95 % CI, 0. 411 - 0. 893; P = 0. 011). Family income, however, did not exhibit a significant difference. Observed results suggested that <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members was a new and significant influencing factor to affect the risk of melamine-associated urinary stones...|$|R

5|$|The {{population}} of the entire municipality grew only 1% between 1981 and 1991, then increased by 15.3% between 1991 and 2001. During that period, the urban population had grown 23%, with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>families</b> increasing considerably — by about 44.5%. The quality of living, the infrastructure development such as the light rail metro and a 15 minutes distance from Porto and Braga, prompted new residents originating from near-by cities such as Guimarães, Famalicão, Braga and Porto {{which led to a}} real estate development that may double the resident population in the medium term.|$|E

5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities, school fees and household expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>families</b> having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E

30|$|According to Hansen and Jensen (2005), {{the family}} {{reconstruction}} {{is considered to}} be significant if the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>families</b> reconstructed from the simulated genotypes were higher than those constructed from original genotype data. Reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>families</b> involving simulated unrelated individuals, based on the allele frequencies of the respective samples, confirmed that much higher <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>families</b> that include fewer individuals would be expected as compared to the real samples. For instance, the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individuals within a full-sib family in the simulated Halda river (HR) sample was two (Fig.  2 b), whereas two full-sib families in the real Halda sample consisted of five and ten individuals (Fig.  2 a). Similar trend was also observed in the Jamuna and Padma samples. The low <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>families</b> found in the real hatchery samples were not due to random grouping of individuals, but should be considered significant (Hansen and Jensen 2005). In a similar study, Hansen et al. (2006) reported fewer <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> half- and full-sib families in hatchery samples compared to the river counterparts in Catla catla.|$|R
