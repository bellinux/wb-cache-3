5|$|He became {{widely known}} for his outspoken lectures against war profiteering, U.S. {{military}} adventurism, and what he viewed as <b>nascent</b> fascism in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The publication, {{along with}} Die Deborah, a German-language {{supplement}} that Wise started the following year, soon attracted a large circulation and was influential {{in helping the}} <b>nascent</b> Reform movement spread throughout North America.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{catered to}} gay people, the bar became a {{flashpoint}} for the <b>nascent</b> homophile movement. The Black Cat {{was at the}} center of a legal fight that was one of the earliest court cases to establish legal protections for gay people in the United States. Despite this victory, continued pressure from law enforcement agencies eventually forced the bar's closure in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Comprising the <b>nascent</b> {{motion picture}} genres of horror and science fiction, the {{nightmare}} picture provoked individual psychological terror in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological terror in its science fiction manifestations. The two main types of pre-Code horror pictures were the single monster movie, and films where masses of hideous beasts rose up and attacked their putative betters. Frankenstein and Freaks exemplified both genres.|$|E
5|$|During the August 2009 summer congressional recess, {{many members}} {{went back to}} their districts and held town hall {{meetings}} on the proposals. The <b>nascent</b> Tea Party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals attended the meetings to oppose the proposed reforms. Many threats were made against members of Congress {{over the course of the}} debate.|$|E
5|$|In Petrograd, {{the work}} of {{beginning}} publication was assisted by the <b>nascent</b> Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda Union, and the new paper bolstered the city's indigenous anarcho-syndicalist movement. Its editorial staff included Maksim Rayevsky, Vladimir Shatov (the linotype operator), Volin, Gregori Maksimov, Alexander Schapiro, and Vasya Swieda.|$|E
5|$|Khalid then {{crushed the}} most {{powerful}} threat to the <b>nascent</b> Islamic state of Medina: Musaylimah, a claimant to prophethood, who had already defeated two Muslim armies. In {{the third week of}} December 632, Khalid won a decisive victory against Musaylimah at the Battle of Yamama. Musaylimah died in the battle, and nearly all resistance from rebelling tribes collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Octopus uses a nonstandard {{system for}} RFID {{instead of the}} more popular ISO/IEC 14443 {{standards}}, since there were no standards in the <b>nascent</b> industry during its development in 1997. The operating range of the reader/writer is between 30 and 100mm (1.18 and 3.94in) {{depending on the type of}} model being used.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any <b>nascent</b> pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional <b>nascent</b> transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{recognized}} {{legacy of the}} 1966 smog was the political reaction to it, which galvanized the <b>nascent</b> environmental movement in the United States and prompted demand for sweeping air-pollution control laws. The smog has been remembered for various purposes by scientists, historians, journalists, writers, artists, activists, and political commentators.|$|E
5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of the <b>nascent</b> Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I. As a result, the veracity of Theophanes's account has been questioned by recent scholarship, which places more emphasis on the Arabic and Syriac sources.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any <b>nascent</b> geysers.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's <b>nascent</b> plans for the Church.|$|E
5|$|According to Teeuw, {{after the}} {{publication}} of Atheis Mihardja immediately became famous. Maier notes that the fame and warm reception to which Atheis was released was influenced not only by the novel's strengths, but also by Mihardja's personality and stature. These qualities were in-line with the <b>nascent</b> government's need to use literature, as the most developed of the new national culture, for nation-building; in 1969, Atheis received a literary award from the government of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|After the {{government}} ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu {{in the fall}} of 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu Bears. After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League. By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, drawing the United States into World War II and ending Robinson's <b>nascent</b> football career.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their ideologies in more detail, but literary figures {{and many in}} the general public praised it; this positive reception may {{have been influenced by}} the <b>nascent</b> government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E
5|$|Assay Commission medals {{were struck}} {{from a variety}} of metals, {{including}} copper, silver, bronze, and pewter. The first Assay Commission medals were struck in 1860 at the direction of Mint Director James Ross Snowden. The initial purpose in having medals struck was not principally to provide keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's medal-striking capabilities. The <b>nascent</b> custom lapsed when Snowden left office in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and {{is different from}} the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a <b>nascent</b> stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity to those found in the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to those found in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E
5|$|Hartono is Tini's lover from university; he {{was also}} Tono's friend. After hearing that Tini enjoys partying, he {{approaches}} her and they begin dating. After they have sex, he breaks off their relationship through a letter. He then drops out of university and becomes involved with the <b>nascent</b> nationalist movement, following future-president Sukarno; these acts cause his family to disown him. He later comes to Batavia to search for Tono and is {{surprised to find that}} Tini has married the doctor. Hartono asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He then goes to Surabaya.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry {{was aware that}} native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the <b>nascent</b> kakapo population within 6 years.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Australian Air Board {{prepared}} to form its first five squadrons and allocate aircraft to each, {{as well as}} to the <b>nascent</b> flying school. The plan was for No.1 FTS to receive twelve Avro 504Ks and four Sopwith Pups, and the squadrons a total of eight Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, eight Airco DH.9s, and three Fairey IIIs. Funding problems forced the Air Force to disband the newly raised squadrons on 1July 1922 and re-form them as flights in a composite squadron under No.1 FTS. The same month, Flight Lieutenant Frank McNamara, VC, took command of the school.|$|E
5|$|In June 2003 Wikipedia was {{transferred}} to a <b>nascent</b> non-profit organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, which was formed as a charitable institution to supervise Wikipedia and its associated wiki-based sites. When the foundation was established, its staff began to solicit public funding and Bomis turned Wikipedia over to the non-profit. All Bomis-owned hardware used to run Wikipedia-associated websites was donated to the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wales transferred Wikipedia-related copyrights from Bomis to the foundation. It was first headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, where Bomis was located. The foundation shifted Wikipedia's dependence away from Bomis, allowing it to purchase hardware for expansion.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, Obama asked Lu {{to begin}} {{planning}} for a possible presidential transition. Obama warned him to tell no one about the <b>nascent</b> operation, even his own wife, so Lu quietly rented a small office in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked on previous Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced policy options {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential political appointees for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US all began design work on {{a new generation of}} ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation's navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling. This <b>nascent</b> arms race was prevented by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers. The German navy was not represented at the talks; {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Versailles, Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{independence}} in 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia established a national army {{to defend the}} <b>nascent</b> Somali Republic's borders. A law to that effect was passed on 6 April 1960. Thus the Somali Police Force's Mobile Group (Darawishta Poliska or Darawishta) was formed. 12 April 1960 has since been marked as Armed Forces Day. British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later. On 1 July 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic.|$|E
5|$|Mysts effects {{extended}} {{to those who}} played the games and technology. The title was widely credited {{as one of the}} first games to appeal not just to hardcore gamers but to casual players and demographics that generally did not play games, such as women. Mysts lack of conventional game elementsviolence, dying, and failureappealed to nongamers and those contemplating buying a computer. The Millers' decision to develop Myst for the <b>nascent</b> CD-ROM format helped boost interest and adoption of disc drives.|$|E
5|$|Norte Chico {{sites are}} notable for {{exceptional}} collective density, {{as well as}} individual size. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a <b>nascent</b> civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the end of the war, the Republic of South Maluku (RMS) {{declared}} its independence from the <b>nascent</b> Indonesia. Rijadi was sent to the frontline on 10 July 1950 as part of Operation Senopati. To retake the island of Ambon, Rijadi took half his forces and invaded the eastern shores, while the other half was tasked with invading from the northern coast. Although the second group experienced heavy resistance, Rijadi's group was able to take to the beach in native canoes unopposed; they later landed more infantry and armour.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a {{small village}} of little {{importance}} until 1958, when it {{was chosen as the}} capital of the <b>nascent</b> nation of Mauritania. It was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people, but droughts and increasing desertification since the 1970s have displaced a vast number of Mauritanians who resettled in Nouakchott. This caused massive urban growth and overcrowding, with the city having an official population of just under a million as of 2013. The resettled population inhabited slum areas under poor conditions, but the living conditions of a portion of these inhabitants have since been ameliorated.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 1966, {{shortly after}} Singapore's independence, the President of Singapore {{appointed}} a Constitutional Commission helmed by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin {{to consider how}} the rights of racial, linguistic, and religious minorities in the <b>nascent</b> nation should be protected. Singapore had just been ejected from Malaysia, and had experienced {{an extended period of}} racial and religious tension resulting from the Maria Hertogh riots. This experience reinforced the need for a multiracial society based on equality among races.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1894, {{the mine}} owners began {{implementing}} the 10-hour day. Union president John Calderwood issued a notice {{a week later}} demanding that the mine owners reinstate the eight-hour day at the $3.00 wage. When the owners did not respond, the <b>nascent</b> union struck on February 7. Portland, Pikes Peak, Gold Dollar and a few smaller mines immediately agreed to the eight-hour day and remained open, but larger mines held out.|$|E
5|$|Open {{heart surgery}} in India {{was at a}} <b>nascent</b> stage in the 1970s and early 1980s. After Panday {{returned}} to India from Canada, he joined the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM), in which he performed hundreds of open heart surgeries. The hospital was run on a government grant and generally catered {{to the middle class}} and poor, as the surgery was at the cost of the government. The hospital was {{one of the very few}} places in India where heart surgery was performed. Panday was the chief of the second unit at KEM.|$|E
5|$|Pahing, who {{had grown}} up within the <b>nascent</b> {{independence}} movement and associated with several historical figures, was arrested for being half-Dutch by the Japanese spy Maruyama (Verdi Solaiman)– a man who coveted Pahing's wife. After being tortured, Pahing was released to discover that his wife had been raped and killed; their newborn son Fajar had been kidnapped. Pahing later died on a flight carrying medical supplies over Yogyakarta when the flight was shot down. Meanwhile, his son was raised by Maruyama– the kidnapper– and had his name changed to Dasaad Muchlisin.|$|E
5|$|Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its <b>nascent</b> form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{he got a}} job distributing newspapers. This respectable work {{required}} {{getting up}} at 6 a.m., not good for a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden's <b>nascent</b> Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to urge them to bring their troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|Rights to {{the film}} {{adaptation}} were purchased for $100. Like the theatrical adaptation, Mary Asquith's screenplay removed much of the book's controversial sexual elements, censorship intended to make Fox's <b>nascent</b> studio appear more respectable to the industry. Fox selected J. Gordon Edwards to direct, in {{what may have been}} his directorial debut; credit for the earlier St. Elmo is disputed, with sources disagreeing whether Edwards or Bertram Bracken directed.|$|E
