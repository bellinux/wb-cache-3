40|$|Background: Studies have {{individually}} {{reported the}} relationship of age, cardiac risk factors, and history of preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD) for predicting acute coronary syndromes in chest pain patients undergoing cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> In this study, we investigate the interplay of all these factors on the incidence of acute coronary syndromes to develop a tool that may assist physicians {{in the selection of}} appropriate chest pain patients for <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired database of consecutive chest pain patients undergoing <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to develop a model for predicting risk of 30 -day acute coronary events (ACE) using information obtained from age, sex, cardiac risk factors, and history of preexisting CAD. Results: A total of 800 chest pain patients underwent <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> ACE occurred in 74 patients (9. 3 %). Logistic regression analysis found only 6 factors predictive of ACE: age, male sex, preexisting CAD, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of this model for predicting ACE was 0. 767 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 719 – 0. 815). There were no cases of ACE in the 173 patients with predicted probability estimates ≤ 2. 5 % (95 % confidence interval, 0 %– 2. 1 %).

40|$|Background—We {{sought to}} {{determine}} inter-rater reliability of the 2009 Appropriate Use Criteria for radionuclide imaging and whether physicians at various levels of training can effectively identify <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> with inappropriate indications. Methods and Results—Four hundred patients {{were randomly selected from}} a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> at an academic medical center. Raters with different levels of training (including cardiology attending physicians, cardiology fellows, internal medicine hospitalists, and internal medicine interns) classified individual <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> using the 2009 Appropriate Use Criteria. Consensus classification by 2 cardiologists was considered the operational gold standard, and sensitivity and specificity of individual raters for identifying inappropriate tests were calculated. Inter-rater reliability of the Appropriate Use Criteria was assessed using Cohen κ statistics for pairs of different raters. The mean age of patients was 61. 5 years; 214 (54 %) were female. The cardiologists rated 256 (64 %) of 400 <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> as appropriate, 68 (18 %) as uncertain, 55 (14 %) as inappropriate; 21 (5 %) tests were unable to be classified. Inter-rater reliability for noncardiologist raters was modest (unweighted Cohen κ, 0. 51, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 45 – 0. 55). Sensitivity of individual raters for identifying inappropriate tests ranged from 47 % to 82 %, while specificity ranged from 85 % to 97 %. Conclusions—Inter-rater reliability for the 2009 Appropriate Use Criteria for radionuclide imaging is modest, and there is considerable variation in the ability of raters at different levels of training to identify inappropriate tests...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the stringent <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> criteria for crossover to cardiac catheterization in the conservative arm of the Fast Revascularization During Instability in Coronary Artery Disease (FRISC-II) trial subjected this strategy to a disadvantage by failing to identify patients with surgical coronary artery disease (CAD). BackgroundIn FRISC-II, an invasive strategy provided superior outcomes compared with a conservative strategy for patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, compared with the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> criteria for crossover to catheterization in the Veterans Affairs Non–Q-Wave Infarction Strategies in Hospital (VANQWISH) trial, the FRISC-II criteria were more restrictive and did not use nuclear imaging or pharmacologic <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> MethodsWe analyzed the conservative arm of VANQWISH to identify the prevalence of surgical CAD in those patients who met the VANQWISH, but not FRISC-II, criteria for catheterization. ResultsOf 385 VANQWISH patients, 90 (23 %) met the FRISC-II criteria for catheterization. Another 98 patients (25 %) met only VANQWISH <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> criteria (60 patients by exercise and 38 by pharmacologic <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing).</b> Among subjects who underwent predischarge angiography, those meeting only VANQWISH <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> criteria had a high prevalence of surgical CAD (51 %), comparable to patients who met FRISC-II criteria (54 %, p = 0. 805). ConclusionsThe overly stringent risk stratification protocol for conservative-arm patients in FRISC-II could have failed to identify almost as many patients with surgical CAD as it identified.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibility that some patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) but negative exercise or chemical stress test results might have mental stress-induced ischemia. The study population consisted solely of those with negative test results. BackgroundMental stress-induced ischemia has been reported in 20 % to 70 % of CAD subjects with exercise-induced ischemia. Because mechanisms of exercise and mental stress-induced ischemia may differ, we studied whether mental stress would produce ischemia in a proportion of subjects with CAD who have no inducible ischemia with exercise or pharmacologic tests. MethodsTwenty-one subjects (14 men, 7 women) with a mean age of 67 years and with a documented history of CAD were studied. All subjects had a recent negative <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> result (exercise or chemical). Subjects completed a speaking task involving role playing a difficult interpersonal situation. A total of 30 mCi 99 mTc-sestamibi was injected at one minute into the speech, and imaging was started 40 min later. A resting image obtained within one week was compared with the stress image. Images were analyzed for number and severity of perfusion defects. The summed difference score based on the difference between summed stress and rest scores was calculated. Severity was assessed using a semiquantitative scoring method from zero to four. ResultsSix of 21 (29 %) subjects demonstrated reversible ischemia (summed difference score ≥ 3) with mental stress. No subject had chest pain or electrocardiographic changes during the stressor. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate all increased between resting and times of peak stress.

40|$|Abstract: Emergency room {{evaluations}} of patients presenting with chest pain continue to rise, and these evaluations which often include cardiac imaging, are an increasing area of resource utilization {{in the current}} health system. Myocar-dial perfusion imaging from the emergency department remains a vital component of the diagnosis or exclusion of coro-nary artery disease as the etiology of chest pain. Recent advances in camera technology, and changes to the imaging pro-tocols have allowed MPI to become a more efficient way of providing this diagnostic information. Compared with con-ventional SPECT, new high-efficiency CZT cameras provide a 3 - 5 fold increase in photon sensitivity, 1. 65 -fold im-provement in energy resolution and a 1. 7 - 2. 5 -fold increase in spatial resolution. With stress-only imaging, rest images are eliminated if stress images are normal, as they provide no additional prognostic or diagnostic value and cancelling the rest images would shorten {{the length of the}} test which is of particular importance to the ED population. The rapid but accurate triage of patients in an ED CPU is essential to their care, and stress-only imaging and new CZT cameras allow for shorter test time, lower radiation doses and lower costs while demonstrating good clinical outcomes. These changes to <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> can allow for faster throughput of patients through the emergency department while providing a safe and ef-ficient evaluation of chest pain...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{studies have}} shown that the {{exercise}} electrocardiogram (ECG) is less accurate for predicting ischemia, especially in women, and there is additional evidence to suggest that heart size may affect its diagnostic accuracy. HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the exercise ECG based on heart size. METHODS: We evaluated 1, 011 consecutive patients who were referred for an exercise <b>nuclear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> Patients were divided into two groups: small heart size defined as left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) < 65 mL (Group A) and normal heart size defined as LVEDV ≥ 65 mL (Group B) and associations between ECG outcome (false positive vs. no false positive) and heart size (small vs. normal) were analyzed using the Chi square test for independence, with a Yates continuity correction. LVEDV calculations were performed via a computer-processing algorithm. SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging was used as the gold standard for the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD). RESULTS: Small heart size was found in 142 patients, 123 female and 19 male patients. There was a significant association between ECG outcome and heart size (χ(2)  =  4. 7, p =  0. 03), where smaller hearts were associated with a significantly greater number of false positives.
