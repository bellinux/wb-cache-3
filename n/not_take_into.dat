5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E

5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as it does <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account Keynes's insight {{on the importance of}} confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman does <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt {{it was a mistake to}} send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E

Grenfell Tower in London {{was considered a}} medium fire risk {{but in spite of}} this at least 79 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire, FRA also failed with the Lakanal House fire. Prof Arnold Dix described the FRA system as only a, [...] "box-ticking exercise". Dix maintains cladding is <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account, {{how hard it is to}} evacuate a burning tower block is <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account, fire risks inside flats such as old electrical equipment that is t greater risk of catching fire and combustible bedding are <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account.|$|R
5|$|For {{work on the}} scenario, Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this does <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, does <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|Strickland did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> {{account the}} swampy lowland and high water table {{that characterizes the}} terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built {{at the rear of}} the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Brigade {{moved up}} to the line to relieve the 2nd and Rifle Brigades and {{remained}} there until the division was withdrawn to a training area in late October, following the relief of II ANZAC Corps by the Canadian Corps. The division suffered heavy losses on 12 October: about 845 men were killed and a further 1,900 wounded in the worst defeat in New Zealand military history. Although Russell blamed himself for {{the outcome of the}} attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his private correspondence {{he made it clear that}} planning and preparation by Godley and his staff at II ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets and an American {{group of}} architects each devised {{separate}} outlines for rebuilding {{the town of}} Spitak. Following an invitation by the Soviets for a critique of their plan, the American's proposal was ultimately accepted as the way forward. The new plan would deviate from Soviet styles that {{were found to be}} rigid and outdated, and would mirror characteristics of the local culture. For many years following World War II the Soviets practiced a methodical top-down approach to urban planning and building, constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units, and the Soviets plan for rebuilding Spitak did not diverge from that approach. The Soviet's grid plan road scheme was found to <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the hillside at the new city's location, and the American's plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped together in an open and communal style.|$|E
5|$|Toll {{collection}} {{started the}} day after the opening, and lasted until 24 May 2007. Seventy percent of the costs were to be covered by the state, and thirty percent through toll fees. The debt was borrowed by the private company that was given a concession to operate a toll plaza on the Inderøy side. Including interest, NOK80 million was collected, and the bridge was paid off three years before schedule. The Vanvikan-based company was disestablished following the closure of the plaza. Until only a few years before the closing, it was the only toll plaza in Nord-Trøndelag. There were several price increases during the toll period. The bridge was free for pedestrians and cyclists, but all motor vehicles were charged, although discounts were available for frequent travelers. The plaza was manned, and did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> use Autopass, like many other plazas.|$|E

5|$|With the expiry of the copyrights, {{companies}} {{around the}} world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years. Productions of Pinafore, both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by Simon Gallaher) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain. Since its original production, H.M.S. Pinafore has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers {{around the world}}. In 2003 alone, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for productions of Pinafore, Pirates and Mikado. This does <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have their own, or that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra. Hundreds of productions of Pinafore are presented every year worldwide.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account {{the fact that the}} pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E
