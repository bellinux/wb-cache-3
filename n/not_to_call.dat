5|$|Governor-General Kerr was {{following}} the crisis closely. At a luncheon with Whitlam {{and several of his}} ministers on 30 October, Kerr suggested a compromise: if Fraser conceded supply, Whitlam would agree <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the half-Senate election until May or June 1976, or alternatively would agree <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the Senate into session until after 1 July. Whitlam rejected the idea, seeking to end the Senate's right to deny supply. On 3 November, after a meeting with Kerr, Fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election, the Coalition would concede supply. Whitlam rejected this offer, stating that he had no intention of advising a House election for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|The press {{surrounding}} the Barker case {{led to the}} first calls about the Boy in the Box. Frank Guthrum, who discovered the boy, had decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the police until he listened to reports of the Barker case on his car radio.|$|E

Thus, if an SMC parliamentary seat is vacated and the Prime Minister exercises discretion <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a by-election in the SMC, the constituency's residents will not only lack a representative in Parliament but will also be without a Town Council chairman.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie's sister, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), {{gives birth}} to a baby girl that she names Amy, to Danielle's surprise. Ronnie's dislike of her lessens with time, and when Danielle falls out with Stacey and ends up {{squatting}} in a flat owned by landlord Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Ronnie convinces him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the police.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his stronghold in Kediri, Trunajaya managed to escape to the {{mountains}} of eastern Java. VOC and the king's forces chased Trunajaya, who, isolated and deprived of food, surrendered to the VOC {{at the end of}} 1679. Initially, he was treated with respect as a captive of the VOC commander. However, during a ceremonial visit to the royal residence in Payak, East Java, on 2 January 1680, he was personally stabbed by Amangkurat, and the king's courtiers finished him off. The king defended this killing of a VOC prisoner by saying that Trunajaya had tried to kill him. The VOC was not convinced by this explanation, but it chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the king into account. A romanticised account of Trunajaya's death appears in the 18th-century Central Javanese babads.|$|E

5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Lamb {{to the stand}} {{on his own behalf}} at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|Peggy {{demands that}} Stacey leave the pub and Stacey pleads with her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{the police for}} Lily's sake. She {{attempts}} to tell Ryan that he is Lily's father, but is interrupted by Pat, who thinks Stacey is trying to seduce him and slaps her. Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that {{was left in the}} room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she can call the police about Stacey. They argue, with Phil accusing Peggy of loving the pub more than she loves him and throwing a match to the alcohol-soaked floor to start a fire. It spreads quickly, causing an explosion. The customers flee the pub, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) is knocked to the ground and trampled in the process but is rescued by his father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and brother Tamwar (Himesh Patel).|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to leave}} the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug {{addiction}} and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess {{to the police and}} is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.|$|E

While the custom of numbering {{the days of the}} week was mostly prevalent in the Eastern Church, Portuguese and Galician, due to Martin's influence, are the only Romance languages in which the names of the days come from numbers rather than planetary names.|$|E
25|$|Investigative {{records show}} that Rowe had twice failed {{polygraph}} tests when questioned as to his possible involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and two separate, non-fatal explosions. These polygraph results had convinced some FBI agents of Rowe's culpability in the bombing. Prosecutors at Chambliss's 1977 trial had initially intended to call Rowe as a witness; however, William Baxley had opted <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Rowe as a witness after being informed {{of the results of}} these polygraph tests.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015 Adamcik {{gained a}} hearing for post-conviction relief with state Sixth District Magistrate Judge Mitchell W. Brown. He claimed that {{testimony}} from character witnesses could {{have changed the}} outcome of the sentencing, but that his former attorney, against Adamcik's parents' wishes, chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> upon these witnesses. Adamcik said that his attorney believed that the prosecution would have submitted even more damaging evidence. In March 2016 Judge Brown denied his request for post-conviction relief. Adamcik is appealing Judge Brown's decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. A hearing will be held on November 9, 2017.|$|E

25|$|Several groups {{called for}} a boycott of the census over the {{involvement}} of Lockheed Martin, including the Stop the War Coalition, and the Christian thinktank Ekklesia. The groups were concerned about sharing data with a company involved in surveillance and data processing for the CIA and FBI; and also providing funding to an arms company making nuclear missiles and cluster bombs. The Green Party also objected, and campaigned unsuccessfully to stop Lockheed Martin getting the contract, although no decision was made about whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for a boycott. The Census Alert campaign group also decided against calling for a boycott.|$|E
25|$|In late October 2009 Turner {{was freed}} on $500,000 bond, and was ordered {{not to use}} a {{computer}} or any device that can access the Internet. His trial started on November 30, 2009 and ended on December 4, 2009, with the defense opting <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> any witnesses. After two hours of deliberation, the jury announced it was deadlocked. Three days later the judge declared a mistrial, and a retrial was set for March 1, 2010. This second trial, overseen by Western District of Louisiana judge Donald Walter, was moved from the Northern District of Illinois to the Eastern District of New York: since the prosecution was to call the three judges to the stand, the defense felt that Turner would not get a fair hearing if the trial was conducted {{in the same city}} where the judges worked. A mistrial was declared on March 10.|$|E

Lieutenant Aleksandr Popov was participating in the exercises on the height near Tskhinvali when his group was requested by the intelligence to reinforce them. According to Popov's mother, Popov told her he could see how the Georgians fired on Tskhinvali one week before the war. The mother of Eldar Lotfullin, 23-year-old contract soldier, said that she was able to call her son for the last time at around 10 PM MSK on 7 August 2008. Eldar Lotfullin told journalist that the Georgian tanks fired on his barracks on 8 August.
