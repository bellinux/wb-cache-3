40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Needlepunched</b> {{nonwoven}} geotextiles {{are widely}} used for various civil engineering applications. These applications are required to perform more than one function, i. e., filtration, separation, protection, drainage, and reinforcement. Reinforcement is a complex phenomenon and strongly depends upon the fabric’s dimensional and mechanical properties {{in addition to the}} soil–geotextile interaction. In this study, the effect of process parameters including web area density, punch density, and depth of needle penetration has been investigated on dimensional (area density and thickness) and mechanical (puncture resistance and tensile strengths in the machine and cross-machine directions) properties of <b>needlepunched</b> nonwoven geotextiles. These process parameters are then empirically related with the fabric properties using multiple regression technique. The anisotropic characteristics of <b>needlepunched</b> nonwoven geotextiles tensile properties have also been discussed.

40|$|The {{swelling}} {{characteristics of}} "ve di!erent geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are examined. Results show that two thermally treated GCLs have similar swell properties but a third thermally treated GCL with bentonite impregnated in the cover geotextile swells to higher GCL bulk void ratios at stresses below 100 kPa. This {{is attributed to}} the uncon"ned swelling of the bentonite present {{on the surface of}} the cover geotextile. A thermally treated <b>needlepunched</b> GCL is shown to have an equilibrium swell height that is 50 % smaller than that of a non-thermally treated <b>needlepunched</b> GCL at 6 kPa. Microscopic examination of the thermal and non-thermally treated "bres before and after the 6 kPa swell tests shows that more thermally treated "bres remain visible on the bottom of the geotextile compared to the non-thermally treated "bres. Additional swell tests at 20 kPa and 100 kPa suggest that as the con"ning stress increases on a GCL during hydration, the tendency for pullout of the "bres decreases. Di!usion tests performed on a thermally treated <b>needlepunched</b> GCL and non-thermally treated need-lepunched GCL under free swell conditions show that the di!usion coe$cients for Na ` and Cl ~ are lower for the thermally treated, <b>needlepunched</b> GCL than for the non-thermally treated GCL under otherwise similar conditions because of the higher bulk void ratio of the latte...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: PTT (polytrimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) based {{meltblown}} and spunbonded webs {{have been}} produced by using Reicofil Bi-Component Meltblown Line at TANDEC at the University of Tennessee and Reicofil 3 Spunbonding system at Reifenhauser, Germany. The processability of meltblown and spunbond-ing {{in a wide range}} of operating windows was extensively investigated. The produced webs were characterized to optimize this process. It was found that the PTT grade studied is quite suitable for the meltblown and spunbonding process. The PTT/PP based bico meltblown webs showed enhanced barrier properties and heat resistance and the PTT spunbonded nonwovens showed advanced drapability and elastic recovery.

40|$|The sealing {{effect and}} {{containment}} of moisture in landfill covers and liners containing geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are largely influenced by moisture retention, swelling, and the self-healing behaviour of bentonite used in GCLs. The method of binding of GCLs also significantly affects the behaviour. To examine these aspects, percent swell and swell pressure tests under different effective pressures {{were conducted on}} two sodium-based GCLs. Permittivity tests were performed on GCL specimens with different hole diameters and also on specimens dried at 20 and 60 oC. The test results are presented and discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nonwoven {{structures}} have a {{range of}} applications which include geotextiles, interlinings, carpet backing and as reinforcements in composites. In this study, the tensile behavior of nonwoven structures including <b>needlepunched</b> and thermal bonded has been predicted by modifying the micromechanical model based upon the geometrical and mechanical properties of the constituent fibers (Adanur, S. and Liao, T. (1999). Fiber Arrangements Characteristics and Their Effects on Nonwoven Tensile Behavior, Textile Research Journal, 69 (11) : 816 – 824). In the modified model, the effects of fiber orientation in addition to the fiber curl factor are incorporated. The theoretical models have been validated with experimental results. The effects of lapping angle and curl factor have also been investigated on the thermal bonded nonwoven structures. Furthermore, the distribution of fiber orientation within a nonwoven structure is related to the lapping and fiber orientation angles using Fourier series...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} an {{experimental study of}} three types of non-woven preforms (<b>needlepunched,</b> spunlaced and mat manufactured using a paper-making process) intended as composite reinforcement. These are potentially very attractive for transport applications. First, the influence of processing on elementary fiber tensile properties is shown to be limited. Then the preforms are evaluated in polypropylene matrix composites and mechanical properties are determined. The structure of non-woven reinforcements {{is strongly dependent on}} the manufacturing route. By varying the fiber content it is shown that the most efficient reinforcement for flax fibers is the mat produced by paper processing. The new spunlaced reinforced composites are shown to have slightly lower tensile properties (15 % lower strength, and 25 % lower stiffness) compared to mat composites at equivalent volume fraction, but further optimization is possible for these materials. Based on the measured constituent properties micromechanics models have been used to estimate composite stiffness. A good correlation is obtained between test results and model predictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the initial fiber orientation distribution on the ballistic performance of a <b>needlepunched</b> nonwoven polyethylene fabric was analyzed. To this end, ballistic tests were carried out in specimens pre-deformed along the machine or the transverse directions and the {{influence of}} pre-deformation on the fiber orientation was measured by means of wide angle X-ray diffraction. It was found that pre-deformation along the machine direction (the soft orientation of the fabric) led to more isotropic in-plane mechanical response and to a marked increase in the specific ballistic limit and in the energy dissipated by unit weight while the opposite behaviour was found after stretching the fabric along the transverse direction. These differences were accompanied by changes in the penetration mechanics from extensive fiber pull-out to slippage between fibers in the network. These results highlight how the nature of the nonwoven microstructure (connectivity of the entanglement points and fiber orientation distribution) can be tailored to improve the impact performance...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{networks}} with out-of-plane auxetic behavior {{have been}} sporadically investigated. One {{of the major}} challenges is to design such materials with giant negative Poissons ratio over large deformations. Here in, we report a systematic investigation to create three-dimensional (3 D) fiber networks {{in the form of}} needle punched nonwoven materials with out-of-plane auxetic behavior over large deformations via theoretical modeling and extensive set of experiments. The experimental matrix has encapsulated the key parameters of the <b>needlepunching</b> nonwoven process. Under uniaxial tensile loading, the anisotropy coupled with local fiber densification in networks has yielded large negative Poissons ratio (up to − 5. 7) specifically in the preferential direction. The in-plane and out-of-plane Poissons ratios of fiber networks have been predicted and, subsequently, compared with the experimental results. Fiber orientation was found to be a core parameter that modulated the in-plane Poissons ratio of fiber networks. A parametric analysis has revealed the interplay between the anisotropy of the fiber network and the out-of-plane Poissons ratio based upon constant volume consideration...|$|R
40|$|Nonwoven {{geotextiles}} {{are complex}} three-dimensional structures {{formed by the}} random arrangement of fibres. They are permeable and compressive textile materials and belong to the geosynthetic group, which also includes geogrids, geonets, geomembranes, and geocomposites. The design of appropriate geosynthetics involves careful consideration of {{the functions of the}} various constituent materials in terms of the intended end-use. A rational design, which effectively combines geotextiles with other geosynthetics, is required. <b>Needlepunched</b> nonwoven geotextiles are extensively used in civil engineering applications, including road and railway construction, landfills, land reclamation, sea defence, and reinforcement of clay slopes. Such applications require geotextiles to perform more than one function, including filtration, drainage, and separation. The filtration function of geotextiles is to retain the soil, while allowing the passage of the liquid. The drainage function of geotextiles is to transmit the liquid in the plane of the fabric without the loss of soil particles. Therefore, the filtration and drainage functions differ mainly in terms of direction of liquid flow. The separation function of geotextiles involves segregation, followed by retention of soil particles. Thus, the geotextile structure should be designed to fulfil the criteria demanded by the specific end-use...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} test program {{was conducted to}} determine the moisture-suction relationships of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). Moisture-suction relationships were determined by combining suction data from pressure plate tests, contact filter paper tests, and relative humidity tests, then fitting water retention curves (WRCs) to the data. WRCs were determined for wetting processes and drying processes in terms of gravimetric moisture content and volumetric moisture content. The effects of GCL type, hydration solution, wet-dry cycles, and temperature on the moisture-suction relationships were analyzed. The three GCLs of the test program consisted of configurations of woven and nonwoven geotextiles reinforced with <b>needlepunched</b> fibers. A geofilm was adhesively bonded to the nonwoven side {{of one of the}} GCL products. The hydration solution tests involved hydrating GCLs with deionized water, tap water, 0. 1 M CaCl 2, or soil water from a landfill cover test plot for a 30 -day conditioning period prior to testing. Cyclic wet-dry tests were conducted on the GCL specimens subjected to 20 wet-dry cycles from 50 % to 0 % gravimetric moisture content prior to testing. Temperature tests were conducted at 2 °C, 20 °C, and 40 °C. GCL type affected moisture-suction relationships. The GCLs with an adhesively-bonded geofilm exhibited lower air-entry suction and higher residual suction than GCLs without a geofilm. The degree of <b>needlepunched</b> fiber pullout during hydration contributed to hysteresis between wetting WRCs and drying WRCs. Hysteresis was high for suction values below air-entry suction and was low for suction values greater than air-entry suction. Cation exchange reduced the water retention capacity for all three GCL types. The saturated gravimetric moisture contents were reduced from approximately 140 % to 70 % for wetting WRCs and 210 % to 90 % for drying WRCs for GCLs hydrated in deionized water compared to CaCl 2 solution. Hysteresis of the nonwoven product decreased from 71 %, to 62 %, to 28 % with respect to deionized water, tap water, and CaCl 2 solution. Hysteresis of the woven product exposed to soil water was 24 % and 0 %, in terms of saturated gravimetric moisture content and saturated volumetric moisture content, respectively. The swell index, Atterberg Limits, mole fraction of bound sodium, and scanning electron microscopy images that were determined of bentonite from the conditioned GCLs indicated that changes in water retention capacity corresponded with cation exchange. Wet-dry cycles and temperature affected the moisture-suction behavior for GCLs. Wet-dry cycles reduced hysteresis and increased the swelling capacity of GCL specimens. Microscopy images indicated that wet-dry cycles caused weak orientation of the clay particles. Increasing temperature resulted in a small decrease in water retention capacity. Results of the test program provided a means for predicting unsaturated behavior for GCLs...|$|R
40|$|Runoff {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{contamination}} in urban areas, since water can transport pollutants from many different media, among which the hydrocarbons generated by vehicles have an especially significant relevance. Under this premise, the study of geotextiles used as water purification layers within pervious pavement structures becomes a crucial issue, since these fabrics have proved to be a suitable environment for the development of biofilms, which are groups of microorganisms capable of reducing the presence of hydrocarbons. For this reason, this paper proposes a first test to assess the capacity of ten different geotextiles by immersing them in a culture medium prepared to favour the growth of a microbial community. The results showed the major importance of geotextile thickness in the generation of biomass and its relationship to the manufacturing process of the fabric, either heat-sealing or <b>needlepunching.</b> Consequently, a second test was developed to measure the mechanical behaviour of a geotextile of each type when buried in a microbially active soil under different conditions. The comparison between exposed and control samples revealed the maintenance of strength-related properties of geotextiles in the presence of microorganisms.

40|$|International audienceGeosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) {{are placed}} {{at the bottom of}} waste {{disposal}} facilities where they hydrate from the subsoil and eventually from a hydraulic head on geomembranes (GMs) defects. Predicting hydration behavior of GCLs requires knowledge of the water-retention properties of the GCL along wetting paths. Given that GCLs could be subjected to different ranges of vertical stresses that are induced by the weight of the supported waste, the confining stress could affect water-retention properties of GCLs and should be investigated. To do so, a laboratory methodology to establish the water-retention curves (WRCs) of <b>needlepunched</b> GCLs under stress was undertaken. Various constant vertical stresses corresponding to different weights of the supported waste were applied to GCL specimens placed in controlled-suction oedometers. Suction values were selected so as to mimic a wetting path from the initial dry state to zero suction. Suction was controlled by using controlled suction techniques with controlled humidity imposed by a saturated saline solutions and using the osmotic technique with polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions. Measurements were undertaken on oedometer systems as to apply confining stresses and have been complemented by standard saturated oedometer swelling tests. The data obtained confirm that increasing the stress on to the GCL results in less, albeit faster, water uptake, which could emphasize on recommendations about rapidly covering GCLs after they are {{placed at the}} bottom of a waste disposal facilities. Finally, the potential validity of the state-surface concept, which was developed in unsaturated soil mechanics, is discussed using van Guenuchten's and Fredlund and Xing's equations for water retention curves...|$|R
40|$|Radiation heat {{transfer}} {{is found to}} be the dominant mode of {{heat transfer}} at temperatures higher than 400 - 500 K [11]. Convection heat transfer being negligible in nonwovens, effective thermal conductivity is given by the sum of its conduction and radiation components. In this research two methods were identified to determine radiative thermal conductivity of <b>needlepunched</b> samples made from Nomex fibers. The first method involved the determination of radiative thermal conductivity using effective (total) thermal conductivity determined using a Guarded Hot Plate (GHP) instrument. In the second method radiative thermal conductivity was estimated using the extinction coefficient of samples. The extinction coefficient was determined by using direct transmission measurements made using a Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometer. Results confirmed that radiation was the dominant mode of heat transfer at temperatures higher than 535 K. The conduction component of effective thermal conductivity did not change much in the range of densities tested. Empirical models for predicting the temperature difference across thickness of the fabric and the radiative thermal conductivity with R-square values of 0. 94 and 0. 88 respectively showed that fabric density, fabric thickness, fiber fineness, fiber length, mean pore size and applied temperature were found to have significant effect on the effective thermal conductivity and its radiation component. Though a high correlation between the results of Method 1 (Guarded Hot Plate) and Method 2 (FTIR) was not seen, the absorbance measurements made using the FTIR spectrometer were found to have significant effect on the radiative thermal conductivity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 An {{evaluation}} of fabric reinforcement of the roadway structure is made. The study includes a parametric analy sis using layered elastic theory {{and a series}} of large scale model tests. The parametric. study analyzes the stresses and strains of roadway structures with a fabric layer between tna surface layer and the soil subgrade and compares them to similar systems without fabric. The results show that some benefit results when the fabric is incorporated with a granular surface. No reinforcement is evident when the fbric is incorporated in paved roadways. The analysis, however, does not clearly delineate the benefits, hence, model test results are presented to provide more quantitative data in the indicated range of greatest benefit. The model tests were performed on a granular roadway structure with and without fabric between the gravel and the soil subgrade. The fabric was a nonwoven, <b>needlepunched</b> polypropylene (Fibretex 400). The tests were performed in a five foot diameter test pit. Repeated loads of magnitude up to 9000 pounds were applied to simulate traffic. Rut depth and recoverable deflections were measured as functions of the number of load applications. The effectiveness of the fabric was evaluated with respect to the rate of rut development. A reasonable correlation was found between rutting and the ratio of the vertical stress on the subgrade to the subgrade strength. Measured deflections were compared with values computed by several theories. A finite element method gave good agreement and therefore, was used to estimate stresses in the fabric. The computed fabric stresses indicated if stress on the subgrade was limited to an acceptable value, the factor of safety with respect to fabric strength would be satisfactory. It is concluded that the common construction fabrics in use today (1977) will not provide significant reinforcement to paved roadways. They may, however, be effective for aggregate surfaced roads on very soft subgrades...|$|R
40|$|Making fabrics for apparel {{applications}} through conventional {{methods such as}} woven and knitting {{processes are}} lengthy and expensive because these processes start from ginning, spinning, weaving and knitting process. For saving the cost and quick response to the apparel market, many researchers and companies are trying to explore the non-conventional methods to produce fabrics for apparel applications by skipping some processing steps during apparel fabrics manufacturing process. For decades, nonwovens are being used as supporting materials in the clothing industry, as such, they are used as fusible interlinings and reinforcements. Since last few years, because of the advancements in the nonwoven technology and materials, innovative nonwoven fabrics have been developed with the acceptable aesthetical properties for fashion garments. The most prominent example of the nonwoven fabric for clothing is “Evolon” produced by Freudenberg Germany. The main {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the limitations in the current nonwoven fabrics used for the apparel applications and to realise the functional properties of the fabrics that are suitable for apparel applications. Fabrics for apparel applications, especially for garments, require aesthetical and mechanical properties such as drape, hand feel, flexural rigidity, moisture management, tensile characteristics, thermal characteristics and air permeability. This study aims to develop nonwoven fabrics with enhanced mechanical and aesthetical characteristics by selecting the appropriate materials and nonwoven processes and process parameters. The developed hydroentangled nonwoven fabric was comprised on Tencel® and bicomponent (PE/PET) sheath core staple fibres. In this study, two different processes were employed for the preparation of the nonwoven fabrics for apparel applications. The first process consisted of carding, <b>needlepunching</b> and hydroentanglement. The second process involves carding, preneedling (for tucking of fibres) and hydroentanglement. The prepared fabrics were characterised according to the British Standards (BS 3356 : 1990, BS 9237 : 1995, BS 13934 - 1 : 1999) and the results were compared with a standard plain-weave cotton woven fabric and also with commercially available nonwoven fabric (Evolon®). The developed hydroentangled nonwoven fabric produced at hydroentanglement energy of 4. 44 kJ/kg, showed better drape properties owing to its flexural rigidity of 252 mg cm in MD while the corresponding commercial hydroentangled fabric displayed a value of 1340 mg cm in MD.

40|$|Nonwoven fabrics are sheet {{structures}} {{created by}} bonding or interlocking a web (network) of fibers through mechanical, thermal or chemical processes. In general, the mechanical response of nonwoven fabrics exhibits two major characteristics. First, the mechanical response can vary significantly when the fabric is loaded along different directions, {{depending on the}} existence of a preferential orientation in the fiber arrangement and/or in the pattern of inter-fiber bonding/entanglement. Second, the mechanisms of deformation include elastic and inelastic components, accompanied by an irrecoverable evolution of the texture of the fiber network. In this work, we propose a three-dimensional, large strain continuum model for the constitutive behavior of nonwoven fabrics that accounts for the fiber network characteristics responsible for its anisotropic behavior, and captures the effects of deformation mechanisms at the micro-scale (fiber and bonds/entanglement) level. The model consists of two constitutive components: a nonlinear elastic component representing the resistances to recoverable deformation mechanisms, and a non-linear inelastic component representing the resistances to irrecoverable deformation and texture evolution. For nonwoven fabrics in which the anisotropy of fiber orientation is combined with random entanglement processes, we propose to capture the combined effects of fibers and junctions orientation distributions using a single tensorial representation of the network anisotropy (fabric ellipsoid). An orthotropic elastic constitutive model for the elastic response of nonwoven fabrics is then formulated based on this structural measure and deformation mechanisms of the network structure. The inelastic component of the model is then prescribed in terms of an evolution law for the fabric ellipsoid. (cont.) A <b>needlepunched</b> web of high strength polyethylene fibers, "Dyneema Fraglight", is selected as the representative material, {{to be used as a}} test case to validate the proposed modeling approach. The model is shown to capture the macroscopic nonlinear anisotropic elastic-inelastic response of the fabric in planar deformation, as well as the underlying micromechanical deformation mechanisms, such as fiber stretch, and irrecoverable evolution of fabric texture. The proposed model can be used to predict the mechanical behavior of nonwoven fabrics and can be combined with other continuum models to aid in the design of multi-component structures. In addition, the proposed elastic formulation can be used to model different classes of anisotropic network materials, such as biological tissues, and tissue engineering scaffolds. bu Petch Jearanaisilawong.
