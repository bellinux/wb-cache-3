40|$|Background: Prophylactic {{misoprostol}} or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{with low}} gastric toxicity (<b>nabumetone)</b> {{has been shown}} to reduce mucosal injury. Aim: To compare <b>nabumetone</b> vs. co-therapy of naproxen with low-dose misoprostol for secondary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in NSAID users. Methods: NSAID users presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were enrolled if they required long-term NSAIDs. After ulcer healing, they were randomized to receive: naproxen (500 - 1000 mg/day) and misoprostol (200 μg b. d.), or <b>nabumetone</b> (1000 - 1500 mg/day) and placebo misoprostol for 24 weeks. The primary end-point was recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The secondary end-point was the proportion of patients suffering from major gastrointestinal events including ulcer bleeding, symptomatic ulcers and severe dyspepsia. Results: A total of 90 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (misoprostol/naproxen 45, <b>nabumetone</b> 45). Recurrent bleeding occurred in 10 patients (22. 2 %) receiving misoprostol/naproxen compared with three (6. 7 %) receiving <b>nabumetone</b> (relative risk 3. 33, 95 % CI: 0. 98 - 11. 32, P = 0. 069).

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the ‘real better’ drug, amongst these with better effi cacy and gastro-intestinal tolerability as well. Methods:Four hundred and twenty-three patients of either sex, aged 40 - 64 years with uncomplicated osteoarthritis of knee joint were randomly allocated into three equal groups receiving aceclofenac, <b>nabumetone</b> or placebo. A baseline pain measurement was done with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS: 0 - 10 scale) and Investigator Global Assessment of Disease status (IGADS: 0 - 4 point scale). Code was broken at the end of two weeks or earlier to eliminate any real fatal outcome. Final evaluation of efficacy was done at the end of four weeks. The signifi cance of difference between the treatment outcomes was analyzed using one way ANOVA test. Results:During the active comparator controlled period, the most common reason for discontinuation was unacceptable adverse events. While 108 (76. 6 %) participants could take the full course of treatment with aceclofenac, 118 (83. 7 %) of the <b>nabumetone</b> group completed the study. Drop outs were highest in the placebo group (33. 9 %) followed by the aceclofenac group (12. 1 %) and <b>nabumetone</b> group (8. 5 %). Discontinuation due to G. I. intolerance was least in the placebo group (2. 1 %) followed by the <b>nabumetone</b> group (5 %) and aceclofenac group (7. 8 %). Conclusions:The preferential inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase 2 by <b>nabumetone</b> was postulated to afford better clinical effi cacy and gastrointestinal tolerability in osteoarthritis as compared to aceclofenac.

40|$|Objective: Although nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) are {{an effective}} therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, they {{are associated with}} significant adverse effects, the management of which imposes additional costs on the healthcare system. Prescribing NSAIDs which have a lower risk of major adverse effects as the first-line NSAID for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis {{may be expected to}} lead to an improvement in clinical outcomes and reduce overall treatment costs. This analysis examines data from a published randomised controlled trial of 5 NSAIDs to explore these hypotheses. Design and Setting: Data from a clinical trial comparing 5 NSAIDs were combined with published cost data to construct 2 clinical decision models, reflecting alternative approaches to the management of major and minor adverse effects in the UK. Interventions: The 5 NSAIDs evaluated in the analysis were <b>nabumetone,</b> diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam and naproxen, although only the results for ibuprofen and <b>nabumetone</b> are reported. Main outcome measures and results: The total cost of care per patient receiving <b>nabumetone</b> was estimated to be between 25 pounds sterling (Lstg) and Lstg 41 more expensive than ibuprofen. In a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients, there were between 690 and 821 more major adverse effects using ibuprofen than <b>nabumetone.</b> The cost per life-year gained (LYG) from using <b>nabumetone</b> rather than ibuprofen ranged between Lstg 1880 and Lstg 2517 (1995 values), depending upon the management of adverse effects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nabumetone</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) used {{mainly in}} treating pain associated with arthritis. The usual oral dose for osteoarthritis is 1000 mg daily, and higher doses are not advised in older patients. There are no known systematic reviews of its analgesic efficacy in acute postoperative pain. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral <b>nabumetone</b> in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study {{has been used for}} many decades to establish whether drugs have analgesic properties. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of single dose oral <b>nabumetone</b> in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (May 2009); EMBASE via Ovid (May 2009); and the Oxford Pain Relief Database. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral <b>nabumetone</b> for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The area under the "pain relief versus time" curve was used to derive the proportion of participants with <b>nabumetone</b> and placebo experiencing at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) was calculated using 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period, and time to use of rescue analgesia, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was also collected. MAIN RESULTS: No studies were identified by the searches that examined oral <b>nabumetone</b> in participants with established postoperative pain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of evidence of efficacy, at present, for oral <b>nabumetone</b> in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully.

40|$|The {{solubility}} {{characteristics of}} drugs remain {{the most challenging}} aspect in the formulation development. With the advent of combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening the number of poorly soluble compounds has dramatically increased. The dissolution rate of drug from its dosage form is considered as an important parameter in the absorption. Dissolution is the rate-limiting step in the absorption of drugs from 1 solid dosage form especially when the drug is poorly water soluble. Poor wettability of drugs leads to the decrease in their bioavailability. Increasing the surface area of the drug particle may curb out this problem. For drugs whose GI absorption is rate limited by dissolution, reduction of particle size increases the rate of absorption and total bioavailability. This is common with drugs of poor water solubility. Solid dispersion of <b>Nabumetone</b> is already carried with methyl cellulose. The main perspective of this study aims at overcoming these problems by solid dispersion technology using carriers like ethyl cellulose {{as well as other}} natural, semi synthetic and synthetic carriers with a view to develop fast release formulation of <b>Nabumetone</b> improving its dissolution characteristics. <b>Nabumetone</b> is an effective NSAID, it is practically insoluble in water, where the dissolution is rate limiting.

The solubility of <b>nabumetone</b> in the binary solvent, dioxane-water shows a bell-shaped profile with a solubility maximum well below the ideal solubility of the drug. This is attributed to solvation of the drug with the dioxane-water mixture, and indicates that the solutesolvent interaction energy is larger than the geometric mean (δ 1 δ 2) of regular solution theory. The new approach provides an accurate prediction of solubility once the interaction energy (W) is obtained. In this case, the energy term is regressed against a polynomial in δ 1 of the binary mixture. Quadratic, cubic, and quartic expressions of ‘W ’ in terms of solvent solubility parameter were utilized for predicting the solubility of <b>nabumetone</b> in various dioxanewater mixtures. But from these three polynomial expressions, a quartic expression of ‘W ’ in terms of solvent solubility parameter was found suitable for predicting the solubility and yields an error in mole fraction solubility of ~ 7. 346 %, a value approximating that of the experimentally determined solubility. Thus the method has potential usefulness in preformulation and formulation studies during which solubility prediction is important for drug design...|$|E
40|$|Spherical {{agglomeration}} {{techniques were}} developed {{for improving the}} flow and compressibility characteristics of microcrystalline mefenamic acid and <b>nabumetone.</b> The process involved agglomerating microcrystals using agglomerating solvents. Temperature and speed of agitation were optimized to obtain spherical agglomerates in a desired range, which {{was found to be}} essential to enhance compressibility. Incorporation of polymer HPMC during agglomeration significantly enhanced the dissolution rate of mefenamic acid while incorporation of solubilizing agent lecithin improved the solubility of <b>nabumetone.</b> Thus, spherical agglomeration is an important technique for improving direct compressibility of pharmaceutical powders and is especially useful when the drug dosage is high...|$|E

PharmDr. Milan Nobilis, CSc. Title of diploma thesis: Study of chiral {{aspects of}} drug {{metabolism}} using instrumental analytic methods For {{the evaluation of}} stereospecificity of rat and human cytosolic carbonyl reductases and activity of microsomal oxidases involved in <b>nabumetone</b> biotransformation, a new chiral high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed. The prepared LLE-HPLC-PDA method enabled extraction, separation and ultraviolet detection of prochiral <b>nabumetone</b> and its five phase I metabolites including enantiomers of two chiral biotransformation products of carbonyl reduction. Methyl ester of naproxen served as an internal standard. Diethyl ether was used for liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) of biomatrices. Chiralcel OD-R 250 mm× 4. 6 mm column with a mobile phase methanol- 1 M NaClO 4 /HClO 4 aqueous solution pH= 3 (75 : 25, v/v) were employed in isocratic sufficient separation of nine analytes. The whole analysis lasted 60 minutes at the flow rate of 0. 5 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored using a photodiode-array detector (scan or single wavelength at λ= 265 nm).
