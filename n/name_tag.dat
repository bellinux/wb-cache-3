5|$|Fernando Alonso {{received}} a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed {{over the course}} of the season without receiving a grid penalty. Power unit supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability of the cars as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their power unit, which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit was a step forward in both power and driveability. He urged the team to pull the introduction of the power unit forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the <b>name</b> <b>TAG</b> Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.|$|E
5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a <b>name</b> <b>tag,</b> so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} right thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E
50|$|<b>Name</b> <b>tags</b> {{are used}} by some {{customer}} service companies, such as fast food restaurants, so that customers may identify employees by name. Professional employees or representatives of public-facing organizations such as universities, banks, or other companies where employees do not wear uniforms, may wear <b>name</b> <b>tags</b> {{as a way of}} distinguishing or identifying the bearer as such, while allowing the employee to wear daily business wear.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{effective}} ways to manage large collections of digital photos is to <b>tag</b> <b>names</b> of people appearing in those photos. However, {{the number of people}} appearing in photo collections may range in the hundreds and the <b>names</b> of <b>tagged</b> people are usually presented in alphabetical order or on a first-tag first-place basis. As a result, it is difficult to quickly search for <b>name</b> <b>tags</b> that a user wishes to find. In order to solve this problem, we developed a digital photo management system that automatically groups the <b>name</b> <b>tags</b> based on their social relationships. This system was tested on users' own photos against three other comparison interfaces. The average searching time for <b>name</b> <b>tags</b> was significantly faster with our system. Also, the user satisfaction was higher than the others...|$|R

Instead, the wreckage rested on the hangar deck of Bunker Hill, half awash in water, with live wires sparking all around. Schock found Ogawa dead in the cockpit, and removed Ogawa's <b>name</b> <b>tag</b> from his flight suit, along with a letter Ogawa carried with him on his last mission, some photographs, a belt from Ogawa's parachute harness, and a large smashed aviator watch of the type that Japanese pilots wore around their necks.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1969, dacron blue made a {{comeback}} to the uniform with a force-wide change away from khaki overnight, {{in part to}} coincide with Singapore's 150th anniversary {{since its founding in}} 1819. The new uniform comprises a dark blue peak cap, shirt, trousers, black belt, shoes and socks, and coded whistle lanyard in blue and white. 3 large and 4 small metal buttons, metal collar badges, and a metal cap badge are affixed, and a black plastic <b>name</b> <b>tag</b> completes the uniform. Metallic ranks, if any, are fixed to the sleeve or on the shoulders for senior officers. The lanyard was changed to a metal chain in 1972, and in 1985, the material of the uniform was changed from 75% polyester 25% cotton to 100% polyester for ease of daily maintenance.|$|E

For students from grades three to five, the uniform is a short-sleeved white shirt with navy blue half pants. The uniform differs a bit during the winter season. In winter, students wear a navy blue sweater with a necktie, in addition to shirt and pants. For footwear, students wear black Oxford shoes with white socks. In addition, a <b>name</b> <b>tag</b> and college badge are included {{as part of the}} uniform. There is a tiny color badge on the sleeve which indicates the house to which the student is attached to. Sport uniforms include white T-shirts with navy blue half pants and appropriate footwear. Resident students have distinctive uniforms as well.|$|E
25|$|Waitrose {{partners}} wear different uniforms {{depending on}} their departments. Managers are expected to wear a blazer with a white shirt with thin grey lines and either charcoal suit trousers or a charcoal skirt. Counter partners must wear a plain white shirt under a grey apron with 'Waitrose' stitched on the front, {{in addition to a}} green tie, as well as either charcoal trousers or skirts and a grey hat with hair net for hygiene reasons. Customer services wear a white shirt but with thicker grey lines than the managers, and must also wear a shorter apron than counter partners. They also wear either a charcoal skirt or trousers and a black fleece or gillet with 'Waitrose' branded on the front in addition to a green tie. The 'Operations' section also wears the same uniform as the customer service partners. All partners are expected to wear a <b>name</b> <b>tag.</b>|$|E

500|$|Due to Harrison's {{extensive}} {{knowledge of}} the X-Files, the episode contains several references to previous episodes. While looking through her desk drawer, Scully finds the merged coin from the sixth season entry [...] "Dreamland"; the Apollo 11 space flight medallion, which was given to her by Mulder in the fourth season episode [...] "Tempus Fugit"; and her dog Queequeg's <b>name</b> <b>tag,</b> which she was given in the third season episode [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose". While investigating, Harrison mentions a liver-eating mutant that produced bile and died under an escalator, a reference to Eugene Victor Tooms, who appeared in the first season episodes [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms"; aliens that shed their skin and leave behind a residue similar to mucus, {{a reference to the}} alien from [...] "The Beginning"; and subterranean men in Florida who took people underground, as featured in [...] "Detour". While searching through Stites' house, Doggett finds a book entitled The Sixth Extinction, a potential reference to the seventh season episode of the same name. In the episode's final scene, Harrison asks Mulder how he and Scully managed to return to America after escaping from a spaceship in Antarctica, a reference to an event that took place {{at the end of the}} 1998 X-Files feature film.|$|E
500|$|The episode's flashforwards {{commence}} with Ben {{waking up}} alarmed in the Sahara with a wounded {{right arm and}} vapor rising from him. [...] The Dharma Initiative parka that he wears was codenamed [...] "Dharka" [...] by the writers. [...] A couple of Easter eggs are present in this scene: Ben's parka has a <b>name</b> <b>tag</b> that indicates that it was formerly owned by Edgar Halliwax (FranÃ§ois Chau) and it displays the first appearance of the logo for a Dharma station called the [...] "Orchid" [...] {{that would not be}} seen until the episode titled [...] "There's No Place Like Home". [...] Another Easter egg is glimpsed in the next scene, when Ben reveals his forged Canadian passport previously seen in [...] "The Economist" [...] for his alias Dean Moriarty, which is also the name of the central character in Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road. [...] Among the most frequent questions that the writers are asked is whether they have planned out future storylines, so the writers try to allude to future plot points, such as with the Dharka scene, that they can later call on as proof that they do know where the story is headed. [...] Director Jack Bender described the scene, which was filmed in a Hawaiian rock quarry, as especially hard to shoot because the actors had to ride horses and use guns, the crew had to relocate due to rocks present that were unsuitable for the scene, and Bender walked head-first into a crane. [...] Emerson stated that the set is [...] "definitely a no-glamour zone... I thought we would ease into things.

40|$|<b>Name</b> <b>tagging</b> is a {{critical}} early stage in many natural language processing pipelines. In this paper we analyze the types of errors produced by a tagger, distinguishing name classification and various types of name identification errors.

We show through examples and performance measurement how different stages can correct different types of errors. The resulting accuracy approaches that of individual human annotators. ...|$|R
