5|$|Throughout {{history the}} scent of <b>narcissi</b> has been an {{important}} ingredient of perfumes, a quality that comes from essential oils rather than alkaloids. <b>Narcissi</b> are also an important horticultural crop, and source of cut flowers (floriculture).|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest <b>narcissi</b> {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today <b>narcissi</b> are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, <b>narcissi</b> are classified into divisions, covering {{a wide range of}} shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, <b>narcissi</b> produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, <b>narcissi</b> are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} where <b>narcissi</b> are prevalent, their {{blooming}} in spring is celebrated in festivals. For instance, the slopes around Montreux, Switzerland {{and its associated}} riviera come alive with blooms each May (May Snow) at the annual <b>Narcissi</b> Festival. Festivals are also held in many other countries.|$|E

50|$|<b>Narcissus</b> poeticus (poet's daffodil, poet's <b>narcissus,</b> nargis, pheasant's eye, findern flower, and pinkster lily) {{was one of}} {{the first}} daffodils to be cultivated, and is {{frequently}} identified as the <b>narcissus</b> of ancient times (although <b>Narcissus</b> tazetta and <b>Narcissus</b> jonquilla have also been considered as possibilities). It is also often associated with the Greek legend of <b>Narcissus.</b> It is the type species of the genus <b>Narcissus.</b> Extremely fragrant, with a ring of petals in pure white and a short corona of light yellow with a distinct reddish edge, It grows to 20 to 40 cm tall, and is widely naturalized in North America.|$|R

5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. <b>narcissi,</b> which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further <b>narcissi</b> at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma <b>narcissi</b> (leaf tip blight). Aecidium <b>narcissi</b> causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|Planted bulbs are {{susceptible}} to nematodes, the most serious of which is Ditylenchus dipsaci (Narcissus eelworm), {{the main cause of}} basal plate disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further <b>narcissi</b> for another five years. Other nematodes include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in <b>narcissi.</b>|$|E

5|$|The plural form of {{the common}} name {{narcissus}} has caused some confusion. British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms, <b>narcissi</b> and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, narcissus, used for both singular and plural. The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order. However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that <b>narcissi</b> is the commonest form, narcissus being excessively sibilant. For similar reasons, Fowler prefers <b>narcissi</b> in British English usage. Neither support narcissus as a plural form. Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the first letter {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E
5|$|This {{classification}} is {{a useful}} tool for planning planting. Most commercially available <b>narcissi</b> come from Divisions 1 (Trumpet), 2 (Large-cupped) and 8 (Tazetta).|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{traditional}} use of <b>narcissi</b> for the treatment of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners. N. poeticus contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.|$|E

5|$|<b>Narcissi</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular garden plants in Islamic culture. Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I is said to have not been able to {{tolerate}} them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day, as described by the poet Ghalib.

50|$|In Greek mythology, Ameinias was a {{young man}} who {{fell in love with the}} {{beautiful}} Beotian hunter <b>Narcissus,</b> who had already spurned his male suitors, according version of <b>Narcissus's</b> myth by Conon (Narrations, 24). <b>Narcissus</b> also spurned him and gave him a sword. Ameinias committed suicide at <b>Narcissus's</b> doorstep after being rejected by <b>Narcissus.</b> He had prayed to Nemesis to give <b>Narcissus</b> a lesson for all the pain he provoked. <b>Narcissus</b> walked by a pool of water and decided to drink some. He saw his reflection, became entranced by it, and killed himself because he could not have his object of desire, or gazing endlessly at the image, he slowly pined away and was transformed by the nymphs into a <b>narcissus</b> flower. Others say he was instead filled with remorse and killed himself beside the pool—and from his dying life's blood the flower was born.|$|R
5|$|While {{some wild}} <b>narcissi</b> are {{specific}} {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage. The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, <b>narcissi</b> are {{depicted}} {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|E
5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour {{and shape of}} the leaves, as can Nematodes.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} poet's daffodil is {{likely in the}} botanical writings of Theophrastus (371 - c. 287 BCE), who wrote about a spring-blooming <b>narcissus</b> that the Loeb Classical Library editors identify as <b>Narcissus</b> poeticus. The poet Virgil, in his fifth Eclogue, also wrote about a <b>narcissus</b> whose description corresponds with that of <b>Narcissus</b> poeticus. In one version of the myth about the Greek hero <b>Narcissus,</b> he was punished by the Goddess of vengeance, Nemesis, who {{turned him into a}} <b>Narcissus</b> flower that historians associate with <b>Narcissus</b> poeticus. The fragrant <b>Narcissus</b> poeticus has also been recognized as the flower that Persephone and her companions were gathering when Hades abducted her into the Underworld, according to Hellmut Baumann in The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature. This myth accounts for the custom, which has lasted into modern times, of decorating graves with these flowers. Linnaeus, who gave the flower its name, quite possibly did so because he believed it was the one that inspired the tale of <b>Narcissus,</b> handed down by poets since ancient times.|$|R

5|$|It was de Jussieu in 1789 {{who first}} {{formally}} created a 'family' (<b>Narcissi),</b> as the seventh 'Ordo' (Order) {{of the third}} class (Stamina epigyna) of Monocots in which Narcissus and 15 other genera were placed. The {{use of the term}} Ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. The family has undergone much reorganisation since then, but in 1805 it was renamed after a different genus in the family, Amaryllis, as 'Amaryllideae' by Jaume St.-Hilaire and has retained that association since. Jaume St.-Hilaire divided the family into two unnamed sections and recognised five species of Narcissus, omitting N. serotinus.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{smallest}} species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species. <b>Narcissi</b> are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism.
