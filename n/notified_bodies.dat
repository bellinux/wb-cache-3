The conformity of Medical Devices and In-vitro Diagnostic Medical Device according to European Union Directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EEC must be assessed before sale is permitted. One of the major requirements to prove conformity is the implementation of the Quality Management System according ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 and ISO 14971. Although the European Union Directives do not mandate certification to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 the preferred method to prove compliance to such standards is to seek its official certification which is issued by certifying organizations known as [...] "Registrars". Several registrars also act as <b>Notified</b> <b>Body.</b> For those medical devices requiring the pre-market involvement of a <b>Notified</b> <b>Body,</b> the result of a positive assessment from the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> is the certificate of conformity allowing the CE mark and the permission to sell the medical device in the European Union.A very careful assessment of the company Quality Management System by the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body,</b> together with the review of the required Technical Documentation, is a major element which the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> takes into account to issue the certificate of conformity to the company product(s).|$|R

[...] For example, a <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices.
