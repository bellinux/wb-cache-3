India was facing an asking-rate of nearly 12 at 100 for 4 in the 12th over but Yuvraj's response was so forceful that all Dhoni <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> give him the strike. By the end, the partnership was 102 at exactly two runs a ball.|$|E
500|$|On April 3, 2014, Kane {{was accused}} of assault, after an {{incident}} in Vancouver, and sued for financial damages. On April 5, 2014, Kane was a healthy scratch under new head coach Paul Maurice, {{in a game against}} the Toronto Maple Leafs. After the game, Maurice said it was a coach's decision, and that if Kane wanted back in the lineup, all he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> [...] "probably just come to the rink." [...] On February 3, 2015 Kane was a healthy scratch against the Vancouver Canucks. It was later determined that he was scratched because of an incident with his teammates. Kane revealed in an October 2015 interview that he felt the Jets did not [...] "have his back" [...] throughout his legal and behavioral issues but instead felt that they traded away their problem. On August 1, Kane plead not guilty to charges alleging he grabbed three women during an altercation at a downtown Buffalo bar in June 2016.|$|E
500|$|After Richard was freed, {{he spent}} {{little time in}} England, instead concentrating on the war with King Philip II of France, which began with Philip's {{attempts}} to acquire Richard's possessions on the continent. Richard made Walter Chief Justiciar about 25 December 1193. Walter remained in England, raising money for the king's wars and overseeing {{the administration of the}} kingdom. The constant warfare forced Walter to find new means of raising money through taxation. The historian Doris Stenton wrote that the Pipe Rolls, or financial records, during Walter's time as justiciar [...] "give the impression of a country taxed to the limit". Walter was also responsible for choosing royal justices, and many of his choices were connected with, or had previously worked with, the archbishop in the royal administration. Because of Richard's absence from England, Walter was able to exercise more authority as justiciar than any of his predecessors. All that Walter <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> keep Richard's monetary needs satisfied. Combined with Walter's position as archbishop, Walter wielded a power unseen in England since the days of Lanfranc.|$|E

500|$|To {{bring about}} this battle, Themistocles used a cunning mix of subterfuge and misinformation, psychologically {{exploiting}} Xerxes's desire {{to finish the}} invasion. Xerxes's actions indicate that he was keen to finish the conquest of Greece in 480BC, and to do this, he needed a decisive victory over the Allied fleet. Themistocles sent a servant, Sicinnus, to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was [...] "on king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes". Themistocles claimed that the Allied commanders were infighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to block the straits. In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles {{seems to have been}} trying to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits. The message also had a secondary purpose, namely that {{in the event of an}} Allied defeat, the Athenians would probably receive some degree of mercy from Xerxes (having indicated their readiness to submit). At any rate, this was exactly the kind of news that Xerxes wanted to hear. Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out to effect the block. Perhaps overconfident and expecting no resistance, the Persian navy sailed into the Straits, only to find that, far from disintegrating, the Allied navy was ready for battle.|$|E

[...] All he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> speak his true name, and the gates would open and allow him in: unfortunately, when he tried [...] "Timothy Hunter", they stayed firmly shut. Tim set off to try to {{discover}} his true name, learning from Titania that she had named her child Tamar, son of Tamlin, before he ended up in Merlin's ice caves and learned about his unique origins. [...] Together, they defeated Tim's enemies and the young magician spoke his collection of true names to open the gates to the White School.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} touch up the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were never sure how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should live or die.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of budget}} constraints, the {{production}} crew will often recycle sets to save money. For instance, the hospital corridor for Smallville Medical Center {{was transformed into}} Lex’s cell in [...] "Asylum", which was later transformed into the asylum corridor, before finally being morphed into Dr. Teng’s laboratory in later episodes. When the production crew {{could not afford to}} rent a local night club, with all of the extras they needed, for more than one night they decided to film all of the wide shots—capturing the three hundred plus extras—on the first night. Then, with their remaining funds, they filmed close-ups of the actors with a limit of fifty extras in the background. When scenes in the season three premiere called for Lex to be stranded on a deserted island, instead of traveling to a beach, the crew found a mountain range in Vancouver that had an area in front of the mountain that resembled a beach. The resemblance was close enough that all they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to bring in some palm trees to complete the aesthetic they were going for. All of the island scenes were shot in one day.|$|E
2500|$|Gooch was enraged, {{as he was}} by Gower's mode of {{dismissal}} at {{a crucial}} stage {{of one of the}} Test matches. During the fourth Test at Adelaide, Gower walked out to the crease to the tune of Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. The last ball before lunch was bowled down the leg side to a leg trap, and all Gower <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> block. However, Gower flicked idly at the delivery and was caught at leg-slip. According to Mike Atherton in his autobiography, [...] "Gooch was at the other end and as he walked off his face was thunderous". This was another example of the strained relationship between the two. His score of nought in the second innings at Melbourne in 1991, when England were chasing quick runs for victory, ended his world record, unbroken sequence, of 119 Test innings without registering a duck. Gower scored 73 and 31* in the following matches against Pakistan; however on 9 August 1992 he was dismissed for one by Waqar Younis in what would be his last Test match, at The Oval. It is often thought that Gooch was instrumental in Gower being left out of the following tour of India. The selection decision prompted a vote of no confidence in the selectors at the MCC, but it was to no avail as Gower was not included. In response to Gooch's perceived regime of hard work over talent, Gower retired from international cricket in early 1993.|$|E

60|$|He was aweary, he said, {{and indeed}} he looked it; {{but he would}} not alight. He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this he broke out cursing and {{swearing}} anew. The bulletin-boarder referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once, with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris himself--although not successfully. He was of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious. It was for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish sentiment. There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing serious about stove-polish.
