40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with Data Envelopment Analysis of systems with <b>Natural</b> <b>Negative</b> Inputs, and <b>Natural</b> <b>Negative</b> Outputs, i. e. inputs and outputs that, by their nature less than zero. Examples of situations with only positive inputs and positive and <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> outputs are given and of situations in which both <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> inputs and <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> outputs occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to the former type of problem, in the literature, however, most available DEA software does not solve either type of problem. An exception to this is the DEA-Solver package (Cooper et al, 2000). However, most of the models of that package have the drawback that they cope with negative outputs and possibly negative inputs by assigning zero weights to them. The Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) model proposed by Cooper et al (2000) appears to be an attractive way to overcome this problem. It is shown that that model copes with the situation of <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> outputs only without modification. Once <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> inputs are incorporated, however, the SBM model no longer applies directly since efficiencies are no longer confined to the region (0, 1). Two approaches are suggested to overcome this difficulty. The first generates a modified efficiency measure based on the solution to an Additive DEA model. The second replaces the Efficiency measure by a Cost Benefit Ratio confined to the region (1, 0). This can be solved by a fractional planning approach. The solution to this fractional programming problem is equivalent to regarding negative outputs as pseudo-inputs and negative inputs as pseudo-outputs...|$|R

40|$|Velocities, optical risetimes, and {{transmission}} line model peak currents for seven natural positive return strokes are reported. The average 2 D positive return stroke velocity for channel segments {{of less than}} 500 m in length starting near {{the base of the}} channel is 0. 8 +/- 0. 3 x 10 exp 8 m/s, which is slower than the present corresponding average velocity for <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> first return strokes of 1. 7 +/- 0. 7 x 10 exp 8 /s. It is inferred that positive stroke peak currents in the literature, which assume the same velocity as negative strokes, are low by a factor of 2. The average 2 D positive return stroke velocity for channel segments of greater than 500 m starting near the base of the channel is 0. 9 +/- 0. 4 x 10 exp 8 m/s.

40|$|AbstractWe {{characterized}} β-synuclein, the non-amyloidogenic homolog of α-synuclein, as an inhibitor of aggregation of α-synuclein, {{a molecule}} implicated in Parkinson's disease. For this, doubly transgenic mice expressing human (h) α- and β-synuclein were generated. In doubly transgenic mice, β-synuclein ameliorated motor deficits, neurodegenerative alterations, and neuronal α-synuclein accumulation seen in hα-synuclein transgenic mice. Similarly, cell lines transfected with β-synuclein were resistant to α-synuclein accumulation. hα-synuclein was coimmunoprecipitated with hβ-synuclein in {{the brains of}} doubly transgenic mice and in the double-transfected cell lines. Our results raise the possibility that β-synuclein might be a <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> regulator of α-synuclein aggregation and that a similar class of endogenous factors might regulate the aggregation state of other molecules involved in neurodegeneration. Such an anti-amyloidogenic property of β-synuclein might also provide a novel strategy {{for the treatment of}} neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R

It will compare the practice with that of female circumcision, which is banned in developed nations but still practiced in the third world, as well as other forms of aggressive action, some once-prevalent, while disputing arguments made for parental ownership of the child, religious expression, cultural tradition, cleanliness, cosmetics, and conformity...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{studies on}} {{different}} classes of vertebrates could help clarify {{the role of}} cytokines in acceptance of the embryo by the maternal tissues. This review focuses on the cytokine interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and reports on its presence in the female reproductive tract of species with different reproductive strategies, that is, viviparity, oviparity, and ovuliparity. Unlike oviparity and viviparity, ovuliparity does not involve any contact between paternal-derived fetal antigens and maternal tissues, because eggs are released unfertilized in the external environment. Therefore, we consider ovuliparity a <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> control for mechanisms of materno-fetal immunotolerance. The goal of this review is to discuss {{the role of the}} IL- 1 system in the acquisition of the ability to retain the embryo in the female genital tract during the transition from ovuliparity to viviparity...|$|R

The active SUC+ genes are homologous. The suc 0 allele at the SUC 2 locus (suc 2 (0) in some strains is a silent gene or pseudogene.

Here we adapt this model {{to test the hypothesis}} that negative superhelical strain facilitates the formation of short-range (6 - 8 DNA turns) repression loops in E. coli. The <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> superhelicity of E. coli DNA is regulated by the interplay of gyrase and topoisomerase enzymes, adding or removing negative supercoils, respectively. Here, we measured quantitatively DNA looping in three different E. coli strains characterized by different levels of global supercoiling: wild type, gyrase mutant (gyrB 226), and topoisomerase mutant (ΔtopA 10). DNA looping in each strain was measured by assaying repression of the endogenous lac operon, and repression of ten reporter constructs with DNA loop sizes between 70 - 85 base pairs. Our data are most simply interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that negative supercoiling facilitates gene repression by small DNA-protein loops in living bacteria...|$|R

The ability to regulate emotions brings into question how difficult/easy it is for individuals that have a more natural positive bias/disposition to them, or have a more <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> bias/disposition to them. We would expect someone with a negative disposition to have a more difficult time regulating his or her emotions, as evidenced by the elevated EMG levels and EDA readings that we acquired. The {{purpose of this study was}} to better understand the way one perceives surprised expressions, as surprised expressions are generally more of an ambiguous type of expression, and how they can act as a gateway to interpret one’s overall social and emotional bias. These interpretations can help us understand how one regulates their emotions, which could help those with a more negative bias, obtain the tools necessary to develop a healthier and more positive outlook on life...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring the {{development}} of the cerebral cortex, Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells settle in the preplate and coordinate the precise growth of the neocortex. Indeed, CR cells migrate tangentially from specific proliferative regions of the telencephalon (for example, the cortical hem (CH)) to populate the entire cortical surface. This is a very finely tuned process regulated by an emerging number of factors that has been sequentially revealed in recent years. However, the putative participation of one of the major families of axon guidance molecules in this process, the Semaphorins, was not explored. Here we show that Semaphorin- 3 E (Sema 3 E) is a <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> regulator of the migration of PlexinD 1 -positive CR cells originating in the CH. Our results also indicate that Sema 3 E/PlexinD 1 signalling controls the motogenic potential of CR cells in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, absence of Sema 3 E/PlexinD 1 signalling increased the migratory properties of CR cells. This modulation implies negative effects on CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 signalling and increased ADF/Cofilin activity...|$|R
40|$|DNA inversions are {{mutations}} involving major rearrangements of {{the genome}} and are often regarded as either deleterious or catastrophic to gene function and {{can be associated with}} genomic disorders, such as Hunter syndrome and some forms of hemophilia. Here, we propose that DNA inversions are also an essential and hitherto unrecognized component of gene evolution in eukaryotic cells. Specifically, we provide evidence that an ancestral neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene was duplicated and that one copy retained its original function, whereas an internal DNA inversion occurred in the other. Crucially, the inversion resulted in the creation of new regulatory elements required for the termination and activation of transcription. In consequence, the duplicated gene was split, and two new and independently expressed genes were created. Through its dependence on DNA inversion, this is a fundamentally new scheme for gene evolution, which we show as being of particular relevance to the generation of endogenous antisense-containing RNA molecules. Functionally, such transcripts can operate as <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> regulators of the expression of the genes to which they are related through a common ancestor...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} characterized VE-statin/egfl 7, {{a protein}} that is exclusively secreted by endothelial cells and modulates smooth muscle cell migration. Here, {{we show that}} VE-statin/egfl 7 is the first known <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> regulator of vascular elastogenesis. Transgenic mice, expressing VE-statin/egfl 7 {{under the control of}} keratin- 14 promoter, showed an accumulation of VE-statin/egfl 7 in arterial walls where its presence correlated with an impaired organization of elastic fibres. In vitro, fibroblasts cultured in the presence of VE-statin/egfl 7 were unable to deposit elastic fibres due to a deficient conversion of soluble tropoelastin into insoluble mature elastin. VE-statin/egfl 7 interacts with the catalytic domain of lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzymes and, in endothelial cells, endogenous VE-statin/ egfl 7 colocalizes with LoxL 2 and inhibits elastic fibre deposition. In contrast, mature elastic fibres are abun-dantly deposited by endothelial cells that are prevented from producing endogenous VE-statin/egfl 7. We propose a model where VE-statin/egfl 7 produced by endothelial cells binds to the catalytic domains of enzymes of the LOX family in the vascular wall, thereby preventing the cross-link of tropoelastin molecules into mature elastin poly-mers and regulating vascular elastogenesis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{ground-based}} measurements at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) {{have greatly}} improved {{our knowledge of}} the energetics, fluence, and evolution of X-ray emissions during natural cloud-to-ground (CG) and rocket-triggered lightning flashes. In this paper, using Monte Carlo simulations and the response matrix of unshielded detectors in the Thunderstorm Energetic Radiation Array (TERA), we calculate the energy spectra of X-rays as would be detected by TERA and directly compare with the observational data during event MSE 10 - 01. The good agreement obtained between TERA measurements and theoretical calculations supports the mechanism of X-ray production by thermal runaway electrons during the negative corona flash stage of stepping lightning leaders. Modeling results also suggest that measurements of X-ray bursts can be used to estimate the approximate range of potential drop of lightning leaders. Moreover, the X-ray images produced during the leader stepping process in <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> CG discharges, including both the evolution and morphological features, are theoretically quantified. We show that the compact emission pattern as recently observed in X-ray images is likely produced by X-rays originating from the source region and the diffuse emission pattern {{can be explained by the}} Compton scattering effects...|$|R

40|$|C 1 q is the {{recognition}} subunit {{of the first}} component of the classical complement pathway. It participates in clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells {{as well as in}} defense against pathogens. Inappropriate activation of the complement contributes to cellular and tissue damage in different pathologies, urging the need for the development of therapeutic agents that are able to inhibit the complement system. In this study, we report heme as an inhibitor of C 1 q. Exposure of C 1 q to heme significantly reduced the activation of the classical complement pathway, mediated by C-reactive protein (CRP) and IgG. Interaction analyses revealed that heme reduces the binding of C 1 q to CRP and IgG. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibition of C 1 q interactions results from a direct binding of heme to C 1 q. Formation of complex of heme with C 1 q caused changes in the mechanism of recognition of IgG and CRP. Taken together, our data suggest that heme is a <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> regulator of the classical complement pathway at the level of C 1 q. Heme may play a role at sites of excessive tissue damage and hemolysis where large amounts of free heme are released...|$|R
40|$|Thymocytes are {{positively}} or negatively selected depending on interactions between their T cell receptors (TCR) and peptides presented by {{major histocompatibility complex}} molecules. We have previously shown that apoptosis of thymocytes from an αβ TCR-transgenic mouse (F 5), induced by antigenic peptide, can be inhibited specifically by an antagonist peptide variant in an in vitro culture model. We have now extended these experiments by demonstrating that the antagonist peptide can inhibit <b>natural</b> <b>negative</b> selection of maturing thymocytes, induced by endogenously expressed antigen, in fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOC). This inhibition resulted in the rescue and maturation of thymocytes that {{would otherwise have been}} deleted. Mature T cells generated in these cultures were able to respond to antigen by producing limited quantities of interferon-γ, but unlike T cells from control FTOC, they required exogenous interleukin- 2 to generate cytolytic effector cells. Interestingly, the antagonist peptide also accelerated the development of F 5 thymocytes {{in the absence of the}} negatively selecting ligand. These data suggest that the developmental fate of a thymocyte may be determined by the recognition of multiple distinct peptide ligands during thymic selection. Alterations in the profiles of selecting peptides presented in the thymus would thus have profound effects on the size and autoreactive potential of the T cell repertoire generated...|$|R
