40|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>filters</b> are {{preprocessing}} techniques {{designed to}} improve data quality in classification tasks by detecting and eliminating examples that contain errors or <b>noise.</b> However, <b>filtering</b> can also remove correct examples and examples containing valuable information, which could be useful for learning. This fact usually implies a margin of improvement on the noise detection accuracy for almost any <b>noise</b> <b>filter.</b> This paper proposes a scheme to improve the performance of <b>noise</b> <b>filters</b> in multi-class classification problems, based on decomposing the dataset into multiple binary subproblems. Decomposition strategies {{have proven to be}} successful in improving classification performance in multi-class problems by generating simpler binary subproblems.

In order to integrate the filtering results achieved in the binary subproblems, our proposal uses a soft voting approach considering a reliability level based on the aggregation of the noise degree prediction calculated for each binary classifier.
