40|$|This study {{dealt with}} a {{restoration}} project conducted at South-East New Territories Landfill in Hong Kong, in order to screen suitable tree and shrub species (both native and pioneer species) for revegetation. For engineered landfills, landfill gas migration and leachate contamination to the topsoil are rarely problematic, {{but the lack of}} nutrients and moisture and poor physical soil conditions may jeopardize potential woodland establishment. The growth performance of 25 woody plant species subjected to 12 different soil amelioration and seedlings planting methods was compared. The results showed that the general performance (mortality rate, apical height, crown diameter and basal diameter) of pioneer species (notably Acacia species) was much better than that of native species in all blocks of woodland mix and scrub mix. The <b>notch</b> <b>planting</b> method was effective in helping seedling roots to have better contact with soil for water uptake, which subsequently increased the survival rates of seedlings, leading to a better tree coverage. Soil ameliorations (horticultural soil with fertilizer and horse and pig manure) generally increased the seedling survival rate and improved plant growth. Tree coverage on all the plant trial blocks was mainly established by the three Acacia species. A planting distance of 1 m was recommended for woodland establishment, and such dense seedlings planting would achieve a better tree coverage under a shorter period of time (than the distance of 3 m). Difficulties in woodland establishment were discussed, and the strategies for achieving a better tree growth were recommended. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|E
50|$|Thlaspi caerulescens {{is a low}} {{biennial}} or perennial {{plant that}} has small basal rosettes of stalked elliptic-lanceolate leaves with entire margins. The one or more flowering stems have small stalkless, alternate leaves clasping the stem. The inflorescence is a dense raceme which continues to lengthen after flowering. The individual flowers are regular, with white or pinkish petals and are about 5 mm wide. Each has four sepals, four petals, six stamens (four long and two short) with violet anthers, and a single carpel. The fruit is many-seeded and narrowly spatulate and has a <b>notched</b> tip. This <b>plant</b> flowers in late spring.|$|R
50|$|Lixus concavus {{is able to}} {{complete}} its lifecycle in the stalks of curly dock, sunflowers, and thistles; eggs are laid singly in 1/8 in cavities, created by feeding activity, and hatch within a week to 10 days. One grub usually develops per plant, the larva having borrowed through the stalk down to ground level, where pupation occurs after around nine weeks; the larva chews an exit hole for the adults before pupating. The pupa is whitish and measures 14-15 mm long. The head bears the long snout of the adult form. The abdominal segments are marked with short spines. The larva takes {{a few weeks to}} develop into an adult that feeds for a few weeks before seeking out a site to overwinter. The weevil has one generation per year. The adult weevil feeds upon the margins of the leaves besides puncturing the stalks; damage appears as distinct <b>notches</b> in the <b>plant</b> tissues.|$|R
40|$|Leaf tensile {{strength}} was measured for four resurrection plants, Craterostigma wilmsii Engl, Xerophyta schlecteri (Baker) N. L. Menezes, Xerophyta humilis (Baker) T. Durand & Schinz and Sporobolus stapfianus Gandoger, {{as well as}} two desiccation-sensitive controls, Zea mays L. and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (ecotype Columbia) at full hydration and after dehydration, both on the plant (naturally-dried) and rapidly off the plant causing death (flash-dried). In the desiccation-tolerant plants, leaf {{tensile strength}} was higher in the monocots than the dicots at full hydration. Three different mechanisms of cell protection occur in resurrection plants on drying: cell-wall folding, packing vacuoles with non-aqueous solute or a combination of the two. Tensile strength in C. wilmsii (dicot) increased when naturally-dried but decreased when flash-dried, possibly {{due to the nature of}} the drying mechanisms (wall folding). The, leaf tensile strength of the Xerophyte species, both monocots, increased when naturally dried and when flashdried. Xerophyte species pack their vacuoles during desiccation. S. stapfianus, a grass which uses a combination of wall folding and vacuole packing, had the highest tensile strength possibly due to its unique architectural structure. Differences in leaf architecture, in terms of lignin content, were examined using light microscopy after histo-chemical staining for lignin, which showed that monocotyledons had a higher percentage of lignin per unit leaf cross-sectional area than dicotyledons. A regression analysis revealed that leaf tensile strength and lignin content were positively correlated in fully hydrated leaves I but no relationship existed between lignin content and naturally dried leaves. This may be due to variations of protective mechanisms induced during desiccation by the four resurrection <b>plants.</b> <b>Notching</b> was observed in X schlechteri, behaving differently to grasses which are notch-insensitive, possibly due to large lignin contents on the outer edges of the leaves...|$|R
