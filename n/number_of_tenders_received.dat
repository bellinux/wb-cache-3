40|$|Objective : Fibromyalgia {{syndrome}} (FMS) is {{a chronic}} rheumatological condition {{which could be}} characterized by generalized pain and fatigue. Cognitive and behavioral therapy {{has been found to}} be a suitable technique in the management of FMS. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy of electromyography (EMG) biofeedback to reduce pain in patients with FMS. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled trial involving two groups of FMS patients, one receiving EMG biofeedback and the other a sham biofeedback, was carried out. The assessment tools included in the study were fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), visual analogue scale (VAS), six-minute walk test (SMWT) and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points; and tenderness <b>of</b> each <b>tender</b> point was done for both the groups. Statistics: A Student&#x 2032;s &#x 2032;t&#x 2032; test was used to study the test for significance. Results: After using biofeedback, the mean VAS scores and the mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points were found to be 3 out of 10 and 6 out of 18 respectively. Subjective analysis from both groups showed improvement in physical and psychological realms. Statistical significance (P < 0. 001) was observed for decrease in pain and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points.

PatientsFifty-nine ambulatory patients (26 males and 33 females, mean±SD age: 46. 3 ± 12 yrs) with common neck pain but no radiation below the elbow. MethodsTwo medical practitioners (a junior and a senior consultant) assessed neck rotation (in degrees) {{and the presence of}} pain during maximum neck flexion and extension, muscle palpation trapezius, levator scapulae, splenius cervicis, semispinalis) and cervical spine palpation. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated for qualitative variables. Angular rotational values (as a continuous variable) were compared using the p coefficient. Pearson coefficient was used to correlate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> spots to the results of the questionnaire. ResultsThere was no significant interexaminer difference (± 10 °) in the neck rotation measurement. Kappa was (i) 0. 71 and 0. 76 for pain in flexion or extension, respectively, (ii) 0. 44 on average for palpation of various muscles and (iii) 0. 53 on average for cervical spine palpation.

The aim of this work was to investigate the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect the differences in cerebral chemical changes between FM patients and control participants. Thirty patients with primary FM (27 females and three males) were selected from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University Hospitals. Patients with primary FM fulfill the American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis of FM. Ten persons were needed as healthy control participants with the same age and sex as the included patients. 1 H-MRS unit was used to assess N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and their ratios from both hippocampi. Our Results showed the following: {{there was a significant difference}} in the level of l-hippocampal (NAA) and right hippocampus Cho and the levels of hippocampal glutamate/glutamine (Glx) in the patient group compared with the control group. There is a highly significant difference between the level of Rt and Lt hippocampal Glx in the same patient, highly significant difference in the level of Rt and Lt hippocampal NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and left hippocampal Cho/Cr ratios between cases and controls, and there was a negative correlation between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points and the level of Lt hippocampal Cr.

This study was planned {{to gain a}} better understanding of the factors that may impact the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia. Material and Methods: The study was carried out in the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation outpatient clinic with 35 women with fibromyalgia and 20 healthy women with no current or past medical history as controls. The subjects were evaluated with digital palpation to test tender points, by algometric measurements to test pressure pain threshold, the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) scores to test pain severity, and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) to test quality of life.

The mean±SD age of patients was 11 ± 2. 7 years and with a disease duration range of 1 – 10 years and median of 4 years. Disease activity was measured by: juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS 27), 100 -mm pain visual analogue scale (VAS), global physician-rated assessment of disease activity and parent/patient global assessment. Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) {{was used to assess}} functional ability. Psychological function was assessed by using depression scale for children of the center for epidemiological studies (CES-DC).

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To study {{whether the}} {{reporting}} of clinical outcomes in arthritis trials measured on ordinal and interval scales is adequate in relation to meta-analysis.  METHODS—Systematic review of randomised trials of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Optimal reporting was defined as data in the original ordered categories for global evaluation and pain, and as mean and SD for <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> joints and grip strength, and if a visual analogue scale {{had been used to}} measure pain.  RESULTS—A total of 144  trials were included. The median sample size was 60  patients. The quality of the reporting increased over time for three of the four variables. Global evaluation was optimally reported in 52  of the 127  trials (41 %) in which it was recorded. Pain was optimally reported in 27  of 98  trials (28 %), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> joints in 41  of 123  trials (33 %), and grip strength in 34  of 124  trials (27 %).

As most trials are underpowered, meta-analysis is indispensable and the deficit therefore needs urgent improvement. Investigators should specify a priori what constitutes an important treatment effect and report <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> patients improved. ...|$|R

We investigated the efficacy and safety of low dose GH as an adjunct to standard therapy in the treatment of severe, prolonged and well-treated fibromyalgia patients with low IGF- 1 levels. Methods Twenty-four patients were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, best available care-controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0. 0125 mg/kg/d of GH subcutaneously (titrated depending on IGF- 1) added to standard therapy or standard therapy alone during one year.

MethodsThe sample consisted of 198 university-age students (male and female) aged between 18 and 29. In accordance with back pain diagnoses, they were separated into two groups: with or without nonspecific chronic low back pain. Both groups were evaluated by a “blinded” observer with no knowledge to the presence or otherwise of lower back pain. Questionnaires concerning clinical-demographic characteristics, life style, quality of life (SF- 36 questionnaire), pain visual analogical scales (VAS), and physical examination were applied. ResultsA univariate analysis showed a statistically significant association (P< 0. 05) with the presence of low back pain and some factors. There was a negative association between low back pain and the following variables: BMI, health self-assessment, VAS and some SF- 36 domains (physical functioning, body pain, general health, vitality, social functioning). There was a positive correlation with the following variables: global pain by VAS, presence of diffuse pain and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points.
