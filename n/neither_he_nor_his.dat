5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> brother would take vengeance {{on those who}} had voted against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, {{even if they did}} not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed {{on top of another}} on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 1864, {{before the}} siege of Paysandú, the Paraguayan {{dictator}} Solano López seized the Brazilian steamer Marquês de Olinda, beginning the Paraguayan War. While the Army of the South crossed Uruguay heading toward Paysandú, Brazil's government sent José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to replace Saraiva. He arrived in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires on 2 December {{and a few days}} later sought a formal alliance with Mitre against the Blancos. The Argentine president refused, insisting that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> government had any role in Flores' rebellion, and that Argentina would remain neutral. On 26 December, the Paraguayans invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, laying waste to towns and the countryside.|$|E

5|$|This {{desertion}} further discouraged Bardanes, and, {{reluctant to}} face the loyalist army in battle, he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph, the hegumenos of the Kathara monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI's second marriage. Bardanes received a letter signed by the Patriarch Tarasios and several leading senators which guaranteed that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> subordinates would be punished if they surrendered. As a further guarantee of good faith, Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter. Satisfied by these assurances, on 8 September Bardanes left his army and, through Nicaea, sought refuge in the monastery of Herakleios at Cius. From there, he embarked on a ship that {{took him to the}} island of Prote. Taking the monastic name Sabbas, Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{internal}} {{tensions and}} economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga traveled to the Crimea by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister Grand Duchess Xenia. They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12miles (19km) from Yalta, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces. On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment. He was named after Tikhon of Zadonsk, the Saint venerated near the Grand Duchess's estate at Olgino. Although Tikhon was the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> younger brother Guri received any title as his father was a commoner.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} {{potential}} transfers to West Ham and Torquay, because <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> wife {{wanted to live}} in either place, Irvine decided to sign for Third Division outfit Halifax Town in December 1972. Despite taking a considerable pay cut, he chose Halifax to enable his family to return to live near Burnley. Irvine made a total of 11 first-team appearances for Halifax Town, scoring one goal for the club. He played his last competitive game for the club in the 1–0 win against York City on 13 March 1973, after manager George Mulhall accused Irvine of not trying and not deserving his wage. At the end of the 1972–73 season, the team avoided relegation to the Fourth Division on goal difference. After failing to report for the away game at Walsall on 1May 1973, to play in a testimonial match for Burnley defender John Angus, he was fined two weeks' wages and forced into extra training sessions. In the summer of 1973, Irvine left Halifax Town by mutual consent, his professional football career over at the age of 29. Despite having the option to sign for Rochdale, he joined semi-professional side Great Harwood, who played in the Northern Premier League. At Great Harwood, he played alongside two former Burnley teammates; goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw and midfielder Les Latcham. Irvine remained at the club for a number of months, before leaving midway through the 1973–74 season and retiring from football altogether.|$|E

25|$|On December 21, {{during the}} battle around Gleize, the men of Kampfgruppe Peiper {{captured}} an American officer, Major Harold D. McCown, who was leading one of the battalions of the 119th U.S. Infantry Regiment. Having heard about the Malmedy massacre, McCown personally asked Peiper about his fate {{and that of his}} men. McCown testified that Peiper told him <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> men were at any risk and that he (Peiper) was not accustomed to killing his prisoners. McCown noted that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> men were threatened in any manner, and he testified in Peiper's defence during the 1946 trial in Dachau.|$|E
25|$|August 15: Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone {{paid his}} respects at the Yasukuni shrine, which {{initiated}} criticism by People's Republic of China {{for the first}} time.

25|$|Thomas Spencer Forsaith, JP (18 July 1814 – 29 November 1898), was a New Zealand {{politician}} and an Auckland draper.

60|$|Just then Nam arrived, {{having been}} let down by Olfan and the captains, and stood glaring round him, not without awe, for <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> any of <b>his</b> brethren had ever dared {{to visit the}} sacred home of the Snake-god.

25|$|Yet another belief {{was that}} the fairies were demons entirely. This belief became much more popular {{with the growth of}} Puritanism. The hobgoblin, once a {{friendly}} household spirit, became a wicked goblin. Dealing with fairies was in some cases considered a form of witchcraft and punished as such in this era. Disassociating himself from such evils may be why Oberon, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, carefully observed that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> court feared the church bells.|$|E
25|$|CADET BRANCH: Marc-Antoine de Lafourcade, born in Condom on 26 December 1676, married Bernarde de Ponteil de Castillon in 1715.

25|$|On May 12, Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga, a Mai Mai militia leader, {{surrendered}} to MONUC in Katanga with 150 combatants, mostly child soldiers. According to MONUC, the transitional government offered Gedeon a command position and officer's rank with {{integration into the}} army. He and his forces stood accused {{of at least a}} dozen summary executions of civilians and the destruction of numerous electoral identification cards, but at year's end he remained in Lubumbashi, Katanga Province and <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> forces had been charged with any crime.|$|E

During the Mexican War, Lowrey enlisted as a private in the 2nd Mississippi Volunteers in 1847. <b>Neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> regiment ever saw action in the conflict, and Lowrey was mustered out in July 1848.|$|E
25|$|Before Sajal's friends left, they tied {{him up to}} a {{chair and}} gagged him, to give the {{appearance}} {{that he was a}} victim too. Initially, he was able to allay suspicions. However, the Kolkata Police became suspicious, since he showed no signs of a struggle or any other injuries. Upon interrogation, he confessed to committing the murders and detailed the crimes. <b>Neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> accomplices showed any signs of remorse. Even when the death sentence was announced, the group chose to clap and sing in unison. Later, the Calcutta High Court reduced the sentence to life imprisonment.|$|E

In 1834 her sister Jenny married Joseph von Laßberg, a specialist in medieval German poetry. The following summer, Annette and her mother travelled to Laßberg's castle Eppishausen in the Swiss Alps. She was inspired by the scenery and on friendly terms with Laßberg, but <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> friends appreciated modern literature and Droste's hopes that they might help her to publish her work came to nothing.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Henry in 1807, the Jacobite claims passed to those {{excluded}} by the Act of Settlement: initially to the House of Savoy (1807–1840), then to the Modenese branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (1840–1919), and finally to the House of Wittelsbach (1919–present). Franz, Duke of Bavaria is the current Jacobite heir. <b>Neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> any of <b>his</b> predecessors since 1807 have pursued their claim.

Alerted by the lighthouse keeper, customs officers and fishermen sailed towards the scene, picking survivors on the water.|$|E
25|$|Dolegiewicz {{had begun}} to covertly use and sell {{anabolic}} steroids over this period. In mid-1981 he sold 500 tablets of Dianabol to track coach Charlie Francis, marking the beginning of sprinter Ben Johnson's drug use. The 1982 season saw him win his last national title in the shot put, but he also managed to win his first international medal in the discus that year, taking the bronze at the 1982 Commonwealth Games behind Bradley Cooper of the Bahamas and Rob Gray (Canada's {{number one in the}} event). The inaugural World Championships in Athletics was held in 1983 and Dolegiewicz was in attendance for Canada. However, <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> compatriot Bruno Pauletto progressed past the qualification stage.

Toronto lost a return match in Rochester, but {{in the third and}} final game of their season, the Chefs defeated a team from Buffalo at Toronto by a score of 18–0. Conacher was again the star, rushing for two touchdowns and scoring 13 of his team's points. He organized the team for a second year in 1934, known as the Wrigley Aromints due to new sponsorship, and again played an exhibition schedule as the team remained unaffiliated with any league. The team again played three games, winning all three. However, at the age of 34 years, Conacher found that the game was too hard on his body physically, and <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> <b>nor</b> <b>his</b> team returned for a third season.|$|E
