40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{which allows the}} vessel engineer to more accurately evaluate the flexibility and stresses in vessel nozzles within the time and expense parameters associated with the normal design process. In a critical process piping system design, the vessel design engineer first calculates nozzle stiffnesses for inclusion of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>spring</b> constants in the piping system analysis. The loads generated from piping analysis are then fed back to the vessel engineer for stress calculation. In an earlier paper “Improving the Accuracy of Piping programs When Analyzing Closely Coupled Equipment, ” the wide divergence in nozzle stiffnesses and stresses computed by the available formula approaches was illustrated. Additionally, it was shown that it is desirable to use the Finite Element approach to better assess both the stiffnesses and the stresses in vessel nozzles. To facilitate FE nozzle modeling, a parametric-driven program was developed to aid the vessel engineer in using the FE program COSMOS/M...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Spring</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{are widely}} used in deaerators. The spray issued from a <b>spring</b> <b>nozzle</b> was studied numerically with an adapted volume of fluid method {{combined}} with a continuous surface force model to capture the gas–liquid interface dynamics. The present analysis focuses on {{the formation of a}} water film and the generation of droplets near the <b>spring</b> <b>nozzle</b> outlet. The numerical simulation results show that the water film breaks up to droplets at the location 20 ~ 25 cm from the nozzle exit vertically. The vortical structures are formed due to the interaction between the liquid film and the surrounding air, which leads to air recirculation and water film instability. When the inlet water velocity decreases from 5. 33 m/s to 4. 1 m/s, it results in a slightly reduced spray angle. But the vertical break up length is not obviously influenced. The water sheet disintegration is probably at the transition state between Rayleigh and first wind-induced breakup regimes...|$|R
40|$|Simple, passive nozzle {{requires}} no active control system to vary injection area. Injection area changes with changing pressure, thereby allowing greater flow as pressure increases. As pressure drop across <b>nozzle</b> is decreased, <b>spring</b> action of segments {{causes them to}} move inward, decreasing the flow area...|$|R
5000|$|Common {{garden hose}} trigger nozzles are a simple {{example of the}} plug nozzle and its method of operation. In this example the nozzle {{consists}} of a conical or bell shaped opening with a plug on a movable rod positioned {{in front of the}} nozzle. The plug looks similar to a poppet valve. The stem of the valve runs back through the body of the nozzle body to a [...] "trigger", normally a long lever running down the back of the <b>nozzle</b> assembly. A <b>spring</b> keeps the valve pressed against the opening under normal use, thereby providing a failsafe cut-off that stops the flow of water when the nozzle is dropped.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} a needle-free injector (NFI), {{which has}} been studied as an administration device to the subcutaneous tissue, as a device to deliver drugs into skin tissues. ShimaJet? used for self-injection of insulin was selected as a spring-powered NFI in this study. Weak (NFI-w) and strong (NFI-s) injectors were evaluated. Rhodamine 6 G, as a model compound, was injected onto the skin surface of hairless rats and the skin distribution and amount released from {{the skin of the}} compound were followed. A modified nozzle (able to inject at an angle of 45 degrees) was prepared in addition to the conventional dedicated <b>nozzle.</b> The <b>spring</b> constants, <b>nozzle</b> shapes and penetration enhancer, 1 -[2 -(decylthio) ethyl] azacyclopentane- 2 -one (HPE- 101), affected not only the skin distribution, but also the release profiles of rhodamine 6 G. In addition, the release profiles of rhodamine 6 G after injection using NFI-w or NFI-s obeyed diffusion-controlled or membrane-controlled kinetics, respectively. This difference was probably due to the skin site (depth) of rhodamine 6 G delivered by the NFI. Furthermore, HPE- 101 increased the retention time of rhodamine 6 G in the epidermis. The present results suggested that an NFI can be a useful tool for enhanced drug delivery into skin...|$|R
