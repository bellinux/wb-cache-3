Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs.

25|$|Some {{argue that}} it is {{impossible}} to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect. Dennett points out that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|E

25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> {{necessary}} for the body schema {{to be able to}} integrate and form a three-dimensional representation of the body, but it also {{plays an important role in}} tool use. Studies recording neuronal activity in the intraparietal cortex in macaques have shown that, with training, the macaque body schema updates to include tools, such as those used for reaching, into the body schema. In humans, body schema plays an important role in both simple and complex tool use, far beyond that of macaques. Extensive training is also not {{necessary for}} this integration.|$|E
25|$|During {{the process}} of {{drafting}} the plan, many residents expressed a desire for a national chain retailer or restaurant to be enticed to locate near or in downtown as a draw. The plan considers this ill-advised and unlikely to happen for several reasons. Chains {{do not like to}} pioneer a new area, instead preferring to cluster with each other, and this leads to the development of large strip malls, impractical and undesirable in downtown Ossining, which still shows the scars of previous demolitions for urban renewal. Ossining as a whole is also geographically undesirable for chains, since <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> neither affluent enough or accessible enough from major highways, the Hudson River cuts the potential trade area for such stores in half.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{elements}} in the novel were inspired by Adams' time at university. For example, one plot thread involves moving a sofa which is irreversibly stuck on the staircase to Richard MacDuff's apartment; according to his simulations, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> impossible to remove it, {{but there is no}} way for it to have got into that position in the first place. In a similar incident that occurred while Douglas Adams attended St John's College, Cambridge, furniture was placed in the rooms overlooking the river in Third Court while the staircases were being refurbished. When the staircases were completed, it was discovered that the sofas could no longer be removed from the rooms, and the sofas remained in those rooms for several decades.|$|E

Roughly located around the Warren Point and Lyncrest areas, the district also extends {{as far as}} Morlot Avenue along the tracks, roughly around or a little after Glen Rock Lumber, housing many industries on Banta Place. The Broadway District is mainly a shopping district as it contains many stores, eateries, hobby centers, salons, and other businesses. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> the largest stretch of stores within Fair Lawn, it also houses {{one of the highest}} densities of nail and beauty salons in the United States. The Broadway District stretches from the Route 4 split with Route 208 and continues all through Fair Lawn and includes a few blocks of Elmwood Park before continuing to Downtown Paterson via the Broadway Bus Terminal. Broadway also hosts the route of local Paterson-New York Spanish Company mini buses, known locally as guaguas, as a cheaper alternative for commuters to and from New York. It is not only the sole district within the Borough that gives access to the guaguas but is {{one of only a handful}} of Bergen-Passaic-Hudson districts that even offers this service.|$|E
