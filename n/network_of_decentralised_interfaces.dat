40|$|Abstract—This paper {{begins by}} {{describing}} the behavioural shift in online interactivity {{and how it}} has empowered the growth <b>of</b> online social <b>networks</b> and emergent forms of social awareness. It then discusses the notion <b>of</b> <b>decentralised,</b> peer-to-peer social <b>networks</b> and how this has been largely motivated by ideals that include giving users greater control over the data that they share {{in order to protect}} their privacy. At the same time it discusses the motivation for opportunistic contact that takes place when people are in geographical proximity (e. g. in the same office or attending the same event) and how those opportunities seem to establish the right context in which one can share and interpret ideas. Based on the hypothesis that the value of opportunistic contact in decentralised, peer-to-peer networks is {{more than the sum of}} its parts, we describe the deployment and evaluation of an application that lets users build opportunistic social <b>networks,</b> making use <b>of</b> <b>decentralised,</b> peer-to-peer infrastructures to ensure that users are in control of their information and leveraging geographic proximity for the exchange of ideas at the right place at the right time. The evaluation of this approach in an academic environment establishes opportunities and challenges for opportunistic social networks and a clear potential of this approach in terms of trust, context, and filtration to increase and improve social awareness...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary peacebuilding, notably as it {{is practiced}} in Afghanistan, {{consistently}} fails to address local needs in favour of international priorities for global security. Despite the significant presence of foreign agencies and aid mechanisms in the country, peace in Afghanistan remains elusive. Any semblance of peace achieved is neither durable, nor sustainable, particularly because of international ignorance of on-the-ground environmental and social realities, with specific reference to natural resource management and gender dynamics. These failures are localised in Bamyan, a small valley in Afghanistan’s Central Highlands, most well known for its historic Buddhist complex, circa 6 th century. An anomaly, Bamyan is a pocket of peace in an otherwise turbulent country, {{a direct result of}} global interest (and therein foreign engagement) in the preservation of eight archaeological sites in the valley. Yet the valley’s ‘World Heritage’ designation (2003) has ultimately prescribed a development policy that emphasises heritage conservation over local socio-economic livelihoods. In so doing, the people of Bamyan are still today incredibly vulnerable, subject to insecurity in their water resource base, which is further aggravated by a changing climate and transition to urbanity. Critiquing present models of peacebuilding, this thesis is an advocate for the agency of design in fragile states. Specifically, the thesis suggests that the intersection of architecture, infrastructure, and ecology creates a framework for sustainable development that is grounded in local conditions and livelihoods. Herein, peacebuilding becomes a bottom-up, pro-active process, engaging with, and responding to, the needs of local people as a means of building a paradigm of self-sufficiency. That is, the thesis strives for ‘positive’ peace, with the intention of cultivating relationships of solidarity between and among communities. In Bamyan, opportunity for this is found through shared spaces for water. Water has important ecological and cultural implications. Rehabilitation of water infrastructure is necessary to restore the valley’s denuded landscape. Ritual importance of water additionally provides occasion for community gathering and social encounter, both for men and for women. Women especially, are integral to the peace process as their presence, in Afghan society, enables the ‘family space,’ a safe, gender-neutral, and culturally appropriate space for informal, public community gathering. Accordingly, the thesis proposes a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> physical, ecological, and social infrastructures throughout the local watershed of Bamyan that seek to build enduring social and environmental resilience. Integration of vernacular and modern technologies capitalises on local knowledge and historical models of behaviour. Participation of the community in the building process moreover strengthens social relations, producing a shared sense of ownership in the peace process. This is explored through detailed design of one node in the network, a washing house along Bamyan River, which connects water and women as mechanisms for enduring peace, uncovering the potential of shared spaces for water to mobilise community solidarity, empower cultural identity, and build human dignity. Coupling ecological and cultural systems draws on the existing and the essential, and the thesis thus conceives a practice of design that can appropriately engage in, and foster, sustainable peace in fragile states...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Germany, {{the energy}} system is {{undergoing}} reorganisation from a centralised {{system based on}} fossil fuels and nuclear power to a sustainable system based on decentralised production and consumption of energy, the so-called Energiewende. Recently, there has been more attention to improving energy efficiency in those regions where conventional energy production activities and energy-intensive industries are located, such as the Ruhr area. Although the potential for decentralised {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) units is high in this region, local action plans show only modest developments for this technology. In this paper, we address this issue by answering the following research question: Which factors block the uptake and integration <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> CHP in the German Ruhr area's energy system? Methods: The multilevel perspective (MLP) was used to analyse the state of system innovation in relation to the uptake and integration <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> CHP technology. Prior to the MLP analysis, a stakeholders' analysis was conducted to identify stakeholders' views, positions and experienced barriers regarding the uptake and integration <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> CHP technology. Data collection included review of text documents and conducting 11 interviews. Results: Due to many regime barriers blocking niche development, the uptake <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> CHP technology is limited. Identified barriers relate to lack of market services and mismatches with user preferences, (sectoral) policies and industrial interests. Conclusions: Observed barriers relate to (i) lack of market services such as financial means for making investments; (ii) user awareness such as unawareness and information deficit regarding the benefits <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> CHP to potential users, (iii) the presence of centralised district heating systems, (iv) policy issues such as lack of sufficient policies supporting diffusion <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> CHP units, legal stipulations from social housing policies that prevent housing cooperatives from becoming energy producers and district heating systems owned by public and private owners (via concessions contracts); (v) sector issues such as lack of skilledservice-providing companies; and (vi) industrial interested such as the vested interests of the coal and gasindustry. Moreover, many of the mentioned barriers seem interrelated, especially those concerning policy and finance available for making upfront investments...|$|R

30|$|The {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> {{wastewater management}} systems in Harare is still minimal, {{regardless of the}} promises of such a concept. The City is used to the conventional centralised systems. A number of factors such as public acceptance, health and cost factors {{and the availability of}} alternative water sources rather than technical barriers (Nhapi 2004 a, b, c) influence {{the extent to which the}} <b>decentralised</b> concept <b>of</b> wastewater treatment and management will be implemented in Harare. Other contributing factors include regulations, convenience and organisations necessary for users if they are to make correct use of wastewater systems. The cost aspect <b>of</b> the <b>decentralised</b> systems is linked to technologies used and the size of population that is to be served by such as system. The technologies are locally available such as duckweed and septic tanks, hence no need for importing such technologies. The availability and cost of alternative water systems (surface, groundwater, rainwater harvesting) is also likely to influence the adoption <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> wastewater management in Harare. Water in the Harare metropolitan area is a very serious problem and this may constrain the effective implementation <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> systems.

For the effective adoption <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> wastewater management strategies, new institutional structures will be required. Cases reviewed from Latin, Central and South America confirms that community engagement is critical factor in the success of the adoption of decentralized wastewater treatment systems. It is therefore important for the City of Harare to engage urban residents in the processes of adopting decentralized wastewater treatment systems. Public awareness is also important so that members of the public are educated on the benefits of implementing such systems in their community.|$|R

The use <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> water systems has introduced a change in the style of water service delivery and often there are new actors responsible and involved in the maintenance and operation of these systems. This raises questions about how to best implement and govern the use <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> water systems. To understand the issues and problem mitigation approaches required for <b>decentralised</b> systems, collection <b>of</b> data on the effectiveness, difficulties, functional aspects and ongoing problems in providing water services is required.

This paper suggests that dedicated household surveys can provide important information on the performance <b>of</b> <b>decentralised</b> water systems based on personal understanding and experience of these systems. This is stated on the basis of householder survey trials which indeed seem to provide useful information, both in terms of feedback from the individual and in generating a coherent data set from which to statistically model the adequacy of various implementation styles and governance structures. An exploration of data sets from survey trials have contributed to collective learning, necessary in firmly establishing decentralised systems as viable options for the provision of urban water services now and into the future...|$|R

The control of the double panel vibration is implemented using Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) decentralised velocity feedback loops. The loops are applied via an array of electrodynamic force actuators and collocated velocity sensors. The actuators are located in an air cavity between the two panels such that they can react against the two panels. Two velocity sensors per actuator are used. Either sensor {{is located at the}} source and radiating panel footprint of an actuator. The error velocity is formed by subtracting weighted sensor outputs. In the introductory part of the thesis a survey of aircraft interior noise is given, and stateof- the-art passive and active noise control methods are presented. In Chapter two the mathematical model for the theoretical analysis of the smart double panel is formulated and a parametric study of passive sound transmission is performed using the mathematical model.
