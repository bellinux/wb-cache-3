40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{maintenance}} of a motor cortical program in the temporal domain is relevant to current <b>neuroinformatic</b> efforts to use non-invasive EEG signals to control neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore natural movements of paralyzed body parts. Here we use an advance neuroelectrical imaging approach to examine the motor cortical responsiveness in human tetraplegia. METHODS: High resolution-electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were performed in five subjects with tetraplegia due to chronic, complete spinal cord injuries (SCIs) while they attempted self-generated movements of a plegic body part (foot), and in five healthy subjects executing simple foot movements. RESULTS: Self-generated movement attempts induced significant EEG sources of activity {{in a set of}} motor-related areas (including the primary motor area, MI) similar to what observed during the preparatory stages of movement execution (control subjects). Functional connectivity showed a preferential interaction between the "non-primary" motor areas and the putative MI foot site, as estimated for both motor execution and attempt. Under this latter condition however, it could be observed an "enlargement" of the functional network by including the left superior parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the existence of a functional circuit subserving the attempted motion in SCI subjects that encompasses a set of areas known {{to play a role in}} motor execution, yet reveals differences in the functional interaction between these areas. SIGNIFICANCE: The understanding of changes in the motor circuitry is relevant to current <b>neuroinformatic</b> efforts to use non-invasive EEG signals to control neuroprosthetic devices designed to benefit paralyzed persons...|$|R

The enhancements comprise a set of brain choropleths and the ability to display these as stacked slices, accessible with a slider. For the first time, this allows the neuroimaging community {{to take advantage of the}} advanced tools already available for exploring geographic data. Our brain choropleths are modeled after widely used geographic maps but this mashup of brain choropleths with extant visualization software fills an important <b>neuroinformatic</b> niche. To date, most <b>neuroinformatic</b> tools have provided online databases and atlases of the brain, but not good ways to display the related data (e. g., behavioral, genetic, medical, etc). The extension of the choropleth to brain maps allows us to leverage general-purpose visualization tools for concurrent exploration of brain images and related data. Related data can be represented as a variety of tables, charts and graphs that are dynamically linked to each other and to the brain choropleths. We demonstrate that the simplified region-based analyses that underlay choropleths can provide insights into neuroimaging data comparable to those achieved by using more conventional methods. In addition, the interactive interface facilitates additional insights by allowing the user to filter, compare, and drill down into the visual representations of the data. This enhanced data visualization capability is useful during the initial phases of data analysis and the resulting visualizations provide a compelling way to publish data as an online supplement to journal articles...|$|R

Abstract This work presents a <b>neuroinformatic</b> method for deriving mechanistic descriptions of fine-structured neural activity. This {{is a new}} development in the computer-assisted analysis of dynamics in conductance-based models, which is illustrated using single compartment models of an action po-tential. A sequence of abstract, qualitative motifs is inferred from this analysis, forming a template that is independent of the specific equations from which they were abstracted. The template encodes the assumptions behind the model reduc-tion steps used to derive the motifs, and so specifies quanti-tative information about their domains of validity. The tem-plate representation of a mechanism is converted to a hybrid dynamical system, which is simulated as a sequence of low-dimensional reduced models (in this example, phase plane models) with appropriate switching conditions taken from the motifs. We demonstrate {{the validity of the}} template on a detailed single neuron model of spiking taken from the literature, and show that the corresponding hybrid system simulation closely mimics the spiking dynamics of the full model...|$|R

40|$|Severe {{traumatic}} brain injury can lead to disorders of consciousness (DOC) characterized by deficit in conscious awareness and cognitive impairment including coma, vegetative state, minimally consciousness, and lock-in syndrome. Of crucial importance is to find objective markers that can account for the large-scale disturbances of brain function to help the diagnosis and prognosis of DOC patients and eventually the prediction of the coma outcome. Following {{recent studies suggesting that}} the functional organization of brain networks can be altered in comatose patients, this work analyzes brain functional connectivity (FC) networks obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Two approaches are used to estimate the FC: the Partial Correlation (PC) and the Transfer Entropy (TE). Both the PC and the TE show significant statistical differences between the group of patients and control subjects; in brief, the inter-hemispheric PC and the intra-hemispheric TE account for such differences. Overall, these results suggest two possible rs-fMRI markers useful to design new strategies for the management and neuropsychological rehabilitation of DOC patients.

40|$|Understanding {{the network}} {{structure}} of white matter communication pathways {{is essential for}} unraveling {{the mysteries of the}} brain's function, organization, and evolution. To this end, we derive a unique network incorporating 410 anatomical tracing studies of the macaque brain from the Collation of Connectivity data on the Macaque brain (CoCoMac) <b>neuroinformatic</b> database. Our network consists of 383 hierarchically organized regions spanning cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia; models the presence of 6, 602 directed long-distance connections; is three times larger than any previously derived brain network; and contains subnetworks corresponding to classic corticocortical, corticosubcortical, and subcortico-subcortical fiber systems. We found that the empirical degree distribution of the network is consistent with the hypothesis of the maximum entropy exponential distribution and discovered two remarkable bridges between the brain's structure and function via network-theoretical analysis. First, prefrontal cortex contains a disproportionate share of topologically central regions. Second, there exists a tightly integrated core circuit, spanning parts of premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, thalamus, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex, insula, and visual cortex, that includes much of the task-positive and task-negative networks and might play a special role in higher cognition and consciousness...|$|R
40|$|While {{the human}} medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is widely {{believed}} to be a key node of neural networks relevant for socio-emotional processing, its functional subspecialization is still poorly understood. We thus revisited the often assumed differentiation of the mPFC in social cognition along its ventral-dorsal axis. Our <b>neuroinformatic</b> analysis was based on a neuroimaging meta-analysis of perspective-taking that yielded two separate clusters in the ventral and dorsal mPFC, respectively. We determined each seed region 2 ̆ 7 s brain-wide interaction pattern by two complementary measures of functional connectivity: co-activation across a wide range of neuroimaging studies archived in the BrainMap database and correlated signal fluctuations during unconstrained (“resting”) cognition. Furthermore, we characterized the functions associated with these two regions using the BrainMap database. Across methods, the ventral mPFC was more strongly connected with the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex, while the dorsal mPFC was more strongly connected with the inferior frontal gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, and middle temporal gyrus. Further, the ventral mPFC was selectively associated with reward related tasks, while the dorsal mPFC was selectively associated with perspective-taking and episodic memory retrieval. The ventral mPFC is therefore predominantly involved in bottom-up-driven, approach/avoidance-modulating, and evaluation-related processing, whereas the dorsal mPFC is predominantly involved in top–down-driven, probabilistic-scene-informed, and metacognition-related processing in social cognition...|$|R

In {{this study we}} analyzed sensor-level resting-state neuromagnetic recordings from 25 reading-disabled children and 27 non-impaired readers under the notion of symbolic dynamics and complexity analysis. We compared two techniques for estimating the complexity of MEG time-series in each of 8 frequency bands based on symbolic dynamics: (a) Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) entailing binarization of each MEG time series using the mean amplitude as a threshold, and (b) An approach based on the neural-gas algorithm (NG) which {{has been used by}} our group in the context of various symbolization schemes. The NG approach transforms each MEG time series to more than two symbols by learning the reconstructed manifold of each time series with a small error.

The relative performance of the two complexity indexes was assessed using a classification procedure based on k-NN and Support Vector Machines. Results revealed the capacity of CI to discriminate impaired from non-impaired readers with 80 % accuracy. Corresponding performance of LZC values did not exceed 55 %.

Evidence for neurodevelopmental disturbances in autism may be further derived from reports of altered brain volume (megalencephaly), cortical dysgenesis and abnormalities in neuronal alignment within the cerebral cortex, as well as cytoarchitectural changes within the amygdala (with fewer neurons particularly in the lateral nucleus), and the cerebellum (loss of Purkinje neurons). Preliminary reports have also suggested that white matter abnormalities, neuroinflammation (Vargas et al. 2005), neuroglial activation (Vargas et al. 2005; Rezaie et al. 2006) and oxidative stress are further components associated with autism. Nevertheless, {{with the exception of}} Purkinje cell loss within the cerebellum (which is not in itself a pathological hallmark for autism), the neuropathology of autism still remains largely undefined, with inconsistent findings possibly reflecting (i) interindividual differences (the autism spectrum), (ii) analysis of small sample sizes, (iii) biases in results (co-occurrence of epilepsy, ‘high’ or ‘low’-functioning status, and pathology related to agonal changes pre-mortem), and/or (iv) aetio-pathological differences {{in the development of the}} condition (i. e. altered development of a distributed neural network involving a number of brain regions or ‘systems’ rather than localised, neurodevelopmental alterations). For the past few years, we have been investigating aspects of the neuropathology of autism in cohorts of individuals whose brain had been donated for research, to the MRC London Neurodegenerative Diseases Brain Bank at the Institute of Psychiatry in the UK, and the Autism Tissue Program (ATP) in the US.

40|$|Major neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} are highly heritable, with mounting {{evidence suggesting that}} these disorders share overlapping sets of molecular and cellular underpinnings. In the current article we systematically test the degree of genetic commonality across six major neuropsychiatric disorders—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. We curated a well-vetted list of genes based on large-scale human genetic studies and verified their appearance on the NHGRI catalog of published genome-wide association studies. A total of 180 genes were accepted into the analysis {{on the basis of}} low but liberal GWAS p-values (< 10 - 5). 22 % of genes overlapped two or more disorders. The most widely shared subset of genes—common to five of six disorders–included ANK 3, AS 3 MT, CACNA 1 C, CACNB 2, CNNM 2, CSMD 1, DPCR 1, ITIH 3, NT 5 C 2, PPP 1 R 11, SYNE 1, TCF 4, TENM 4, TRIM 26, and ZNRD 1. Using a suite of <b>neuroinformatic</b> resources, we showed that many of the shared genes are implicated in the postsynaptic density, expressed in immune tissues and co-expressed in developing human brain [...] Using a translational cross-species approach, we detected two distinct genetic components that were both shared by each of the six disorders; the 1 st component is involved in CNS development, neural projections and synaptic transmission, while the 2 nd is implicated in various cytoplasmic organelles and cellular processes. Combined, these genetic components account for 20 – 30 % of the genetic load. The remaining risk is conferred by distinct, disorder-specific variants. Nevertheless, the convergence of different analytical approaches on similar targets may bear important implications. Thus, although adding mostly confirmatory findings, higher resolution of shared and unique genetic factors provided in this manuscript could ultimately translate into improved diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating disorders...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of neuroimaging {{research}} and accumulation of <b>neuroinformatic</b> databases the synthesis of consensus findings using meta-analysis is becoming increasingly important. Meta-analyses pool data across many studies to identify reliable experimental effects and characterize the degree of agreement across studies. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods use the full statistic images, and allow the use of hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify the information lost by working only with the coordinates of peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We apply a 3 -level IBMA mixed model for a "mega-analysis", and highlight important considerations in the specification of each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the datasets considered, we find that ALE at sigma= 15 mm, KDA at rho= 25 - 30 mm and MKDA at rho= 15 mm give the greatest similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0. 45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an effective mechanism for sharing image data, including whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard errors...|$|R
