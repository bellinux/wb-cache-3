5|$|Social {{anthropology}} is {{the branch}} of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed <b>non-industrial</b> and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{commercial}} activities the Port of Albany has <b>non-industrial</b> uses along the river. A ship museum and a tourism cruise ship are docked at the Steamboat Square. Steamboat Square was, until 2010, named the Snow Dock for being where city trucks {{dumped into the}} Hudson River snow plowed from the streets. A PortFest was held in 2007 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Port of Albany-Rennselaer and the 10th anniversary of the USS Slater as a museum docked at Albany. National Maritime Day is celebrated with free trolley rides of the port and free rides aboard the Dutch Apple Cruise.|$|E

25|$|An RAF {{assessment}} {{showed that}} 23 {{percent of the}} industrial buildings, and 56 percent of the <b>non-industrial</b> buildings, not counting residential buildings, had been seriously damaged. Around 78,000 dwellings had been completely destroyed; 27,700 were uninhabitable, and 64,500 damaged, but readily repairable.|$|E
25|$|Chikmagalur {{district}} unfortunately has {{not made}} good progress in terms of Industrial Development. Inadequate infrastructure, poor roads, poor rail network and investors preferring <b>non-industrial</b> ventures over industrial ones are quoted {{as some of the}} reasons for the backwardness of Industrial Development in this district.|$|E
25|$|The sea {{ports of}} the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach {{together}} {{make up the}} Los Angeles–Long Beach Harbor. There are also smaller, <b>non-industrial</b> harbors along L.A.'s coastline. Most of these like Redondo Beach and Marina del Rey are used primarily by sailboats and yachts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} smaller, <b>non-industrial</b> harbors along Los Angeles's coastline. The port {{includes}} four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Gerald Desmond Bridge, and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge. Passenger ferry service from San Pedro {{to the city}} of Avalon on Santa Catalina Island is provided by Catalina Express.|$|E
25|$|Miners {{working in}} the {{industrial}} enterprise of underground metal mining often came from <b>non-industrial</b> backgrounds. Placer mining was gradually replaced by lode mining from 1860 to 1910, forcing miners to go deeper underground and resulting in an increasing level of industrialization. Tensions resulted from changing demands for job skills and work discipline.|$|E
25|$|Brooklyn's Broadway, {{ending in}} the ferry to Manhattan, became the area's lifeline. The area became a popular {{location}} for condiment and household product manufacturers. Factories for Domino Sugar, Esquire Shoe Polish, Dutch Mustard {{and many others}} were established in the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of these factory buildings are now being (or already have been) converted to <b>non-industrial</b> uses, primarily residential.|$|E
25|$|As of 1 April 2008, empty {{relief was}} altered, {{removing}} the previous total relief for industrial properties, and removing the 50% relief for other properties. The three-month period of total relief for <b>non-industrial</b> properties was retained, and a six-month period instituted for industrial properties. In the Pre Budget Report 2008, the Chancellor increased the rateable value for full relief to £15,000 {{for the period}} 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010.|$|E
25|$|Mark Elvin {{argues that}} China {{was in a}} high level {{equilibrium}} trap in which the <b>non-industrial</b> methods were efficient enough to prevent use of industrial methods with high initial capital. Kenneth Pomeranz, in the Great Divergence, argues that Europe and China were remarkably similar in 1700, and that the crucial differences which created the Industrial Revolution in Europe were sources of coal near manufacturing centers, and raw materials such as food and wood from the New World, which allowed Europe to expand economically {{in a way that}} China could not.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{potential}} for use in nuclear weapons programs, the possession or import/export of large industrial quantities of heavy water are subject to government control in several countries. Suppliers of heavy water and heavy water production technology typically apply IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) administered safeguards and material accounting to heavy water. (In Australia, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987.) In the U.S. and Canada, <b>non-industrial</b> quantities of heavy water (i.e., in the gram to kg range) are routinely available without special license through chemical supply dealers and commercial companies such as the world's former major producer Ontario Hydro.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} were obligated {{to repay the}} loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day {{in the guise of}} the state owned KfW bank, (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in <b>non-industrial</b> projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other <b>non-industrial</b> environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably {{be a long time before}} robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{world of}} Earthsea {{is one of}} sea and islands: a vast {{archipelago}} of hundreds of islands surrounded by mostly uncharted ocean. Earthsea contains no large continents, with the archipelago resembling Indonesia or the Philippines. The largest island, Havnor, at approximately 380 miles across, {{is about the size}} of Great Britain. The cultures of Earthsea are not direct analogues of those of our world, but are literate <b>non-industrial</b> civilizations. Technologically, Earthsea is an early Iron Age society, with bronze used in places where iron is scarce. Weapons also include the use of wood and other hard but easily crafted metals. The overall climate of Earthsea is temperate, comparable to the mid-latitudes (over a distance of about 1800 miles) of the Northern hemisphere. There is a yearly transition from warm summers to cold and snowy winters, especially in northern islands like Gont and Osskil. In the southern regions of Earthsea it can be much warmer.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{products}} {{have always been}} a staple to the economy, comprising 1% of the total gross state output and 9% of total manufacturing as of 2013. In 2007 Windham County contained the largest concentration of kilns for drying lumber east of the Mississippi River. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological succession. Today, most of Vermont's forests are secondary. The state and non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% forest in 1880s when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing land. Over 85% of that area is <b>non-industrial,</b> private forestland owned by individuals or families. In 2013 73.054 million cubic feet of wood was harvested in Vermont. A large amount of Vermont forest products are exports with 21.504 million feet being shipped overseas plus an additional 16.384 million cubic feet to Canada. Most of it was processed within the state. In this century the manufacture of wood products has fallen by almost half. The annual net growth has been estimated at 172.810 million cubic feet. The USDA estimates that 8.584 billion cubic feet remain in the state. Forest products also add to carbon sequestration since lumber and timber used in houses and furniture hold carbon {{for long periods of time}} while the trees that were removed are replaced overtime with new growing stock. While wood pellets are replacing coal in European power plants reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% and preventing mountaintop removal for coal mining.|$|E
500|$|MIT's School of Architecture, now the School of Architecture and Planning, was {{the first}} in the United States, and it has a history of {{commissioning}} progressive buildings. The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the [...] "Maclaurin buildings" [...] after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete, a first for a <b>non-industrial</b> – much less university – building in the U.S. Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s and features the Pantheon-esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where graduation ceremonies are held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers. The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor {{and the rest of the}} campus.|$|E
500|$|The National Park covers [...] of Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and South and West Yorkshire, {{including}} {{the majority of}} the area commonly referred to as the Peak. Its northern limits lie along the A62 road between Marsden and Oldham, and its southernmost point is on the A52 road on the outskirts of Ashbourne in Derbyshire. The park boundaries were drawn to exclude built-up and industrial areas; in particular Buxton and the adjacent quarries {{at the end of the}} Peak Dale corridor are surrounded on three sides by the park. The town of Bakewell and many villages are in the national park as is much of the (<b>non-industrial)</b> west of Sheffield. As of 2010, it is the fifth largest National Park in England and Wales. In the UK, the designation National Park means that there are planning restrictions to protect the area from inappropriate development and a Park Authority to look after it, but does not imply the land is owned by the government, or that it is uninhabited.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union had a <b>non-industrial</b> {{railway network}} of , of which [...] were electrified. As {{the quality of}} rail {{transport}} continued to deteriorate, {{in part because of}} the Russian Civil War, some within the Soviet leadership claimed that the railways were not sustainable if congestions continued to increase. Those who advocated for an enlargement of rail transport felt that increased investment and the lengthening of already established rail tracks could solve the ongoing congestion crisis. The majority agreed on increasing investments, but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used. There were even some who believed in the recapitalisation of the railways. Gosplan economists in the meantime advocated for the rationalisation of the railways, coupled with tariffs based on actual cost, which would reduce traffic demand and provide funds for investment. The leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and the rail system continued to deteriorate. In 1931, in a Central Committee (CC) resolution, it was decided that increased investments coupled with the introduction of newer trains could solve the crisis. This resolution was never carried out, and yet again, the system continued to deteriorate.|$|E
2500|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{also have}} specialized use in mines and other environments where {{a very small}} structure gauge makes a very small loading gauge necessary. Narrow-gauge railways also have more general applications. <b>Non-industrial</b> narrow-gauge mountain railways are or were common in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and the Pacific Cordillera of Canada, in Mexico, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Greece, and Costa Rica. In some countries, narrow gauge is the standard, like the [...] gauge in Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, New Zealand, South Africa, the Australian states of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, and the [...] in Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeometry aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It {{emphasizes}} {{the application of}} analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on {{the definition of the}} chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis. Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and geodesy as well as computer-based tools such as geographic information system technology. Rare earth elements patterns may also be used. [...] A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and <b>non-industrial</b> culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.|$|E
2500|$|A City Council {{survey in}} 1953 {{concluded}} that [...] of land was beyond repair. In 1956, the council produced their own {{plans for the}} redevelopment of the area to consolidate <b>non-industrial</b> activities such as retail into well-defined areas. However, they were met with opposition as they took no consideration {{of the importance of}} the small tradesmen that were vital to the area. In 1960, Sir Richard Vyse produced a plan for his Hockley estate, however, he died before the plan could be carried out. In 1963, the council agreed to buy the freehold of [...] of the Vyse estate for £650,000. In 1965, a council scheme for the redevelopment of the area was approved for completion in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|The {{goal of the}} BDL was to {{preserve}} the leading position of agriculture {{in the economy and}} politics of Germany. In one of the founding documents it says: [...] "German agriculture is the primary and most important industry, the strongest support of the empire and of the several states. To protect and strengthen agriculture is our first and most serious task because by the blossoming and flourishing of agriculture, the welfare of all professions is secured." [...] But the BDL also came to the defense of the mom and pop shops as against big-city department store chains, they safeguarded the interests of the rural and small urban middle class, the shop assistants, rural workers, sailors and fishermen and small wine growers. Basically they took all <b>non-industrial</b> workers, and small businesses under their wing.|$|E
2500|$|The goal of {{anthropology}} {{is to provide}} a holistic account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called [...] "primitive" [...] in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of [...] "inferior". Today, anthropologists use terms such as [...] "less complex" [...] societies or refer to specific modes of subsistence or production, such as [...] "pastoralist" [...] or [...] "forager" [...] or [...] "horticulturalist" [...] to refer to humans living in <b>non-industrial,</b> non-Western cultures, such people or folk (ethnos) remaining of great interest within anthropology.|$|E

For both NSB-run and private, <b>non-industrial</b> railways, municipalities and counties were often the largest owners. Eventually, all the private, <b>non-industrial</b> railways started losing money, and unless they received subsidies, were forced to close.
