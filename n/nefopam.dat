40|$|SummaryBackgroundMultimodal {{analgesia}} combining several non-opioid analgesics {{is recommended}} for pain control after surgery. In one study of total hip arthroplasty (THA), pain relief achieved by adding ketamine to the paracetamol–ketoprofen combination was statistically significant but remained inadequate in most patients. In two other studies, the analgesic effect of <b>nefopam</b> was synergistic with that of ketoprofen and additive with that of paracetamol. Adding <b>nefopam</b> to the paracetamol–ketoprofen-ketamine combination has not been evaluated. HypothesisAdding <b>nefopam</b> to the paracetamol–ketoprofen–ketamine combination significantly improves analgesia after THA. Material and methodsA prospective single-centre comparative non-randomised study (control group then <b>nefopam</b> group) was conducted in patients undergoing THA under general anaesthesia. All patients received paracetamol–ketoprofen–ketamine and morphine/droperidol patient-controlled analgesia. The <b>nefopam</b> group also received a continuous infusion of <b>nefopam</b> (120 mg/d for 48 h). Pain was evaluated daily for 7 days. The main evaluation criteria were morphine consumption, and pain intensity evaluated using a numerical rating scale and a validated questionnaire. To detect a 40 % morphine-sparing effect by H 24 (α= 0. 05 and β= 0. 2), 85 patients were needed in each group. ResultsThe two groups (90 patients/group) had no significant differences for perioperative characteristics, pain scores, morphine consumption at H 24 (<b>nefopam,</b> 13 ± 12 mg and control, 14 ± 13 mg, P= 0. 39), or functional recovery. Compared to the control group, the <b>nefopam</b> group had lower rates of nausea/vomiting (P< 0. 0001), pruritus (P= 0. 002), and visual disturbances (P= 0. 02). DiscussionNefopam failed to improve pain relief when added to a multimodal analgesia regimen but alleviated several morphine-induced side effects. Redundancy between <b>nefopam</b> and ketamine may explain the absence of greater pain relief. This study emphasises the need for clinical evaluations of every analgesic regimen, as the available data were not sufficient to predict these results.

The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of <b>nefopam</b> {{for the prevention of}} perioperative shivering in patients undergoing different types of anaesthesia compared with placebo group and other active interventions. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials were systematically searched for potentially relevant trials. Trial quality and extracted data were evaluated by two authors independently. Dichotomous data on the absence of shivering was extracted and analysed by using relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Continuous outcome was abstracted and analysed by using weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Outcome data was analysed by using random effect model or fixed effect model in accordance with heterogeneity.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY. To compare {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>nefopam</b> and paracetamol as components of the preventive multimodal anesthesia (PMA) in patients operated on for a hernia of an intervertebral disc (hID). MATERIAL AND METHODS. In 2013, 35 patients were operated on for hID. Group 1 (21) received PMA including wound infiltration by bupivacaine, ketoprofen and paracetamol. Group 2 (15) received <b>nefopam</b> instead of paracetamol. Intensity of postoperative pain, side effects and satisfaction of patients with anesthesia were assessed, and in 6 months later — existence and intensity of chronic pain. RESULTS. Intensity of postoperative pain, satisfaction with anesthesia, and also frequency and intensity of chronic pain didn’t differ in group 1 and 2. Occurrence of undesirable reactions was higher in group 2. CONCLUSION. In patients receiving <b>nefopam</b> and paracetamol as components of PMA, intensity of postoperative pain and also occurence and intensity of chronic pain don’t differ, but the patients receiving to <b>nefopam,</b> experience the undesirable reactions more often which do not affect satisfaction with anesthesia.  </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nefopam</b> is a centrally-acting but non-opioid {{analgesic}} drug of the benzoxazocine chemical class, {{developed in the}} early 1970 s. It is widely used, mainly in European countries, for the relief of moderate to severe pain {{as an alternative to}} opioid {{analgesic drug}}s, and used in rheumatic disease and other musculoskeletal disorders in the UK. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral <b>nefopam</b> in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study has been used for many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of single dose oral <b>nefopam</b> in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009); EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to May 2009); the Oxford Pain Relief Database (1950 to 1994); and reference lists of studies found. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral <b>nefopam</b> for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The area under the "pain relief versus time" curve was used to derive the proportion of participants with <b>nefopam</b> and placebo experiencing least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations. The number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) was calculated using 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). The proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period, and time to use of rescue analgesia, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was also collected. MAIN RESULTS: No included studies were identified after examining in detail thirteen studies on oral <b>nefopam</b> in participants with established postoperative pain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of evidence of efficacy for oral <b>nefopam</b> in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies are lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes, there is no urgent research agenda...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nefopam</b> is a non-opioid, non-steroidal, {{centrally}} acting analgesic {{which has}} an opioid-sparing effect. It also reduces the threshold (triggering core temperature) for shivering without causing sedation or respiratory depression. The drug is therefore useful as both an analgesic and to facilitate induction of therapeutic hypothermia. However, compartmental pharmacokinetics during hypothermia are lacking for <b>nefopam.</b> METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, blinded study in eight volunteers. On two different occasions, one of two <b>nefopam</b> concentrations was administered and more than 30 arterial blood samples were gathered during 12 h. Plasma concentrations were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to investigate the pharmacokinetics of <b>nefopam</b> with non-linear mixed-effect modelling. RESULTS: A two-compartment mammillary model with moderate inter-individual variability and inter-occasional variability independent of covariates was found to best describe the data [mean (SE) : V(1) = 24. 13 (2. 8) litre; V(2) = 183. 34 (13. 5) litre; Cl(el) = 0. 54 (0. 07) litre min(- 1); Cl(dist) = 2. 84 (0. 42) litre min(- 1) ]. CONCLUSIONS: The compartmental data set describing a two-compartment model was determined and could be implemented to drive automated pumps. Thus, work load could be distributed to a pump establishing and maintaining any desired plasma concentration deemed necessary for a treatment with therapeutical hypothermia. status: publishe...|$|E

Novel Biomed 2013; 1 : 16 - 22. Background: Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain {{due to a}} {{disorder}} in the peripheral or central nervous system with different pathophysiological mechanisms. Current treatments are not effective. Here we compared the analgesic effect of <b>nefopam,</b> and morphine in chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. Methods: Male wistar rat (150 - 200 g, n= 8) were divided into 3 different groups: 1 - Saline-treated CCI group, 2 - Saline-treated sham group, and 3 - Drug-treated CCI groups. In CCI model of neuropathic pain, the left sciatic nerve was exposed and 4 loose chromic gut ligatures were placed around the nerve proximal to the trifurcation. Ketamine 60 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg were used for anesthesia. <b>Nefopam</b> (10, 20, 30 mg/kg), and morphine (1, 3, 5 mg/kg) were injected 30 minutes before surgery and continued daily to day 14 post-ligation. Von Frey filaments for mechanical allodynia and acetone test for cold allodynia were respectively used as pain behavioral tests. Experiments were performed on day 0 (before surgery) and days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 post injury. Behavioral studies were performed in a quiet room between 9 : 00 to 11 : 00 AM. All experiments followed the IASP guidelines on ethical standards for investigation of experimental pain in animals. Results: <b>Nefopam</b> (20 and 30 mg/kg) blocked mechanical and cold allodynia during the experimental period, but the analgesic effects of morphine (5 mg/kg) lasted for 7 days. Conclusions: It seems that <b>nefopam</b> could effectively reduce pain behavior compared to morphine with reduced adverse effects. </p...|$|E
40|$|Neuropathic pain is {{a chronic}} pain due to {{disorder}} in peripheral or {{central nervous system}} and different pathophysiological mechanisms. Currently there is no effective response to conventional therapy. Co-administration of nonanalgesic dose of drugs can reduce both pain and their adverse effects. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the analgesic effect of three drugs (nimesulide, <b>nefopam,</b> morphine) with different mechanisms of action as a single and combination form in a model of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was induced using CCI model in male wistar rats (n= 6, 180 - 220 g) and divided into different groups: 1) sham, saline 2) CCI, saline 3) CCI, nimesulide (1. 25, 2. 5, 5 mg/kg) 4) CCI, <b>nefopam</b> (10, 20, 30 mg/kg) 5) CCI, morphine (1, 3, 5 mg/kg) 6) CCI, nimesulide (1. 25 mg/kg) /morphine (3 mg/kg) 7) CCI, nimesulide (1. 25 mg/kg) /nefopam (10 mg/kg) 8) CCI, <b>nefopam</b> (10 mg/kg) /morphine (3 mg/kg). Pain behavior was assessed using allodynia tests (Vonfrey filaments and acetone test) before and days 1, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after surgery.
