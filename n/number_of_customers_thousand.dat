The research is aimed {{to answer some}} issues there are Marketing Strategy and The Influence of Marketing Strategy in Increasing the <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Customers</b> <b>of</b> Umrah Regular Package at Qiblat Tour. The theory used {{as a measure of}} effective marketing strategies is Marketing Mix 7 p (Product, Price, promotion, process, place (Distribution), Physical Evidence, people). The method used is Qualitative descriptive method because it helped the writer to obtain a variety of information related to The Influence of Marketing Strategy in Increasing the <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Customers</b> <b>of</b> Umrah Regular Package at Qiblat Tour. The methods of data collection used are interview, observation, and documentation. The data obtained and then analyzed and presented descriptive. The result is the marketing strategy undertaken by Qiblat Tour is by (1) giving priority to the quality of service and the best hospitality in order to create satisfaction, loyalty and interest in customers, (2) running promotion programs such as advertising through electronic and print media and others, (3) creating new products with lower price than the normal price, (4) hold the event program and (5) participating as a sponsorship. The result of the marketing strategy that has been done by the Qiblat Tour is very good because it is very influential in increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> Especially by creating the new products (Milad program), this program is produces the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> than usual.

The conclusion is the marketing strategy undertaken by Qiblat Tour is quite effective because it has a very good influence in increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> Therefore, the company must keep maintaining the quality of the strategy that has been reputed quite effective and has a very good influence for the company.

40|$|In the literature, retrial queues with batch arrivals {{and heavy}} service times {{have been studied}} and the {{so-called}} equivalence theorem has been established {{under the condition that}} the service time is heavier than the batch size.

In this paper, under the assumption of regularly varying tails, we eliminate this condition by allowing that the service time can be either heavier or lighter than the batch size.
