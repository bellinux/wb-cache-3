In the UV spectra of the samples with better crystal quality, we detect multiphonon mA 1 (LO) peaks up to m = 4 together with strong PL signal from c-GaN. In the more disordered samples the PL emission is quenched, and this allows us to detect multiphonons up to m = 6. The intensity of the multiphonon peaks can be used to assess the crystal quality of the c-GaN and c-GaMnN samples.

40|$|The {{growth of}} GaN {{nanowires}} from Ga and NH 3 {{sources in the}} flow of Ar carrier gas using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system was systematically studied. The substrates used were Si(111) and Si(100). Fabricated nanowires were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). We investigated the influence of growth temperature, catalyst used, Ga amount, and the ratio of Ar and NH 3 flow rates on the morphology and properties of GaN nanowires. We found that the best results were obtained for a growth temperature of 950  °C. Optimal catalysts were Au and metallic Ni, while the use of nickel nitrate was found to lead to formation of SiO x nanowire bunches in addition to GaN nanowires. For the optimal temperature and catalyst used, the influence of the Ga to N ratio on the nanowire growth was studied. It was found that different types of nanostructures are observed in relatively Ga-rich and in relatively <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions.</b> Growth mechanisms of different types of nanowires, including the stacked-cone nanowires and the microscale structures formed by lateral growth under <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions,</b> are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|GaMnN layers {{grown by}} plasma {{assisted}} {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (PAMBE) {{as a function of}} Ga/N ratio, Mn flux and growth temperature are assessed using a variety of structural characterisation techniques. At 680 C, the Ga/N ratio is found to have a dominant impact on the zinc-blende GaMnN epilayer growth rate and the resultant composition, morphology and microstructure. A maximum growth rate and an optimised microstructure are associated with growth under slightly Ga-rich conditions. A reduced growth rate and enhanced Mn incorporation are associated with growth under slightly <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions.</b> Increasing Mn flux under <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions</b> is considered to lead to a build up of a Mn surfactant layer during the early stages of growth and to a transition from zinc-blende single phase growth to zinc-blende/wurtzite mixed phase growth. Further, under Ga-rich conditions at low temperature, GaMnN films adopt a tilted growth mode, with close packed planes for both hexagonal and cubic phases being tilted roughly parallel to the growth surface, and this way of modified growth is also accompanied by improved Mn incorporation which is not commonly found for samples grown under Ga-rich conditions at elevated temperature. In addition, alpha-MnAs inclusions and voids extending into the GaAs buffer layer were identified in all samples, but are considered not to have a detrimental effect on layer electrical and magnetic properties.

30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} SEM images of surface {{morphology}} and cross sections of samples A to D. From the top view of sample A (A 1), {{one can see}} some obvious dark holes on the surface, indicating the formation of vacancies due to In accumulation in droplets. The formation of holes and droplets easily leads to a pretty rough surface (rms[*]=[*] 33, from AFM scanning result), as shown in Figure  3 A 2. As we know, the melting temperature of metal In is only about 157 °C. Thus, under {{the growth temperature of}} InN (550 °C), the pulsed deposition of In for a long duration time may form a thick liquid In layer on the surface. By the effect of surface tension, In droplets in large size would come into being quickly. This is the main reason governing the surface roughness. In order to reduce the roughness, the pulse time of TMI is reduced to 8  s for sample B. The obtained InN film shows better flatness (rms[*]=[*] 20) and dark holes have been well removed (Figure  3 B 2). According to the theoretical simulation of the kinetics of InN formation [17], if the thickness of indium film is larger than two atomic layers, the nitridation of this In film could not well form a InN epilayers in correct stoichiometric ratio (1 : 1) and the excessive In will lead to roughness. Thus, the TMI pulse time was further decreased down to 4  s. As shown in Figure  3 C 1, the islands of sample C begin to show regular shape relatively and the surface becomes more flat (rms[*]=[*] 14). Meanwhile, it can be observed that there are some islands in larger size, as indicated by arrow. The number of these types of large islands further increases in sample D (Figure  3 D 1), in which the TMI pulse time was set to 3  s. This trend of quality deterioration implies that the indium film deposited during the TMI period turns to be less than one atomic layer and fail to construct indium bilayer. This insufficient coverage of indium layer could not provide the advantage of nitridation of indium bi-layer structure. On the contrary, over-nitridation under <b>N-rich</b> <b>condition</b> leads to the deterioration of the InN film quality of sample D. Therefore, it could be determined that 4 -s pulsed supply of TMI in sample C is the optimal setting.|$|R
40|$|High Curie {{temperature}} of 900 K {{has been reported}} in Cr-doped AlN diluted magnetic semiconductors prepared by various methods, which is exciting for spintronic applications. It is believed that N defects play important roles in achieving the high-temperature ferromagnetism in good samples. Motivated by these experimental advances, we use a full-potential density-functional-theory method and supercell approach to investigate N defects and their effects on ferromagnetism of (Al,Cr) N with N vacancies (V-N). We investigate the structural and electronic properties of V-N, single Cr atom, Cr-Cr atom pairs, Cr-V-N pairs, and so on. In each case, the most stable structure is obtained by comparing different atomic configurations optimized in terms of the total energy and the force on every atom, and then it is used to calculate the defect formation energy and study the electronic structures. Our total-energy calculations show that the nearest substitutional Cr-Cr pair with the two spins in parallel is the most favorable and the nearest Cr-V-N pair makes a stable complex. Our formation energies indicate that V-N regions can be formed spontaneously under N-poor condition because the minimal V-N formation energy equals - 0. 23 eV or Cr-doped regions with high enough concentrations can be formed under <b>N-rich</b> <b>condition</b> because the Cr formation energy equals 0. 04 eV, and hence real Cr-doped AlN samples are formed by forming some Cr-doped regions and separated V-N regions and through subsequent atomic relaxation during annealing. Both of the single Cr atom and the N vacancy create filled electronic states in the semiconductor gap of AlN. N vacancies enhance the ferromagnetism by adding mu(B) to the Cr moment each but reduce the ferromagnetic exchange constants between the spins in the nearest Cr-Cr pairs. These calculated results are in agreement with experimental observations and facts of real Cr-doped AlN samples and their synthesis. Our first-principles results are useful to elucidate the mechanism for the ferromagnetism and to explore high-performance Cr-doped AlN diluted magnetic semiconductors.
