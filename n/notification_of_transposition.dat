Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{problem in}} computational biology is the genome rearrangement using reversals and <b>transpositions.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> genome evolving by reversals and transpositions {{leads to a}} combinatorial optimization problem of sorting by reversals and transpositions, i. e., sorting of a permutation using reversals and <b>transpositions</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary fragments. The reversal operation works on a single segment of the genome by reversing the selected segment. Two kinds <b>of</b> <b>transpositions</b> have been studied in the literature. The first kind <b>of</b> <b>transposition</b> operations delete {{a segment of the}} genome and insert it into another position in the genome. The second kind <b>of</b> <b>transposition</b> operations delete a segment of the genome and insert its inverse into another position in the genome. Both transposition operations can be viewed as operations working on two consecutive segments. In this paper, we introduce a third transposition operation which works on two consecutive segments and study sorting of a signed permutation by reversals and transpositions. By allowing reversals and the first kind <b>of</b> <b>transpositions,</b> or reversals and the first two kinds <b>of</b> <b>transpositions,</b> or reversals and all three kinds <b>of</b> <b>transpositions,</b> we have three problem models. After establishing a common lower bound on the number of operations needed, we present a unified 2 -approximation algorithm for all these problems. Finally, we present a better 1. 75 -approximation for the third problem...|$|R
