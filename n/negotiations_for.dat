40|$|Experiments of a {{bargaining}} game between licensors and licensees were conducted. The main treatment is {{to introduce a}} “second-chance” <b>negotiation</b> <b>for</b> licensors {{in a context of}} ultimatum game. The experimental results reveal that the introduction of the “second-chance” <b>negotiation</b> <b>for</b> licensors has significant impacts on behaviors of the licensors and licensees. This “second-chance” <b>negotiation</b> <b>for</b> licensors essentially increases the average offers made by the licensees, expected willingness-to-accept of the licensors, and offers accepted by the licensors. The market efficiency of patent transaction is improved since the rates of acceptance are strikingly raised. The licensors would be the main beneficiary with this additional opportunity...|$|R

5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the <b>negotiations</b> <b>for</b> almost a decade.|$|E
5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began <b>negotiations</b> <b>for</b> the sale of his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of XML as the lingua franca for communication among applications over the Web, the {{recent advances in}} service oriented computing and in web service architectures and the applicability of these technologies {{in the area of}} eCommerce necessitates the conceptualisation of business roles and <b>negotiation</b> models <b>for</b> web service based provision. According to the web service paradigm it is envisaged that services will be provided to customers based on dynamic web service composition. This places additional requirements to SLA negotiation in comparison to the traditional service provision paradigm where <b>negotiation</b> <b>for</b> service was performed with a single service provider system.
