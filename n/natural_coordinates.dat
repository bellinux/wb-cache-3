The numerical implementation of <b>natural</b> neighbor <b>coordinates</b> in a Galerkin method {{is known as the}} Natural Element Method (NEM).

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} for representing target classes in feature space using Riemannian manifolds is explored. In a formal {{application of the}} approach, it is required that several basic assumptions used {{in the development of}} differential and Riemannian geometry are satisfied.

Developing target class representations which satisfy these assumptions has a direct consequence on the selection of a suitable feature set. Having found a suitable feature set, the approach results in a <b>natural</b> <b>coordinate</b> system in which to calculate distance metrics used in classification algorithms. In this paper, the approach is applied to a situation where an active sensor and a passive sensor are spatially separated and are simultaneously collecting data on a set of targets.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> for the {{synthesis}} of mechanisms using optimization methods. It will be shown that an approach based on this kind of coordinates has many interesting aspects. The modeling of a mechanism with <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates,</b> like any other multi-body system, is carried out by means of a system of algebraic constraint equations. These are complemented by additional equations describing the requirements of the mechanism. All types of requirements - paths, function generation, body guidance, correlation between members - may be given in this way, so that there is a unified method for treating any kind of synthesis. An interesting method is developed here for kinematic analysis of candidate mechanisms. According to this method, kinematic analysis is carried out in the sense that only constraint equations are satisfied exactly, while requirements are satisfied at best. This corresponds to finding the motion of the candidate mechanism that is `closest' to established requirements. This method is then reduced to the solution of the Initial Value Problem (IVP) of a proper system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Lastly, the design space (i. e., the space of the design parameters) also takes advantage of the <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> approach. It is based on the initial values of the <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> themselves rather than on link lengths. This avoids the need to assemble the mechanism in the initial position (and associated branching problems), gives more uniform spanning of the solution space, and guarantees that at least the starting configuration for the ODEs IVP exists and is known. Three examples are given: a four-bar linkage generating a straight path, the same type of linkage generating a square angle (both without correlation), and a six-link Stephenson's mechanism producing a function with a dwell range...|$|E

40|$|Growth rate {{variations}} for two paraboloidal domes: A and B, identical {{when seen}} from the outside but differing in the internal pattern of principal growth directions, were modeled {{by means of the}} growth tensor and a <b>natural</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. In dome A periclinal trajectories in the axial plane were given by confocal parabolas (as in a tunical dome), in dome B by parabolas converging to the vertex (as in a dome without a tunica). Accordingly, two <b>natural</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems, namely paraboloidal for A and convergent parabolic for B, were used. In both cases, the rate of growth in area on the surfaces of domes was assumed to be isotropic and identical in corresponding points. It appears that distributions of growth rates within domes A and B are similar in their peripheral and central parts and different only in their distal regions. In the latter, growth rates are relatively large; the maximum relative rate of growth in volume is around the geometric focus in dome A, and on the surface around the vertex in dome B...|$|R

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] finite element methods that are high-order accurate, exactly integrable, and highly efficient are presented. This paper derives generalized natural Cartesian coordinates {{in three dimensions}} for linear triangles {{on the surface of}} the sphere. By using these <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> as the finite element basis functions we can integrate the corresponding integrals exactly thereby achieving a high level of accuracy and efficiency for modeling physical problems on the sphere. The discretization of the sphere is achieved by the use of a spherical geodesic triangular grid. A tree data structure that is inherent to this grid is introduced; this tree data structure exploits the property of the spherical geodesic grid, allowing for rapid searching of departure points which is essential to the Lagrange-Galerkin method. The generalized <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> are also used for determining in which element the departure points lie. A comparison of the Lagrange-Galerkin method with an Euler-Galerkin method demonstrates the impressive lever of high order accuracy achieved by the Lagrange-Galerkin method at computational costs comparable or better than the Euler-Galerkin method. In addition, examples using advancing front unstructured grids illustrate the flexibility of the Lagrange-Galerkin method on different grid types, By introducing generalized <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> and the tree data structure for the spherical geodesic grid, the Lagrange-Galerkin method can be used for solving practical problems on the sphere more accurately than current methods, yet requiring less computer time.

40|$|Abstract. A self-adaptation {{method for}} natural-coordinate systems is proposed, {{in order to}} {{automate}} the selection of <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> for each rigid element of a multibody system. The four-step method includes: First, find out all empty positions, which come from the feature points or vectors of the joints attached to the element, and give equal weight to them; second, delete redundant empty positions and add their weight to the unique one; third, select at most four empty positions which have a maximum total weight and can be occupied by a natural-coordinate system at the same time; fourth, the standard natural-coordinate system on the element can adapt itself to the selected empty positions, leading to an actual natural-coordinate system, which contains twelve rational <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> for the element.

Presumably, such frames should {{be as much as}} possible autonomous, i. e. once they are properly defined {{they should be able to}} perform their functions with the least reference to the external reference frame they are defined in. As a possible tool for such frames there are considered the so- called <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> (also called barycentric or area coordinates) defined for separate triangles of a 3 -D or 2 -D network. Besides of reviewing their theoretical background and properties they are used to give solutions to some geodetic problems such as direct and reverse problems, intersection and resection, transformations and projections, etc. Their relations to covariant/contravariant vector components and the use of the metric tensor are investigated to facilitate the solutions. Main properties of <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> consist in their invariance with respect to linear transformations of the frame, as well as in a separation of nonmetric and metric relations between geometric structures within the frame. Considered are also some other applications of <b>natural</b> <b>coordinates</b> such as in GPS positioning, in photogrammetry, as well as in finite element approximation in deforming networks.

It was ascertained that: 1) the domes of spruce seedlings have a paraboloidal shape; 2) the shape is maintained during growth, but the domes become higher and wider; 3) {{the relative}} elemental rate of growth in area on dome surface is isotropic, as indicated by analysis of cell packets in the surface layer.
