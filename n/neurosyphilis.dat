5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle. In {{those who have a}} severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with <b>neurosyphilis,</b> intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{infectious}} diseases can be transmitted either congenitally (before or at birth), and can cause serious neurodevelopmental problems, as for example the viruses HSV, CMV, rubella (congenital rubella syndrome), Zika virus, or bacteria like Treponema pallidum in congenital syphilis, which may progress to <b>neurosyphilis</b> if it remains untreated. Protozoa like Plasmodium or Toxoplasma which can cause congenital toxoplasmosis with multiple cysts {{in the brain and}} other organs, leading to a variety of neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} radical {{physical}} therapies {{were developed in}} central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg's malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (or <b>neurosyphilis)</b> first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927. This treatment heralded {{the beginning of a}} radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum-based culture of therapeutic nihilism in the treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, most particularly dementia praecox (increasingly known as schizophrenia from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as hereditary degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention. Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by barbiturate induced deep sleep therapy to treat dementia praecox, which was popularised by the Swiss psychiatrist Jakob Klaesi. In 1933 the Vienna-based psychiatrist Manfred Sakel introduced insulin shock therapy and in August 1934 Ladislas J. Meduna, a Hungarian neuropathologist and psychiatrist working in Budapest, introduced cardiazol shock therapy (cardiazol is the tradename of the chemical compound pentylenetetrazol, known by the tradename metrazol in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a psychiatric disorder. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing dementia praecox. Cardiazol shock therapy, founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between schizophrenia and epilepsy and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist Ugo Cerletti in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Adrian Stokes of yellow fever in September 1927, it became {{increasingly}} evident that yellow fever {{was caused by a}} virus, not by the bacillus Leptospira icteroides, as Noguchi believed. Feeling his reputation was at stake, Noguchi hastened to Lagos to carry out additional research. However, he found the working conditions in Lagos did not suit him. At the invitation of Dr. William Alexander Young, the brilliant young director of the British Medical Research Institute, Accra, Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana), he moved to Accra and made this his base in 1927. However, Noguchi proved a very difficult guest and by May 1928 Young regretted his invitation. Noguchi was secretive and volatile, working almost entirely at night to avoid contact with fellow researchers. The diaries of Oskar Klotz, another researcher with the Rockefeller Foundation, describe Noguchi’s temper and behavior as erratic and bordering on the paranoid. His methods were haphazard. According to Klotz, he inoculated huge numbers of monkeys with yellow fever, but failed to keep proper records. He may have believed himself immune to yellow fever, having been inoculated with a vaccine of his own development. Possibly his erratic and irresponsible behavior was caused by the untreated syphilis with which he was diagnosed in 1913, and which may have progressed to <b>neurosyphilis.</b> In any case, he was careless not only of his own safety, but also of the safety of those around him. Despite repeated promises to Young, Noguchi failed to keep infected mosquitoes in their specially designed secure housing. In May 1928, having failed to find evidence for his theories, Noguchi was set to return to New York, but was taken ill in Lagos. He boarded his ship to sail home, but on 12 May was put ashore at Accra and taken to a hospital with yellow fever. After lingering for some days, he died on 21 May.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{relationship}} between syphilis {{and the two}} types of pupils (AR pupils and tonic pupils) is not known at the present time. [...] The older literature on AR pupils did not report the details of pupillary constriction (brisk vs. tonic) that are necessary to distinguish AR pupils from tonic pupils. Tonic pupils can occur in <b>neurosyphilis.</b> [...] It is not known whether <b>neurosyphilis</b> itself (infection by Treponema pallidum) can cause tonic pupils, or whether tonic pupils in syphilis simply reflect a coexisting peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond A. Vonderlehr was {{appointed}} on-site {{director of the}} research program and developed the policies that shaped the long-term follow-up section of the project.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of that decade, [...] "White" [...] Premier Manolache Costache Epureanu opened his cabinet to Junimist experts, and Pogor was expected to take over a top administrative position. Carp, who negotiated the deal, vouched for Pogor's competence. Pogor resigned before the so-called [...] "Hen and Fledgling" [...] cabinet was even sworn in. Reportedly, he complained of dorsopathy, leaving Maiorescu worried that he had developed <b>neurosyphilis.</b> Pogor declared himself cured within a few days, announcing that he was ready to take over as Romania's Minister of Education. According to various sources, he actually held the office, if only briefly. His unexpected renunciation cleared the path for Maiorescu's own political ascent, moving him from a position in the background to the [...] "Fledgling" [...] Education portfolio.|$|E

50|$|<b>Neurosyphilis</b> is an {{infection}} of the brain or spinal cord caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It usually occurs in {{people who have had}} chronic, untreated syphilis, usually about 10 to 20 years after first infection and develops in about 25%-40% of persons who are not treated. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that <b>neurosyphilis</b> can occur at any stage of a syphilis infection.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Neurosyphilis</b> {{was almost}} at the point being unheard of in the United States after {{penicillin}} therapy was introduced. However, concurrent infection of T. pallidum with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) {{has been found to}} affect the course of syphilis. Syphilis can lie dormant for 10 to 20 years before progressing to <b>neurosyphilis,</b> but HIV may accelerate the rate of the progress. Also, infection with HIV has been found to cause penicillin therapy to fail more often. Therefore, <b>neurosyphilis</b> has once again been prevalent in societies with high HIV rates and limited access to penicillin. Blood testing for syphilis was once required in order to obtain a marriage license in most U.S. states, but that requirement has been discontinued by all 50 states over recent years, also contributing to the spread of the disease.|$|E

50|$|Treponema pallidum invades {{the nervous}} system within three to {{eighteen}} months after the primary infection. The initial series of events is asymptomatic meningitis, which can remain {{in the human body}} system and produce more damage within the body. Every form of <b>neurosyphilis</b> has meningitis as a component; however, every case differs in severity. The individual is infected with syphilis through a gram negative bacteria that only humans can obtain. Syphilis has four stages of infection, which are primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. If syphilis is not treated, the disease can affect various other systems in the body, including the brain, heart, and vessels. The infection of the heart and vessels leads to meningovascular syphilis, which is usually presented during the secondary stage of syphilis. If syphilis is prolonged, it can affect {{the nervous system}}, which is known as <b>neurosyphilis.</b> Meningeal syphilis is a component of <b>neurosyphilis,</b> which usually occurs in the tertiary stage of syphilis.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Reese {{developed}} a {{particular interest in}} <b>neurosyphilis,</b> which, in the 1920s and 1930s, accounted for >10% of all psychiatric illnesses. In the days before effective antibiotic therapy of that disease, somewhat unconventional treatments were utilized. One of them involved the purposeful infection of patients with malarial organisms, {{with the goal of}} creating a fever. That technique followed the empiric observation that syphilis sometimes improved after febrile illnesses. Reese collaborated with investigators at other institutions using this approach, known as the [...] "Wagner-Jauregg" [...] treatment. Lorenz and Bleckwenn also focused on <b>neurosyphilis</b> with respect to their research endeavors, and, as the preeminent neurologist of the group, Reese was asked to evaluate the side-effects of experimental antisyphilitic drugs on nervous system function. The trio of physicians at Wisconsin went on to publish more than 100 papers on neurosyphilis; in particular, they {{developed a}}nd refined an alternative to Wagner-Jauregg therapy, using an arsenical medication called tryparsamide. Until the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, it was probably the most effective treatment for <b>neurosyphilis</b> available.|$|E
