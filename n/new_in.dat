5|$|Although the {{original}} fleet {{did not include}} any minibuses, {{a large number of}} Mercedes-Benz vehicles were introduced from September 1986 on a high-frequency route in central and northern Glasgow; it did not prove profitable and was converted to full-size operation a year later, with many of the minibuses transferred to other SBG subsidiaries. Another unusual vehicle in the Kelvin fleet was the only Leyland Lynx bought by Scottish Bus Group, which was delivered <b>new</b> <b>in</b> 1989. Six rare Leyland Lion double-deckers were ordered in 1988, but owing to a large cut in Kelvin's peak vehicle requirement they did not enter service with the company and were instead sent to Clydeside Scottish.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, NSB {{announced}} that the traffic around Trondheim would become the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, which would take {{over most of the}} Class 92 trains.

The changes to the schedule involved almost a doubling of the number of departures, particularly between Trondheim and Stjørdal, where a one-hour headway was introduced. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. While local trains had existed previously north of Trondheim, the services south to Oppdal were all <b>new</b> <b>in</b> an area which was previously only served by intercity and night trains. The initial services consisted of four services from Trondheim—northwards along the Nordland Line to Steinkjer, east along the Meråker Line to Storlien, south along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and south-east along the Røros Line to Tynset.|$|E

5|$|Once Upon a Child {{purchases}} and sells used children's attire and toys. The first Once Upon a Child store was opened in 1985 in Perrysburg, Ohio, by Dennis and Lynn Blum in 1985 after they observed Goodwill Industries accepting and selling used baby attire.

5|$|Participation in the Crusades {{was also}} {{seen as a}} form of pilgrimage, and indeed the same Latin word, peregrinatio, was {{sometimes}} applied to both activities. While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited, England played a prominent part in the Second, Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries, with many crusaders leaving for the Levant during the intervening years. The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not <b>new</b> <b>in</b> England, however, as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo-Saxon times. Many of those who took up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left, often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey. Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or mortgaging their lands and possessions, which affected their families and, at times, considerably affected the economy as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Under Louis XII the courtesans of France {{settled in}} Blois from 1498 to 1515, {{and the city}} became {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of France.

Named after Robertet's barony of Alluyes, construction of the Hôtel d'Alluye began in 1498 or 1500 and was completed in 1508. It was built during his tenure as secretary and notary to Louis XII, and a diplomatic document from the Republic of Florence described the hôtel as <b>new</b> <b>in</b> September 1508. The hôtel particulier is an example of French Renaissance architecture; this, coupled with its ornamentation, were intended to reflect the tastes of Robertet, who was well known for his artistic collections. One of the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Blois, the hôtel indicates the influence of the Quattrocento on him.|$|E
5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player can carry a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. <b>New</b> <b>in</b> Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds.
