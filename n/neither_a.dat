It was quickly replaced by the Brazos Valley seventh Sonic Drive-In location, the only in the area with <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> drive-in nor drive through option. The Sonic closed in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that is <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> planet nor a natural satellite. That is, {{it is in}} direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There is <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Deficiencies in {{vanadium}} {{result in}} reduced growth in rats. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that vanadium {{is an essential}} nutrient for humans, so <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> Recommended Dietary Intake nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Dietary intake is estimated at 6 to 18 µg/day, with less than 5% absorbed. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of dietary vanadium, beyond which adverse effects may occur, is set at 1.8 mg/day.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{voices are}} often used, it is <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> concert opera nor a cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, {{almost from the}} beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the {{dramatic}} scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....|$|E

On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film {{could be made}} for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million.

5|$|In December 1961, Disney Studios {{released}} Babes in Toyland, a {{film version}} of Victor Herbert's 1903 operetta starring teen heartthrobs Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands. Though new songs with jazzy tempi were incorporated into the film and one critic was delighted with the film's colorful numbers, Babes in Toyland was <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> success nor a complete box office flop. Its gigantic toy soldiers became members of the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Christmas Parades.|$|E

5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E

5|$|An online {{petition}} {{was formed}} {{in response to the}} concerns raised about the planned mosque, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent the building of the mosque; the petition closed with over 250,000 signatures and was at the time the most signed petition on the site. Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E
5|$|Ayane was {{originally}} introduced as an unnamed training dummy in the Sega Saturn version of Dead or Alive, before {{she became a}} player character in the 1998 PlayStation port, in which she is an opponent character in the practice and tournament modes (Ayane was later included in the Dead or Alive ++ arcade edition) {{as well as an}} unlockable secret character. In the original DOA, Ayane has had <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> written background nor in-game plot-line (according to the later canon, Ayane was sent to secretly follow Kasumi).|$|E
5|$|Chris Hemsworth reprises {{his role}} of Thor from {{previous}} MCU {{films in the}} film's mid-credits scene. Additionally, Linda Louise Duan appears, unnamed, as Tina Minoru, Mark Anthony Brighton portrays Daniel Drumm, and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir, all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One. The latter is based on Hamir the Hermit, Wong's father in the comics, who was the Ancient One's personal manservant. The character is <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> manservant nor Wong's father in the film. Zara Phythian, Alaa Safi, and Katrina Durden portray zealots under Kaecilius, and Pat Kiernan appears as himself. Doctor Strange co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a bus rider reading Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception. Amy Landecker was cast as anesthesiologist Bruner, {{but the majority of}} her role was cut from the finished film.|$|E

5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E
5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with the problem}} and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E
