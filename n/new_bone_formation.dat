25|$|In {{naturally}} dentate species, edentulism is {{more than}} just the simple presence or absence of teeth; it is biochemically complex, because the teeth, jaws, and oral mucosa are not static objects; they are dynamic (changing over time). Processes such as bone remodeling (loss and gain of bone tissue) in the jaws and inflammation of soft tissue in response to the oral microbiota are clinically important for edentulous people. For example, bone resorption in the jaw is frequently how the teeth were able to detach in the first place; the jaw in an edentulous area undergoes further resorption even after the teeth are gone; and insertion of dental implants can elicit <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> <b>formation,</b> leading to osseointegration. Meanwhile, bacteria and yeasts of the oral cavity and the immune system of their host create an immensely complicated and constantly changing interplay that presents clinically as gingivitis, caries, stomatitis, and other periodontal pathology.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{persistent}} rumors suggesting otherwise, {{there is}} no clear association between water fluoridation and cancer or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for bone cancer and osteosarcoma. Series of research concluded that concentration of fluoride in water doesn't associate with osteosarcoma. The beliefs regarding association of fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma stem from a study of US National Toxicology program in 1990, which showed uncertain evidence of association of fluoride and osteosarcoma in male rats. But there is still no solid evidence of cancer-causing tendency of fluoride in mice. Fluoridation of water has been practiced around the world to improve citizens' dental health. It is also deemed as major health success. Fluoride concentration levels in water supplies are regulated, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates fluoride levels to not be greater than 4 milligrams per liter. Actually, water supplies already have natural occurring fluoride, but many communities chose to add more fluoride {{to the point that it}} can reduce tooth decay. Fluoride is also known for its ability to cause <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> <b>formation.</b> [...] Yet, further research shows no osteosarcoma risks from fluoridated water in humans. Most of the research involved counting number of osteosarcoma patients cases in particular areas which has difference concentrations of fluoride in drinking water. The statistic analysis of the data shows no significant difference in occurrences of osteosarcoma cases in different fluoridated regions. Another important research involved collecting bone samples from osteosarcoma patients to measure fluoride concentration and compare them to bone samples of newly diagnosed malignant bone tumors. The result is that the median fluoride concentrations in bone samples of osteosarcoma patients and tumor controls are not significantly different. Not only fluoride concentration in bones, Fluoride exposures of osteosarcoma patients are also proven to be not significantly different from healthy people.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} clinical signs, describe lesions {{and differences}} in the magnetic resonance imaging appearance of spinal <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> <b>formations</b> classified as disseminated idiopathic spinal hyperostosis and/or spondylosis deformans on radiographs and compare degeneration status of the intervertebral discs using the Pfirrmann scale. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 18 dogs presented with spinal disorders using information from radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging examinations. RESULTS All dogs {{were found to be}} affected with both disseminated idiopathic spinal hyperostosis and spondylosis deformans. Neurological signs due to foraminal stenosis associated with disseminated idiopathic spinal hyperostosis were found in two dogs. Spondylosis deformans was associated with foraminal stenosis and/or disc protrusion in 15 cases. The Pfirrmann score on magnetic resonance imaging was significantly higher in spondylosis deformans compared with disseminated idiopathic spinal hyperostosis and signal intensity of <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> due to disseminated idiopathic spinal hyperostosis was significantly higher compared to spondylosis deformans. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Differences between disseminated idiopathic spinal hyperostosis and spondylosis deformans found on magnetic resonance imaging contribute to an increased differentiation between the two entities.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decade, bisphosphonates (BPs) have {{attracted}} increasing attention as a surface modifier for orthopedic and dental implants. Bisphosphonates are stable pyrophosphates that prevent {{the loss of}} bone mass and are used widely to treat a range of diseases with excess bone resorption, such as bone metastasis, hypercalcemia of a malignancy, and Paget’s disease [13 – 16]. In orthopedic implants, the use of BP is expected to promote osteogenesis at the bone tissue/implant interface by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts. BPs were reported to inhibit the differentiation of the osteoclast precursor and the resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts [17, 18]. Furthermore, BPs alter the morphology of osteoclasts, such {{as a lack of}} ruffled border and disruption of the actin ring, both in vitro and in vivo[19, 20]. García-Moreno et al. reported that BPs enhance the proliferation, differentiation, and bone-forming activity of osteoblasts directly [21]. Recently, pamidronic acid, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, was reported to conjugate the titanium surface and stimulate <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> <b>formations</b> around the implant both in vitro and in vivo, which contribute {{to the success of the}} implant technology [22, 23].|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we found that nanofibrous poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds mimicking collagen fibers in size were superior to solid-walled scaffolds in promoting osteoblast differentiation and <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> in vitro. In this study we used an in vivo model to confirm the biological properties of nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds and to evaluate how effectively they support bone regeneration against solid-walled scaffolds. The scaffolds were implanted in critical-size defects made on rat calvarial bones. Compared with solid-walled scaffolds, nanofi-brous scaffolds supported substantially more <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> tissue <b>formation,</b> which was confirmed by micro-computed tomography measurement and von Kossa staining. Goldner’s trichrome staining showed abundant collagen deposition in nanofibrous scaffolds {{but not in the}} control solid-walled scaffolds. The cells in these scaffolds were immuno-stained strongly for Runx 2 and bone sialoprotein (BSP). In contrast, solid-walled scaf-folds implanted in the defects were stained weakly with trichrome, Runx 2, and BSP.

50|$|The {{easiest way}} to {{diagnose}} PDP is when pachydermia, finger clubbing and periostosis of the long bones are present. <b>New</b> <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> under the periosteum can be detected by radiographs of long bones.

5000|$|One {{theory is}} that hypertrophic {{osteopathy}} is caused by increased {{blood flow to the}} ends of the legs, overgrowth of connective tissue, and then <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> surrounding the bones.

40|$|Remodeling {{of joints}} {{is a key}} feature of {{inflammatory}} and degenerative joint disease. Bone erosion, cartilage degeneration and growth of bony spurs termed osteophytes are key features of structural joint pathology {{in the course of}} arthritis, which lead to impairment of joint function.

This addendum summarizes the new insights in the molecular regulation of <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> in the joint and its relation to bone resorption. It describes how inflammatory cytokines impair <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> and block the repair response of joints towards inflammatory stimuli. It particularly points out the key role of Dickkopf- 1 protein, a regulator of the Wingless signaling and inhibitor of <b>bone</b> <b>formation.</b> This <b>new</b> link between inflammation and <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> is also crucial for explaining the generation of osteophytes, bony spurs along joints, which are characterized by <b>new</b> <b>bone</b> and cartilage <b>formation.</b> This mechanism is largely dependent on an activation of wingless protein signaling and can lead to complete joint fusion.

Moreover the influence of a collagen/chondroitin sulfate (coll I/cs) coating of PCL scaffolds was evaluated. Defect areas filled with autologous bone and empty defects served as reference.

40|$|Background: The {{histological}} {{features of}} osteitis in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in animal studies induced by bacterial inoculation into maxillary sinuses revealed inflammatory {{involvement of the}} underlying bone matrix and/or the Haversian system; however, human studies do not mention these findings. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the inflammatory characterization of osteitis in CRS. Method: A prospective study of primary CRS patients undergoing sinus surgery was conducted (August 2012 to April 2013). Bone-mucosa samples were taken from a predetermined site that correlated to a computed tomography location. Radiological bone thickness was measured. A blinded histopathological assessment included inflammatory infiltrate of bone, periosteal reaction, presence of osteoblasts or osteoclasts, fibrosis, and the percentage of <b>new</b> woven <b>bone</b> to total bone thickness, together with an overall opinion of whether neo-osteogenesis was present. Results: Twenty-two primary CRS patients (age 45. 8 ± 15. 6 years; 59. 1 % female) were recruited. CRS with polyps accounted for 59. 1 % of patients. The bony thickness measured radiologically was a median 1. 72 (interquartile range [IQR], 2. 38; range, 0. 3 - 12. 14) mm. No samples (0 %) had evidence of inflammatory infiltrate of bone; 90. 9 % had both osteoblasts present and <b>new</b> woven <b>bone</b> <b>formation.</b> Woven <b>bone</b> was greater with periosteal reaction (80. 83 % ± 9. 25 % vs. 47. 50 % ± 29. 37 %; p = 0. 006), greater with osteoclasts present (80. 00 % ± 12. 58 % vs 59. 00 % ± 28. 52 %; p = 0. 03), and greater when fibrosis was present (69. 75 % ± 24. 14 % vs 25. 00 % ± 7. 07 %; p = 0. 003). Conclusion: Most primary CRS patients demonstrated evidence of <b>new</b> woven <b>bone</b> <b>formation.</b> True "osteitis" with inflammatory infiltrate of the bone was not observed. "Osteitis" is likely a process of neo-osteogenesis and bone remodeling, rather than bone inflammation in primary CRS. 7 page(s...|$|R
