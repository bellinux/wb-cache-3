It is found that several distinct temporal stages of <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> can be distinguished in which one of these quantities shows a characteristic behaviour and that these times coincide {{for many of these}} measurements. The rate of change in the measured data is correlated with proposed solute dynamics during <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> for both ageing that takes place prior to artificial <b>ageing</b> <b>natural</b> pre <b>ageing</b> and post artificial underageing <b>natural</b> secondary <b>ageing</b> heat treatments.

40|$|Quench {{sensitivity}} in Al-Mg-Si alloys {{has been}} largely attributed to the solute loss at the heterogeneous nucleation sites, primarily dispersoids, during slow cooling after extrusion. As such, the number density of dispersoids, the solute type and concentration {{are considered to be}} the key variables for the quench sensitivity. In this study, quench sensitivity and the influence of <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> in a lean Al-Mg-Si alloy, AA 6060, which contains few dispersoids, have been investigated by hardness measurement, thermal analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). It is shown that the quench sensitivity in this alloy is associated with the degree of supersaturation of vacancies after cooling. Due to vacancy annihilation and clustering during <b>natural</b> <b>ageing,</b> the quench sensitivity is more pronounced after a short <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time (30 min) compared to a longer <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time (24 h). Therefore, prolonged <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> not only leads to an increase in hardness, but can also {{have a positive effect on}} the quench sensitivity of lean Al-Mg-Si alloys...|$|R
40|$|Although Al alloys {{based on}} the Al-Cu-(Mg) system have been {{investigated}} for decades, information about the evolution of microstructure on the atomistic level during <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> is scarce. Therefore, {{the early stages of}} <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> in laboratory Al-Cu-(Mg) alloys and in AA 2024 were investigated using positron annihilation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This complementary approach allows for accessing both essential components of Al alloys, namely vacancies and alloying elements. It is found, that during <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> the chemical environment of vacancies is formed both of Cu and Mg atoms and that the rearrangement of vacancy surroundings persists the hardness increase of Al-Cu-Mg alloys. During <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> two different regimes of vacancy environment are detected and interpreted in terms of cluster growth and vacancy capture. Features of the near edge structure of the X-ray absorption are interpreted using theoretical calculations obtained by the FEFF 8. 4 c ode. Thus the agglomeration of Cu and Mg, which is accompanied by lattice distortions around Cu atoms, can be probed. A minimal size of Cu-Mg co-clusters is proposed for later stages of <b>natural</b> <b>ageing...</b>|$|R
25|$|There is a {{long history}} of using {{artificial}} means to try to accelerate the <b>natural</b> <b>aging</b> process. In Ancient Rome a smoke chamber known as a fumarium was used to enhance the flavor of wine through artificial aging. Amphorae were placed in the chamber, which was built on top of a heated hearth, in order to impart a smoky flavor in the wine that also seemed to sharpen the acidity. The wine would sometimes come out of the fumarium with a paler color just like aged wine. Modern winemaking techniques like micro-oxygenation can have the side effect of artificially aging the wine. In the production of Madeira and rancio wines, the wines are deliberately exposed to excessive temperatures to accelerate the maturation of the wine. Other techniques used to artificially age wine (with inconclusive results on their effectiveness) include shaking the wine, exposing it to radiation, magnetism or ultra-sonic waves. More recently, experiments with artificial aging through high-voltage electricity have produced results above the remaining techniques, as assessed by a panel of wine tasters.|$|E

40|$|Hardness {{measurements}} and 3 -dimensional atom probe analysis {{have been used}} to characterise the precipitation behaviour in two 6 xxx series aluminium alloys, one Cu-free alloy (Al- 0. 78 at%Mg 0. 68 at%Si) and one Cu-containing alloy (Al- 0. 78 at%Mg- 0. 68 at%Si- 0. 30 at%Cu). The heat treatments consisted of either <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> or pre-ageing at 353 K followed by a paint-bake treatment at 453 K. <b>Natural</b> <b>ageing</b> was seen to increase the hardness, and hence reduce formability compared to pre-ageing. In addition, the strengthening effect of artificial ageing was less after <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> than after pre-ageing. In the Cu-ftee alloy, needle-like beta" was observed to form only after a pre-ageing treatment during the first 60 minutes of a paint-bake treatment. In the Cu-containing alloy, needle-like beta" formed during paint bake in both the naturally-aged and pre-aged material, although it is formed more rapidly after pre-ageing. This was accompanied by an increase in strength over the Cu-ftee alloy and indicates that Cu reduces the deleterious effect of <b>natural</b> <b>ageing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Quench sensitivity, the {{dependence}} of strength and hardness on the cooling rate after extrusion or solution treatment, limits the applications of extrusions of heat treatable aluminium alloys. Reduced properties in slow cooled samples have long been attributed {{to the loss of}} solute on heterogeneous nucleation sites during cooling. While minimum cooling rates to avoid precipitation of Mg-Si-containing phases and reduced properties have been mapped out for a broad range of commercial alloys, little is understood about the physical mechanisms leading to quench sensitivity. In this investigation the difference in hardness evolution between slow cooled and fast quenched samples of various commercial and model Al-Mg-Si alloys has been determined for a broad range of <b>natural</b> and artificial <b>ageing</b> times. This has demonstrated that the artificial ageing response of fast quenched samples differs greatly from the artificial ageing response of slow cooled samples. In contrast to fast cooled samples, where <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> has a negative effect, the artificial ageing response of slow cooled samples is less dependent on <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time. As a result, hardness differences between fast and slow cooled samples is large during artificial <b>ageing</b> after short <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> times, but small after long <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> times, such that quench sensitivity strongly varies. In order to explain this phenomenon, the cooling rate dependent microstructural development has been investigated using hardness measurements, electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). From TEM investigations and theoretical considerations of the diffusion range it has been determined that solute is only lost from a limited region around the non-hardening precipitates forming during cooling on secondary dispersoids. The increased age hardening rate in fast cooled samples after short <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> times is therefore the result of a high vacancy supersaturation rather than a high solute supersaturation compared to slow cooled samples. Non-equilibrium vacancies appear to act as precipitation sites for the precursor of the strengthening β”-precipitates. In slow cooled samples the formation of β”-precipitates seems to be suppressed. In lean alloys with a low solute content, such as the investigated AA 6060, the age hardening response is almost independent of the cooling rate. Small additions of Cu or changes in the Mg:Si-ratio in alloys with a combined Mg+Si-content greater than 1 wt. % have little effect on precipitation of non-hardening phases during cooling, but affect <b>natural</b> and artificial <b>ageing</b> behaviour. The cooling rate after extrusion or solution treatment was also found to affect whether <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> has a negative effect or not. In fast cooled samples of Al-Mg-Si alloys with combined Mg+Si-contents greater than 1 wt. % the decrease in ageing kinetics due to the decrease of non-equilibrium vacancies with increasing <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time contributes to the negative effect. In slow cooled samples the initial number of quenched-in vacancies is low, such that ageing kinetics are independent of the <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time...|$|R
