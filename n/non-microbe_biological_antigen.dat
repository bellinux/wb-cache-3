40|$|Three cell wall-associated protein antigens (antigens b, c, and d) were {{isolated}} from mutanolysin-solubilized cell walls of Streptococcus salivarius HB and purified to apparent homogeneity {{by a combination}} of ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and immunoadsorption chromatography. Antigens b and c were also isolated from culture supernatants. Antigen b consisted of more than 80 % protein and had an apparent molecular weight as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 320, 000. Antigen c consisted of 57 % protein, about 30 % neutral sugar, and about 13 % amino sugar, and its glycoprotein nature was confirmed by specific staining techniques. During sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis antigen c resolved into two or more bands, depending on the source or the isolation procedure, in the molecular weight range from 220, 000 to 280, 000. Antigen d consisted of 95 % protein and was observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as two bands with molecular weights of 129, 000 and 121, 000. Under nondenaturing conditions all three antigens had molecular weights in the range from 1 × 106 to 3 × 106 as determined by gel filtration. The amino acid compositions of antigens b, c, and d were characterized by low amounts of basic amino acids and relatively high levels of nonpolar amino acids. Among oral streptococcal species antigens b and c were virtually restricted to strains of S. salivarius and most often to serotype I strains. Antigen b was recognized as the factor that mediates coaggregation of S. salivarius with Veillonella strains.

Here, we show that, on activated T cells, the TCR avidity for peptide-MHC complexes is 20 - to 50 -fold higher than the TCR avidity of naive T cells. This increased avidity for peptide-MHC depends on TCR reorganization and is sensitive to the cholesterol content of the T cell membrane. Analysis of the binding data indicates the enhanced avidity is due to increases in cross-linking of TCR on activated T cells. Activation-induced membrane (AIM) changes in TCR avidity represent a previously unrecognized means of increasing the sensitivity of activated T cells to small amounts of antigen in the periphery...|$|R

40|$|When {{antibodies}} {{against a}} well-defined antigen {{are used to}} immunize animals of the same genetic background, the antibodies raised {{are referred to as}} antiidiotypic (1 - 8).

To obtain sufficient amounts of such antigens, efficient protein production platforms are needed. In this study, a pipeline {{for the production}} and purification of surface-exposed and secreted antigens of the gram-positive bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is presented. Cytoplasmic or extracellular production of S. aureus antigens was achieved using the Lactococcus lactis strain PA 1001, which lacks the major extracellular protease HtrA and the autolysin AcmA to minimize proteolysis and cell lysis, respectively. For most tested S. aureus antigens, secretory production directed by the signal peptide of the major secreted protein Usp 45 of L. lactis resulted in higher yields than intracellular production without a signal peptide. Additionally, secretory production of His-tagged antigens allowed their facile one-step purification from the growth medium by metal affinity chromatography. For three of the purified <b>antigens,</b> <b>biological</b> activity was confirmed through enzyme activity assays.

Ultrasound elastography is a novel imaging technique capable of mapping tissue stiffness of the prostate. It is known that prostatic cancer tissue is often harder than healthy tissue (information used by digital rectal examination [DRE]). Two elastography techniques have been developed based on different principles: first, quasi-static (or strain) technique, and second, shear wave technique. The tissue stiffness information provided by US elastography should improve the detection of prostate cancer and provide guidance for biopsy. Prostate elastography provides high sensitivity for detecting prostate cancer and shows high negative predictive values, ensuring that few cancers will be missed.

40|$|Pathogenesis of {{infectious}} disease {{is not only}} determined by the virulence of the microbe {{but also by the}} immune status of the host. Vaccination is the most effective means to control infectious diseases. A hallmark of the adaptive immune system is the generation of B cell memory, which provides a long-lasting protective antibody response that is central to the concept of vaccination. Recent studies revealed a distinct function for B 1 b lymphocytes, a minor subset of mature B cells that closely resembles that of memory B cells in a number of aspects. In contrast to the development of conventional B cell memory, which requires the formation of germinal centers and T cells, the development of B 1 b cell-mediated long-lasting antibody responses occurs independent of T cell help. T cell-independent (TI) antigens are important virulence factors expressed by a number of bacterial pathogens, including those associated with <b>biological</b> threats.

Methods: Two hundred ninety-nine subjects with different degrees of retinopathy according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Scale participated in this study. Albuminuria {{was defined as a}}n albumin/creatinine ratio above the normal cutoff limit, that is, 2. 0 g/mol for men and 2. 8 g/mol for women. Hypertension was defined as a diastolic blood pressure more than 90 mm Hg, a systolic blood pressure more than 140 mm Hg, or pharmacological antihypertensive treatment. Serum APAAs were detected by immunofluorescence on tissue-cultured bovine retinal pericytes. Association analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate statistical tools. Results: In type 2 diabetes, APAAs were independently associated with albuminuria (OR = 0. 56; P <. 04), hypertension (OR = 2. 21; P <. 01), as well as with proliferative retinopathy (OR = 0. 39; P <. 01). Conclusions: The increased prevalence of APAA in patients with hypertension may suggest that these antibodies are related to tissue damage and repair and that the decline in frequency with albuminuria may serve as a marker for more advanced angiopathy.

40|$|Background: Activation of naive B {{lymphocytes}} by extracellular ligands, e. g. antigen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CD 40 ligand, induces {{a combination}} of common and ligand-specific phenotypic changes through complex signal transduction pathways. For example, although {{all three of these}} ligands induce proliferation, only stimulation through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) induces apoptosis in resting splenic B cells. In order to define the common and unique biological responses to ligand stimulation, we compared the gene expression changes induced in normal primary B cells by a panel of ligands using cDNA microarrays and a statistical approach, CLASSIFI (Cluster Assignment for Biological Inference), which identifies significant co-clustering of genes with similar Gene Ontology annotation. Results: CLASSIFI analysis revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in ion and vesicle transport, including multiple components of the proton pump, in the BCR-specific gene cluster, suggesting that activation of antigen processing and presentation pathways is a major <b>biological</b> response to <b>antigen</b> receptor stimulation. Ligand-specific changes in the expression of other proton pump components and MHC class II, and the induction of receptor internalization/endocytosis provided experimental support for this hypothesis. Conclusions: The hypothesis that overrepresentation of vesicle transport genes in the BCR-specific gene cluster revealed by the CLASSIFI analysis of the gene expression microarray data reflected the activation of antigen processing and presentation pathways was validated experimentally. Furthermore, the CLASSIFI analysis has identified at least thirty-eight proteins as candidate components of the B cell antigen processing and presentation pathway...|$|R
40|$|Ligation of the antigen receptors on B cells transduces transmembrane signals {{leading to}} the {{induction}} of DNA synthesis. We now show that a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G-protein(s) of the Gi class {{plays a key role}} in the regulation of surface immunoglobulin (sIg) -mediated DNA synthesis in B cells. This site of G-protein regulation is distinct from that we have previously reported to govern the coupling of the antigen receptors on B cells to the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate. We have, moreover, identified a candidate target for this new G-protein regulation by showing that mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPkinase) activity, which {{plays a key role in}} the transduction of sIg-mediated proliferative signals in B cells, is abrogated by pre-exposure to pertussis toxin that covalently modifies and inactivates heterotrimeric G-proteins of the Gi class. Furthermore, our data suggest that this pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein couples the antigen receptors to MAPkinase activation, at least in part, by regulating sIg-coupling to Lyn, Syk and perhaps Blk and Fyn activity, results consistent with studies in other systems which show that classical G-protein-coupled receptors recruit such protein tyrosine kinases to tranduce MAPkinase activation. Interestingly, however, this G-protein plays no apparent role in the control of up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II expression on B cells, suggesting that such G-protein-regulated-tyrosine kinase and MAPkinase activation is not required for the induction of this <b>biological</b> response following <b>antigen</b> receptor ligation...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} helper factors {{necessary}} for in vitro antibody response by B cells {{have been identified}} in the supernates of antigen-stimulated T cells of experimental animals (1 - 6). These factors fall into two broad categories: nonspecific helper factors (1 - 4), and antigen specific helper factors (5, 6). Nonspecific factors of T-cell origin behave like polyclonal B-cell activators and stimulate syngeneic as well as allogeneic B cells to synthetize antibodies against a variety of antigens (1 - 3). On the other hand antigen-specific factors induce only autologous B cells (or B cells that share a haplotype or Ia determinants with autologous B cells) to synthetize antibodies with specificity restricted to the antigen used to elicit the T-cell helper activity. It has also been shown that antigenspecific factors express Ia determinants and contain or can bind to antigen or antigen fragments (5, 6). Supernates of human T cells stimulated with tetanus toxoid antigen (TT) 1 have been shown to contain a helper factor(s) termed lymphocyte mitogenic factor (LMF) which can induce blastogenesis and immunoglobulin synthesis in as many as 50 - 60 % of autologous as well as allogeneic B cells (7).

Circulating antigens were found in five of seven proven cases of IA due to A. fumigatus. In {{two of the five}} positive cases, antigenemia was detected with inhibition-EIA earlier than with X ray or other <b>biological</b> methods.

The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of inhibition-EIA were 71. 4, 94. 4, and 71. 2 %, respectively. The data were compared with those obtained by a latex agglutination assay of galactomannan (GM) that was positive in only one patient with probable IA. The higher sensitivity obtained by inhibition-EIA may well be due to its ability to detect circulating antigens other than GM in the sera of IC patients with IA. Detecting these antigens may improve the diagnosis of IA, as they may serve as markers of this infection...|$|R

Purified CFA/I is a fimbrial molecule 7. 0 nm in diameter and has an average molecular weight of 1. 6 X 10 (6), as determined by sedimentation equilibrium. CFA/I is a polymer of identical subunits of molecular weight 23, 800 with an N-terminal valine, 37 % hydrophobic amino acid residues, and 11 residues of proline per mol. The purified antigen retains its morphology, antigenicity, and <b>biological</b> activity. Purified <b>antigen</b> retains its morphology, antigenicity, and biological activity. Purified CFA/I exhibits mannose-resistant hemagglutination of human group A, bovine, and chicken erythrocytes, as do CFA/I-positive bacteria. This was demonstrated by sensitizing latex microbeads with the purified antigen since cell-free CFA/I fimbriae do not hemagglutinate erythrocytes. Thus, CFA/I detached from the bacteria are monovalent; however, purified CFA/I antigen retains an affinity for the epithelial cells of rabbit small intestine and blocks adhesion of CFA/I-positive bacteria. These results demonstrate that purified CFA/I is a good candidate for use in an oral vaccine for immunoprotection against diarrhea caused by CFA/I-positive enterotoxigenic E. coli...|$|R
40|$|A {{mixture of}} {{well-defined}} recombinant antigens {{together with an}} adjuvant that preferentially stimulates specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) -secreting helper type 1 CD 4 (+) T cells (Th 1 cells) presents a rational option for a vaccine against leishmaniasis. The potential of this approach was investigated in murine infections with Leishmania mexicana, which are characterized {{by the absence of}} a parasite-specific Th 1 response and uncontrolled parasite proliferation. A mixture of three antigens (glycoprotein 63, cysteine proteinases, and a membrane-bound acid phosphatase), which are all expressed in amastigotes, the mammalian stage of the parasite, were used for the immunization of C 57 BL/ 6 mice in combination with six adjuvants (interleukin 12 [IL- 12], Detox, 4 '-monophosphoryl lipid A, QS- 21, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and Corynebacterium parvum). All six vaccine formulations containing the mixture of recombinant antigens were protective against challenge infections with promastigotes, the insect stage of the parasite, in that mice controlled and healed infections but developed transient and, in certain cases, accentuated disease. The most effective adjuvants were IL- 12 followed by Detox. Further studies using these two adjuvants showed that a similar protective effect was observed with a mixture of the corresponding native proteins, and mice which had controlled the infection showed a preponderance of IFN-gamma-secreting CD 4 (+) T cells in the lymph nodes draining the lesion. Using the recombinant proteins individually, it is shown that the relatively abundant cysteine proteinases and glycoprotein 63, but not the acid phosphatase, are able to elicit a protective response. The results are discussed in comparison to previous studies with subunit vaccines and with respect to cell <b>biological</b> aspects of <b>antigen</b> presentation in Leishmania-infected macrophages...|$|R
40|$|A {{patient who}} {{suffered}} a recurring thrombosis over the last 15 yr has been investigated. The only abnormality found in this patient was a significantly depressed level of plasminogen activity in plasma. In spite of the depressed plasminogen activity, the patient {{was found to have}} a normal level of plasminogen antigen concentration. It was calculated that the activity per milligram of plasminogen of the patient was approximately one-half the values of normal subjects. The same discrepancy between <b>biological</b> activity and <b>antigen</b> concentration was found in {{the other members of the}} kindred. A niece was found to have practically no plasminogen activity but possessed a normal concentration of plasminogen antigen. Both her parents were found to have approximately half the normal plasminogen activity and normal antigen levels. These studies suggested that the molecular abnormality was inherited as an autosomal characteristic, and the family members who had half the normal levels of activity with normal plasminogen antigen were heterozygotes whereas the one with practically no plasminogen activity was homozygote. Subsequent studies showed that the pattern of gel electrofocusing of purified plasminogen of the heterozygotes consisted of 10 normal bands and 10 additional abnormal bands, each of which had a slightly higher isoelectric point than each corresponding normal component. This indicates that plasminogen of the heterozygote is a mixture of normal and abnormal molecules in an approximately equal amount, which was substantiated by active site titration of purified plasminogen preparations obtained from the propositus and a normal individual. The gel electrofocusing pattern of the homozygote consisted of abnormal bands only. The defect is a hereditary abnormality of plasminogen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Activation of naïve B {{lymphocytes}} by extracellular ligands, e. g. antigen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CD 40 ligand, induces {{a combination}} of common and ligand-specific phenotypic changes through complex signal transduction pathways. For example, although {{all three of these}} ligands induce proliferation, only stimulation through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) induces apoptosis in resting splenic B cells. In order to define the common and unique biological responses to ligand stimulation, we compared the gene expression changes induced in normal primary B cells by a panel of ligands using cDNA microarrays and a statistical approach, CLASSIFI (Cl uster Assi gnment f or Biological I nference), which identifies significant co-clustering of genes with similar Gene Ontology™ annotation. Results CLASSIFI analysis revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in ion and vesicle transport, including multiple components of the proton pump, in the BCR-specific gene cluster, suggesting that activation of antigen processing and presentation pathways is a major <b>biological</b> response to <b>antigen</b> receptor stimulation. Proton pump components that {{were not included in the}} initial microarray data set were also upregulated in response to BCR stimulation in follow up experiments. MHC Class II expression was found to be maintained specifically in response to BCR stimulation. Furthermore, ligand-specific internalization of the BCR, a first step in B cell antigen processing and presentation, was demonstrated. Conclusion These observations provide experimental validation of the computational approach implemented in CLASSIFI, demonstrating that CLASSIFI-based gene expression cluster analysis is an effective data mining tool to identify biological processes that correlate with the experimental conditional variables. Furthermore, this analysis has identified at least thirty-eight candidate components of the B cell antigen processing and presentation pathway and sets the stage for future studies focused on a better understanding of the components involved in and unique to B cell antigen processing and presentation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Exosomes are 30 - 100 nm {{membrane}} vesicles of endocytic origin {{produced by}} numerous cells. They can mediate diverse <b>biological</b> functions, including <b>antigen</b> presentation. Exosomes {{have recently been}} shown to contain functional RNA, which can be delivered to other cells. Exosomes may thus mediate biological functions either by surface-to-surface interactions with cells, or by the delivery of functional RNA to cells. Our aim was therefore to determine the presence of RNA in exosomes from human saliva, plasma and breast milk and whether these exosomes can be taken up by macrophages. Method Exosomes were purified from human saliva, plasma and breast milk using ultracentrifugation and filtration steps. Exosomes were detected by electron microscopy and examined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed by capturing the exosomes on anti-MHC class II coated beads, and further stain with anti-CD 9, anti-CD 63 or anti-CD 81. Breast milk exosomes were further analysed {{for the presence of}} Hsc 70, CD 81 and calnexin by Western blot. Total RNA was detected with a Bioanalyzer and mRNA was identified by the synthesis of cDNA using an oligo (dT) primer and analysed with a Bioanalyzer. The uptake of PKH 67 -labelled saliva and breast milk exosomes by macrophages was examined by measuring fluorescence using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Results RNA was detected in exosomes from all three body fluids. A portion of the detected RNA in plasma exosomes was characterised as mRNA. Our result extends the characterisation of exosomes in healthy humans and confirms the presence of RNA in human saliva and plasma exosomes and reports {{for the first time the}} presence of RNA in breast milk exosomes. Our results also show that the saliva and breast milk exosomes can be taken up by human macrophages. Conclusions Exosomes in saliva, plasma and breast milk all contain RNA, confirming previous findings that exosomes from several sources contain RNA. Furthermore, exosomes are readily taken up by macrophages, supporting the notion that exosomal RNA can be shuttled between cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Vaccines {{are complex}} multi-component products, {{in which an}} interdependent {{relationship}} among constituents exists: the concomitant inclusion of antigens, adjuvants, and excipients is essential to guarantee {{the efficacy of the}} final product. To stimulate the immune system and raise immunogenicity against highly purified vaccine components most likely adjuvants are required, thus becoming more and more crucial elements of modern vaccine formulations. Physico-chemical and functional attributes of all components and of the whole vaccine formulation have to be controlled before injection. However, often characterization challenges are experienced with the currently available analytical techniques, also because of interferences with adjuvants. In this thesis adjuvants were evaluated with the aim to improve quality and immunogenicity of combination vaccines, in which the inclusion of multiple antigenic components contributes to enhanced complexity of the final product. In detail, three virulence factors of the Gram negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis (pertussis toxin PT, filamentous heamagglutinin FHA, and pertactin 69 K) were chosen as model antigens. Currently licensed acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids in the DTaP/TdaP vaccine, which is considered a cornerstone of combination vaccines. This vaccine is typically adjuvanted with aluminum salts, known to induce mainly a humoral immune response which has been associated with recent pertussis outbreaks reported in many countries. This suggests that existing vaccines may not be ideal to provide protection against the disease. Thus, a pharmaceutical sciences approach focusing on adjuvants was applied to investigate the potential improvement of acellular pertussis vaccines through promotion of the analytical characterization and rational polarization of the quality of immune responses. Improved in vitro characterization assays for combination vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide: Vaccines in vitro characterization is required to identify optimal formulation conditions to ensure physical, chemical, and <b>biological</b> integrity of <b>antigens</b> and adjuvants. Analytical methods currently in use are mostly suitable for the characterization of unformulated antigens – requiring the complete desorption from aluminum-based adjuvants - and are not always able to reveal individual antigens in vaccine combinations. Here, the Luminex technology is proposed as proof of concept for the development of an improved analytical method for vaccine characterization, based on the use of specific antibodies bound to magnetic microspheres presenting unique digital signatures for simultaneous recognition of respective antigens in the entire formulation. TdaP combination vaccines were chosen as a model to develop an assay able to quantify acellular pertussis antigens and their levels of adsorption to adjuvant at the same time. This assay was directly applicable on the commercial vaccine product, avoiding any laborious procedures for separation of the antigens from the adjuvant. Accurate and reproducible quantification of aP antigens in TdaP vaccine has been achieved in a range between 0. 78 and 50 ng/mL, providing information on antigen identity, quantity, and degree of adsorption to aluminum hydroxide. Importantly, the Luminex characterization method {{has the potential to be}} further evaluated as correlate of in vitro potency assays - ideally allowing reducing in vivo animal studies. In vivo evaluation of novel adjuvants for improved aP-containing combination vaccines: The successful approach of combining diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis antigens into a single vaccine has become the cornerstone of pediatric and adults immunization programs. Yet, even if vaccination coverage is high, a resurgence of pertussis has been recently reported in many countries suggesting that current vaccines may not provide adequate long-lasting protection. In order to develop pertussis-containing vaccines able to induce a more durable and better tailored immune response different approaches have been proposed, including the use of novel adjuvants. Currently licensed pertussis vaccines contain aluminum salts, which are the most common adjuvants for human use. By inducing mainly humoral immune responses aluminum salts might not be ideal for providing protection against pathogens which require a more cellular immune response, such as Bordetella pertussis. Therefore, alternative adjuvants that induce more balanced T-helper profiles or even Th 1 -prone responses might be more adequate. In this project, we tested three different adjuvants: MF 59 emulsion adjuvant – that induces a mixed Th 1 / 2 response - as well as the combination of a Toll-Like Receptor 4 agonist (TLR 4 a) or a Toll-Like Receptor 7 agonist (TLR 7 a) with aluminum hydroxide to induce even further Th 1 polarization. The adjuvants were evaluated for their ability to improve immune responses against a TdaP vaccine containing three B. pertussis antigens: genetically detoxified pertussis toxin (PT- 9 K/ 129 G), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (69 K). The quicker onset of serum antibody titers and the changed quality of the antibody responses induced by the adjuvants evaluated here fully support the potential replacement of aluminum salts with alternative adjuvants to enhance pertussis immunogenicity in aP-containing combination vaccines. Conclusions: Overall, the collected results suggested the possibility to modulate quality and efficacy of a complex vaccine product by carefully working on the adjuvant component. Improving the analytical characterization of vaccines while addressing a rational polarization of immune responses are proposed as effective strategies to be pursued for the development of next generation combination vaccines...|$|R
