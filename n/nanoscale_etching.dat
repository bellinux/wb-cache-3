40|$|We {{investigated}} the depth dependence of coherence times of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers through precisely depth controlling by a moderately oxidative at 580 C in air. By successive <b>nanoscale</b> <b>etching,</b> NV centers {{could be brought}} close to the diamond surface step by step, which enable us to trace {{the evolution of the}} number of NV centers remained in the chip and to study the depth dependence of coherence times of NV centers with the diamond etching. Our results showed that the coherence times of NV centers declined rapidly with the depth reduction in their last about 22 nm before they finally disappeared, revealing a critical depth for the influence of rapid fluctuating surface spin bath. By monitoring the coherence time variation with depth, we could make a shallow NV center with long coherence time for detecting external spins with high sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to study the plasma etching process ofmetals (specifically copper) {{in order to develop}} a new method for making copperinterconnects for {{microelectronics}} applications. This new process could offeran alternative for the damascene process to create nanoscale copper features. Ideally,a higher temperature etch process is developed, however hardware limitationsrequired to put the emphasis on the development of a low-temperature (60 &# 176;C) process. During evaluation of different low-temperature methods for copper patterning,two observations were critical and determined the directions of the researchpresented in this work. The first observation is that, even at lowtemperatures, significant process drifts occur in plasma etch chambers, aftercopper has been processed. The second observation is the growth of nanowiresduring room-temperature plasma exposure of halogenated copper films. Since process drifts occur not only for copper but are common for metaletching in general a broader study is performed on process control of metaletch plasmas. It is shown that by recombination of atomic plasma species onmetal residues in the etch chamber, uniformity across the wafer of the etchprocess is impacted. Also, if residues are not cleaned properly wafer-to-wafervariations occur. This phenomenon is investigated using various plasmadiagnostic techniques and a model is proposed that confirms the observations. The nanowire growth process upon plasma exposure of copper halides isstudied in terms of growth conditionsand nanowires are fully characterized. Since this growth process might be anindication of photon induced volatilization of the copper halides, thevolatilization process is studied in depth by exposing samples to pulsed laserlight in a vacuum setup. Experimental results point to a non-thermal pathwayfor the light induced desorption process. A new volatilization mechanism isproposed in which the initial step is photon induced exciton formation in thebulk copper halide. Next, holes can be self-trapped by interstitial cations anddiffuse to the surface where they can recombine with electrons from adsorbedmolecules. This leads to detachment of molecules from the surface. Anotherpathway in the reaction is recombination of electrons with interstitial cationswhich leads to formation of colloids that form the nuclei for nanowire growth. Based on the results of this thesis, it seemsmore appropriate to maintain the current copper damascene based integrationschemes for making interconnects. Anisotropic <b>nanoscale</b> <b>etching</b> of copper doesnot seem a technically feasible process with the current state-of-the-art. Therecommendations resulting from this thesis on etch chamber wall contamination,impact, monitoring and cleaning processes, however, do find wide applicationsas metals are introduced in the critical process steps for making microelectronicdevices. Work on laser induced desorption of copper halides has led to newinsights in photon induced desorption mechanisms. nrpages: 167 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|SAW devices can be {{realized}} as sensors by coating a suitable sensing medium on the acoustic path of the device to detect various physical and chemical measurands. ZnO is a compound widely employed as sensing and wave propagation medium in SAW devices. In particular, high aspect ratio ZnO nanowires are a promising candidate as sensing medium for SAW gas sensors and UV detectors because of its favorable sensing properties, high surface-to-volume ratio and variety of growth techniques. In this thesis, high aspect ratio catalyst-free ZnO nanowires were directly grown as sensing medium {{on the surface of}} SAW devices for the first time through the self-seeding thermal evaporation method. Initially, growth of ZnO nanowires were conducted on blank 128 °-YX LiNbO 3 substrates and the alignment nature of the as-grown nanowires was studied. As-grown ZnO nanowires exhibited a crisscross aligned growth pattern due to step bunching of the polished LiNbO 3 surface during the nanowire growth process. However, it was experimentally observed that <b>nanoscale</b> <b>etching</b> of the LiNbO 3 surface could realize growth of well-aligned ZnO nanowires because of the added surface roughness. The thermal evaporation method was then adopted for direct growth of ZnO nanowires on SAW devices. High temperature stable Rayleigh mode SAW resonators were designed, and fabricated using Pt/Ti electrodes on 128 °-YX LiNbO 3 substrates to facilitate the on-chip nanowire growth conducted at 620 °C. As {{a key part of the}} on-chip growth process, a mask and sleeve setup was used to protect one-half of the IDT aperture during the nanowire growth process to enhance post-growth device functionality. It was observed that the proposed device had approximately 3 times higher sensitivity to UV light of 365 nm wavelength as compared to the only previous report where 1 -D ZnO nanostructures were directly grown on a LiNbO 3 based SAW device using solution grown method for UV detection purposes. Further, FEM simulations were conducted to study the prospects of coupled resonance phenomenon towards enhancing the sensitivity of the ZnO nanowire integrated SAW device to conductivity changes in the sensing medium. It was observed that sensitivity increases by more than 200 times when the ZnO nanowire heights are adjusted such that the resonance frequency of the nanowires approaches the original resonance frequency of the SAW device. FEM simulations were also used to investigate the possibility of switching from Rayleigh waves to higher order Sezawa waves propagating on layered SAW devices to enhance the mass loading sensitivity of SAW sensors. As an example, it was shown that Sezawa waves propagating on a ZnO/Si layered SAW device has 2 to 8 times higher mass loading sensitivity as compared to Rayleigh waves propagating on the same device. The use of the self-seeding thermal evaporation method instead of the conventionally used solution grown method opens up possibilities towards scalable growth of catalyst-free ZnO nanowires without fusion among their roots which increases the surface area of the sensing medium. Moreover, on-chip growth of ZnO nanowires in the absence of a liquid medium has future prospects for in situ measurement of the SAW device response...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a facile fabrication {{of a rich}} variety of silicon patterns with different length scales by combining polymer lithography and a metal-assisted chemical etching method. Several types of polymer patterns were fabricated on silicon substrates, and silver layers were deposited on the patterned silicon surfaces and used to etch the silicon beneath. Various silicon patterns including topographic lines, concentric rings, and square arrays were created at a micro-and <b>nanoscale</b> after <b>etching</b> the silicon and subsequent removal of the patterned polymer masks. Alternatively, the arrays of sub- 30 nm silicon nanowires were produced by a chemical etching of the silicon wafer which was covered with highly ordered polystyrene-block-polyvinylpyridine (PS-b-PVP) micellar films. In addition, silicon nanohole arrays were also generated by etching with hexagonally packed silver nanoparticles that were prepared using PS-b-PVP block copolymer templates. close 5...|$|R
40|$|By {{efficient}} <b>nanoscale</b> plasma <b>etching,</b> the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) {{centers in}} diamond {{were brought to}} the sample surface step by step successfully. At each depth, we used the relative ratios of spin coherence times before and after applying external spins on the surface to present the decoherence, and investigated the relationships between depth and ratios. The values of relative ratios declined and then rised with the decreasing depth, which was attributed to the decoherence influenced by external spins, surface spins, discrete surface spin effects and electric field noise. Moreover, our work revealed a characteristic depth at which the NV center would experience relatively the strongest decoherence caused by external spins in consideration of inevitable surface spins. And the characteristic depth was found depending on the adjacent environments of NV centers and the density of surface spins. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{characterization}} {{and development of}} nanolithography using Electron Beam Lithography system and <b>nanoscale</b> plasma <b>etching.</b> The standard Bosch process and a modified three-pulse Bosch process were developed in STS ICP and Plasma ICP system separately. The limit of the Bosch process at the nanoscale regime was investigated and documented. Furthermore, the effect of different control parameters on the process were studied and summarized in this report. 28 nm-wide trench with aspect-ratio of 25 (smallest trench), and 50 nm-wide trench with aspect ratio of 37 (highest aspect-ratio) have been demonstrated using the modified three-pulse process. Capacitive resonators, SiBAR and IBAR devices have been fabricated using the process developed in this work. IBARs (15 MHz) with ultra-high Q (210, 000) have been reported. M. S.
