5000|$|Working on Lips Tullian was {{an unusual}} task for Saudek. Up to that time, he had mainly {{depicted}} the contemporary world or visions of the future. The historical theme of the series required a different approach and technique. Another problem {{was the lack of}} space intended for a large amount of plot and text in each episode. Gradually, he managed to adapt the format to his own style. Saudek's style changed significantly from the previous period (Muriel albums), however, he has retained one of the most characteristic elements of his style: the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> and cite his previous works in a new and surprising associations. Additionally, the series utilizes [...] "innumerable amount" [...] of double entendres, jokes and hidden meanings (in the text {{as well as in the}} illustrations) in each episode. Lips Tullian, a highwayman from the 17th century, bears closer resemblance to modern superheroes than to a historical character. As a defender of the poor and tormented, he doesn't hesitate to help anywhere; however, his efforts focus mainly on rescuing beautiful women from the hands of evil villains. Eroticism and reflection of female beauty is another important element, characteristic throughout the whole of Saudek's oeuvre. The plot is naïve (based on kitschy 19th-century novels) and the main theme of the series is, in Saudek's words: [...] "revenge and love in many variations, the topic still living".|$|E
40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{and use of}} academic vocabulary has {{a direct impact on}} educational outcomes for L 2 students, in academic preparation programmes, undergraduate studies and postgraduate work. This study investigated the challenges of learning academic vocabulary among 16 postgraduate Saudi students who are studying in New Zealand universities. The study takes the position that students‟ perspectives of the challenges they face in acquiring academic vocabulary can offer an alternative perspective to existing research on academic vocabulary. The study asked four research questions: 1) In which aspects of postgraduate studies are the challenges of learning academic vocabulary mostly found? 2) What are the challenges that postgraduate Saudi students face in acquiring academic vocabulary? 3) What strategies do these postgraduate Saudi students use to learn academic vocabulary? and 4) Do students who report the most challenges tend to have the least vocabulary learning strategies? To answer these research questions a qualitative case study approach was adopted and data were collected through an initial survey, individual face-to-face interviews, and a focus group interview. The findings show that every one of the 16 participants struggled with academic vocabulary, variously in a number of academic settings and across all four language skills. Reading to write (Hirvela, 2016) was of particular challenge due to the extensive <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> from original texts. Additionally, the study found that participants had little prior knowledge of how to acquire academic vocabulary and had few learning strategies to address their difficulties. The findings of this study did not lead to a conclusion that simple exposure to academic vocabulary can increase the chance of incidental vocabulary acquisition but rather, on the contrary, suggests that purposeful vocabulary learning is needed and that such learning needs to be grounded in sound learning strategies, including the use of vocabulary learning tools. Moreover, the study revealed that inappropriate vocabulary learning strategies can cause frustration and loss of motivation. The study has implications for EAP preparation programmes in Saudi Arabia (and indeed elsewhere) and for postgraduate support in New Zealand universities...|$|E
5000|$|The pre-history of {{the text}} {{stretches}} back to {{the origins of the}} O Antiphons themselves, which were in existence by, at the latest, the eighth century. However, to speak meaningfully {{of the text}} of the hymn per se, they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be <b>paraphrased</b> in strophic, metrical form. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that efforts along those lines could have been made quite early; we know, for instance, that they were paraphrased extensively by the English poet Cynewulf in a poem written before the year 800. However, despite popular imagination of an early origin for [...] "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel," [...] the hymn's history is first substantiated only much later.|$|R

The paper makes a pedagogical proposal that paraphrase exercises should be integrated into English lessons, on a regular basis, in which learners are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> every single sentence in their textbook by using some of the paraphrastic techniques identified.

40|$|If {{we are to}} use {{electronic}} plagiarism detectors {{on student}} work, {{it would be interesting}} to know how much similarity should be expected in independently written documents on a similar topic. If our measure is coarse, the answer should be zero, but a finer grained analysis (such as would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> detect inadequate <b>paraphrasing)</b> is likely <b>to</b> detect some background noise. How much background noise should there be? We would like to determine this, but it is hard to publish research based on analysis of student work, because we cannot know whether any particular pair of students worked completely independently or not, and in any case the results might attract unwelcome publicity. To get an estimate of an appropriate level of this background noise, we analysed submissions to an international conference using the Ferret plagiarism detector developed by Lyon et al. (2001). Ferret provides very fast and fine-grained similarity detection in moderately large collections of documents. This was an exercise intra-corporal or collusion detection rather than comparison to Web sources. For this purpose the Ferret algorithm is well suited. There were 483 files; scanning the files took about 50 seconds, and calculating the similarity statistics took about 10 seconds...|$|R
