5|$|Similarly, Neil Brown Jr., {{the actor}} who played Guillermo, gave an {{interview}} where he obliquely referred to possible participation in the Season 2 premiere. This ultimately <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the screen.|$|E
5|$|After Knight's granddaughter {{forwarded}} him {{a copy of}} Knight's autobiographical manuscript, Ottaviani made Knight's role more prominent. Ottaviani's {{interest in}} Knight eventually led to his company G.T. Labs publishing Knight's autobiography, with notes by Ottaviani and forewords by Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen. Other character relationships were fictionalized as well; editor James Gordon Bennet, Jr. never lobbied with Cope, and never exposed Marsh's will. Cope's bones also <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to New York.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a handful}} of men reached Illinois Country, help <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the fort. Most of the {{remaining}} members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region {{as part of the}} Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Brown {{traveled}} to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan {{in search of}} desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get along well, and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to America. Following that trip, Brown wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered {{to be one of}} the best works written about the Arabian horse.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the Rosetta Stone. It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the Louvre Museum. It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801. It is now on display at the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after this}} turmoil, Jamal was rehired by WWE, {{and he and}} Rosey were {{scheduled}} to reunite 3-Minute Warning. The duo wrestled as a tag team during a dark match before the January 9, 2006, episode of Raw. However, on March 21, 2006, Rosey was released from his WWE contract, and the hinted return of 3-Minute Warning <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to television.|$|E
5000|$|Neil Gaiman: Yeah. The Lady Metamorpho. So famous she <b>never</b> even <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into Who's Who. Anyway, she's in there. Terribly sad story.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one episode}} of Riding Bean was {{produced}} and the planned series was <b>never</b> <b>made,</b> due, <b>it</b> is said, to a falling out between writer Kenichi Sonoda and Toshiba EMI.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Charlene/Songs of Love releases, Charlene recorded another album's worth of material for Motown which <b>never</b> even <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into a record pressing plant.|$|R
5|$|The Fragile Yellow Arc of Fragrance was {{the first}} script sent by Moris Farhi. It was one episode long and was a calling card piece never seriously pitched for {{production}}. This story <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the production stage, and {{was included in the}} 2009 publication of Farhi's script for Farewell Great Macedon. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem {{also makes it}} very vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was once}} again {{expected}} to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004. He was subsequently banned until the semi-finals, but <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to action and finished the competition scoreless due to Italy's elimination {{in the first round}} on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
50|$|Previously {{he played}} for Ruch Chorzów, Wisła Kraków and FC Moscow. Though the fee {{transferring}} him to the Russian side was <b>never</b> <b>made</b> public, <b>it</b> {{was assumed to be}} around $1.9 million.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{tropical}} cyclone <b>never</b> <b>made</b> landfall, <b>it</b> caused rain {{in parts of}} Mexico. The highest total of 3.6 in was recorded in Caleta de Campos. Furthermore, the storm brought strong winds to the region, but damage was less than expected.|$|R
50|$|On April 30, 1969 he {{was traded}} by the Orioles along with pitcher John O'Donoghue to the Seattle Pilots, and <b>never</b> again <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{to the major}} league level. His {{lifetime}} ERA for 3.1 innings stands at 0.00.|$|R
5|$|Bournemouth {{signed him}} on loan on 3 December 1999, who he made eight Second Division {{appearances}} for in 1999–2000, having returned to Newcastle on 26 January 2000. His final loan spell was with Stockport County, whom he joined on 25 February 2000, {{where he played}} {{until the end of}} 1999–2000, making five First Division appearances. During his time at Newcastle, he was named as a first-team substitute on six occasions, but <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> onto the pitch. Elliott, however, was a regular in the Newcastle reserve team and eventually became the team's captain. His final Newcastle reserve appearance saw him win the Northumberland Senior Cup for the second time, after scoring a goal from 35yards in the final against Newcastle Blue Star in May 2000.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} {{planning}} for a major uprising then and there, had a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} sent to Prince who agreed to voice the {{character}} and sent back a page of notes about what he would be wearing in various scenes. The writers were confused when the notes did not correspond to the script and they discovered that Prince was referring to a script that had been written by someone else. Prince disliked the Simpsons writers' script and demanded the other one be made into an episode, but the writers refused. The episode eventually fell through and <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> past written form. It {{became one of the}} few completed scripts never to be produced.|$|E
50|$|He played {{badminton}} at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men's singles, {{losing in}} the round of 32 to Chen Hong of China. Jonassen reached the quarterfinals of several Badminton World Championships but <b>never</b> quite <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the medal rounds.|$|R
50|$|None of the {{aircraft}} made by SPCA was built in large numbers. Part of them <b>never</b> even <b>made</b> <b>it</b> past the prototype stage, such as the 1928 SPCA 10, often known as the SPCA Paulhan-Pillard after its designers Louis Paulhan and engineer Pillard.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a mystery}} {{to a lot of}} Swedes how Nilsson with all his talent <b>never</b> really <b>made</b> <b>it</b> big when playing for PSV and Kaiserslautern, but {{according}} to himself he was too shy to make it in those rougher top club environments.|$|R
5|$|Eastwood favors jazz (especially bebop), blues, classic {{rhythm and}} blues, classical, and country-and-western music; his {{favorite}} musicians include saxophonists Charlie Parker and Lester Young, pianists Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Fats Waller, and Delta bluesman Robert Johnson. He {{is also a}} pianist and composer. Jazz has {{played an important role}} in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album Cowboy Favorites, released on the Cameo label.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{reshuffle}} in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion became the Austrian foreign minister, freeing Metternich {{to assume the}} post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. He <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806. He enjoyed being in demand and was happy {{to be sent to}} France on a generous salary of 90,000 gulden a year. After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von Floret, whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Saint-Cloud; soon, the War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards. Metternich's wife and children joined him in October, and he went into society, using his charm to win great eminence there. The presence of Eleonore did not prevent him from a series of affairs that certainly included Napoleon's sister Caroline Murat, Laure Junot, and perhaps many besides.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to {{her house}} that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police {{the next day and}} began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5000|$|Director Lewis Gilbert said on June 25, 2010, on the BBC radio {{programme}} Desert Island Discs, that The Adventurers was [...] "a big, sprawling, very expensive film {{which was a}} disaster. I should <b>never</b> have <b>made</b> <b>it.</b> It's one I'm not proud of." ...|$|R
50|$|On November 7, 1944 Osgood {{was drafted}} by the Chicago Cubs from the Dodgers in the 1944 minor league draft, but he <b>never</b> again <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the major league level. His career ended with a 0-0 record and a 3.00 ERA.|$|R
5000|$|... 1990 saw {{the series}} suffer even more as most races {{averaged}} nine competitors, {{some of which}} <b>never</b> even <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the green flag. John Churchill would take the final championship for his own team as the series was cancelled soon after.|$|R
5|$|The Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, {{and later}} the Little Belt Affair, contributed to the United States' {{decision}} to declare war on Britain on 18June 1812. Chesapeake, {{under the command of}} Captain Samuel Evans, was prepared for duty in the Atlantic. Beginning on 13December, she ranged from Madeira and traveled clockwise to the Cape Verde Islands and South America, and then back to Boston. She captured six ships as prizes: the British ships Volunteer, LiverpoolHero, Earl Percy, and Ellen; the brig Julia, an American ship trading under a British license; and Valeria, an American ship recaptured from British privateers. During the cruise she was chased by an unknown British ship-of-the-line and frigate but, after a passing storm squall, the two pursuing ships were gone the next morning. The cargo of Volunteer, 40tons of pig iron and copper, were sold for $185,000. Earl Percy <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to port as she ran aground off the coast of Long Island, and LiverpoolHero was burned as she was considered leaky. Chesapeakes total monetary damage to British shipping was $235,675. She returned to Boston on 9April 1813 for refitting.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} {{onto the top}} deck but is confronted by Foster and his two {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Jagger {{has also}} had an {{intermittent}} acting career, most well-known {{for his role in}} Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. Jagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry the original performer from its run on London's West End. The same year he was approached by director Alejandro Jodorowsky {{to play the role of}} Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, but the movie <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978 and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, in the late 1970s. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2002).|$|E
50|$|In 1970, Russell {{was paid}} £4689 by the Beatles's company Apple Corps for {{the motion picture}} rights to his novel Wasp, the {{contract}} being signed on behalf of Apple by Ringo Starr. The film was <b>never</b> <b>made,</b> but <b>it</b> remained {{one of the most}} lucrative deals Russell ever made.|$|R
50|$|The {{full extent}} of Belegaer after the Akallabêth is <b>never</b> <b>made</b> clear, but <b>it</b> reaches far enough to the north to be ice-covered, and far to the south.|$|R
50|$|In {{a career}} {{total of three}} games he was 2-for-5 (.400) with one run scored. On November 5, 1946 he was drafted by the New York Yankees from the Pirates in the 1946 minor league draft, but <b>never</b> again <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the major leagues.|$|R
