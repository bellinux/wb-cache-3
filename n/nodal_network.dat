Several field tests of QKD have proven {{it to be a}} reliable technology for cryptographic key exchange and have demonstrated <b>nodal</b> <b>networks</b> of point-to-point links. However, so far no convincing answer has been given {{to the question of how}} to extend the scope of QKD beyond niche applications in dedicated high security networks. Here we show that adopting simple and cost-effective telecommunication technologies to form a quantum access network can greatly expand the number of users in quantum networks and therefore vastly broaden their appeal. We are able to demonstrate that a high-speed single-photon detector positioned at a network node can be shared between up to 64 users for exchanging secret keys with the node, thereby significantly reducing the hardware requirements for each user added to the network. This point-to-multipoint architecture removes one of the main obstacles restricting the widespread application of QKD. It presents a viable method for realising multi-user QKD networks with resource efficiency and brings QKD closer to becoming the first widespread technology based on quantum physics.

40|$|AbstractThe design-research {{illustrated}} {{in this research}} article focus on the emerging field of interactive architecture focusing on developing real-time information exchanging architectural bodies. These interactive bodies demonstrate a fusion between the material, the electronic and the digital domains. This fusion is explicitly attained through a synergistic merger between the fields of ambient sensing, control systems, ubiquitous computing, architectural design, pneumatic systems and computation. The resultant spatial bodies are thus visualised as complex adaptive systems, continually engaged in activities of data-exchange resulting in physical and ambient adaptations of their constituting components in response to contextual variations. Interdependent <b>nodal</b> <b>networks,</b> where every node/junction of a spatial prototype becomes a potential information hub by means {{of its ability to}} collect, process and communicate contextual data apart from working as an actuated detail owing to its ability to kinetically re-position itself in three-dimensional space is thus a critical outcome of this inter-disciplinary way of working.

There are many factors that influence the reliability of EEE parts in the satellite system. Excessively dissipated heat can cause the failure of EEE parts and consequently, leading to a failure of total satellite system. In this paper, the thermal modeling using <b>nodal</b> <b>network</b> was compared with that using plate modeling {{to find out which}} one is the most suitable methodology.

40|$|Transmission network {{constraints}} {{become increasingly}} relevant in generation scheduling models, given the ongoing integration of market zones and {{the deployment of}} renewables in remote areas. However, a full <b>nodal</b> <b>network</b> representation in generation models is often not possible due to computational limitations. Therefore, reduced zonal network models are needed. A crucial step in the nodal-zonal network reduction is the calculation of injection shift keys (ISKs). Injection shift keys denote the nodal contribution to the zonal generation balance and are needed to compile different nodes into one equivalent node. This paper discusses injection shift keys in detail and proposes an improved method to calculate them. According to the improved method, the generation and load portfolio is split up in different categories, and injection shift keys are determined separately for each category. A case study of the central European electricity system indicates that the improved method is able to approximate the <b>nodal</b> <b>network</b> without a considerable increase in computational cost. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} {{of a water}} distribution network (WDN) {{is defined as the}} probability that WDN is able to provide sufficient flow and pressure at all consumption nodes of the network under predicted and unforeseen conditions during a specified period of time. Uncertainty in projected nodal demands and estimated pipe roughness coefficients of each year of operation is the major cause of fluctuation in pipe flows and nodal pressures of the WDN. Since WDN {{is one of the most}} important and expensive components of water supply systems, safeguarding the {{reliability of}} WDNs under uncertain demand and pipe roughness is the aim of water agencies or authorities dealing with design, maintenance, and the operation of WDNs. There are two main approaches in the current literature for safeguarding the reliability of a WDN: applying reliability theory as a probabilistic approach; and, using resilience index as a deterministic approach. To assess the reliability of a WDN, the nodal demands and pipe roughness coefficients are modeled probabilistically, and the performance of the water distribution network in terms of probabilistic nodal pressures is assessed using various methods, such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). On the other hand, the resilience index is a surrogate deterministic measure for the reliability of the WDN which has been widely used in recent years to improve the reliability of WDN design. In this study, MCS is applied to compute the reliability of the nodes and the network under uncertain demand and roughness, and to determine how reliability is distributed among the various nodes of WDN, as well as assessing the reliability of the network as a series or parallel system. The effect of the resilience index on the <b>nodal</b> and <b>network</b> reliability is also assessed. This research investigates the relationship between the reliability and resilience index at two levels of nodes and networks; thus, it fills the knowledge gap that exists in a process where only the resilience index is used, thereby providing a more comprehensive measure for the WDN operating under uncertain conditions. The results showed that the impact of uncertainty in projected demands and estimated pipe roughness &ndash; which is not considered in the term of the resilience index &ndash; can be assessed on performance of a WDN using the reliability theory. The results of the reliability assessment of different nodes of a WDN showed that the value of reliability at each node depends on the location of the node, and it decreases as the distance of nodes from the supply node increases. Results of sensitivity analysis of reliability to the degree of uncertainty in design parameters also show that an increase in the coefficient of variation (COV) of random nodal demands and random pipe roughness coefficients decreases the <b>nodal</b> and <b>network</b> reliability of a WDN. Furthermore, a mathematical formula was developed between the reliability and resilience index to determine the thresholds of the resilience index that are able to meet a desired level of <b>nodal</b> and <b>network</b> reliability under a designated uncertainty in nodal demands and pipe roughness coefficients...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} method to prefigure responsive models by investigating the form’s spatial movement in the step from one configuration to another. Folded surfaces have been chosen for investigation. Contemporary architecture proposes buildings that are no longer simply juxtaposed volumes marked by light, i. e., surfaces drawn by shadows that change with {{the position of the}} Sun throughout the day. Today, buildings interact with the surrounding environment, changing the morphological characteristics of their exteriors in relation to various environmental parameters. Buildings change in relation to external conditions, but they also communicate via the possibilities expressed by a skin that shimmers in relation to the message to externalize. We are faced with responsive forms that the designer should control through design. The design of forms in movement is seen widely in the study of objects called “folded surfaces”. This area addresses the different means of prefigurement offered by the design used to initially investigate the layout, which is drawn according to canonical rules of symmetry, balance, and the ability to tessellate flat space. The next step is to translate the signs into mountain and valley folds, studying the different spatial conformations assumed by tiles of the folded surface rotating around the pattern lines. Spatial control of the model is ensured by geometrically controlling the basic entities that compose the folded surfaces: the surface/face of the pattern, the zipper lines between the faces, the point/vertex where the zipper lines meet. By applying the basic rules of descriptive geometry, an algorithm that controls the entire form can be constructed. This is the fundamental contribution of nodal programming tools for modelling support. Today almost all design programs include <b>nodal</b> <b>networks,</b> which allow the geometric algorithms used in the research to be specified and some variable dimensions to be extrapolated from the definition. Acting on the variables, it is possible to control the step from the folded surface of one conformation to another.

However, the test-retest (TRT) reliability of graph metrics of functional networks has not been systematically examined. Here, we investigated TRT reliability of topological metrics of functional brain networks derived from resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} data. Specifically, we evaluated both short-term ( 5 months apart) TRT reliability for 12 global and 6 local <b>nodal</b> <b>network</b> metrics. We found that reliability of global network metrics was overall low, threshold-sensitive and dependent on several factors of scanning time interval (TI, long-term>short-term), network membership (NM, networks excluding negative correlations>networks including negative correlations) and network type (NT, binarized networks>weighted networks). The dependence was modulated by another factor of node definition (ND) strategy. The local nodal reliability exhibited large variability across nodal metrics and a spatially heterogeneous distribution. Nodal degree was the most reliable metric and varied the least across the factors above. Hub regions in association and limbic/paralimbic cortices showed moderate TRT reliability. Importantly, nodal reliability was robust to above-mentioned four factors. Simulation analysis revealed that global network metrics were extremely sensitive (but varying degrees) to noise in functional connectivity and weighted networks generated numerically more reliable results in compared with binarized networks. For <b>nodal</b> <b>network</b> metrics, they showed high resistance to noise in functional connectivity and no NT related differences were found in the resistance.
