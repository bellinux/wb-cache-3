Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq, but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.|$|E

25|$|In September 2004, he was {{appointed}} as assistant coach to the England cricket team, and announced his retirement as a player shortly after, feeling he no longer enjoyed batting. In his short spell as an international coach, he caused some controversy. His appointment was criticised by former England captain Mike Atherton, who felt that the job should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to someone {{who had been on}} the rebel tour of South Africa. His attitude came under fire from former coach Keith Fletcher, who accused him of being too fond of drinking and partying, {{to be a role model}} for young international cricketers. He hit back at Fletcher, criticising his management skills. Maynard continued to coach the England side and at one point drafted in professional lyricists to help him compose an England team song.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{unlikely}} that Behn went to Surinam with her husband, although {{she may have}} met and married in Surinam or on the journey back to England. A socially creditable single woman in good standing would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> unaccompanied to Surinam. Therefore, it is most likely that Behn and her family went to the colony {{in the company of}} a lady. As for her purpose in going, Janet Todd presents a strong case for its being spying. At the time of the events of the novel, the deputy governor Byam had taken absolute control of the settlement and was being opposed not only by the formerly republican Colonel George Marten, but also by royalists within the settlement. Byam's abilities were suspect, and it is possible that either Lord Willoughby or Charles II would be interested in an investigation of the administration there.|$|E
25|$|Many Jews {{continued}} to live as lower class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult. They could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills because without the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. But as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry. In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses {{in the city and}} 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of Paris and Nancy increased also. These different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.|$|E

25|$|In September 2006 it was {{announced}} that instead of Eden Park, the Government and Auckland City Council were assessing the possibility of a new stadium on Auckland's waterfront to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup. This assessment was part of the Government's formal due diligence process on the decision to redevelop Eden Park. The Government had said it would assist with the funding if a new stadium was built. The Government announced in a report in November 2006 that it would favour a new stadium on the Auckland waterfront, which would have meant that the Eden Park redevelopment would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> ahead, and that options for its use or redevelopment would have to be developed. After the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council differed in their support for the new stadium, the Government changed to supporting the redevelopment of Eden Park, subject to suitable resolution of the design, funding and governance issues.|$|E
25|$|Keane's {{first two}} games as manager could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> much better; first coming from behind to beat Derby County 2–1, {{followed}} by an easy 3–0 victory over Leeds United. Sunderland began to steadily creep up the league standings under Keane's management, and {{by the turn of}} the year they had escaped the bottom half of the league. Five further players were signed during the January 2007 transfer window, three (Anthony Stokes, Carlos Edwards and Stern John) on permanent contracts and two (Jonny Evans and Danny Simpson) on loan from Manchester United, Keane's old club. Results continued to improve, and Keane was rewarded with the February and March Manager of the Month awards, while his team began to challenge for the automatic promotion places. Meanwhile, Keane tackled his players' non-professional approach with a firm hand. When three players were late for the team coach to a trip to Barnsley, in March 2007, he simply left them behind.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{a natural}} force from which {{none of us is}} immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume {{everyone}} in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home on the day of his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths {{in the context of the}} play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.|$|E

500|$|Delays in the {{shooting}} schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The uncooperative weather then took a different turn, plunging from oppressive heat to down near , causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in October. The crew wore warm coats, gloves, and boots. Swayze and Grey stripped down to light summer clothing, to repeatedly dive into the cold water. Despite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as [...] "horrifically" [...] cold, and she might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into the lake, except that she was [...] "young and hungry".|$|E

500|$|... "Irreplaceable JP" [...] {{was written}} for Chrisette Michele. Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Beyoncé's second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said that they might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> in the {{direction}} they did on the song. The tune did not suit Beyoncé's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, {{although it was not}} based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R western music song instead.|$|E
500|$|English statesmen William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester {{had worked}} to obtain Darnley's licence {{to travel to}} Scotland {{from his home in}} England. Although her advisors had thus brought the couple together, Elizabeth felt {{threatened}} by the marriage, because as descendants of her aunt, both Mary and Darnley were claimants to the English throne and their children, if any, would inherit an even stronger, combined claim. However, Mary's insistence on the marriage seems to have stemmed from passion rather than calculation. The English ambassador Nicholas Throckmorton stated [...] "the saying is that surely she [...] is bewitched", adding that the marriage could only be averted [...] "by violence". The union infuriated Elizabeth, who felt the marriage should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> ahead without her permission, as Darnley was both her cousin and an English subject.|$|E

[...] Going to Oxford and seeing the selflessness and ambition of the students transitioned me to being in the sport as a mechanism to do good." [...] The Oxford swim team encouraged him to join its ranks, and he subsequently earned most valuable player honors and a Blue jacket, the British equivalent of a varsity letter. On his newfound perspective, Tarwater said, [...] "Missing the Olympics in 2008 was the best thing that's ever happened in my whole life... I would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Oxford; I would not have invested in my own personhood... being able to chase an Olympic dream is a gift... I made it a misery.

On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference.

I feel sure she would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E
500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the segment [...] "The Monkey's Paw", Hank Azaria faked some Arabic. Usually, the writers get inspiration for the Halloween specials from old horror stories, but recently, the writers tried to conceive of their own stories instead of creating more parodies. Also, when the Moroccan salesman tries to warn Homer Simpson, saying [...] "You'll be sorry", the animators forgot to move his lips. They only realized their error after the broadcast, so they decided not to change it. While writing the segment, Sam Simon, one of the writers, wanted the fingers to go down in such an order so they would eventually have the middle finger sticking up. Once the animation would have been complete, however, they could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through; Fox would have refused to air the episode. They had considered the alternative of deliberately blurring the middle finger themselves, but decided that Fox would have also refused. For this episode, {{there were a lot of}} loop lines; for instance, the ending to [...] "The Monkey's Paw" [...] was added to the last second. As a result of the loop, they still retained Flanders's old house next to his newly created castle. In order to make the episode fill the time needed, the animators often extended the laughing time for Kang and Kodos.|$|E

David Hinckley, in the New York Daily News, claimed that Awake [...] "requires more work [...] than the average viewer is likely to put in" [...] and {{described}} it as a show which would not fit into prime-time television. [...] "Game Day", in contrast, received mixed reviews from IGN and The A.V. Club; the publications gave it their lowest scores of the season. Zack Handlen, an A.V. Club critic, described the mysteries of [...] "Game Day" [...] "childishly simple". In addition, [...] "Ricky's Tacos" [...] was criticized for being too much like Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Despite this, recurring guest star Dr. Banks (Chris McGarry) was well received by Handlen, who thought that he [...] " [...] becoming [...] favorite secondary character on the show". [...] "Nightswimming" [...] also received mixed reviews from critics. That episode's [...] "red reality" [...] storylines were praised; those for the [...] "green reality" [...] were considered [...] "boring". Handlen thought that if the [...] "red reality" [...] storyline was not featured in [...] "Nightswimming", it would not work as an episode; Sepinwall thought the episode should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into detail about the guest stars.|$|E
