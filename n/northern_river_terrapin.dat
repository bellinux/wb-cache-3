In Malaysia, this species is found in large river with noticeable number in Perak, Terengganu and Bukit Penang, Kedah River. The Batagur aifinis considered threaten and endangered species in 2009 IUCN, REDLIST and CITIES. Wildlife conservation centre at Bota Kanan, Per is the largest conservation centre in Malaysia and was established in 1968. The purpose of the â€¢establishment of this centre is to conserve and maintain the <b>river</b> <b>terrapin</b> population by rearing in â€¢artificial ponds. This study aimed at to identify the factors affecting the hatching success of river terrapin's egg while rearing in artificial pond. There are many factors related to the rate of unsuccessful hatching such as death hatchling in nest, weak hatching due to the immature egg, egg predated by other organism and yolkless eggs which contain blood spot only. The experiments were carried out by analyzing parameter based on nest site selection, food preference during ovulations time, and predation by other organism and environmental factors (soil temperature and water quality) in the pond site. The targeted factors were obtained through the data of field observation and laboratory analyzes. The results of our study indicated that the terrapin's eggs under a sandy soil of 12 cm depth with temperature of 32 Â°C, healthy nutritional dietary intake during ovulation time, and precautionary measures of hatchery site from predation by other organism are the factors for a good hatching success of Batagur affinis's egg. Our study could be helpful for terrapin conservation centre especially in breeding of <b>river</b> <b>terrapin</b> in artificial ponds. ...|$|R

The B affinis belongs to the order testudines/chelonians i. e reptile that has shell. In Malaysia, this species is found in large river with noticeable numbers in Perak, Terengganu and Bukit Pinang, Kedah River. Throughout the region the population of this animal has declined and <b>river</b> <b>terrapin</b> is currently listed as an endangered species by the IUCN. There are mane factors that lead to extinction of this species such as poaching, habitat destruction, pollution, diseases etc. Disease {{is one of the}} important factor that caused the death of <b>river</b> <b>terrapin.</b> Due to the declining of population, DWNP has established 3 Terrapin Conservation Centers in Malaysia such as Perak,Terengganu and Kedah in order conserve this animal.

A study was carried' out on the diseases of fresh 'water <b>river</b> <b>terrapin</b> B affinis in collaboration with the Wildlife Conservation Centre, Perak. For this experiment 4 artificial tanks marked as A, II and C containing 10 baby (8 months old) terrapin in each tank and tank D containing 10 matured terrapin were observed to identify h addition 10 baby terrapin put in a separate tank as a control. The study period was from 28 / 12 / 2012 until 13 / 4 / 2013. Observations were carried out on the eye, shell, and skin of the animal. Weekly check up the animal and the measurement of the body weight, length and width of carapace and plastron were made to determine its growth, The infected terrapins were isolated and given compulsory treatment and observed, The infection rate was tank A 20 %, B 30 % C 20 % and D 30 % as well which was significantly important while the death of infected terrapins also one of the important findings where the death rate in tank A 100 % B 50 %, C 100 % and in tank 0 % was recorded. After the treatment, the cured terrapins were released into original tank. Dead terrapins then sent to Veterinary Research Institute of Perak. In our study it is found that for the conservation of terrapin and maintaining a good population in an artificial pond and disease control significantly important.
