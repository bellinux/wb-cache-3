But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John went to this whole level of artistry. But he {{made me feel like}} I had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer,</b> like I knew shit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} Community {{was based on}} Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his {{relationship}} with his then-girlfriend, he once enrolled in Glendale Community College, north of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together. Harmon got involved in a study group and – somewhat against his own instincts – became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. [...] "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them," [...] he explained, [...] "even though they {{had nothing to do with}} the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> them." [...] With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realised the value of connecting with other people.|$|E

500|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin's (Carlyle) backstory is revealed. During the ogre wars, the {{children}} {{that live in the}} Frontlands are conscripted to military service at age 14. The Duke's men gather young soldiers with the help of [...] "The Dark One" [...] who possesses great magical power. Rumpelstiltskin's son, Baelfire (Dylan Schmid), will turn 14 in three days and he is desperate to keep his child out of battle. As father and son flee from the village, they are confronted by the Duke's men. They mock Rumpelstiltskin for running away when he was supposed to serve, and reveal that his cowardice caused his wife to leave him. Rumpelstiltskin begs for his son's life but he has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> but fealty. The Duke's chief soldier commands Rumpelstiltskin to kiss his boot, but when the desperate man bends down the soldier kicks him to the ground. The old beggar (Brad Dourif) {{by the side of the}} road sees this and offers the pair assistance since they spared him a coin. The beggar tells Rumpelstiltskin a secret, the Duke possesses a dagger that allows him to command The Dark One and all his power. If Rumpelstiltskin steals the dagger, he will control The Dark One himself. If he kills The Dark One with the dagger, he will possess his magic. Rumpelstiltskin sets fire to the Duke's castle (in a parallel with Mr. Gold's actions) and steals the dagger which reads the name of The Dark One, [...] "Zoso".|$|E
500|$|Churches of Christ {{consistently}} {{teach that}} in baptism a believer surrenders {{his life in}} faith and obedience to God, and that God [...] "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes {{the state of the}} person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do." [...] Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it [...] "is a confession that a person has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> God". While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a [...] "sacrament", their view of it can legitimately be described as [...] "sacramental". They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to {{be an integral part of}} the conversion process, rather than as only a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as nothing more than a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as [...] "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation". There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to [...] "reexamine the richness of the Biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity".|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed, {{arguing that}} [...] "All the story's power {{is allowed to}} leak away by the deliberative {{heaviness}} with which Rivette pads through his 150-minute narrative, with its exasperating lack of dramatic emphasis." [...] Philip French noted similarities to Hitchcock's Vertigo and Jean Cocteau's Orphée, but called it [...] "surprisingly flat and unmagical". The New York Times also found it [...] "dry and overdetermined," [...] and Time Out complained that it [...] "never supplies the frissons expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story." [...] Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others, but said that [...] "its glacially slow pace will frustrate {{all but the most}} patient". (Rivette said when promoting the film that [...] "I like The Sixth Sense because the final twist doesn't challenge everything that went before it. You can see it again, which I did, and it's a second film that's just as logical as the first one. But the end of The Others made the rest of it meaningless.") [...] "An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art-house audiences" [...] was Empire wry take. The Digital Fix argued that Rivette's direction resulted in a product that [...] "if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master, is ultimately an empty film that has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> but its own cleverness". Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine found it was [...] "a lesser Rivette offering — a watchable, ultimately unfulfilling ghost story".|$|E

2500|$|The war {{energised}} Churchill, who was 65 {{years old}} when he became Prime Minister. An American journalist wrote in 1941: [...] "The responsibilities which are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human being on earth. One would think such a weight would have a crushing effect upon him. Not at all. The last time I saw him, while the Battle of Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years younger than before the war began... His uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people". Churchill's speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British. His first as prime minister was the famous, [...] "I have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> but blood, toil, tears, and sweat" [...] speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament as [...] "electrifying". The House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s [...] "was now listening, and cheering". Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous ones, given just before the Battle of Britain. One included the words: ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, {{writing for}} the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick Lasalle bluntly noted that the motion picture starts out [...] "bad" [...] and later [...] "gets worse". He summed up his displeasure by stating, [...] ""Sunshine" [...] has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer,</b> and this {{nothing is going to}} be offered relentlessly and earnestly, like a holy missive." [...] In a {{primarily}} negative review, Joanne Kaufman writing for The Wall Street Journal, called the film [...] "a warmed-over stew of sci-fi and gothic horror". Unenthusiastic, she affirmed, [...] "There are the predictable malfunctions that compromise the space craft, the banal speechifying about the fate of mankind, the issue of who will live and who will die. Who cares? The characters are so sketchily drawn that it's hard to keep them straight, let alone get worked up about their survival." [...] Also describing an unfavourable opinion, Marrit Ingman of The Austin Chronicle professed the film exhibited [...] "problems which arise in the film's third act" [...] which causes [...] "a profoundly implausible plot turn that sends the movie skidding into bogeyman horror. It cheapens the sentiment, and the film doesn't recover." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the tour}} ended in April 1973, Yes took {{a short break}} and regrouped in London and {{proceeded}} to rehearse and develop Anderson and Howe's material at Manticore Studios in Fulham, then owned by fellow progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Wakeman thought the musical direction the band had begun to take ventured into [...] "avant-garde jazz rock, and I had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> there". Squire recognised [...] "a lot of substance" [...] to the four tracks, but at times there was not as much which made the album become [...] "too varied and too scattered". Despite their opinions, Anderson wrote in the liner notes that Squire, Wakeman and White made [...] "important contributions of their own" [...] to the music. He believed the entire group were [...] "on the same page" [...] and supported the concept and material at the time, but realised Wakeman's criticisms ended a period of [...] "elusive harmony" [...] that had existed within the band for their successful albums Fragile (1971) and Close to the Edge. Howe recalled that despite the lengthy arrangements, no one [...] "bottled it" [...] and thought a single album would be more appropriate. White contributed some lengthy sections of music that bridged between the main sections of tracks, but did not receive a writing credit which bothered him at first, but later allowed it as the album was mostly Anderson and Howe's idea.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Federal {{government}} had only 42 warships in commission, {{and many of}} the best were laid up as unserviceable or distributed widely around the world, the Confederate States had almost <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> in opposition. With no navy yet established, they turned to the alternative of privateering. The word [...] "privateer" [...] applies to any private citizen in the world who raises a ship and crew to engage in the destruction of enemy shipping for profit. Although specifically allowing attacks upon enemy warships, privateers are typically amateurs employed against commercial shipping because armed navy ships are more likely to fight back effectively. Privateering is authorized by the issuance of [...] "letters of marque and reprisal" [...] by a sponsoring government. It was explicitly allowed by the Confederate Constitution the words of which were copied almost directly from the American Constitution. With a mission to prey upon commercial vessels of the enemy, their pay would consist of the value of seized ships and cargoes, also known as prizes, less legal costs. Two benefits would accrue to the Confederate government; the disruption of commerce might persuade the European nations to pressure the North to end the conflict, and it would also force the North on its own to ease the expected blockade in order to chase down the privateers. When the war began, [...] "legitimate" [...] privateers could legally clear prizes in neutral ports, which were literally worldwide. Therefore, privateers were a credible threat to the national security of the United States, whereas if the Confederate States could tie up the Union Navy in the protection of Northern shipping, any blockade, which was expected but not yet declared, would be at least mitigated and the Southern Confederacy would be seen as a new world power to be respected.|$|E
