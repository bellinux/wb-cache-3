5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of <b>net</b> <b>material</b> <b>product,</b> and in total the bunkers cost {{more than twice as}} much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Justification and {{calculation}} {{of a new}} methodological approach {{to the construction of}} a standard beach seine (502 / 302 х 3. 75) {{with the use of the}} properties of mirror netting ensuring the saving of the <b>netting</b> <b>material,</b> reduction of weight, price and drag resistance. Methodology. The carp age group selectivity of the constructed seine was assessed within fish fauna monitoring based on the catch analysis of monitoring gill nets with mesh sizes of 30 - 130 mm according to generally accepted methods [9, 10]. Calculation of <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> and ropes was carried out according to generally accepted methods [12 - 14]. Seine resistance was calculated according to N. T. Senin formula for different <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> and the angles of the movement of different seine parts in water [2]. The gear reliability and data processing were carried out according to standard methods [11, 14, 15]. Findings. A variant of the construction of the maximum lightweight beach lake seines made of mirror pattern netting taking into account the properties of the mirror pattern <b>netting</b> <b>material,</b> reduction of weight, price and drag resistance has been proposed. The provided re{{calculation of}} the properties of a serial seine made of rhombic mesh for the mirror netting seine taking into account netting properties allowed: 1) reducing the seine drag resistance value by 1, 4 times; 2) reducing the weight of <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> by 16. 3...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this PhD project {{was to develop a}} method for {{non-linear}} strength analysis of net structures applied in the aquaculture and fishing industries, e. g. net cages and trawls. The work focused on the aquaculture net cage, which was applied in experiments and analyses, and included research to establish knowledge within material properties and failure modes of traditional <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> for aquaculture. It was chosen to focus on tensile properties and to study elastic and plastic behaviour, fracture, creep behaviour and cod bite damage. The project consisted of three main activities: tensile testing of <b>netting</b> <b>materials,</b> studies and testing of cod bite damage and resistance, and structural analysis of aquaculture net cages. Net cages are built as a system of ropes and netting. They are designed to transfer and carry all major forces through the ropes. Loads from current, waves, weights and handling induce forces in the net cage, which must be dimensioned to withstand this. Analyzing an aquaculture net cage is both complex and time consuming due to non-linear effects, detailed geometry and dynamic loads. The behaviour of the net cage is dominated by very large deformations and displacements, and materials with non-linear properties. There is a need for verified analysis methods and specific guidance on how to reduce the complexity of a net cage analysis. In order to perform a strength analysis of a net cage, it is crucial to know the material properties of the <b>netting</b> <b>material.</b> Traditionally, the material property of major interest for the aquaculture industry has been the tensile breaking strength of netting (mesh) and ropes, and comparatively little focus has been on their detailed stiffness properties and general behaviour prior to fracture. A new test method was established to determine the uniaxial tensile properties of knotless <b>netting</b> <b>materials.</b> It was applied on a variety of <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> and stress-strain relations were developed. Data on temporary creep properties, recovery of strain post creep and post creep tensile properties of a selection of Raschel knitted <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> was presented. Post creep tensile testing showed that the length and force at break were not significantly affected by the creep load history. Cod farmers have reported that cod interact with the cage netting through biting and thereby create wear and tear. The nature of the cod bite attack on traditional, multifilament <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> was described based on studies of cod interaction with traditional knotless netting and resulting fracture damage on netting fibres. Field experiments were performed, subjecting panels of netting to cod bite in commercial cod cages. In addition, a test method was developed to simulate damage on traditional netting from cod bite, and a prototype bite-jig was designed and assembled. It was concluded that <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> for cod aquaculture must be resistant to cod bite or be repellent or uninteresting for cod. A method for numerical analysis of net cages in constant uniform current was developed and verified for limited solidity, deformations and current velocities. Various new designs for aquaculture net cages were presented and compared to a traditional net cage with regard to stresses in the <b>netting</b> <b>material</b> and deformation of the net cage.

In 1939, agriculture contributed 65 percent of <b>Net</b> <b>material</b> <b>product</b> (NMP), and four {{out of every five}} Bulgarians were employed in agriculture. The importance and organization of Bulgarian agriculture changed drastically after the war, however. By 1958, the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) had collectivized a high percentage of Bulgarian farms; in the next three decades, the state used various forms of organization to improve productivity, but none succeeded. Meanwhile, private plots remained productive and often alleviated agricultural shortages during the Todor Zhivkov era.|$|E

By inhibiting microbial growth, copper alloy aquaculture cages avoid costly net changes that are necessary with other materials. The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive.|$|R

50|$|Until independence, Armenia's {{economy was}} {{based largely on}} industry—chemicals, {{electronic}} products, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber and textiles; it was highly dependent on outside resources.

This increase in the importance of agriculture was attributable to food security needs of the population in the face of uncertainty during the first phases of transition and the collapse of the non-agricultural sectors of the economy in the early 1990s. As the economic situation stabilised and growth resumed, the share of agriculture in GDP dropped to slightly over 20% (2006 data), although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40%.|$|E

The economy of the Soviet Union never reached this stage of development, so planned its economy in financial terms throughout the duration of its existence. Nonetheless, a number of alternative metrics were developed for assessing the performance of non-financial economies in terms of physical output (i.e.: <b>net</b> <b>material</b> <b>product</b> versus gross domestic product).|$|E

In the early postwar decades, Azerbaijan's major cash crops were cotton and tobacco, but in the 1970s grapes became the most productive crop. An anti-alcohol campaign by Moscow in the mid-1980s contributed to a sharp decline in grape production in the late 1980s. In 1991 grapes accounted for over 20 percent of agricultural production, followed closely by cotton.|$|E

50|$|During the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1976-80), by contrast, {{economic}} performance {{was far less}} satisfactory; in the closing years of the period, the slowdown in economic growth became especially noticeable. <b>Net</b> <b>material</b> <b>product</b> grew by only 3.7% yearly on average, instead of the 4.9% called for by the plan. Both agriculture and industry and productivity increase failed to meet planned growth targets Problems in agriculture were in part a result of drought (1976) and severe winter and spring flooding (1979). Other factors, such as shortages of agricultural machinery and spare parts and poor quality of fertilizer, also affected the agricultural sector. Large imports of grain necessarily continued. During the plan period, growth rates in personal consumption declined, reaching a low point of 0.5% in 1979. At the same time, {{in contrast to the}} previous plan period, retail prices rose by about 11% over the 5-year period. During the last few years of the plan, there were widespread consumer complaints about the unavailability of basic commodities such as meat, milk, and vegetables. The economy's performance was lackluster despite the continuing infusion of substantial investment funds. In part, the rise in the investment rate in the 1970s reflected large capital expenditures for increased mining of coal and other fuels and for the development of engineering branches to produce equipment for nuclear power plants. Nevertheless, given the considerable funding poured into the economy, the mediocre condition of the Czechoslovak industrial plant in general {{at the end of the}} 1970s must have been discouraging to economic planners.|$|E

The bunkers were presented by the Party as both a symbol and a practical means of preventing Albania's subjugation by foreign powers, but some viewed them as a concrete expression of Hoxha's policy of isolationism - keeping the outside world at bay. Some Albanians saw them as an oppressive symbol of intimidation and control. Ismail Kadare used the bunkers in his 1996 novel The Pyramid to symbolise the Hoxha regime's brutality and control, while Çashku has characterised the bunkers as [...] "a symbol of totalitarianism" [...] because of the [...] "isolation psychology" [...] that they represented. It has been argued that the bunkerisation programme was a form of [...] "patterned large-scale construction" [...] that [...] "has a disciplinary potential as a means of familiarising a population with a given order of rule." [...] The regime's xenophobia had the effect of creating a siege mentality and a sense of constant emergency.|$|E
