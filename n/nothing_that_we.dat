25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. <b>Nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
500|$|Philippe Dauman, the {{president}} and CEO of Viacom, contradicted the notion, saying {{he did not think}} [...] "the limited amount of Nick library content on Netflix ... has had a significant impact". [...] A Nickelodeon spokesman said SpongeBob is performing consistently well and remains the number one rated animated series in all of children's television. He added, [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have seen that points to SpongeBob as a problem". Dauman blamed the drop on [...] "some ratings systemic issues" [...] at Nielsen, citing extensive set-top-box data that [...] "does in no way reflect" [...] the Nielsen data.|$|E
500|$|During {{its peak}} years in early 2000, SpongeBob SquarePants {{received}} enormous ratings {{and number of}} viewers. By 2012, {{it was reported that}} the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the show might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger, directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.

2500|$|Observers often {{identified}} Bloom with deconstruction in the past, but {{he himself}} never admitted to sharing {{more than a}} few ideas with the deconstructionists. He told Robert Moynihan in 1983, [...] "What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through negative theology... There is no escape, there is simply the given, and there is <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since Israeli {{electoral law}} forbids any {{organization}} calling {{to abolish the}} Jewish character {{of the state to}} take part in the Knesset elections, Abnaa al-Balad boycotts what it calls the [...] "Zionist electoral process". Ibrahim Makkawi, a member of the movement and professor of Educational Psychology, explained this position further in a paper presented at the Third North American Student Conference on the Palestine Solidarity Movement at Rutgers University in October 2003, stating:We refuse to enter the Zionist Knesset, simply because it is (a) in direct contradiction with our national identity as the legitimate owners of the land, (b) it gives legitimacy to the Zionist Entity and support to its myth about democracy, (c) it is a vehicle of cooptation and fragmentation of our leadership and (d) there is virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can achieve through the Knesset with regard to our citizens rights that we cannot do without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Roland to Margaret, [...] "there's <b>nothing</b> more <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can do {{in regard}} to that affair. As soon as there are any new {{developments}} we shall have to consider it again, but until then let us give up our whole souls {{to each other and}} the Artesian ray." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir, <b>nothing,</b> save <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{only did}} what we were driven to do.

25|$|I am now {{quite happy}} to be {{breaking}} up. Things getting much too big and uncontrollable. All along we've wanted to keep our hands on everything, so <b>nothing</b> happened <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't want to.

60|$|God be with you! There {{is indeed}} nothing terrible {{in such a}} death, <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would undo, <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may {{remember}} otherwise than with deeply thankful, though with softened hearts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Sewell, [...] "we {{need not}} waste {{any more of}} your time. We have heard <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not expect, boys, and now we at least know where we stand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well" [...] (resuming {{her former}} tone), [...] "don't squeeze your fingers quite into my hand. I see. There is <b>nothing</b> {{wonderful}} in <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> knew he, at least, was here, whoever might be absent." ...|$|R

60|$|We stored {{ourselves}} {{here with}} fresh provisions and water, but got <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could properly call a store, except {{the flesh of}} about thirty deer, which we dried in the sun, and which proved indifferently good afterwards, but not extraordinary.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do so, Isobel. Of {{course there}} will be danger, but the danger will be <b>nothing</b> to <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have passed through together. The Sepoys will no doubt fight hard, but already they must have begun to doubt; their {{confidence}} in victory must be shaken, and they begin to fear retribution for their crimes. The fighting will, I think, be less severe as the struggle goes on, and at any rate the danger to us, fighting as the assailants, is as <b>nothing</b> to <b>that</b> run when <b>we</b> were little groups surrounded by a country in arms.|$|R
5000|$|Colombia Reports said in October {{that about}} 800 former Colombian Armed Forces members {{had signed up}} for three months of service in return for $1,000 per week and instant Emirati citizenship, if they survive.

6000|$|... "I {{thought my}} {{mistress}} would have married you," [...] said Gabriel, not knowing {{enough of the}} full depths of Boldwood's love to keep silence on the farmer's account, and determined not to evade discipline by doing so on his own.

6000|$|... "Strange," [...] {{said the}} lieutenant, as the {{distance}} between the two began sensibly to decrease, [...] "if these be smugglers, with an empty boat, as you lead me to suppose they are, they would only be too glad to stop and let us see <b>that</b> they had <b>nothing</b> aboard <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could touch.

6000|$|... "That {{depends on}} what you mean by miracle. Science shows us all kinds of wonders which our great grandfathers would have called miracles, but these are <b>nothing</b> but laws <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are {{beginning}} to understand. Give me an instance." ...|$|R

60|$|By now it {{was drawing}} towards sunset, so we made such {{preparations}} as we could for the night.

60|$|Hence also it will follow, {{that the}} first thing {{necessary}} to the possession of a school of architecture is {{the formation of a}} school of able sculptors, and <b>that</b> till <b>we</b> have <b>that,</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> do can be called architecture at all.|$|R
25|$|I {{certainly}} don't {{feel like}} a winner.
