25|$|This is a {{paradigm}} shift because under the original NMCI contract, the government managed the network at a distance and did not own any IT assets used in the program. Rather, they were owned by the prime contractor, and services are provided to the government on a per-seat basis. Pricing is primarily assessed on a per-machine basis that includes security services, help desk support, and periodic technology upgrades; however, fees for additional services (such as classified connectivity, mission-critical service, additional user accounts, software installation, seat moves, remote access from mobile devices, etc.) did apply. Videophones that provide equal access for Deaf employees are not permissible under NMCI regulations. As of October 2007, the per seat price for all of NMCI was reduced by 15 percent.

25|$|GEDCO {{estimates}} {{the damage to}} the electricity network due to the recent hostilities at over $10 million. Even before the conflict, its reserves of spare parts were close to depletion due to the 18-month blockade on Gaza. By 29 January 38 transformers essential for the repair of the electricity system are still waiting permission from the Israelis to be allowed into Gaza. Due to the lack of supplies, GEDCO continues to partially repair the network where possible. The UN warns that those ad-hoc partial repairs will increase technical losses by 25-30 percent, reduce the lifetime of <b>network</b> <b>components,</b> and further expose sections of the network to possible collapse. Since the cease-fire, Israel has allowed approximately 87 tonnes cooking gas per day, which is much less than the estimated need of 300 tonnes per day. No petrol or diesel has been allowed into Gaza since 2 November, except for UNRWA. No petrol, diesel or cooking gas was allowed by Israel into Gaza between 8 and 14 February.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- We {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of solving differential equations by using evolutionary algorithm. The trial solution is constructed by incorporating a Neural <b>Network</b> <b>component</b> and a non-Neural part so as to satisfy the initial/boundary conditions. The effective minimisation of the error function gives the closed analytic form of the solution for the given differential equation with specified boundary/initial conditions. We try to minimise the error function by using the Evolutionary algorithm. Comparison of the solutions thus obtained and the solution obtained analytically is done. The present work reveals the ability of Evolutionary algorithms for solving Differential equations. The presence of the Neural <b>Network</b> <b>component</b> makes the solution thus obtained amenable to design on hardware...|$|R

50|$|Under certain conditions, a <b>network</b> <b>component</b> {{shutting}} down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring {{segments of the}} network leading to a cascading failure of a larger section of the network.

40|$|A <b>network</b> <b>component</b> {{is said to}} be {{a single}} point of failure if its failure causes a {{critical}} end-to-end requirement to be falsified. Single points of failure are avoided by means of redundancy and various fault-tolerance protocols. However, planning for their avoidance from an end-to-end standpoint is a major challenge because constraints of different types need to be reconciled at and across multiple protocol layers. Thus, it is hard for a network administrator to answer the question “Given a network design D and a critical requirement R, is there a <b>network</b> <b>component</b> whose failure will cause R to be false, and if so, how? ” This paper presents an approach to formalizing this question in Alloy and automatically answering it.
