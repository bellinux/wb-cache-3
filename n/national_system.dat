Most importantly perhaps, the local-government law of July 1805 founded the first Dutch system of public administration.|$|E
5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of <b>National</b> <b>System</b> of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} is an elaboration {{of an intellectual}} curiosity that is a parallel but separate development {{of the literature on}} <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of innovation and <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of corporate governance.

The purpose of the paper is to identify the commonalities and the differences of both concepts and to address the conditions by which <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of corporate governance can benefit from the knowledge accumulated by <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of innovation. More precisely, the difficulties faced by <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of innovation are centrally discussed in order to establish the conditions from which the literature on corporate governance can benefit.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel concept of <b>National</b> <b>Systems</b> of Entrepreneurship {{and provide an}} approach to characterizing them. <b>National</b> <b>Systems</b> of Entrepreneurship are fundamentally resource allocation systems that are driven by individual-level opportunity pursuit, {{through the creation of}} new ventures, with this activity and its outcomes regulated by country-specific institutional characteristics. In contrast with the institutional emphasis of the <b>National</b> <b>Systems</b> of Innovation frameworks, where institutions engender and regulate action, <b>National</b> <b>Systems</b> of Entrepreneurship are driven by individuals, with institutions regulating who acts and the outcomes of individual action. Building on these principles, we also {{introduce a}} novel index methodology to characterize <b>National</b> <b>Systems</b> of Entrepreneurship. The distinctive features of the methodology are: (1) systemic approach, which allows interactions between components of <b>National</b> <b>Systems</b> of Entrepreneurship; (2) the Penalty for Bottleneck feature, which identifies bottleneck factors that hold back system performance; (3) contextualization, which recognizes that national entrepreneurship processes are always embedded in a given country's institutional framework...|$|R
5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of <b>National</b> <b>System</b> of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal {{for what would}} become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of innovation {{suggest that the}} innovative performance of an economy depends not only on how the individual institutions (e. g. firms, research institutes, universities) perform in isolation, but also on how they {{interact with each other}} as elements of collective system of knowledge creation and use, and on their interplay with social institutions (such as values, norms and legal frameworks). A significant amount of international literature is currently emerging on the concept of <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of innovation. Much of this literature has focused on developed countries, although some initial work is now being done internationally on the application of <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of innovation to developing countries. Very little of this work on <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of innovation has, however, been sector specific- such as for the construction industry.

5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no <b>national</b> <b>system</b> of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{a freeway}} linking {{southeast}} Kansas City to Independence were {{first published in}} 1955 in a document titled General Location of <b>National</b> <b>System</b> of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas. The first portions of the highway that were signed I-470 were established in 1970, between I-70 and US40 in Independence. The north-south portion of the highway, then designated US71 Bypass had been in existence since 1970 and was renumbered to Route 291 between 1970 and 1971. Between 1979 and 1980, {{the portion of the}} freeway between the Grandview Triangle and the Exit7 cloverleaf had been completed. US50's alignment was changed to follow I-470 west to the Grandview Triangle, and the old routing of US50 was renumbered Route 350. The section of freeway between US50 and Route291 was opened to traffic in 1983, completing the route. Between 1980 and 1983, the portion of the route that is concurrent with Route291 was upgraded to freeway standards and included in the I-470 loop.|$|E

5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was formed}} on May 13, 1913, and several {{sections}} of the system were designated along {{the course of the}} then-future I-75. Division1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit, and Division2 connected Detroit with Mackinaw City. A branch of Division7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie. The system was signposted in 1919, and those highways were marked on maps for the first time. The first M-10 was designated along the highways from Ohio through Detroit to Standish. M-76 connected Standish with Grayling, where the first M-14 ran northward to Cheboygan. From there, M-10 connected to Mackinaw City. In the UP, M-12 connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie along a route to the east of the old Mackinac Trail. When the United States Numbered Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, most of these highways were redesignated as part of the <b>national</b> <b>system.</b> From the state line northward, M-10 was included as a part of US24 and US25. At Detroit, M-10 was used as a part of US10. North of Grayling, M-14 was redesignated as a part of US27. M-12 was used for US2.|$|E

The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E
