5|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{tessellation}} can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It {{is closely related to}} but <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as planar graph duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the convex hull of the input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite line segments. The dual of this diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a planar graph that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the convex hull of the input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than line segments of the Voronoi diagram. This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi diagram, to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays, or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi diagram as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi diagram. Each vertex of the Voronoi diagram is positioned at the circumcenter of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle.|$|E

25|$|Euclid {{set forth}} {{the first great}} {{landmark}} of mathematical thought, an axiomatic treatment of geometry. He selected a small core of undefined terms (called common notions) and postulates (or axioms) which he then used to prove various geometrical statements. Although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the Elements, it may {{be thought of as}} part of the common notions. Euclid never used numbers to measure length, angle, or area. In this way the Euclidean plane is <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the Cartesian plane.|$|E
25|$|Even though Schleswig, Holstein, and Denmark had all had {{the same}} {{hereditary}} ruler for some centuries, the inheritance rules in the three territories were <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The Dukedoms of Schleswig and Holstein were inherited under the Salic law which ignored females: the Kingdom of Denmark had a slightly different inheritance law which included male heirs inheriting through the female line. In the 19th century this slight difference in inheritance law meant that when the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark died the Kingdom of Denmark would {{be separated from the}} duchies of Schleswig and Holstein because one man would inherit the Kingship and another the Dukedoms, as happened on the death of Frederick in 1863.|$|E

25|$|That some {{works are}} {{categorized}} as New Testament Apocrypha {{is indicative of}} the wide range of responses that were engendered in the interpretation of the message of Jesus of Nazareth. During the first several centuries of the transmission of that message, considerable debate turned on safeguarding its authenticity. Three key methods of addressing this survive to the present day: ordination, where groups authorize individuals as reliable teachers of the message; creeds, where groups define the boundaries of interpretation of the message; and canons, which list the primary documents certain groups believe contain the message originally taught by Jesus. There was substantial debate about which books {{should be included in the}} canons. In general, those books that the majority regarded as the earliest books about Jesus were the ones included. Books that were not accepted into the canons are now termed apocryphal. Some of them were vigorously suppressed and survive only as fragments. The earliest lists of canonical works of the New Testament were <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as modern lists; for example, the Book of Revelation was regarded as disputed by some Christians (see Antilegomena), while Shepherd of Hermas was considered genuine by others, and appears (after the Book of Revelation) in the Codex Sinaiticus.|$|E

500|$|Frank Capra's The Bitter Tea of General Yen was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> type of film: Stanwyck plays {{a missionary}} {{who goes to}} civil-war-torn China and meets the titular general (played by Nils Asther) after his car kills the driver of her rickshaw. When she is knocked {{unconscious}} in a riot, he takes {{her out of the}} rabble and onto a train car. She has lurid, horror-themed, symbolic dreams about the General, in which she is both titillated and repulsed by him. The film breaks precedent by developing into an interracial love story, but his army ends in ruins. Yen kills himself at the film's conclusion—by drinking poisoned tea—rather than be captured and killed. Capra adored the script and disregarded the risk of making a film that broke California's (and 29 other states') laws concerning the portrayal of miscegenation. Cinematographer Joseph Walker tested a new technique he created, which he dubbed [...] "Variable Diffusion", in filming the picture. This rendered the entire picture in very soft focus.|$|E
500|$|A fire at {{the rear}} of the hotel in 1888 {{destroyed}} a number of outbuildings, adding to the premises' general dilapidation. [...] American real estate investor and former hotelier John De Baun purchased the property from Leeder's widow for ₤14,000 in 1894, along with several other sites along St Georges Terrace. [...] He engaged architects Ernest Saunders Porter and Edmond Neville Thomas to design the new Palace Hotel for the site with no expense to be spared and many of the construction materials imported. [...] Marble for the fireplaces and mosaic floor tiles for the main entrance and bar-room floors came from Italy. [...] It boasted having [...] "electric light and gas laid on in every room", as well as electric bells and speaking tubes [...] "conveniently placed everywhere" [...] and was reputed to have the first lift in Perth as well as 10 bathrooms serving the 50 bedrooms on the first floor.
