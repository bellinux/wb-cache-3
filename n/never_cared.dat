5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

Veronica {{talks about}} Piz’s {{problem at the}} concert, and three kids say that they saw a white girl who was faking being fat. Dick shows up at Mac’s door and tells her that Beaver <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> about her. Veronica finds Piz’s guitar, and they visit the seller. The seller’s {{description}} matches that of other people. Veronica talks to Piz about a suspect, {{but he says that}} it doesn’t match the woman he saw. Keith and the bail-jumper’s car gets stranded. Veronica signs up for the mentoring program in criminology class, and she notices that one of the kids at the concert has a criminal record.

25|$|Unlike {{his contemporaries}} at Princeton, and {{perhaps due to}} his invalid wife, Warfield <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> much for churchmanship. While he was {{certainly}} supportive of political moves within various churches to strengthen and push conservative theology, he was never interested in the actual process itself, preferring to use his work at Princeton to influence future generations of Presbyterian ministers.|$|E
25|$|The Depression {{following}} {{the stock market}} crash of 1929 made it difficult for Mestler to obtain employment, and this he took as a sign that the time had come for him to give up his architectural career, for which he <b>never</b> <b>cared,</b> and to do what he had always longed to do by exclusively devoting himself to art.|$|E

25|$|As the Empress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} bell tower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> for by Elizabeth. After her death, the imperial court took no interest in the church, and the church was left without any funding. For some time, the church existed off of private and voluntary funds, from people such as Andrey Muravyov.|$|E
25|$|Guernica {{quickly became}} a world-renowned symbol of {{civilian}} suffering resulting from conflict and inspired Pablo Picasso to adapt one of his existing commissions into Guernica. The Spanish Republican Government had commissioned a work from him for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. Though he accepted the invitation to display a piece, he remained uninspired until he heard of the bombing of Guernica. Before the bombing of Guernica took place, Picasso <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> much for anything {{that had to do}} with politics. Once Picasso heard the news he changed his commissioned work for Spain into a reflection on the massacre.|$|E
500|$|The tale {{is about}} {{undesirable}} elements of society. Warne objected to Potter's opening paragraph: [...] "I am quite tired of making goody goody books about nice people. I {{will make a}} book about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod." [...] He altered the text to read, [...] "I have made many books about well-behaved people." [...] Potter responded:If it were not impertinent to lecture one's publisher—you are a great deal too much afraid of the public, for whom I have <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> one tuppenny-button. [...] I have always thought the opening paragraph distinctly good, because it gets away from [...] "once upon a time".|$|E

500|$|Nelson {{signed with}} Liberty Records and was {{recording}} by August 1961 at Quonset Hut Studio. His first two successful singles {{as an artist}} were released by the next year, including [...] "Willingly" [...] (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, Shirley Collie, which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.10) and [...] "Touch Me" [...] (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.7). Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ...And Then I Wrote, released in September 1962. In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in Las Vegas. He then worked {{on the west coast}} offices of Pamper Records, in Pico Rivera, California. Since the job did not allow him the time to play music of his own, he left it and bought a ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, outside of Nashville. Fred Foster of Monument Records signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released: [...] "I <b>Never</b> <b>Cared</b> For You".|$|E
500|$|Broussard {{reported}} in a January 2006 interview that many of Duke Nukem Forevers elements had been finished; [...] "we're just basically pulling it all together {{and trying to make}} it fun". Later that year Broussard demonstrated samples of the game, including an early level, a vehicle sequence, and a few test rooms. Among the features seen was the interactive use of an in-game computer to send actual e-mails. The developer seemed contrite and affected by the long delays; while a journalist demoed the game Broussard referenced note cards and constantly apologized for the state of the game. In filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Take-Two revealed they had renegotiated the Duke Nukem Forever deal, with the former publisher receiving $4.25million instead of $6million on release of the game. Take-Two offered a $500,000 bonus if Duke Nukem Forever was commercially released by December 31, 2006. However, Broussard denied the rumors that DNF would be released, saying that 3D Realms <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> for or asked for the bonus. He stated that he would [...] "never ship a game early." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{previous}} Republican nominee {{candidates and}} fellow Long Island Congressmen Rick Lazio and Pete King had both indicated {{an interest in}} replacing Giuliani, upon Giuliani's withdrawal the state party quickly rallied around Lazio, who had more campaign funds and who {{was viewed as a}} potentially strong candidate. [...] In particular, Governor Pataki — who <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> much for Giuliani to begin with — was strongly in favor of Lazio, and praised him as [...] "fresh, unencumbered challenger" [...] to Clinton. [...] This also caused a shuffle in New York's unique third-party ballot-line alignments: the Liberal Party of New York, which was previously set to run Giuliani (whom they had supported in all three of his mayoral races), now switched to Clinton, while the Conservative Party of New York, which had previously been loath to endorse the socially liberal Giuliani (and was set to nominate former Westchester Congressman Joe DioGuardi) lined up behind Lazio. [...] Lazio accepted the unanimous approval of delegates to the Republican Party state convention at a hotel ballroom in Buffalo on May 30.|$|E

[...] The Pope, highly {{dependent}} on Frankish armies for his independence from Lombard and Byzantine power (the Byzantine Emperor still considered himself {{to be the only}} legitimate [...] "Roman Emperor", and thus, ruler of all of the provinces of the ancient empire, whether recognised or not), declared for [...] "he who had the power".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1967 interview, Eden {{explained}} {{his decision to}} resign: [...] "It was not over protocol, Chamberlain's communicating with Mussolini without telling me. I <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> a goddamn, a tuppence about protocol. The reason for my resignation was that we had an agreement with Mussolini about the Mediterranean and Spain, which he was violating by sending troops to Spain, and Chamberlain wanted to have another agreement. I thought Mussolini should honour the first one before we negotiated for the second. I was trying to fight a delaying action for Britain, and I could not go along with Chamberlain's policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gosdzik and Cangelosi left in 1996 {{and were}} {{replaced}} by Tommy Vetterli (formerly of Coroner) and, surprisingly, Jürgen Reil. The band continued to experiment with their sound, releasing Outcast and Endorama, both of which experimented with goth and ambient influences, incorporated samples and loops and even found Petrozza trying a few different singing styles on for size. It also retained the groove metal influences. The record sales went down, {{by the end of}} the 1990s the band reached both commercial and critical nadir. Though frontman Mille Petrozza <b>never</b> <b>cared</b> about this: [...] "For us, success doesn't define in record sales.
