25|$|As {{neurotoxins}} are compounds which {{adversely affect}} the nervous system, {{a number of}} mechanisms through which they function are through the inhibition of neuron cellular processes. These inhibited processes can range from membrane depolarization mechanisms to inter-neuron communication. By inhibiting the ability for neurons to perform their expected intracellular functions, or pass a signal to a <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell,</b> neurotoxins can induce systemic nervous system arrest {{as in the case}} of botulinum toxin, or even nervous tissue death. The time required for the onset of symptoms upon neurotoxin exposure can vary between different toxins, being on the order of hours for botulinum toxin and years for lead.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} possible cellular automata have a one-dimensional {{array of}} cells, {{each of which}} can hold a binary value (either 0 or 1), with each cell having a neighborhood consisting only of it and its two nearest cells on either side; these are called the elementary cellular automata. [...] If the update rule for such an automaton causes each cell to always remain in the same state, then the automaton is reversible: the previous state of all cells can be recovered from their current states, because for each cell the previous and current states are the same. Similarly, if the update rule causes every cell to change its state from 0 to 1 and vice versa, or if it causes a cell to copy the state from a fixed <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell,</b> or if it causes it to copy a state and then reverse its value, it is necessarily reversible. [...] call these types of reversible cellular automata, {{in which the state}} of each cell depends only on the previous state of one <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell,</b> [...] "trivial". Despite its simplicity, the update rule that causes each cell to copy the state of a <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell</b> is important in the theory of symbolic dynamics, where it is known as the shift map.|$|E
2500|$|The VP24 and VP35 [...] {{structural}} proteins of EBOV play a {{key role}} in this interference. When a cell is infected with EBOV, receptors located in the cell's cytosol (such as RIG-I and MDA5) or outside of the cytosol (such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), recognize infectious molecules associated with the virus. On TLR activation, proteins including interferon regulatory factor 3 and interferon regulatory factor 7 trigger a signaling cascade that leads to the expression of type 1 interferons. The type 1 interferons are then released and bind to the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptors expressed on the surface of a <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell.</b> Once interferon has bound to its receptors on the <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell,</b> the signaling proteins STAT1 and STAT2 are activated and move to the cell's nucleus. This triggers the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which code for proteins with antiviral properties. EBOV's V24 protein blocks the production of these antiviral proteins by preventing the STAT1 signaling protein in the <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell</b> from entering the nucleus. The VP35 protein directly inhibits the production of interferon-beta. By inhibiting these immune responses, EBOV may quickly spread throughout the body.|$|E
40|$|Resealing of a {{disrupted}} {{plasma membrane}} at the micron-diameter range requires Ca 2 +-regulated exocytosis. Repeated membrane disruptions reseal {{more quickly than}} the initial wound, and this potentiation of membrane resealing persists for at least 24 hours after the initial wound. Long-term potentiation of membrane resealing requires CREB-dependent gene expression, which is activated by the PKC- and p 38 MAPK-dependent pathway in a wounded cell. The present study demonstrates that membrane resealing is potentiated in both wounded and <b>neighboring</b> <b>cells</b> in MDCK cells. Wounding of cells expressing CREB 133, a mutant variant of CREB, does not show the potentiated response of cell membrane resealing in either wounded or <b>neighboring</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, wounding of cells induces CREB phosphorylation, not only in wounded cells, but also in <b>neighboring</b> <b>cells.</b> Inhibition of the nitric oxide/PKG signaling pathway suppresses CREB phosphorylation in <b>neighboring</b> <b>cells,</b> but not in wounded cells. The potentiation of membrane resealing in <b>neighboring</b> <b>cells</b> is suppressed if the nitric oxide/PKG pathway is inhibited during the initial wound. Together, {{these results suggest that}} the nitric oxide/PKG pathway stimulates CREB phosphorylation in <b>neighboring</b> <b>cells</b> so that subsequent cell membrane disruptions of the <b>neighboring</b> <b>cells</b> reseal more quickly...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{scientists}} to theorize the existence of spontaneous cascades of electrical activity during retinal development was, computational neurobiologist David J. Willshaw. He proposed that adjacent cells generate electrical activity in a wave-like formation through layers of interconnected pre-synaptic and postsynaptic cells. Activity propagating through a close span of pre- and postsynaptic cells is thought to result in strong electrical activity in comparison to pre- and postsynaptic cells that are farther apart, which results in weaker activity. Willshaw thought this difference in firing strength and location of cells was responsible for determining the activities boundaries. The lateral movement of firing from <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell</b> to <b>neighboring</b> <b>cell,</b> starting in one random area of cells and moving throughout both the pre- and postsynaptic layers, {{is thought to be}} responsible for the formation of the retinotopic map. To simulate the cascade of electrical activity, Willshaw wrote a computer program to demonstrate the movement of electrical activity between pre- and postsynaptic cell layers. What Willshaw called spontaneous patterned electrical activity is today referred to as retinal waves.|$|E
