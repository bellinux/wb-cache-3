5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> {{and the strong}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>force).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> (or nucleon-nucleon {{interaction}} or residual strong force) is a {{force that}} acts between the protons and neutrons of atoms. Neutrons and protons, both nucleons, {{are affected by the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> almost identically. Since protons have charge +1 e, they experience an electric force that tends to push them apart, but at short range the attractive <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic <b>force.</b> The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> binds nucleons into atomic nuclei.|$|R
25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for {{the strong}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{have also been}} developed. The quantum field theory of the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.|$|R
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Forces</b> Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50percent. A second summit, was held in October 1986, Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted eliminated. Reagan refused. The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Forces</b> Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500kilometers (300 to 3,400miles) and their infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|Special scale {{relativity}} {{predicts the}} value of the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> with great precision, as later experimental measurements confirmed. The first prediction of the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> at the Z energy level was made in 1992: ...|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the task}} of {{describing}} the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> phenomenologically was formidable. The first semi-empirical quantitative models came in the mid-1950s, such as the Woods-Saxon potential (1954). There was substantial progress in experiment and theory related to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> in the 1960s and 1970s. One influential model was the Reid potential (1968). In recent years, experimenters have concentrated on the subtleties of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> such as its charge dependence, the precise value of the πNN coupling constant, improved phase shift analysis, high-precision NN data, high-precision NN potentials, NN scattering at intermediate and high energies, and attempts to derive the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> from QCD.|$|R
5000|$|Strong nuclear force: Unlike {{gravity and}} electromagnetism, the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{is a short}} {{distance}} force that takes place between fundamental particles within a nucleus. It is charge independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. The strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is the strongest force in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances {{of the order of}} 10−15 m). The strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> mediates both <b>nuclear</b> fission and fusion reactions.|$|R
5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle {{that has never been}} shown to exist, and in part because it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again.|$|E
5|$|Tibbets's {{grandson}} Paul W. Tibbets IV {{graduated from}} the United States Air Force Academy in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the 393d Bomb Squadron, flying the B-2 Spirit at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The squadron {{was one of the}} two operational squadrons that had formed part of the 509th Composite Group when Tibbets commanded it. Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America's strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the 509th Bomb Wing.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher became closely {{aligned with}} the Cold War {{policies}} of US President Ronald Reagan, based on their shared distrust of Communism. A disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult {{with her on the}} invasion of Grenada. During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, permitting the US to station more than 160cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting on 14 November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> at an eventual cost of more than £12billion (at 1996–97 prices). Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of 1985–86, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned in protest.|$|E
50|$|Some {{scientists}} {{have tried to}} make a theory that combines the electromagnetic <b>force,</b> the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> and the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b> This theory is called a grand unified theory (or a GUT). This theory tries to explain these forces in one big unified way or theory.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason the}} trend reverses after iron {{is the growing}} {{positive}} charge of the nuclei. The electric force may be weaker than the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> but its range is greater: in an iron nucleus, each proton repels the other 25 protons, while the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> only binds close neighbors.|$|R
50|$|While anti-de Sitter space {{does not}} {{correspond}} to gravity in general relativity with the observed cosmological constant, an anti-de Sitter space is believed to correspond to other forces in quantum mechanics (like electromagnetism, the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force).</b> This is called the AdS/CFT correspondence.|$|R
5|$|When the Cold War {{ended in}} 1991, {{there were more}} than 500 US nuclear weapons in the UK. Of these, about 400 were bombs, 48 were Ground Launched Cruise Missiles, and {{approximately}} 100 were B57 nuclear depth bombs. The BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155mm nuclear artillery shells. The cruise missiles were withdrawn in 1991 {{under the terms of the}} 1987 Intermediate-Range <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Forces</b> Treaty. The United States then decided to withdraw its short-range nuclear weapons. The last US warheads, including the B57s and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992. The only American nuclear weapons then remaining in the UK were 110 or so B61 nuclear bombs stored at RAF Lakenheath for USAF F-15E Strike Eagles, which were withdrawn by 2008. The British WE.177 nuclear bombs used by the RAF and Royal Navy were withdrawn from service in August 1998, at which point the only remaining British nuclear weapons were British warheads on the Trident missiles of the s.|$|E

25|$|When {{constructing}} a physical theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> one could simply {{assume that it}} does not depend on isospin, although the total isospin should be conserved.|$|E
50|$|An {{example that}} {{illustrates}} nuclear binding energy is {{the nucleus of}} 12C (carbon-12), which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The protons are all positively charged and repel each other, but the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> overcomes the repulsion and causes them to stick together. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is a close-range force (it is strongly attractive {{at a distance of}} 1.0 fm and becomes extremely small beyond a distance of 2.5fm), and virtually no effect of this force is observed outside the nucleus. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> also pulls neutrons together, or neutrons and protons.|$|R
50|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{holding an}} atomic nucleus {{together}} is very strong, in general {{much stronger than}} the repulsive electromagnetic forces between the protons. However, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is also short range, dropping quickly in strength beyond about 1 femtometre, while the electromagnetic force has unlimited range. The strength of the attractive <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> keeping a nucleus together is thus proportional {{to the number of}} nucleons, but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so large that the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> holding it together can just barely counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains. Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by reducing size.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is powerfully [...] between nucleons at {{distances}} of about 1 femtometre (fm, or 1.0 × 10−15 metres), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5 fm. At distances less than 0.7 fm, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> becomes [...] This repulsive component {{is responsible for}} the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows. By comparison, the size of an atom, measured in angstroms (Å, or 1.0 × 10−10 m), is five orders of magnitude larger. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is not simple, however, since it depends on the nucleon spins, has a tensor component, and may depend on the relative momentum of the nucleons. [...] The <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{is not one of the}} fundamental forces of nature.|$|R
25|$|Gluons {{also share}} this {{property}} of being confined within hadrons. One consequence is that gluons {{are not directly}} involved in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> between hadrons. The force mediators for these are other hadrons called mesons.|$|E
25|$|Alexandru Proca (October 16, 1897, Bucharest – December 13, 1955, Paris) was a Romanian {{physicist}} {{who studied}} {{and worked in}} France. He developed the vector meson theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> and the relativistic quantum field equations that bear his name (Proca's equations) for the massive, vector spin-1 mesons. He became a French citizen in 1931.|$|E
25|$|In July 2014, the U.S. {{government}} formally accused Russia {{of having}} violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Forces</b> (INF) Treaty by testing a prohibited medium-range ground-launched cruise missile (presumably R-500, {{a modification of}} Iskander) and threatened to retaliate accordingly. Concern in the U.S. was also caused by the test-firing in 2014 of the Russian RS-26 Rubezh Intercontinental Ballistic Missile capable of evading the existing anti-ballistic missile defenses.|$|E
25|$|It {{is already}} known that {{electromagnetism}} and the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> are different manifestations {{of a single}} force called the electroweak force. The LHC may clarify whether the electroweak force and the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> are similarly just different manifestations of one universal unified force, as predicted by various Grand Unification Theories.|$|R
50|$|Einstein became {{increasingly}} isolated {{in his research}} on a generalized theory of gravitation, and most physicists consider his attempts ultimately unsuccessful. In particular, his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored developments in quantum physics (and vice versa), most notably {{the discovery of the}} strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills {{proposed}} to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, general relativity states that gravitational fields have energy, and special relativity concludes that energy {{is equivalent to}} mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> also have this self-interacting property.|$|E
25|$|Reagan met {{four times}} with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ascended {{to power in}} 1985, and their summit {{conferences}} led to {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Forces</b> Treaty. Gorbachev tried to save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America, then by shedding the East European empire in 1989. The Soviet Union collapsed on Christmas Day 1991, ending the U.S–Soviet Cold War.|$|E
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of Albert Einstein's theory, it comes as no {{surprise}} that all attempts to treat gravity simply like one more quantum force (on par with electromagnetism and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces)</b> have failed. According to Einstein, gravity is not a force – it is a property of space-time itself. Loop quantum gravity is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity based directly on Einstein's geometrical formulation.|$|E
