5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{argued that}} the {{sections}} of the Act dealing with disputation by petition encompassed any question {{about the validity of}} an election, including the eligibility of a candidate, and that the sections should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|E

5|$|Until this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} a {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint {{because they are not}} highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morr√© and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through lipid flow from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{pathways}} {{that animals}} may have followed are <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive.</b> Pigs, for example, {{may have been}} domesticated as their populations became accustomed to the human niche, which would suggest a commensal pathway, or {{they may have been}} hunted and followed a prey pathway, or both.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the origin}} and ethnogenesis of Eurasian Avars and their {{language}} still remains completely unresolved, and probably besides Slavs also included components and influence from other ethnic groups like Eurasian Steppe-Iranians, being a heterogeneous tribal community by which both Avar and Iranian theory are <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive.</b>|$|E

25|$|Biological {{psychiatry}} and other approaches to mental illness are <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> but may simply attempt {{to deal with}} the phenomena at different levels of explanation.

25|$|Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. The {{purpose of}} preparative {{chromatography}} is {{to separate the}} components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form of purification.
