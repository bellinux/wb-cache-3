5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the <b>nucleus</b> <b>ambiguus,</b> whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E

Microinjection of latex microspheres containing fluorescein or rhodamine and Fluoro-gold in the ventral VPM. PB, RVL, Amb, LRt and NTS revealed sets of labeled paratrigeminal nucleus neurons respectively organised in a rostral-caudal sequence. the largest extent of the paratrigeminal nucleus (medial portion) contained neurons projecting to the RVL/Amb. structures associated with cardiovascular regulation. the data show a segmented topographical organization of the nucleus. with different sets of neurons within delimited segments, projecting to neuronal structures associated with different functions. This points to a complex and extensive role for the paratrigeminal nucleus in the integration of somatosensory reflexes related to cardiovascular. respiratory and pain mechanisms. the nucleus may act as a medullary relay interposed between sensory afferents and different structures related to homoeostatic functions.

40|$|International audienceAminopeptidase A (APA) {{generated}} brain angiotensin III, one of {{the main}} effector peptides of the brain renin angiotensin system, exerting a tonic stimulatory effect on the control of blood pressure in hypertensive rats. The distribution of APA in human brain has not been yet studied. We first biochemically characterized human brain APA (apparent molecular mass of 165 and 130 kDa) and we showed that the human enzyme exhibited similar enzymatic characteristics to recombinant mouse APA. Both enzymes had similar sensitivity to Ca(2 +). Kinetic studies showed that the K(m) (190 mumol/L) of the human enzyme for the synthetic substrate-l-glutamyl-beta-naphthylamide was close from that of the mouse enzyme (256 mumol/L). Moreover, various classes of inhibitors including the specific and selective APA inhibitor, (S) - 3 -amino- 4 -mercapto-butyl sulfonic acid, had similar inhibitory potencies toward both enzymes. Using (S) - 3 -amino- 4 -mercapto-butyl sulfonic acid, we then specifically measured the activity of APA in 40 microdissected areas of the adult human brain. Significant heterogeneity was found in the activity of APA in the various analyzed regions. The highest activity was measured in the choroids plexus and the pineal gland. High activity was also detected in the dorsomedial medulla oblongata, in the septum, the prefrontal cortex, the olfactory bulb, the nucleus accumbens, and the hypothalamus, especially in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Immunostaining of human brain sections {{at the level of the}} medulla oblongata strengthened these data, showing for the first time a high density of immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies and fibers in the motor hypoglossal nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the Roller <b>nucleus,</b> the <b>ambiguus</b> <b>nucleus,</b> the inferior olivary complex, and in the external cuneate nucleus. APA immunoreactivity was also visualized in vessels and capillaries in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the inferior olivary complex. The presence of APA in several human brain nuclei sensitive to angiotensins and involved in blood pressure regulation suggests that APA in humans is an integral component of the brain renin angiotensin system and strengthens the idea that APA inhibitors could be clinically tested as an additional therapy for the treatment of certain forms of hypertension...|$|R

The appearance of considerable retrograde labeling in mesencephalic periventricular grey and rostral mesencephalic reticular formation indicated a possible role for these structures as intermediates in an indirect hypothalamo-medullary control circuitry. This led us to extend the peroxidase injections to these mesencephalic areas after which the hypothalamus was investigated for retrograde labeling. All data combined indicated the existence of three descending pathways, direct and indirect, between hypothalamus and the parasympathetic motor nuclei of the lower medulla. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{position}} {{and number of}} preganglionic somata innervating the insulin-secreting β-cells of the endocrine pancreas were investigated in Wistar rats. This question was approached by comparing the innervation of the pancreas of normal rats with the innervation of the pancreas in alloxan-induced diabetic animals. The presumption was made that alloxan treatment destroys the β-cells of the islet of Langerhans and results in a selective degeneration of the β-cells innervation. Cell bodies of preganglionic fibers innervating the pancreas were identified by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase following pancreas injections. It was found that 25 % of the cells innervating the pancreas in the left dorsal vagal motor nucleus, 50 % of the cells in the <b>ambiguus</b> <b>nucleus</b> and 50 % of the cells innervating the pancreas, that originate in segments C 3 -C 4 of the spinal cord, fail to become labeled after alloxan treatment.

A second cell population in the ventral horn and intermediolateral column of the segments T 3 -L 2 of the cord also was labeled in normal rats and was not affected by the alloxan treatment. These thoracic cell groups are thus considered as sympathetic preganglionic somata that maintain direct connections to the pancreas. Additional preliminary information is presented dealing with the general aspects of sympathetic and parasympathetic organization of the pancreas innervation. ...|$|R

In the present paper, the effects of levocarnitine acetyl on axotomy-induced cell death in the brain stem motor nuclei 90 days after section of the vagus nerve were studied. The right vagus nerve was cut at the neck. To prevent regeneration, a 5 mm-long segment of the vagus nerve was excised and the distal stump was displaced caudally. After surgery, a group of rats (n = 6) was treated with levocarnitine acetyl dissolved in the drinking water (75 mg/kg/day) (Group I). A second group of operated rats (n = 4) received drinking water alone. (Group II).

Here, we propose guidelines for the pathoanatomical investigation of these nuclei based on current knowledge with respect to ingestion and the nuclei responsible for this process. The application of these guidelines is described by drawing upon the example of the lower brain stem of a male patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, who displayed malfunctions during the preparatory phase of ingestion, as well as lingual and pharyngeal phases of swallowing. By way of the representative application of the recommended investigation procedure to 100 mum serial sections through the patient's brain stem stained for lipofuscin pigment and Nissl material, we observed neuronal loss together with astrogliosis in nearly all of the ingestion-related lower brain stem nuclei (motor, principal and spinal trigeminal nuclei; facial nucleus; parvocellular reticular nucleus; <b>ambiguus</b> <b>nucleus,</b> motor nucleus of the dorsal glossopharyngeal and vagal area; gelatinous, medial, parvocellular and pigmented solitary nuclei; hypoglossal nucleus). In view of their known functional role in the three-phase process of ingestion, damage to these nuclei not only offers an explanation of the patient's malfunctions related to the preparatory phase of ingestion and lingual and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, but also suggests that the patient may have suffered from additional esophageal phase swallowing malfunctions not mentioned in his medical records...|$|R

The distribution of RLN 3 /RXFP 3 networks has been determined in rat and mouse brain, but not in higher species. In this study we describe the distribution of RLN 3 neurons in the brain of macaque (Macaca fascicularis) using in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. RLN 3 mRNA {{and high levels of}} RLN 3 -like immunoreactivity (-LI) were observed in neurons within a ventromedial region of the central gray of the pons and medulla that appears to represent the primate analog of the nucleus incertus (NI) described in lower species.

Experiments were performed on urethane anesthetized adult rabbits. Phrenic nerve discharge was recorded as the central respiratory motor output. Hypoxic respiratory response was produced by ventilating the rabbit with 10 % O 2 -balance 90 % N 2 for 5 minutes. The responses of phrenic nerve discharge to hypoxia were observed before and after microinjecting PTK inhibitor genistein, AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX, or inactive PTK inhibitor analogue daidzein at the region of <b>ambiguus</b> <b>nucleus</b> (NA) at levels 0 - 2 mm rostral to obex where the inspiratory subgroup of VRC were recorded.

Microinjection of daidzein had no effect on hypoxic respiratory response. 2. Fluorescent immunostaining showed that hypoxia significantly increased the number of phosphotyrosine immunopositive neurons in areas surrounding NA and most of these neurons were also immunopositive to glutamate AMPA receptor subunit GluR 1.

Cross-correlational analysis showed that 71 % of Pa 5 and 93 % of NTS baroreceptor-activated neurons possessed phasic discharge patterns locked to the cardiac cycle. These findings suggest that the Pa 5, like the NTS, acts as a terminal for primary afferents in the medullary-baroreflex or cardiorespiratory-reflex pathways.
