25|$|The Caparo, Radical, and Westfield are road-legal in the UK but {{are unable}} to clear a speed bump. According to Caparo, the car driven by Top Gear was a {{prototype}} that didn't feature the adjustable ride height found on the production model. Because The Stig set {{his time in the}} <b>non-adjustable</b> prototype and the production version has not been driven around the track, the Caparo's time remains ineligible for the Power Lap board.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the standard or [...] "plain finish" [...] model, a deluxe or [...] "fancy finish" [...] model was offered with pistol grip stock and checkering on the forearm and wrist of the stock. The plain finish rifles were offered in 1907 at a list price of $28. That equates to approximately $730 2016 dollars. In 1935, Winchester offered a special [...] "Police Rifle" [...] variant, featuring a <b>non-adjustable</b> rear sight, sling swivels, larger magazine release, and a special barrel measuring 5/8" [...] at the muzzle, and rear sight dovetail moved [...] 2 3/8" [...] inches rearward. A barrel sleeve with Krag bayonet mount and front sight was also an option with the [...] "Police Rifle".|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally <b>non-adjustable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The ACR Neon, {{available}} with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin <b>non-adjustable</b> struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter [...]81 fifth gear and {{final drive ratio}} of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to [...] on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights {{and a lack of}} side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name [...] "ACR" [...] was initially the internal ordering code for the [...] "Competition Package", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The backronym [...] "American Club Racer" [...] was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.|$|E

50|$|To {{work with}} both true and {{magnetic}} bearings, the user of a <b>non-adjustable</b> compass {{needs to make}} simple calculations that {{take into account the}} local magnetic declination. The example on the left shows how you would convert a magnetic bearing (one taken in the field using a <b>non-adjustable</b> compass) to a true bearing (one that you could plot on a map) by adding the magnetic declination. The declination in the example is 14°E (+14°). If, instead, the declination was 14°W (-14°), you would still “add” it to the magnetic bearing to obtain the true bearing: 40°+ (-14°) = 26°.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1991, a five speed 750 SuperSport was {{released}} {{with a single}} disc, and <b>non-adjustable</b> 41 mm Showa forks. A 400 SuperSport Junior was also released using the same 750SS running gear.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 the TT600RE {{model was}} {{launched}} with <b>non-adjustable</b> Yamaha suspension with shorter travel, and an electric starter {{instead of the}} TT600R kick-start only. The rims were changed from Tagasako to San Remo.|$|E

5000|$|The lesser 6-string models, {{such as the}} DM Mahogany series, had open-backed, 3-on-a-plate <b>non-adjustable</b> [...] "economy" [...] tuners in the {{earliest}} years. Later ones, were individual machines, but looked exactly the same from the front.|$|E
5000|$|Many 6-string [...] "upscale" [...] {{models from}} 1978-1983 {{instruments}} had adjustable sealed tuners, but the 12-string models continued with the covered (<b>non-adjustable)</b> [...] "economy" [...] tuners (14:1 ratio.) Others continued on using the cheaper tuners.|$|E
5000|$|TT-01 - The first Tamiya TT-01 was {{released}} as a Ferrari Enzo in 2003. The original version features a 27T 540 [...] "silver-can" [...] motor, open planetary differentials front and rear, and <b>non-adjustable</b> double wishbone suspension with dry friction shock absorbers.|$|E
5000|$|The Franchi SPAS-12 came {{equipped}} with a <b>non-adjustable</b> circular aperture rear sight and a large, <b>non-adjustable</b> blade foresight integrated into the barrel. The LAW-12 was a semi-automatic only and the SAS-12 was a pump action only. These three [...] "sister" [...] shotguns accepted all SPAS-12 components, notably trigger groups, barrel threaded attachments and stocks. The various magazine extension tubes of the LAW-12 and SAS-12 were never designed to be interchangeable with the SPAS-12 as this would cause issues with the gas selector switch moving from Auto to Pump action on the SPAS-12 model. The extensions {{have been known to}} spin off the front of the SPAS-12 during cycling if the extension was not tapered for the SPAS-12 retaining pin.|$|E
50|$|Adjustable Techmatic was {{a version}} of the Techmatic dating from 1970. The {{adjustable}} version featured user-selection of shave closeness on the cartridge.

50|$|In 1986, Lubomyr Kuzmak, a Ukrainian {{surgeon who}} had {{emigrated to the}} United States in 1965, {{reported}} on the clinical use of the “adjustable silicone gastric band” (ASGB) via open surgery. Kuzmak, who from the early 1980s had been searching for a simple and safe restrictive procedure for severe obesity, modified his original silicone <b>non-adjustable</b> band he had been using since 1983, by adding an adjustable portion. His clinical results showed an improved weight loss and reduced complication rates compared with the <b>non-adjustable</b> band he had started using in 1983. Kuzmak’s major contributions were the application of Mason’s teachings about VBG {{to the development of}} the gastric band; the volume of the pouch; the need to overcome staple line disruption; the ratification of the use of silicone and the essential element of adjustability.|$|E
50|$|For {{use as an}} ad-hoc {{automatic}} rifle, the M16 and M16A1 {{could be}} equipped with the XM3 bipod, later standardized as the Bipod, M3 (1966) and Rifle Bipod M3 (1983). Weighing only 0.6 lbs, the simple and <b>non-adjustable</b> bipod clamped unto {{the barrel of the}} rifle to allow for supported fire.|$|E
50|$|Pirelli Diablo Rosso tyres are {{fitted in}} the same sizes used on the Hypermotard 1100, but the 796 uses less substantial, <b>non-adjustable</b> 43 mm Marzocchi forks and has Sachs rear suspension.

50|$|Through {{at least}} the late 1930s, D’Angelico’s guitar necks had <b>non-adjustable</b> steel reinforcement. Later models had {{functional}} truss rods. By the late 40s, D'Angelico was building only the Excel and the New Yorker. All New Yorker models featured pearl inlays in the headstock and fingerboards, as well as quadruple bindings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-adjustable</b> 41 mm {{inverted}} forks {{are combined}} with a twin-spar steel frame to provide improved handling. Stock suspension setting is firm, providing stability through corners. Although commonly found only in larger sized sport bikes, the Hyosung GT250R comes standard with a 300 mm front disc setup using twin-piston calipers. Rear brakes is a single 230 mm disc.|$|E
5000|$|Another common {{feature of}} Alien Gear's {{holsters}} {{is the use}} of hex screws and crushable rubber washers to attach the retention shell to the holster. Many competing companies use rivets, which are <b>non-adjustable.</b> Belt clips on the inside-the-waistband holster were also made adjustable so the holster would ride at the height and tilt angle that customers preferred.|$|E
