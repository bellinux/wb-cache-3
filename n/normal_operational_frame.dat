40|$|We {{begin with}} {{a brief review of}} the {{abstract}} dynamical system that models systems of biological neurons, introduced in the original article. We then analyze the dynamics of the system. Formal analysis of local properties of flows reveals contraction, expansion, and folding in different sections of the phase-space. The criterion for the system, set up to model a typical neocortical column, to be sensitive to initial conditions is identified. Based on physiological parameters, we then deduce that periodic orbits in the region of the phase-space corresponding to <b>normal</b> <b>operational</b> conditions in the neocortex are almost surely (with probability 1) unstable, those in the region corresponding to seizure-like conditions are almost surely stable, and trajectories in the region corresponding to <b>normal</b> <b>operational</b> conditions are almost surely sensitive to initial conditions. Next, we present a procedure that isolates all basic sets, complex sets, and attractors incrementally. Based on the two se [...] ...|$|R

40|$|DC grids are {{susceptible}} to DC side faults, which lead to a rapid rise of the DC side currents. DC side faults should be detected {{in a very short}} time before fault currents cause damage to the system or equipment, e. g., exceed the maximum interruptible limits of DC circuit breaker. This paper presents a primary and backup protective data-based algorithm. The proposed algorithm depends on the local voltage and current measurements to detect and identify various kinds of faults in the HVDC grid, both in the forward and backward direction. Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to derive the thresholds and the <b>operational</b> time <b>frames</b> of the primary and backup protection zones of the algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influence of the line inductor value on the decision thresholds and on the <b>operational</b> time <b>frame</b> of the algorithm.
