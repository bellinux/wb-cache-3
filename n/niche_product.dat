25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of mead consumption, the beverage is a <b>niche</b> <b>product</b> in Poland. In 2013, about 600,000 litres of mead {{were sold in}} Poland, compared with 142.5 million litres of wine sold during the same period. Mead amounted to 0.5 percent of total alcohol consumption in Poland in 2013. Only nine percent of adult Poles polled that year declared that they had drunk mead {{at least once in}} the last three months; 27 percent said they had enjoyed mead in the last 12 months. Those who drank mead, did so mostly at family or social gatherings. A majority of those who did not, said there had been no occasion for it.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties in {{acquiring}} valley oak wood {{as well as}} issues stemming from its drying such as cracking and warping have shifted its consumption from a general purpose lumber to a primarily <b>niche</b> <b>product.</b> Valley oak wood has a small, but significant market for use in cabinetry though, and is also suitable for hardwood flooring. Tyloses present in the pores of valley oak wood increases its impermeability to fluids allowing it {{to be used in}} the production of water-tight vessels. Such vessels include wine barrels where valley oak wood sees limited role in the composition of and where it has similar properties to other white oaks such as a reduced tannin load compared to the red oaks and an open grain that allows for an increased transfer of oxygen.|$|E

2500|$|Citroën had {{attempted}} to replace the ultra-utilitarian 2CV several times (with the Dyane, Visa, and the AX).

2500|$|For 1969, Pontiac {{moved the}} Grand Prix from the {{full-sized}} lineup into a G-body model {{of its own}} based on the A-body intermediate four-door modified from 116 inches to 118 inches wheelbase chassis, but with distinctive styling and long hood/short deck proportions to create yet another <b>niche</b> <b>product</b> - the intermediate-sized personal-luxury car that offered the luxury and styling of the higher priced personal cars such as the Buick Riviera and Ford Thunderbird and the old Grand Prix and Olds Starfire but for a much lower price tag. The development of the car really has an interesting twist. Pete Estes who like Knudsen had moved to be GM of Chevrolet in 1966 and Delorean now {{general manager of the}} Pontiac division needed a car {{to take the place of}} the sagging sales of the full size Grand Prix, but the development cost of the car was too much of burden for Pontiac division alone, so Delorean went to his old boss now at Chevrolet to gather support for the development cost of the new [...] "G" [...] body Grand Prix. Estes agreed to share in the cost and allow Pontiac to have a one-year exclusivity on this new car, the next year Chevy would follow with its version which was called Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The new Grand Prix was such a sales success in 1969 as dealers moved 112,000 units - more than four times the number of Grand Prixs sold in 1968. Full-sized Pontiacs were also substantially restyled but retained the same basic under-body structure and chassis that debuted with the 1965 model - in fact the roof-lines for the four-door pillared sedans and Safari wagons were the same as the 1965 models, while the two-door semi-fastback design gave way to a squared-off notch-back style and four-door hardtop sedans were also more squared off than 1967-68 models. The GTOs and Firebirds received the Ram Air options, the GTO saw the addition of the [...] "Judge" [...] performance/appearance package, and the Firebird also got the [...] "Trans Am" [...] package. Although originally conceived as a 303 cubic inch model to compete directly in the Trans Am racing series, in a cost-saving move the Pontiac Trans Am debuted with the standard 400-cubic-inch performance engines. This year also saw De Lorean leaving the post of general manager to accept a similar position at GM's Chevrolet division. His replacement was F. James McDonald.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of social networks like Facebook and WeChat and so on, the social {{characteristics of the}} emerging e-commerce has become increasingly prominent and the varied demand for products rises in the same way, and the commercial value of <b>niche</b> <b>products</b> has also been surging with a blowout type, {{which suggests that the}} business model of <b>niche</b> <b>products</b> owns unique research value. Thus, the paper starts with the characteristics of <b>niche</b> <b>products</b> and their level of market demands, combines with the information diffusion characteristics of social networks, proposes the Business to (the Social Network Service) SNS to Customers (B 2 S 2 C) model and takes walnut oil products as example to empirically demonstrate this social commerce model. The empirical results show that the B 2 S 2 C social business model can reduce the high cost of middlemen, increase market share of <b>niche</b> <b>products</b> and ultimately achieve a significant improvement for its business efficiency, which suggests strong guiding significance and practical value for the product positioning and business model innovation for social network environment.

40|$|A key {{question}} for Internet commerce {{is the nature}} of competition with traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Although traditional retailers vastly outsell Internet retailers in most product categories, research on Internet retailing has largely neglected this fundamental dimension of competition. Is cross-channel competition significant, and if so, how and where can Internet retailers win this battle? This paper attempts to answer these questions using a unique combination of data sets. We collect data on local market structures for traditional retailers, and then match these data to a data set on consumer demand via two direct channels: Internet and catalog. Our analyses show that Internet retailers face significant competition from brick-and-mortar retailers when selling mainstream products, but are virtually immune from competition when selling <b>niche</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, because the Internet channel sells proportionately more <b>niche</b> <b>products</b> than the catalog channel, the competition between the Internet channel and local stores is less intense than the competition between the catalog channel and local stores. The methods we introduce can be used to analyze cross-channel competition in other product categories, and suggest that managers need {{to take into account the}} types of products they sell when assessing competitive strategies.
