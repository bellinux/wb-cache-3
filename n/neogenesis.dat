50|$|Normally GLP-1 levels rise {{during a}} meal {{to help the}} body utilize and control the {{elevation}} in blood sugar levels, but this response is hindered in Type 2 diabetics3. If injected to treat hyperglycemia it stimulates insulin production and inhibits glucagon secretion in the pancreas. GLP-1 itself {{can be used to}} treat diabetes, but it only has a half-life of around 5 minutes; by attaching the albumin this half-life is significantly increased, so that there are detectable levels 11-15 hours after administration2.GLP-1 also contributes to the health and survival of the insulin-producing cells in the body. Studies in rodents and humans illustrate that the incretin hormones {{play a central role in}} the homeostasis of pancreatic β cell mass as well as function. Chronic treatment of both normal and diabetic rodents with GLP-1R agonists can result in an increase in β cell mass due to increases in β cell 1) proliferation, 2) <b>neogenesis</b> and/or, 3) decreases in β cell apoptosis3.|$|E
50|$|Exendin-4 {{increases}} {{beta cell}} {{mass in the}} pancreatic islets to improve the release of insulin to ultimately increase glucose uptake. The mechanism regarding this insulin increase involves Ex-4 and GLP-1. When the islets in the pancreas are exposed to GLP-1, there is an increased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic genes bax and caspase-3, which leads to greater cell survival. GLP-1 binding to its G protein-coupled receptor activates various different pathways including the growth factor receptor and is coupled to pathways stimulating mitogenesis. Some of these pathways include Rap, Erk1/2, MAPK, B-RAF, PI3-K, cAMP, PKA, and TORC2 that are activated to initiate exocytosis, proinsulin gene expression and translation, increase insulin biosynthesis, and genetically increase beta cell proliferation and <b>neogenesis.</b> The GLP-1R is a G protein-coupled receptor that is dependent on glucose and GLP-1 is a peptide hormone that acts directly on the beta cell to stimulate insulin secretion by activating signal transduction when glucose is present. When glucose is not present, this receptor no longer couples to stimulate insulin secretion {{in order to prevent}} hypoglycemia.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and characteristics of inflammation and disease severity. METHODS: Arthroscopic synovial biopsy was performed in 103 patients with active RA (Disease Activity Score 28 -joint assessment >or= 3. 2) who had not received treatment with biologic agents. Sections were stained and assessed by digital image analysis. Lymphocyte aggregates were counted and graded for size (1 - 3). Synovial lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> {{was defined as the}} presence of grade 2 or 3 aggregates and subclassified based on the presence of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). RESULTS: Lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> was present in 31 % of the RA synovial tissues, whereas an additional 25 % contained only grade 1 aggregates. FDCs were present in 28 % of the samples with lymphoid <b>neogenesis,</b> corresponding to 8 % of the total RA cohort. Histologically, synovia with lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> showed increased infiltration by T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, and increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and lymphotoxin beta compared with samples without lymphoid <b>neogenesis.</b> Patients with lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> also had higher C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and leukocyte and thrombocyte counts, but exhibited no increase in the severity of clinical signs and symptoms. Of importance, there was no relationship between the presence of lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> and IgM rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies. The presence of lymphocyte aggregates with FDCs did not define a specific clinical phenotype compared with lymphocyte aggregates without FDCs. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that synovial lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> is associated with more severe synovial and systemic inflammation, but this is not confined to a specific clinical subset of R...|$|E

The local production of autoantibodies and the presence of ectopic lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> in the rheumatoid synovium suggest that these dedicated microenvironments resembling canonical lymphoid follicles may regulate the initiation and maturation of B cell autoimmunity. In this study, we assessed experimentally the relevance of ectopic lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> for B cell autoimmunity by a detailed structural, molecular, and serological analysis of seropositive and seronegative human synovitis. We demonstrate that synovial lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> is a reversible process associated with inflammation which is neither restricted to nor preferentially associated with autoantibody positive rheumatic conditions. Despite the abundant expression of key chemokines and cytokines required for full differentiation toward germinal center reactions, synovial lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> in rheumatoid arthritis only occasionally progresses toward fully differentiated follicles. In agreement with that observation, we could not detect Ag-driven clonal expansion and affinity maturation of B lymphocytes. Furthermore, ectopic lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> is not directly associated with local production of anti-citrullinated protein Abs and rheumatoid factor in the rheumatoid joint. Therefore, we conclude that synovial lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> is not a major determinant of these rheumatoid arthritis-specific autoantibody response...|$|E
40|$|Beta-cell {{deficit is}} the major {{pathological}} feature in type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, and {{plays a key role}} in disease progression. In principle, beta-cell regeneration can occur by replication of pre-existing beta-cells, or by beta-cell <b>neogenesis</b> from stem/progenitors. Unfortunately, beta-cell replication is limited by the almost complete absence of beta-cells in patients with type 1 diabetes, and the increasing recognition that the beta-cell replicative capacity declines severely with age. Therefore, beta-cell <b>neogenesis</b> has received increasing interest. Many different cell types within the pancreas have been suggested as potential beta-cell stem/progenitor cells, but the data have been conflicting. In some cases, this may be due to different regeneration models. On the other hand, different results have been obtained with similar regeneration models, leading to confusion about the nature and existence of beta-cell <b>neogenesis</b> in adult animals. Here, we review the major candidates for adult regeneration pathways, and focus on the recent discovery that alpha-cells can function as a novel beta-cell progenitor. Of note, this is a pathway that appears to be unique to beta-cell <b>neogenesis</b> in the adult, as the embryonic pathway of beta-cell <b>neogenesis</b> does not proceed through a glucagon-positive intermediate. We conclude that beta-cell <b>neogenesis</b> from alpha-cells is a new pathway of potential therapeutic significance, making it of high importance to elucidate the molecular events in alpha- to beta-cell conversion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Obliterative bronchiolitis after lung {{transplantation}} {{is associated}} with intrapulmonary lymphoid <b>neogenesis.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the role of lymphoid <b>neogenesis,</b> especially its relationship with secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) in allograft airway rejection. METHODS: A murine intrapulmonary tracheal transplant model and a conventional subcutaneous tracheal transplant model were tested using wild-type control mice and splenectomized lymphotoxin α knockout (LT) mice deficient in SLOs as recipients. RESULTS: In both subcutaneous and intrapulmonary tracheal transplant models using wild-type animals, tracheal isografts remained open without rejection, whereas allografts showed progressive luminal obliteration after transplantation. Lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> containing alloreactive T cells was observed in the lungs, which received an intrapulmonary tracheal allograft. Despite a lack of SLOs, intrapulmonary allografts in splenectomized LT mice were rejected and obliterated by day 28, but the rejection of subcutaneous allografts was significantly delayed. Extensive lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> was observed in the lungs of both intrapulmonary and subcutaneous allograft LT recipients. Increased proliferation of CD 4 T cells and B 220 B cells was observed in the lungs but not in the thymus or bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: Intrapulmonary lymphoid <b>neogenesis</b> is capable of mounting alloimmune responses without SLOs. Tracheal allograft rejection occurs as efficiently as in wild-type animals when it is placed in the lungs. Tracheal allograft rejection in the subcutaneous tissue occurs in a delayed manner without SLO in association with intrapulmonary lymphoid <b>neogenesis...</b>|$|E

Nevertheless, skepticism persists as to its occurrence otherwise, despite a continuing accumulation of reports of hair <b>neogenesis</b> in many laboratory animals, sheep, and man. The objectors have cited the tremendous ability of the hair follicle to reorganize itself after almost complete loss of its epithelium provided the hair papilla is preserved. New evidence indicates that even the hair papilla is dispensable and may reform itself from the connective tissue sheath mesenchyme.

We hypothesized that Rspo 1 deficiency enhances β-cell <b>neogenesis</b> in STZ-induced diabetes. METHODS: Wild-type (Rspo 1) and knockout (Rspo 1) mice were injected with STZ (40 mg/kg) for 5 days, followed by analysis of oral glucose and insulin tolerance, and were killed on day 6 (acute; 9 - 11 mice) or 32 (chronic; 11 - 16 mice). Immunohistochemistry was performed for β-cell apoptosis, proliferation, <b>neogenesis,</b> and markers of β-cell maturity. RESULTS: There {{was no difference in}} oral glucose handling between STZ-induced Rspo 1 and Rspo 1 mice, although Rspo 1 mice demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity. β-cell mass, islet number, and islet size distribution did not differ between STZ-induced Rspo 1 and Rspo 1 mice, but Rspo 1 animals had reduced β-cell apoptosis and increased numbers of insulin-positive ductal cells, indicating β-cell <b>neogenesis.</b> Furthermore, the increased β-cell regeneration observed in the Rspo 1 animals was associated with a more differentiated/mature β-cell phenotype as assessed by increased immunopositivity for Nkx 6. 1, MafA, and GLUT 2.

40|$|Abstract: Efforts to cure {{diabetes}} are now {{focused on}} restoring a physiologically-regulated population of insulinproducing cells to the patient. A number of animal models of � cell regeneration have been employed {{to study the}} mechanisms of the process. Islet <b>neogenesis,</b> the regeneration of pancreatic islets from pancreatic stem cells, is arguably the least fraught with barriers to widespread use as a therapy for diabetes. These animal models {{have led to the}} description of the reg family of proteins that appear to be related to islet regeneration. Islet neogenesis-associated protein (INGAP) is an initiator of islet <b>neogenesis</b> in animal models and a peptide sequence from INGAP carries the biological activity. INGAP peptide has been shown to stimulate an increase in � cell mass in mice, rats, hamsters and dogs. INGAP is also found in the pancreas in human pathological states involving islet <b>neogenesis.</b> The peptide has been tested in human clinical trials, with success being reported.

We in-vestigated {{the hypothesis that}} a novel gene encoding a con-stituent of Ilotropin was expressed in the hamster pancreas undergoing islet <b>neogenesis.</b> Islet <b>neogenesis</b> associated pro-tein (INGAP) {{is a product of}} a novel gene expressed in re-generating hamster pancreas. Northern blot analysis showed a strong single transcript of 850 bp at 1 and 2 d after CW that disappeared by the 6 th day and was absent from untreated control pancreata. INGAP gene is expressed in acinar cells, but not in islets. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of INGAP in Ilotropin but not in extracts from control pancreata. A synthetic pentadecapeptide, correspond-ing to a region unique to INGAP, stimulated a 2. 4 -fold in-crease in [3 H]thymidine incorporation into hamster duct epi-thelium in primary culture and a rat pancreatic duct cell line but had no effect on a hamster insulinoma tumor cell line. A portion of human INGAP gene was cloned and ap-pears to be highly homologous to the hamster gene.

40|$|Pancreatic β cell <b>neogenesis</b> and {{proliferation}} {{during the}} neonatal period {{are critical for}} the generation of sufficient pancreatic β cell mass/reserve and have {{a profound impact on}} long-term protection against type 2 diabetes (T 2 D).

40|$|Current therapies for {{diabetes}} mellitus are insufficient {{to prevent the}} devastating complications associated with this disease. A novel approach {{for the treatment of}} diabetes is the restoration of an insulin-producing beta-cell mass through the stimulation of endogenous progenitor cells. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to determine if pharmacological initiation of islet <b>neogenesis</b> and subsequent beta-cell mass expansion will lead to the reversal of hyperglycaemia in a response that is under homeostatic regulation and has efficacy in humans. A pentadecapeptide fragment of Islet <b>Neogenesis</b> Associated Protein (INGAP 104 - 108), was administered to normoglycaemic hamsters and was found to result in an expanded beta-cell mass as measured by immunohistochemical morphometric analysis. This expansion was shown to occur through the transformation of duct- and acinar-associated progenitors. In order to determine if this therapeutic approach would be effective in mammals other than hamsters, INGAP 104 - 108 was administered to normoglycaemic mice, dogs and monkeys, hyperglycaemic mice, and to human pancreatic tissue cultures. INGAP 104 - 108 administration led to a dose-dependent increase of beta-cell mass in mice, with similar trends observed in dogs. Similarly, administration of INGAP 104 - 108 to normoglycaemic monkeys for 90 days resulted in profound areas of islet <b>neogenesis.</b> Administration of INGAP 104 - 108 to diabetic mice resulted in restoration of euglycaemia and a dramatic increase in beta-cell mass. Furthermore, INGAP 104 - 108 administration to cultured human acinar tissue, {{led to the formation of}} insulin-producing islet-like structures. These results suggest that INGAP 104 - 108 therapy has the ability to reverse a diabetic state and could be effective in humans. However, it was necessary to determine whether the continual stimulation of islet <b>neogenesis</b> through INGAP 104 - 108 administration is a safe therapeutic approach. The beta-cell mass dynamics of euglycaemic mice administered INGAP 104 - 108 at various doses for 31 or 90 days were determined. beta-cell mass was greatly increased at 31 days of therapy, though by 90 days of therapy there was no difference in total beta cell mass between all treatment groups. However, there were marked instances of islet <b>neogenesis</b> in mice treated with INGAP 104 - 108 for 90 days. This elevation in islet <b>neogenesis</b> was tempered by decreased beta-cell replication and increased beta-cell apoptosis, resulting in no overall difference in total beta-cell mass. These results suggest that inherent homeostatic regulation persisted to maintain a net beta-cell mass that matched the physiological need, even in the setting of continual induction of islet <b>neogenesis.</b> INGAP 104 - 108 therapy has been shown to expand the insulin-producing beta-cell mass in a safe homeostatic manner and reverse diabetic hyperglycaemia.

40|$|One major {{unresolved}} {{question in}} the field of pancreas biology is whether ductal cells have the ability to generate insulin-producing β-cells. Conclusive examination of this question has been limited by the lack of appropriate tools to efficiently and specifically label ductal cells in vivo. We generated Sox 9 CreERT 2 mice, which, during adulthood, allow for labeling of an average of 70 % of pancreatic ductal cells, including terminal duct/centroacinar cells. Fate-mapping studies of the Sox 9 + domain revealed endocrine and acinar cell <b>neogenesis</b> from Sox 9 + cells throughout embryogenesis. Very small numbers of non-β endocrine cells continue to arise from Sox 9 + cells in early postnatal life, but no endocrine or acinar cell <b>neogenesis</b> from Sox 9 + cells occurs during adulthood. In the adult pancreas, pancreatic injury by partial duct ligation (PDL) has been suggested to induce β-cell regeneration from a transient Ngn 3 + endocrine progenitor cell population. Here, we identify ductal cells as a cell of origin for PDL-induced Ngn 3 + cells, but fail to observe β-cell <b>neogenesis</b> from duct-derived cells. Therefore, although PDL leads to activation of Ngn 3 expression in ducts, PDL does not induce appropriate cues to allow for completion of the entire β-cell <b>neogenesis</b> program. In conclusion, although endocrine cells arise from the Sox 9 + ductal domain throughout embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, Sox 9 + ductal cells of the adult pancreas no longer give rise to endocrine cells under both normal conditions and in response to PDL...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes, {{particularly}} type 1 diabetes, {{results from}} the lack of pancreatic β-cells. β-cell replenishment can functionally reverse diabetes, but two critical challenges face the field: 1. protection of the new β-cells from autoimmunity and allorejection, and 2. development of β-cells that are readily available and reliably functional. This chapter will examine the potential of endogenous replenishment of pancreatic β-cells as a possible therapeutic tool if autoimmunity could be blunted. Two pathways for endogenous replenishment exist in the pancreas: replication and <b>neogenesis,</b> defined as the formation of new islet cells from pancreatic progenitor/stem cells. These pathways of β-cell expansion are not mutually exclusive and both occur in embryonic development, in postnatal growth, and in response to some injuries. Since the β-cell population is dramatically reduced in the pancreas of type 1 diabetes patients, with {{only a small fraction of}} the β-cells surviving years after onset, replication of preexisting β-cells would not be a reasonable start for replenishment. However, induction of <b>neogenesis</b> could provide a starting population that could be further expanded by replication. It is widely accepted that <b>neogenesis</b> occurs in the initial embryonic formation of the endocrine pancreas, but its occurrence anytime after birth has become controversial because of discordant data from lineage tracing experiments. However, the concept was built upon many observations from different models and species over many years. Herein, we discuss the role of <b>neogenesis</b> in normal growth and regeneration, as learned from rodent models, followed by an analysis of what has been found in humans...|$|E
40|$|Wound induced hair {{follicle}} <b>neogenesis</b> (WIHN) describes a regenerative phenomenon in adult mammalian skin, wherein fully functional {{hair follicle}}s regenerate de novo {{in the center}} of large excisional wounds. Originally described in rats, rabbits, sheep, and humans in 1940 - 60, the WIHN phenomenon was reinvestigated in mice only recently. The process of de novo hair regeneration largely duplicates the morphological and signaling features of normal embryonic hair development. Similar to hair development, WIHN critically depends on the activation of canonical WNT signaling. However, unlike hair development, WNT activation in WIHN is dependent on Fgf 9 signaling generated by the immune system's gamma delta (γδ) T cells. The cellular bases of WIHN remain to be fully characterized, however, the available evidence leaves open the possibility for a blastema-like mechanism, wherein epidermal and/or dermal wound cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming toward a more plastic, embryonic-like state. De novo hair follicles do not regenerate from preexisting hair-fated bulge stem cells. This suggests that hair <b>neogenesis</b> is not driven by preexisting lineage-restricted progenitors, as is the case for amputation-induced mouse digit tip regeneration, but rather may require a blastema-like mechanism. The WIHN model is characterized by several intriguing features, which await further explanation. These include: (i) minimum wound size requirement for activating <b>neogenesis,</b> (ii) restriction of hair <b>neogenesis</b> to the wound's center, (iii) imperfect patterning outcomes, both in terms of neogenic hair positioning within the wound and in terms of their orientation. Future inquires into the WIHN process, made possible by a wide array of the available skin-specific genetic tools, will undoubtedly expand our understanding of the regeneration mechanisms in adult mammals...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{results from}} inadequate insulin action, {{which can be}} viewed as a consequence of the limited ability to restore β cells after they are lost as the result of metabolic exhaustion, autoimmune destruction, or surgical insult. Arguably, a uniformly effective therapeutic pathway to address all forms of diabetes would be to reverse the restrictions on β-cell and islet regeneration. The development from progenitor cells of islets with normal endocrine function does occur in adult humans; it is referred to as islet <b>neogenesis.</b> The induction of islet <b>neogenesis</b> is an important, if not essential, therapeutic approach for curing type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) and could be valuable in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) as well. Islet <b>neogenesis</b> associated protein (INGAP) is the first therapeutic candidate to be identified as the result of a purposeful search for an endogenous molecule with islet neogenic activity. It was found that partial obstruction of the pancreatic duct in hamsters induced islet neogenesis; under this condition, a neogenesis-promoting activity was identified and partially purified from a soluble tissue fraction. A 168 -kDa protein product of the cloned gene was found to be responsible for the <b>neogenesis</b> activity. This molecule named INGAP contains an active core sequence of amino acids called INGAP peptide. Results from in vitro, animal, and human studies suggest that INGAP and INGAP peptide are neogenic in at least several vertebrate species, including humans. INGAP has since been found to be a member of the family of Reg proteins, which are found across and in multiple versions within species and are closely associated with embryonic and regenerative processes. Clinical results suggest that INGAP peptide can be a suitable <b>neogenesis</b> therapy, but optimization of the therapy and more data are required to fully access this potential. Understanding of the signaling pathways of INGAP and other related Reg proteins is a promising means of advancing therapeutic development for people with T 1 DM and T 2 DM.

The recipient mice {{were treated with}} PSN 632408 or vehicle and BrdU daily. Human islet graft function in the mice was evaluated by nonfasting glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance, and removal of the grafts. Immunostaining for insulin, glucagon, and BrdU or Ki 67 was performed in islet grafts to evaluate α- and β-cell replication. Insulin and CK 19 immunostaining was performed to evaluate β-cell <b>neogenesis.</b> Four weeks after human islet transplantation, 71 % of PSN 632408 -treated mice achieved normoglycaemia compared with 24 % of vehicle-treated mice. Also, oral glucose tolerance was significantly improved in the PSN 632408 -treated mice. PSN 632408 treatment significantly increased both human α- and β-cell areas in islet grafts and stimulated α- and β-cell replication. In addition, β-cell <b>neogenesis</b> was induced from pancreatic duct cells in the islet grafts. Our results demonstrated that activation of GPR 119 increases β-cell mass by stimulating human β-cell replication and <b>neogenesis.</b> Therefore, GPR 119 activators may qualify as therapeutic agents to increase human β-cell mass in patients with diabetes...|$|E
40|$|One week of {{treatment}} with EGF and gastrin (EGF/G) {{was shown to}} restore normoglycemia and to induce islet regeneration in mice treated with the diabetogenic agent alloxan. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration are not fully understood. We performed genetic lineage tracing experiments to evaluate the contribution of beta cell <b>neogenesis</b> in this model. One day after alloxan administration, mice received EGF/G treatment for one week. The treatment could not prevent the initial alloxan-induced beta cell mass destruction, however it did reverse glycemia to control levels within one day, suggesting improved peripheral glucose uptake. In vitro experiments with C 2 C 12 cell line showed that EGF could stimulate glucose uptake with an efficacy {{comparable to that of}} insulin. Subsequently, EGF/G treatment stimulated a 3 -fold increase in beta cell mass, which was partially driven by <b>neogenesis</b> and beta cell proliferation as assessed by beta cell lineage tracing and BrdU-labeling experiments, respectively. Acinar cell lineage tracing failed to show an important contribution of acinar cells to the newly formed beta cells. No appearance of transitional cells co-expressing insulin and glucagon, a hallmark for alpha-to-beta cell conversion, was found, suggesting that alpha cells did not significantly contribute to the regeneration. An important fraction of the beta cells significantly lost insulin positivity after alloxan administration, which was restored to normal after one week of EGF/G treatment. Alloxan-only mice showed more pronounced beta cell <b>neogenesis</b> and proliferation, even though beta cell mass remained significantly depleted, suggesting ongoing beta cell death in that group. After one week, macrophage infiltration was significantly reduced in EGF/G-treated group compared to the alloxan-only group. Our results suggest that EGF/G-induced beta cell regeneration in alloxan-diabetic mice is driven by beta cell <b>neogenesis,</b> proliferation and recovery of insulin. The glucose-lowering effect of the treatment might {{play an important role in}} the regeneration process...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether the transcription factor FoxM 1 was required for regeneration of �-cell mass via proliferation and/or <b>neogenesis</b> in the adult after 60 % partial pancreatectomy (PPx). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Adult mice with a pancreas-wide deletion of Foxm 1 (Foxm 1 flox/flox;Pdx 1 -Cre [FoxM 1 �panc]) and their control littermates (Foxm 1 flox/flox) were subjected to PPx or a sham operation, after which islet expression of Foxm 1 and several target genes, �-cell mass, proliferation, �-cell size, islet size, islet density, and neurogenin- 3 expression were analyzed. RESULTS—In control mice, PPx stimulated �-cell proliferation and <b>neogenesis</b> and upregulated Foxm 1 and several of its known targets (Plk 1, Cenp-a, Birc 5 /Survivin, and Ccnb 1) in islets. Within 1 week post-PPx, control mice underwent significan...|$|E

40|$|We {{observed}} {{the distribution of}} CD 56 + epithelial cells in the pancreatic duct system using 25 fetal, one infantile, 3 normal adult, 4 diabetic, and 8 chronically inflamed pancreatic tissue samples. In the early stage of gestation (12 to 17 weeks), CD 56 + cells were commonly seen in the immature tubular structures. They were often continuous to pancreatic islets, and their distribution {{was similar to that}} of synaptophysin (Syn) + cells, suggesting that they are precursors of islet <b>neogenesis.</b> Their number decreased in proportion to gestational age. Instead, from 24 weeks of gestation, luminal cell clusters that were common in interlobular ducts revealed CD 56 +. These cell clusters were unrelated to islet <b>neogenesis</b> and Syn expression. Similar CD 56 + luminal cell clusters were also observed in cases of chronic pancreatitis, whereas they were scarce in normal adult and diabetic tissues. CD 56 + cells were also occasionally seen in intralobular ducts, intercalated ducts, and centroacinar cells in cases of chronic pancreatitis. We conclude that {{there are two types of}} CD 56 + epithelial cells in the pancreatic duct system: CD 56 + endocrine cells are numerous during the early stage of gestation, when islet <b>neogenesis</b> appears, while CD 56 + luminal cells may represent developmental and regenerative changes of pancreatic ducts. </p...|$|E
