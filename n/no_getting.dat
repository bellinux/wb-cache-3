25|$|There was <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> {{away from}} Selznick completely, though. He contended that his 50% {{stake in the}} profits still {{entitled}} him to input into the project. He still dictated sheaves of memos about the script, and tried to oust Cary Grant from the cast in favor of his contractee, Joseph Cotten. When the United States detonated two atomic bombs over Japan in August, the memos commenced anew and centered mainly on Selznick's continuing dissatisfaction with the script. Hitchcock was abroad, so Dozier called on playwright Clifford Odets, who previously wrote None But the Lonely Heart for RKO and Grant, to do a rewrite. With Hitchcock and Selznick both busy, Barbara Keon would be his only contact.|$|E

At the debate the candidates discussed issues pertinent to African-Americans including education, {{civil rights and}} reproductive safety. Biden stated that {{to prevent the spread}} of AIDS public servants have to communicate to [...] "black men... it is not unmanly to wear a condom, getting women to understand they can say <b>no,</b> <b>getting</b> people in the position where testing matters.

500|$|In July 2003, Goodrem was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkin's lymphoma {{and was forced to}} leave the show to begin treatment. Goodrem was written out of Neighbours, and script producer, Luke Devenish, said: [...] "She had to concentrate on her health, so there was <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> around it. There was absolutely no question of attempting to keep her working." [...] Nina departed in October 2003, with an exit storyline that allowed for a return in the future. Three months' worth of scripts were rewritten, and a new character, Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair), was created and introduced to cover Nina's planned storyline with Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey).|$|E
500|$|This {{storm of}} {{publicity}} caused {{a flurry of}} activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour {{to ask if he}} had finished." [...] Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Théophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: [...] "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin... And this is where I have to toss a 100-sou coin in the air {{to see whether or not}} there's a God." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} commended the {{development}} of Cheryl, as well as Greer's portrayal of the character. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall declared that Cheryl was his favorite character on the show. In his review for [...] "El Secuestro", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but she steps it up here, playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> it is usually pretty funny, and if anyone can pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer." [...] Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and H. Jon Benjamin, Greer was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production—the award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.|$|E

500|$|Worried of Clarkson being {{continually}} typecast as {{a talent}} show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily Max Martin, and {{encouraged them to}} produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she'll always be labeled as an American Idol winner; she remarked, [...] "I'm the first one, so it's {{going to be on}} my grave, I'm aware of that. (There's <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> away from it) so why even try?" [...] Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with Dr. Luke. These songs include [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and a demo version of what would have been [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes". Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having [...] "a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience." [...] Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the 1990s. Davis recalled, [...] "Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an American Idol winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song." [...] Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs. Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements; and the three eventually decided to develop a rock sound, a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve. Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album. Clarkson then asserted that she wanted it to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested [...] "Because of You" [...] instead, saying that she [...] "was a shitty writer (sic) who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon her". Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.|$|E
2500|$|... 2) Re{{mediation}} as the inseparability {{of mediation}} and reality: Bolter and Grusin assert that, “although Baudrillard's notion of simulation and simulacra might suggest otherwise, all mediations are themselves real.

Despite {{the fact that}} all media depend on other media in cycles of remediation, our culture still needs to acknowledge that all media remediate the real.

2500|$|Cesarani {{notes that}} by 1943, as the {{military}} position of the German forces deteriorated, the Nazi leadership became more openly explicit about the Final Solution. In March, Goebbels confided to his diary: [...] "On the Jewish question especially, we are in it so deeply that there is <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> out any longer. And {{that is a good}} thing.

2500|$|The {{tour was}} clearly {{regarded}} as disappointing: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> {{away from the}} fact that the programme arranged for them was too ambitious, and they failed to make any strong appeal to the public. Any hope they might have had of attracting attention, was destroyed by the ill-success that attended them in their early fixtures."

2500|$|Critics such as Jonathan Rosenbaum {{have argued}} that [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> around {{the fact that the}} movies of Abbas Kiarostami divide audiences—in this country, in his native Iran, and {{everywhere}} else they're shown." [...] Rosenbaum argues that disagreements and controversy over Kiarostami's movies have arisen from his style of film-making because what in Hollywood would count as essential narrative information is frequently missing from Kiarostami's films. Camera placement, likewise, often defies standard audience expectations: in the closing sequences of Life and Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees, the audience is forced to imagine the dialogue and circumstances of important scenes. In Homework and Close-Up, parts of the soundtrack are masked or silenced. Critics {{have argued that}} the subtlety of Kiarostami's cinematic expression is largely resistant to critical analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{noted that}} Amy did not develop much {{throughout}} the 2010 series. Dan Martin of The Guardian, in a mid-series review, wrote, [...] "I wonder whether I really know Amy Pond. Beneath the sass and the sauce and the wit and (there's <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> away from this) the skirts, I've yet to completely empathise with her, or work out {{what makes her}} tick". In a review before the finale, Martin called her [...] "a revelation", although she sometimes [...] "felt a little one note...But I'd put all of that down to guest writers responding to a character brief that probably said little more than 'feisty redhead'". IGN's Matt Wales shared similar sentiments, writing, [...] "Despite Gillan's effortless charisma, Pond was frequently painted in largely two-dimensional strokes that made for a brash, sometimes irritating turn. It's testament to Gillan's abilities and brilliant chemistry with Smith that she remained thoroughly watchable throughout but, bereft of back story (albeit intentionally), {{it was hard to}} really get involved with the character". Paul Kerton of Zap2it, however, wrote in a review of [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] that Amy's [...] "brilliantly executed introduction to the show stood out. Amy's character after just one episode is already one with depth". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino was also more positive towards Amy in the fifth series, writing that she was equally [...] "competent, intelligent, and [...] " [...] as she was flawed and made mistakes, which made her relatable and [...] "a successful female character".|$|E

2500|$|The Cortes of Leiria {{opened on}} January 25, 1438. Before the Cortes, King Edward (via a spokesman) openly blamed Henry's neglect of his {{military}} {{instructions for the}} debacle at Tangier. [...] But there was <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> away {{from the fact that}} Edward had authorized the expedition himself, against the advice of others, including the Cortes itself. A letter from the captive Ferdinand was read before the Cortes. The letter urged the fulfillment of the treaty, expressing Ferdinand's desire to be released and outlining why holding on to Ceuta served Portugal little purpose. Once again, Pedro of Coimbra and John of Reguengos, who had opposed the expedition from the start, urged the Cortes to ratify the treaty and surrender Ceuta immediately. The prelates agreed – although the Archbishop of Braga added that the Pope's approval should also be sought. [...] Most of the burghers also agreed – save for those of the major commercial port cities of Lisbon, Porto and Lagos, who felt that the release of a prince was too small a reward for so important a city, and that perhaps the treaty could be renegotiated. Ultimately, it was the noble magnates that sank the proposal. Rallied by Ferdinand of Arraiolos, the constable who had led the nobles at Tangier (although he earlier opposed the expedition), the Portuguese nobles opposed the swap altogether. [...] Arraiolos argued fervently that reneging the treaty was no dishonor, as it had been signed under duress. [...] The Cortes was dissolved without a decision being made.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Live Your Life" [...] was filmed in October 2008 in Los Angeles and was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. The video, using the radio edit of the song, stars T.I. and Rihanna. It plays backwards, starting {{with the end of}} T.I.'s day. In the opening scene T.I. is shown walking with bloody wounds culminating in the song beginning. It then goes from a series of underground shots of him with interspersed scenes of Rihanna in a dressing room. T.I. is then shown being thrown out of a car, being kicked by a large man. The video then cuts again to the day with T.I. wearing the same suit seen earlier in the video, but undamaged. He then encounters a group of thugs whom he brawls with. The video then begins a different story arc, showing T.I. before he made his fortune, singing in a recording studio and in front of a house playing dice and dominoes with friends. This portion of the video is interspersed with clips of the other story arc, such as showing T.I. with a briefcase full of money. He is then shown in the bathroom of a bar, before walking out into the bar passing Rihanna who has exited her dressing room. Rihanna performs on stage with a microphone while T.I. talks to a man saying [...] " [...] want out."; the man replies by explaining that there is <b>no</b> <b>getting</b> out, not for him nor for the character that Rihanna plays. T.I slams the money briefcase down on the table and shows it to the man saying that [...] "I'm done. I got myself here, I'll get myself out". Then he is seen walking into that same bar, in a flashback, with a CD in his hand. The man that T.I. spoke to earlier calls him over. This is a flashback showing T.I. trying to get a record deal. The last shot of the video takes place at around {{the same time as the}} first shot of the video. T.I. is walking down the Los Angeles River, raising his hands triumphantly in the air with a bloodied and scarred face. The song's producer, Just Blaze, is briefly seen playing pool in the bar during the second verse and final chorus.|$|E
