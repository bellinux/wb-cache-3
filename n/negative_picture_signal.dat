40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the relation between the phenomenological quality of memory (Tulving, 1985) and the realism (validity) in confidence judgement when using emotional pictures (I. A. P. S; Lang, Ohman, & Vaitl, 1988). A series of three experiments was completed where the participants judged the phenomenological quality of their memory and/or their confidence. The results showed facilitation for the <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> in a matrix search task in the encoding phase, where <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> were more easily and quickly detected, compared to positive ones. In the memory phase of the experiments a higher degree of recollective experience (a larger proportion of 'remember' responses) was found for <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> A higher level of confidence for recognition of <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> than for positive ones was obtained, but no general valence dependent effect on the realism in the confidence judgement was found. However, when analysing only the remember responses, <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> showed higher overconfidence than the positive pictures. The results support that a recollective experience induces higher confidence and overconfidence. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the neural basis of individual variation in emotion regulation, specifically the ability to reappraise negative stimuli so as to down-regulate negative affect. Brain functions in young adults were measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging during three conditions: (i) attending to neutral pictures; (ii) attending to <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> and (iii) reappraising <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> Resting-state functional connectivity was measured with amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) seed regions frequently associated with emotion regulation. Participants reported more negative affect after attending to <b>negative</b> than neutral <b>pictures,</b> and less <b>negative</b> affect following reappraisal. Both attending to <b>negative</b> vs neutral <b>pictures</b> and reappraising vs attending to <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> yielded widespread activations that were significantly right-lateralized for attending to <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> and left-lateralized for reappraising <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> Across participants, more successful reappraisal correlated with less trait anxiety and more positive daily emotion, greater activation in medial and lateral prefrontal regions, and lesser resting-state functional connectivity between (a) right amyg-dala and both medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, and (b) bilateral DLPFC and posterior visual cortices. The ability to regulate emotion, a source of resilience or of risk for distress, appears to vary in relation to differences in intrinsic functional brain architecture.

Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), MSNA, and perceived stress levels were recorded in 18 men during three randomized trials: 1) neutral <b>pictures,</b> 2) <b>negative</b> <b>pictures,</b> and 3) mental stress. MAP and HR increased during mental stress (Δ 14 ± 2 mmHg and Δ 15 ± 2 beats/min, P < 0. 001) but did not change during viewing of <b>negative</b> or neutral <b>pictures.</b> MSNA did not change during viewing of neutral (Δ 1 ± 1 burst/min, n = 16) or negative (Δ 0 ± 1 burst/min, n = 16) pictures or during mental stress (Δ 1 ± 2 burst/min, n = 13). Perceived stress levels were higher during mental stress (3 ± 0 arbitrary units) than during viewing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> (2 ± 0 arbitrary units, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Reward {{facilitates}} {{performance and}} boosts cognitive performance across many tasks. At the same time, negative affective stimuli interfere with performance {{when they are}} not relevant to the task at hand. Yet, the investigation of how reward and negative stimuli impact perception and cognition has taken place {{in a manner that is}} largely independent of each other. How reward and negative emotion simultaneously contribute to behavioral performance is currently poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the simultaneous manipulation of positive motivational processing (here manipulated via reward) and aversive processing (here manipulated via <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> viewing) influence behavior during a perceptual task. We tested 2 competing hypotheses about the impact of reward on <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> viewing. On the one hand, suggestions about the automaticity of emotional processing predict that <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> interference would be relatively immune to reward. On the other, if affective visual processing is not obligatory, as we have argued in the past, reward may counteract the deleterious effect of more potent <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> We found that reward counteracted the effect of potent, negative distracters during a visual discrimination task. Thus, when sufficiently motivated, participants were able to reduce the deleterious impact of bodily mutilation stimuli...|$|R

In contrast, <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> presentation did not slow down judgments in subsequent perceptual processing (e. g., color judgments about words, size judgments about objects).

40|$|Emotionally {{negative}} stimuli {{serve as}} a mechanism of biological preparedness to enhance attention. We hypothesized that emotionally negative stimuli would also serve as motivational priming to increase attention resources for subsequent stimuli. To that end, we tested 11 participants in a dual sensory modality task, wherein emotionally <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> were contrasted with emotionally neutral pictures and each picture was followed 600 ms later by a tone in an auditory oddball paradigm. Each trial began with a picture displayed for 200 ms; half of the trials began with an emotionally <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> {{and half of the}} trials began with an emotionally neutral picture; 600 ms following picture presentation, the participants heard either an oddball tone or a standard tone. At the end of each trial (picture followed by tone), the participants categorized, with a button press, the picture and tone combination. As expected, and consistent with previous studies, we found an enhanced visual late positive potential (latency range= 300 - 700 ms) to the <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> stimuli. We further found that compared to neutral <b>pictures,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> resulted in early attention and orienting effects to subsequent tones (measured through an enhanced N 1 and N 2) and sustained attention effects only to the subsequent oddball tones (measured through late processing negativity, latency range= 400 - 700 ms). Number pad responses to both the picture and tone category showed the shortest response latencies and greatest percentage of correct picture-tone categorization on the <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> followed by oddball tone trials. Consistent with previous work on natural selective attention, our results support the idea that emotional stimuli can alter attention resource allocation.

Next to that we hypothesized that adolescents that have a higher tendency towards somatisation would also have higher startle responses while watching <b>negative</b> physical-related <b>pictures</b> then while watching other <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> To test these hypotheses we measured startle reflex on an acoustic startle stimulus in a large group of adolescents, while watching pictures of pleasant, unpleasant or neutral content. The unpleasant pictures were divided in pictures presenting painful physical experiences and pictures with non-physical contents. The tendency towards somatisation was measured with the Dutch version of the Somatic Complaints Subscale of Youth Self Report questionnaire. By means of repeated measures ANOVA we tested whether there was an association between the scores on the somatisation questionnaires and the startle responses on the pictures of different valence. Our population consisted of 641 adolescents, 52. 4 % female. No association between somatisation and startle amplitude was found (F= 0. 938; P= 0. 392).

It {{is unclear how}} affective functions in aging correspond to subjective experiences and physiological changes. In Study I, ratings of emotional intensity and neural activity to facial expressions using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) were analyzed in younger and older adults. Negative expressions resulted in increased neural activity in the right amygdala and hippocampus in younger adults, and increased activation in the right insular cortex in older adults. There were no age differences in subjective ratings. In Study II, subjective ratings of, and skin conductance response (SCR) to, neutral and <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> were studied. The ratings of <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> were higher for older adults compared to younger adults.

The memory performance of both age groups was higher in response to <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> compared to neutral ones, although the performance was generally higher for younger adults. SCR at encoding was the better arousal predictor for memory, but only in younger adults. The results indicate age-related changes in affective processing.

40|$|Chanting {{and praying}} {{are among the}} most popular {{religious}} activities, which are said to be able to alleviate people’s negative emotions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this mental exercise and its temporal course have hardly been investigated. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the effects of chanting the name of a Buddha (Amitābha) on the brain’s response to viewing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> that were fear- and stress-provoking. We recorded and analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from 21 Buddhists with chanting experience as they viewed <b>negative</b> and neutral <b>pictures.</b> Participants were instructed to chant the names of Amitābha or Santa Claus silently to themselves or simply remain silent (no-chanting condition) during picture viewing. To measure the physiological changes corresponding to negative emotions, electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response data were also collected. Results showed that viewing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> (vs. neutral pictures) increased the amplitude of the N 1 component in all the chanting conditions. The amplitude of late positive potential (LPP) also increased when the <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> were viewed under the no-chanting and the Santa Claus condition. However, increased LPP was not observed when chanting Amitābha. The ERP source analysis confirmed this finding and showed that increased LPP mainly originated from the central-parietal regions of the brain. In addition, the participants’ heart rates decreased significantly when viewing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> in the Santa Claus condition. The no-chanting condition had a similar decreasing trend although not significant. However, while chanting Amitābha and viewing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> participants’ heart rate did not differ significantly from that observed during neutral picture viewing. It is possible that the chanting of Amitābha might have helped the participants to develop a religious schema and neutralized the effect of the negative stimuli. These findings echo similar research findings on Christian religious practices and brain responses to negative stimuli. Hence, prayer/religious practices may have cross-cultural universality in emotion regulation. This study shows {{for the first time that}} Buddhist chanting, or in a broader sense, repetition of religious prayers will not modulate brain responses to negative stimuli during the early perceptual stage, but only during the late-stage emotional/cognitive processing. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Despite ample {{support for}} {{enhanced}} affective well-being and emotional stability in healthy aging, {{the role of}} potentially important dimensions, such as the emotional arousal, has not been systematically investigated in neuroimaging studies. In addition, the few behavioral studies that examined effects of arousal have produced inconsistent findings. The present study manipulated the arousal of pictorial stimuli {{to test the hypothesis}} that preserved emotional functioning in aging is modulated by the level of arousal, and to identify the associated neural correlates. Young and older healthy participants were presented with <b>negative</b> and neutral <b>pictures,</b> which they rated for emotional content, while fMRI data were recorded. There were three main novel findings regarding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> with different levels of arousal in young and older adults. First, the common engagement of the right amygdala in young and older adults was driven by high arousing negative stimuli. Second, complementing an age-related reduction in the subjective ratings for low arousing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures,</b> there were opposing patterns of activity in the rostral/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala, which showed increased vs. decreased responses, respectively, to low arousing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> Third, increased spontaneous activity in the ventral ACC/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in older adults was linked to reduced ratings for low arousing <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the neural correlates underlying processing of negative emotions with different levels of arousal in the context of enhanced emotional functioning in healthy aging. Notably, the results support the idea that older adults have emotion regulation networks chronically activated, in the absence of explicit induction of the goal to regulate emotions, and that this effect is specific to low arousing negative emotions...|$|R

This initial learning phase {{was followed by a}} memory updating phase, during which participants learned picture-location associations for old pictures (i. e., pictures previously associated with other neutral stimuli) and new pictures (i. e., pictures not seen in the first phase).

In addition, frontopolar activity was more negatively correlated with the amygdala when participants learned picture–location associations for old <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> than for new negative or old neutral pictures. Past studies revealed that the frontopolar OFC allows for updating the affective values of stimuli in reversal learning or extinction of conditioning [e. g., Izquierdo, A., & Murray, E. A.
