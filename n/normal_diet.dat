5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places they form part of the <b>normal</b> <b>diet.</b> Insects have a high protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition. In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, the <b>normal</b> <b>diet</b> {{includes}} {{rice and}} noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, {{they appear to be}} just as effective.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to the United States in March 1949. Truman offered him the post of Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs but General Smith declined the appointment, preferring to return to military duty. He was appointed as {{the commander of the}} First Army at Fort Jay, New York, his first command since 1918. Throughout the war, Smith had been troubled by a recurring stomach ulcer. The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a <b>normal</b> <b>diet,</b> and he was suffering from malnutrition. Smith was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Hospital, where the surgeons decided to remove most of his stomach. This did cure his ulcer, but Smith remained malnourished and thin.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), a measure originally designed to measure pathological eating in the 1970 s, is related to healthy eating and/or <b>normal</b> <b>dieting</b> today. This study included the EAT, a measure of healthy/unhealthy eating, a measure of <b>normal</b> <b>dieting,</b> a measure of pathological eating, and a demographics form. These questionnaires were administered to 206 undergraduate women. Results indicated that most factors on the EAT are highly correlated with <b>normal</b> <b>dieting</b> and several factors are correlated with healthy eating. It may be that researchers have been questioning the validity of the EAT because it is measuring <b>normal</b> <b>dieting</b> and, to some extent, healthy eating. Future research should investigate this issue further. PsychologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico. Dept. of PsychologySmith, Jane EllenBryan, AngelaErickson, Sara...|$|R

5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their <b>normal</b> <b>diet,</b> and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their <b>normal</b> <b>diet</b> of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether tumor-induced cachexia and aberrations in host liver metabolism, induced by the MAT-LyLu variant of the Dunning prostate tumor, could be prevented by omega 3 fatty acids from fish oil. On day 0, adult Copenhagen-Fisher rats fed normal chow ad libitum were inoculated with 10 (6) MAT-LyLu cells (n = 14) or saline (n = 9). On day 7, when tumors were palpable, four tumor-bearing (TB) and four nontumor-bearing (NTB) rats were put on isocaloric diets with 50 % of total energy as fish oil. The introduction of fish oil-enriched diets caused a reduction in energy intake to less than half of the energy intake by animals fed <b>normal</b> <b>diets</b> during days 7 - 14 (difference by dietary group: NTB, P < 0. 001; TB, P < 0. 001). During days 14 - 21, energy intake in fish oil-fed animals returned to approximately 75 % of energy intake by animals fed <b>normal</b> <b>diets</b> (difference by dietary group: NTB, P < 0. 003; TB, P = 0. 001). Carcass weight of animals on day 21, when the study was terminated, was significantly related to initial weight (P = 0. 05) and mean food intake during the study (P = 0. 01). When data were adjusted for these variables using analysis of covariance, with NTB animals on <b>normal</b> <b>diets</b> being the reference group, significant loss of carcass weight was observed in TB animals on <b>normal</b> <b>diets</b> only (mean +/- SEM 58 +/- 10 g loss, P < 0. 001), but not in TB animals on fish oil diets (8 +/- 18 g loss, P = 0. 67).

40|$|Fifty {{children}} consecutively {{attending a}} clinic for coeliac disease co-operated in a trial; 10 {{found to have}} flat mucosa were excluded. Forty children of mean age 9. 8 years, whose duodenal or jejunal mucosa had returned to normal or near normal appearance after a mean of 5. 8 years on gluten-free diets, were put back on <b>normal</b> <b>diets.</b> In 37, mucosal occurred in a mean of 16. 9 months (four to 74 months). Four of the 37 had serial biopsies, in which mucosal enzymes (particularly lactase) fell and interepithelial lymphocyte counts rose before the mucosal morphology was regarded as definitely 'coeliac'. Three children had normal mucosal appearance after 58 to 73 months on <b>normal</b> <b>diets,</b> one of whom showed temporary mucosal abnormalities, another having occasionally low enzymes, in both suggesting underlying gluten sensitivity. Lactase suppression and raised IEL counts appear to be sensitive indicators of gluten intolerance. In our experience, a diagnosis of coeliac disease based on severe mucosal damage and a satisfactory response to a gluten-free but milk-containing diet implies a very strong likelihood of permanent or prolonged gluten intolerance, but with a striking variability in its expression...|$|R

25|$|In {{some regions}} of India, fasts of {{religious}} nature are {{an occasion for}} a change in <b>normal</b> <b>diet,</b> and a total absence from cooking or eating is held as elective while a <b>normal</b> <b>diet</b> for a fasting day is a light feast consisting of different foods from usual, amongst which sweet potato is one of the prime sources of sustenance. Sweet potato– shakarkand, शक्करकंद– is eaten otherwise, too, and a popular variety of preparation in most parts is roasted slow over kitchen coals at night and eaten with some dressing—primarily salt, possibly yogurt—while the easier way in the south is simply boiling or pressure cooking before peeling, cubing and seasoning for a vegetable dish as part of the meal. In Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is known as 'Sakkara valli Kilangu'. It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into flour; this is then mixed with wheat flour and baked into chapattis (bread). Between 15 and 20 percent of sweet potato harvest is converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber harvest is used in India as cattle fodder.|$|E
25|$|Choline is a {{precursor}} to trimethylamine, which some persons {{are not able to}} break down due to a genetic disorder called trimethylaminuria. Persons suffering from this disorder may suffer from a strong fishy or otherwise unpleasant body odor, due to the body's release of odorous trimethylamine. A body odor will occur even on a <b>normal</b> <b>diet</b> i.e., one that is not particularly high in choline. Persons with trimethylaminuria are advised to restrict the intake of foods high in choline; this may help to reduce the sufferer's body odor.|$|E

25|$|Magnesium {{toxicity}} from magnesium salts is rare {{in healthy}} individuals with a <b>normal</b> <b>diet,</b> because excess magnesium is readily excreted in urine by the kidneys. A few cases of oral magnesium toxicity have been described in persons with normal renal function ingesting large amounts of magnesium salts, but it is rare. If {{a large amount of}} magnesium chloride is eaten, it will have effects similar to magnesium sulfate, causing diarrhea, although the sulfate also contributes to the laxative effect in magnesium sulfate, so the effect from the chloride is not as severe.|$|E
25|$|People {{with primary}} lactase {{deficiency}} cannot modify their body’s {{ability to produce}} lactase. In societies where lactose intolerance is the norm, it is not considered a condition that requires treatment. However, where dairy is a larger component of the <b>normal</b> <b>diet,</b> a number of efforts may be useful. There are four general principles in dealing with lactose intolerance: avoidance of dietary lactose, substitution to maintain nutrient intake, regulation of calcium intake, and use of enzyme substitute. Regular consumption of dairy food by lactase deficient individuals may also reduce symptoms of intolerance by promoting colonic bacteria adaptation.|$|E
25|$|It takes {{around five}} days of total {{abstinence}} to unmask a food or chemical, {{during the first week}} on an elimination diet withdrawal symptoms can occur but it takes at least two weeks to remove residual traces. If symptoms have not subsided after six weeks, food intolerance is unlikely to be involved and a <b>normal</b> <b>diet</b> should be restarted. Withdrawals are often associated with a lowering of the threshold for sensitivity which assists in challenge testing, but in this period individuals can be ultra-sensitive even to food smells so care must be taken to avoid all exposures.|$|E

The heavens influenced every person in different ways by influencing elements connected to certain humors, important information in reaching a diagnosis.

25|$|The {{provision}} of salt {{was a major}} logistical problem for the largest Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements. As they came to rely upon cereal foods over salty meat and fish, Neolithic cultures had to incorporate supplementary sources of salt into their diet. Similarly, domestic cattle need to be provided with extra sources of salt beyond their <b>normal</b> <b>diet</b> or their milk production is reduced. Cucuteni-Trypillia mega-sites, {{with a population of}} likely thousands of people and animals, are estimated to have required between 36,000 and 100,000kg of salt per year. This was not available locally, and so had to be moved in bulk from distant sources on the western Black Sea coast and in the Carpathian Mountains, probably by river.|$|E
