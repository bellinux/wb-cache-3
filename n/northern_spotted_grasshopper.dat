40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is a {{controversial}} {{species in the}} Pacific Northwest that is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The barred owl (Strix varia), a species historically restricted to eastern North America, has recently expanded its range to completely overlap that of the <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl. Recent evidence suggests that barred owls may compete with <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls and may be one cause for recent declines in some <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl populations. Our focus was to examine whether barred owls {{have the potential to}} competitively exclude <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls from their territories through interference competition. We used a playback experiment to quantify aggressive vocal and physical behavior of barred and <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls during territorial defense. Experimental trials consisted of displaying <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> or barred owl taxidermy mounts, and broadcasting recorded vocalizations of the corresponding species, in both barred and <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl territories. The frequency of interspecific interactions was lower compared to intraspecific interactions between <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls alone. However, barred owls responded with higher levels of vocal and physical aggression than did <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls when agonistic interspecific interactions occurred. Our results suggest that barred owls are likely to assume the dominant role during interspecific interactions with <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls. Thus, interference competition is a plausible mechanism by which barred owls could contribute to observed population declines of <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls in areas where the species co-occur...|$|R

40|$|State {{and federal}} actions to {{conserve}} <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) habitat are largely initiated by establishing habitat occupancy. <b>Northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl occupancy is typically assessed by eliciting {{their response to}} simulated conspecific vocalizations. However, proximity of barred owls (Strix varia) –a significant threat to <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls–can suppress <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl responsiveness to vocalization surveys and hence their probability of detection. We developed a survey method to simultaneously detect both species that does not require vocalization. Detection dogs (Canis familiaris) located owl pellets accumulated under roost sites, within search areas selected using habitat association maps. We compared success of detection dog surveys to vocalization surveys slightly modified from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Draft 2010 Survey Protocol. Seventeen 2 km 62 km polygons were each surveyed multiple times {{in an area where}} <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls were known to nest prior to 1997 and barred owl density was thought to be low. Mitochondrial DNA was used to confirm species from pellets detected by dogs. Spotted owl and barred owl detection probabilities were significantly higher for dog than vocalization surveys. For spotted owls, this difference increased with number of site visits. Cumulative detection probabilities of <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls were 29 % after session 1, 62 % afte...|$|R

40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} threatened subspecies ever listed under the US Endangered Species Act. Despite protection of its remaining forest habitat, recent field studies show continued declines of <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls. One potential threat to <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls which has not yet been shown is loss of genetic variation from population bottlenecks. Bottlenecks can increase the probability of mating among related individuals, potentially causing inbreeding depression, and can decrease adaptive potential. Here we report evidence for recent bottlenecks in <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls using a large genetic dataset (352 individuals and 10 microsatellite loci). The signature of bottlenecks was strongest in the Washington Cascade Mountains, in agreement with field data. Our results provide independent evidence that <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owls have recently declined, and suggest that loss of genetic variation is an emerging threat to the subspecies’ persistence. Reduced effective population size (Ne) shown here in addition to field evidence for demographic decline highlights the increasing vulnerability of this bird to extinction...|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{whooping}} crane, {{the only}} endangered species protections the God Squad has exempted was the <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl. It started in 1991, when {{a federal judge}} ordered the halting of logging on Pacific Northwest national lands because of {{the threat to the}} <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl. [...] Following this action, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) filed for exemption from Section 7. [...] The <b>northern</b> <b>spotted</b> owl is a medium-sized bird that is dependent on old-growth forest and large territories for survival. [...] The BLM came up with a solution that allowed logging to continue in the area, which included the sale of timber on 44 timber tracts to the logging industry. The 44 tracts totaled 4400 acres (18 km2) of land. [...] The God Squad convened and discussed the issue. In a 5:2 vote, the God Squad voted for approval of the exemption in thirteen of the sales where there was no reasonable alternative to the sale. [...] However, the exemption was soon overturned when Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found it had been illegal for the President to talk to his cabinet about the exemption.|$|R
