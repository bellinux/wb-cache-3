5|$|Many sunscreens use <b>nanoparticles</b> of {{zinc oxide}} (along with <b>nanoparticles</b> of {{titanium}} dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern {{that they might be}} absorbed into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO <b>nanoparticles</b> applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, a comprehensive review of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{problems}} with producing <b>nanoparticles</b> initially arise once these <b>nanoparticles</b> are generated in solution. Without {{the use of}} a stabilizing agent, <b>nanoparticles</b> tend to stick together once the stirring is stopped. In order to counteract this, a certain collidial stabilizer is generally added. These stabilizers bind to the <b>nanoparticles</b> in a way that prevents other particles from bonding with them. Some effective stabilizers found so far include citrate, cellulose, and sodium borohydride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nanoparticles</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to greatly influence biological processes. The potency of a nanoparticle increases as its surface area-to-volume-ratio does. Attachments of ligands to the surface of <b>nanoparticles</b> allow them to interact with biomolecules.|$|E
30|$|It was {{observed}} {{that there is}} retention of <b>nanoparticle</b> during the flooding experiments. The retention of <b>nanoparticle</b> was dependent on the composition of brine and environmental condition. The concentration solution of <b>nanoparticle</b> also affects the retention of <b>nanoparticle</b> on the reservoir rock minerals.|$|R
30|$|SEM {{pictures}} for different concentrations of injected <b>nanoparticle</b> flooding have shown <b>nanoparticle</b> adsorption increment on pore walls {{as a function}} of <b>nanoparticle</b> flooding concentration.|$|R
30|$|It {{is found}} that the {{stability}} of <b>nanoparticle</b> solution with co-solvent, SDS surfactant, {{be more effective in}} the avoidance of <b>nanoparticle</b> aggregation than <b>nanoparticle</b> solution individual. Therefore, stabilized aqueous solutions consisting of <b>nanoparticle</b> in water stabilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are more stable.|$|R
25|$|Small {{molecules}} in vivo {{have a short}} retention time, {{but the use of}} larger <b>nanoparticles</b> does not. These <b>nanoparticles</b> can be used to avoid immune response, which aids in the treatment of chronic diseases. It has been investigated as a potential cancer therapy and also has the potential to affect the understanding of genetic disorders. <b>Nanoparticles</b> also have the potential to aid in site-specific drug delivery by improving the amount of unmodified drug that is circulated within the system, which also decreases the necessary dosage frequency. The targeted nature of <b>nanoparticles</b> also means that non-targeted organs are much less likely to experience side effects of drugs intended for other areas.|$|E
25|$|Attaching ionic ligands to <b>nanoparticles</b> allows {{control over}} enzyme activity. An example of enzyme {{inhibition}} {{is given by}} binding of a-chymotrypsin (ChT), an enzyme with a largely cationic active site. When a-chymotrypsin is incubated with anionic (negatively charged) <b>nanoparticles,</b> ChT activity is inhibited as anionic <b>nanoparticles</b> bind to the active site. Enzyme activity can be restored {{by the addition of}} cationic surfactants. Alkyl surfactants form a bilayer around ChT, whereas thiol and alcohol surfactants alter the surface of ChT such that interactions with <b>nanoparticles</b> are interrupted. Though formation of a protein-nanoparticle complex can inhibit enzyme activity, studies show that it can also stabilize protein structure, and significantly protect the protein from denaturization.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between <b>nanoparticles</b> and {{molecules}} change {{depending on}} the nanoparticle's core. Nanoparticle properties depend {{not only on the}} composition of the core material, but also on varying thicknesses of material used. Magnetic properties are particularly useful in molecule manipulation, and thus metals are often used as core material. Metals contain inherent magnetic properties that allow for manipulation of molecular assembly. As <b>nanoparticles</b> interact with molecules via ligand properties, molecular assembly can be controlled by external magnetic fields interacting with magnetic properties in the <b>nanoparticles.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{develop a new}} model for the {{electron}} emission of high-Z <b>nanoparticle</b> irradiated by X-rays. This study is motivated by the recent advances about the <b>nanoparticle</b> enhancement of cancer treatment by radiotherapy. Our original approach combines a pure probabilistic analytical model for the photon trajectories inside the <b>nanoparticle</b> and subsequent electron cascade trajectories based here on a Monte-Carlo simulation provided by the Livermore model implemented in Geant 4. To compare the <b>nanoparticle</b> and the plane surface electron emissions, we also develop our model for a plane surface. Our model highlights and explains {{the existence of a}} <b>nanoparticle</b> optimal radius corresponding to a maximum of <b>nanoparticle</b> electron emission. It allows us to study precisely the <b>nanoparticle</b> photon absorption and electron cascade production depth in the <b>nanoparticle...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nitrate reductase was {{suggested}} to initiate <b>nanoparticle</b> formation by many fungi including Penicillium species, while several enzymes, α-NADPH-dependent reductases, nitrate-dependent reductases and an extracellular shuttle quinone, were implicated in silver <b>nanoparticle</b> synthesis for Fusarium oxysporum. Jain et al. (2011) indicated that silver <b>nanoparticle</b> synthesis for A. flavus occurs initially by a [...] "33kDa" [...] protein {{followed by a}} protein (cystein and free amine groups) electrostatic attraction which stabilizes the <b>nanoparticle</b> by forming a capping agent. Intracellular silver and gold <b>nanoparticle</b> synthesis is not fully understood but similar fungal cell wall surface electrostatic attraction, reduction, and accumulation has been proposed. External gold <b>nanoparticle</b> synthesis by P. chrysosporium was attributed to laccase, while intracellular gold <b>nanoparticle</b> synthesis was attributed to ligninase.|$|R
25|$|In many {{synthetic}} processes using {{transition metal}} catalysts, metal <b>nanoparticles</b> {{play an important}} role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal <b>nanoparticles.</b> More importantly, ILs can be made that incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium <b>nanoparticles</b> are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and recyclability are realized.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nanoparticles</b> 40nm in {{diameter}} and smaller {{have been successful in}} penetrating the skin. Research confirms that <b>nanoparticles</b> larger than 40nm do not penetrate the skin past the stratum corneum. Most particles that do penetrate will diffuse through skin cells, but some will travel down hair follicles and reach the dermis layer.|$|E
25|$|Instead of doping {{a surface}} directly, {{antimicrobial}} activity can be imparted to a surface by applying a coating containing antimicrobial agents such as biocides or silver <b>nanoparticles.</b> In {{the case of}} the latter, the <b>nanoparticles</b> can have beneficial effects on the structural properties of the coating along with their antibacterial effect.|$|E
30|$|During impact process, <b>nanoparticle</b> made {{rotary motion}} and {{translational}} motion under {{effects of the}} shear force from plates before plates {{came into contact with}} <b>nanoparticle.</b> When coming into contact, plates would destroy the absorption layer first and then pressed <b>nanoparticle.</b> The transformation of <b>nanoparticle</b> depended on magnitude of impact force which is shown in Figure 5. In case 1, with lower impact force, <b>nanoparticle</b> merely had a small deformation, and with larger one in case 2, the <b>nanoparticle</b> was squashed and large deformation had been made. In the meantime of pressing <b>nanoparticle,</b> distribution of atoms in the plates near contact point was changed but would recover when the contact point had leaved <b>nanoparticle.</b> The impaction also cut some atoms in nanoparticle; these atoms would be absorbed to plates directly. Thus it had an effect of filling for rough surfaces. Figure 6 shows the comparison of friction processes of two cases after impaction. In case 1, <b>nanoparticle</b> still rotated mildly and enhanced friction process; in case 2, the <b>nanoparticle</b> was absorbed to the plates and became a part of it which could still improve surface-to-surface contact friction state. No matter how large the impaction force was, in later period, the destroyed absorption layer re-formed between surfaces of plates and <b>nanoparticle</b> and changed the interactions.|$|R

These nine-component hydrogen-bonded supramolecular structures {{held together by}} 36 hydrogen bonds induce gold <b>nanoparticle</b> assembly. The morphologies of the <b>nanoparticle</b> assemblies can be tuned easily by changing the quantity of the building block chemisorbed on the <b>nanoparticle</b> surface...|$|R
30|$|During impaction, the argon {{absorption}} layer {{was first}} destroyed, and then plates and <b>nanoparticle</b> interacted. <b>Nanoparticle</b> would be pressed and some atoms from <b>nanoparticle</b> {{would be cut}} and absorbed to plates which had an effect of filling for rough plates, which would form a new <b>nanoparticle</b> protective crust and have an effect of filling for rough plates.|$|R
25|$|In DSSC, {{electrodes}} {{consisted of}} sintered semiconducting <b>nanoparticles,</b> mainly TiO2 or ZnO. These nanoparticle DSSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion through the semiconductor <b>nanoparticles</b> for the electron transport. This limits the device efficiency {{since it is}} a slow transport mechanism. Recombination {{is more likely to}} occur at longer wavelengths of radiation. Moreover, sintering of <b>nanoparticles</b> requires a high temperature of about 450°C, which restricts the fabrication of these cells to robust, rigid solid substrates. It has been proven that there is an increase in the efficiency of DSSC, if the sintered nanoparticle electrode is replaced by a specially designed electrode possessing an exotic 'nanoplant-like' morphology.|$|E

Then they irradiated {{the area with}} near-infrared laser light. This caused the <b>nanoparticles</b> to swell three times or more in size bursting the endosomes and dispersing the RNA in the cell. miR-34a can lower the levels of CD44.|$|E

40|$|Trajectories of a polarizable species (atoms or molecules) in the {{vicinity}} of a negatively charged <b>nanoparticle</b> (at a floating potential) are considered. The atoms are pulled into regions of strong electric field by polarization forces. The polarization increases the deposition rate of the atoms and molecules at the <b>nanoparticle.</b> The effect of non-spherical shape of the <b>nanoparticle</b> is investigated by the Monte Carlo method. The shape of the non-spherical <b>nanoparticle</b> is approximated by an ellipsoid. Total deposition rate and its flux density distribution along the <b>nanoparticle</b> surface are calculated.

40|$|The gold nanoparticels were {{modified}} by biological active saccharides, and {{the properties of}} gold <b>nanoparticle</b> including protein recognition abilities were investigated. First, the gold <b>nanoparticle</b> with about 8 nm diameter was {{modified by}} lactose-substituted mercapto oligoethylene. The gold <b>nanoparticle</b> was water soluble, and aggregated by addition of the specific recognition lectin. Then, the gold <b>nanoparticle</b> with 40 nm diameter was prepared by glycopolymer cattying α-mannoside. The gold <b>nanoparticle</b> with mannose was readily water soluble, and showed pink colour.

By controlling the Gold <b>nanoparticle</b> density and selecting different interdigitated electrode distances and <b>nanoparticle</b> sizes, chemical sensors of different linearity and sensitivity can be obtained...|$|R
25|$|<b>Nanoparticles</b> {{can also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with DNA to perform genetic alterations. These are frequently monitored through the use of fluorescent materials, allowing scientists to judge if these tagged proteins have successfully been transmitted—for example green fluorescent protein, or GFP. <b>Nanoparticles</b> are significantly less cytotoxic than currently used organic methods, providing a more efficient method of monitoring genetic alternations. They also do not degrade or bleach with time, as organic dyes do. Suspensions of <b>nanoparticles</b> with the same size and shapes (mono-dispersed) with functional groups attached to their surfaces can also electrostatically bind to DNA, protecting them from several types of degradation. Because the fluorescence of these <b>nanoparticles</b> does not degrade, cellular localization can be tracked without the use of additional tagging, with GFPs or other methods. The 'unpacking' of the DNA can be detected in live cells using luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) technology.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{formation}} {{between a}} weak flexible polyelectrolyte chain and one positively charged <b>nanoparticle</b> in presence of explicit counterions and salt particles is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The influence of parameters {{such as the}} <b>nanoparticle</b> surface charge density, salt valency, and solution property such as the pH on the chain protonation/deprotonation process and monomer adsorption at the <b>nanoparticle</b> surface are systematically investigated. It is shown that the <b>nanoparticle</b> presence significantly modifies chain acid/base and polyelectrolyte conformational properties. The importance of the attractive electrostatic interactions between the chain and the <b>nanoparticle</b> clearly promotes the chain deprotonation leading, at high pH and <b>nanoparticle</b> charge density, to fully wrapped polyelectrolyte at the <b>nanoparticle</b> surface. When the <b>nanoparticle</b> bare charge is overcompensated by the polyelectrolyte charges, counterions and salt particles condense at {{the surface of the}} polyelectrolyte–nanoparticle complex to compensate for the excess of charges providing from the adsorbed polyelectrolyte chain. It is also [ [...] . ...|$|R
30|$|The phase {{behavior}} of nanofluid {{as a function}} of salinity and <b>nanoparticle</b> concentration was evaluated. Stability of nanofluid decreases exponentially with the increase in salinity and <b>nanoparticle</b> concentration in the same concentration. In addition to understanding the effect of temperature on nanofluids, different concentrations of <b>nanoparticle</b> dispersion were tested. The results show that in high temperatures, <b>nanoparticle</b> solutions become less stable with increasing salinity.|$|R

25|$|For example, {{one study}} {{reported}} that cube-shaped platinum <b>nanoparticles</b> with (100) facets displayed a fourfold increase in oxygen reduction activity compared to randomly faceted platinum <b>nanoparticles</b> of similar size. The authors concluded that the (111) facets of the randomly shaped <b>nanoparticles</b> bonded more strongly to sulfate ions than the (100) facets, {{reducing the number of}} catalytic sites open to oxygen molecules. The nanocubes they synthesized, in contrast, had almost exclusively (100) facets, which are known to interact with sulfate more weakly. As a result, a greater fraction of the surface area of those particles was available for the reduction of oxygen, boosting the catalyst’s oxygen reduction activity.|$|E
