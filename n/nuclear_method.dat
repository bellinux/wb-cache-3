40|$|Level Mixing Spectroscopy (LEMS) {{can be used}} to {{determine}} nuclear quadrupole moments. In this paper it is shown how LEMS can be applied to nuclei implanted in a cubic lattice. In this case the quadrupole interaction is due to electric field gradients produced by defects. The method has been illustrated by measuring quadrupole moments of Po 202 - 204 isomers produced in Pt-nat(C- 12, 4 n) and Pt-nat(C- 13, 5 n) reactions, the (natural) Platinum serving as a host material. The result could be analysed with the assumption of two different defect associated sites, making up for about 80 % of the total site population. The experimental ratio Q(Po- 202, 8 (+)) /Q(Po- 204, 8 (+)) is in agreement with the systematics in the lead region.

The system studied was the anodic oxidation of tanta-lum, and the oxide was sectioned by slow dissolution in concentrated HF almost saturated with NH 4 F; the 1 sO present {{was detected by}} bombarding the oxide with 3. 042 MeV protons and counting neutrons emitted in 1 sO (p,n) 18 F reaction.

40|$|Density is an {{important}} measure for hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement quality control. Traditionally, the nuclear gauge method is widely used in pavement density testing. However, some disadvantages of nuclear gauges (such as the handling, storage, and transportation of radioactive materials) have created the need of non-nuclear technology. This thesis evaluated the Pavement Quality Indicator (PQI) model 301, which was promised to be more efficient than the <b>nuclear</b> <b>method.</b> The PQI utilizes many electrical impedance principles by using the current going through the pavement to determine its density and moisture content. Test data were collected in the field during pavements, and cores {{were taken to the}} laboratory for further testing. A thorough investigation of calibration methods was also performed both in the lab, and on the field to improve the accuracy of the PQI’s results. Results showed that the PQI could be a better alternative to a nuclear gauge when the following benefits are considered: 1) economic savings, 2) faster data measurement, 3) no intense federal regulations, safety concerns, licensing and intense training, and 4) improved calibration techniques.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} behaviour {{of isolated}} nonmagnetic atoms Cd on ferromagnetic single crystal surfaces of Ni is presented. Using a <b>nuclear</b> <b>method,</b> the perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy PAC, atomic resolution is achieved {{making it possible}} to distinguish between probe atoms at various sites of a surface, i. e., in terraces, in at atomic steps, at kinks, or as adatoms. These different atomic surface sites have differing Ni coordination numbers, i. e., the number of Ni nearest neighbours. A correlation as a continuous nonlinear dependence with increasing magnetic hyperfine fields Bhf versus decreasing coordination number was found. Furthermore, experimental evidence is presented, that the induced s moments on the Cd isolated impurity is independent on the details of the surface symmetry but essentially determined only by the coordination number. Replacing step by step Ni atoms by Pd atoms with induced magnetic moments a similar behavour is observed. Monolayers of Pd on Ni form large unit cells which offer selected sites to the impurity. The possibility to create ordered structures of isolated impurities on a ferromagnetic surface, in particular of rare earth atoms, by taking advantage of selected sites in unit cells, will be discusse...|$|E
40|$|Starting from state-by-state {{calculations}} of exclusive {{rates of the}} ordinary muon capture (OMC), we evaluated total muon-capture rates {{for a set of}} light- and medium-weight nuclear isotopes. We employed a version of the proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA, for short) which uses as realistic nuclear forces the Bonn C-D one boson exchange potential. Special attention was paid on the percentage contribution to the total muon-capture rate of specific low-spin multipolarities resulting by summing over the corresponding multipole transitions. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>method</b> used offers the possibility of estimating separately the individual contributions to the total and partial rates of the polar-vector and axial-vector components of the weak interaction Hamiltonian for each accessible final state of the daughter nucleus. One of our main goals is to provide a reliable description of the charge changing transitions matrix elements entering the description of other similar semileptonic nuclear processes like the charged-current neutrino-nucleus reactions, the electron capture on nuclei, the single e̱ṯa̱-decay mode, etc., which play important role in currently interesting laboratory and astrophysical applications like the neutrino-detection through lepton- nucleus interaction probes, and neutrino-nucleosynthesis. Such results can be also be useful in various ongoing muon-capture experiments at PSI, Fermilab, JPARC and RCNP.

40|$|Conventional {{quality control}} of {{compaction}} during construction is currently {{based on an}} in-situ determination of dry unit weight and moisture content via nuclear procedures, but {{because this is a}} localised procedure, poor compaction can often occur. Moreover, with older compacted embankments where few or no records of the control done during construction are available, there is no existing methodology that can help practising engineers assess their post-construction condition. This means that the scope of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>method</b> renders it as inadequate and alternative methods should be considered. The use of shear wave velocity (Vs) surveys (i. e. MASW) to assess the quality of larger, previously compacted surface areas and depths seems to be a promising method. Furthermore, shear wave velocity can be readily related to the soil modulus, which is a variable commonly used in construction design. Fills are placed on, at, or near the OMC (optimum moisture content) so the compacted soil is in an unsaturated condition at the time of construction and therefore a field determination of Vs should also include the evaluation of matric suction (ua-uw). In this study, a field application at Penrith Lake Development Corporation (NSW, Australia) was investigated. A silty sand material collected from the site, was compacted and subjected to different confining pressures. In each specimen the Vs and (ua-uw) were measured with Bender elements and the filter paper method, respectively. The laboratory results showed that Vs trends together with (ua-uw) or moisture content, could effectively predict the compaction characteristics of the soil...|$|E
