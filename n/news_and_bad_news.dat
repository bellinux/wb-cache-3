40|$|We {{present a}} model in which some of the firm’s {{information}} (“new”) can be disclosed verifiably and some information (“type”) cannot, to show that some firms may voluntarily withhold good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> We describe an equilibrium in which high-type firms withhold good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> whereas low-type firms disclose good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Under some parameter values, this equilibrium exists when other more traditional equilibria are ruled out by standard equilibrium refinements.

40|$|In {{the model}} of an asset market with {{strategic}} interaction among traders, this paper proves that the occurrence of asset price overreaction and underreaction to new information depends on the proportion of conservatism traders, proportion of heuristic traders, degree of conservatism bias, degree of representativeness heuristic {{and the number of}} traders in the market. Specifically, the asset price overreacts to good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> underreacts to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> when the total representativeness heuristic minus the total conservatism bias in the market is greater than zero but less than one; otherwise, the asset price underreacts to good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> overreacts to <b>bad</b> <b>news...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{negative}} relation between returns and return volatility, {{referred to as}} the “leverage effect”, has been a puzzle in the finance literature since the 1970 s. Strategic disclosure of good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withholding of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> provides a potential explanation. Good news disclosures imply a positive share price response and a reduction in residual uncertainty; inferences of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> imply a negative share price response and a smaller reduction in residual uncertainty. We document that the leverage effect is stronger for firms in industries with greater return synchronicity, following the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and for firms in Canada relative to the U. S. These three patterns suggest that the leverage effect is stronger in environments in which strategic disclosure of good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withholding of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> is more likely to characterize disclosure decisions. Thus, the evidence is consistent with the effects of this disclosure strategy on uncertainty as an explanation for the {{negative relation}} between returns and return volatility. Does strategic disclosure explain the ‘leverage effect’? An empirical regularity is that returns are negatively related to return volatility. Black (1976) provided an early explanation for the phenomenon. As returns increase, market leverag...|$|R

50|$|Naturally {{regenerated}} {{trees in}} an understorey prior to harvesting constitute {{a classic case}} of good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Understorey white spruce is of particular importance in mixedwoods dominated by aspen, as in the B15, B18a, and B19a Sections of Manitoba, and elsewhere. Until {{the latter part of the}} last century, white spruce understorey was mostly viewed as money in the bank on a long-term, low interest deposit, with final yield to be realized after slow natural succession, but the resource became increasingly threatened with the intensification of harvesting of aspen. White spruce plantations on mixedwood sites proved expensive, risky, and generally unsuccessful. This prompted efforts to see what might be done about growing aspen and white spruce on the same landbase by protecting existing white spruce advance growth, leaving a range of viable crop trees during the first cut, then harvesting both hardwoods and spruce in the final cut. Information about the understorey component is critical to spruce management planning. The ability of then current harvesting technology and crews employed to provide adequate protection for white spruce understories was questioned by Brace and Bella. Specialized equipment and training, perhaps with financial incentives, may be needed to develop procedures that would confer the degree of protection needed for the system to be feasible. Effective understorey management planning requires more than improved mixedwood inventory.|$|E

30|$|On the {{positive}} side, some prior studies support that higher reporting frequency reduces information asymmetry and put analysts and traders {{on a more}} level playing field as insiders (Leftwich et al. 1981; Schipper 1981; Verrecchia 1990; Botosan and Harris 2000; Yee 2004; Butler et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2012). On the negative side, firms that report more frequently have better incentive to disclose selective information to the market—firms may {{be more willing to}} disclose good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> (Brown et al. 2009). In addition, the accounting quality of more frequent financial reports could be lower if short-term monitoring pressure induces more earnings management (Gigler et al. 2014). In this paper, we argue against the traditional view of higher reporting frequent being necessarily more positive. The results are often not obvious and depend on how the traders process the information.|$|R

50|$|In the draft, the Eagles traded down again, lining {{themselves}} {{up with two}} first-round picks in 2009. Training camp and the preseason were mixed with good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> On the negative side, All-Pro guard Shawn Andrews had a late-start to the preseason because of a personal battle with depression. Cornerback Lito Sheppard now looked like a third wheel in the secondary behind Samuel and Sheldon Brown, and vented his frustration. A contract dispute with star running back Brian Westbrook also looked to be another distraction until the team signed him to a three-year, $21 million extension. Philadelphia's biggest issue was the weak receiving corps. In the spring, the team was unsuccessful in acquiring a big name receiver, and the situation was exascerbated when number one receiver Kevin Curtis went down with a sports hernia in the preseason, while number two receiver Reggie Brown nursed a sore hamstring. No moves were made to fix the problem, and many experts considered the Eagles too weak at the position to go deep into the playoffs. However, 5'10 second round draft pick DeSean Jackson had a great preseason, and was named as a Week 1 starter for the Eagles at receiver. Quarterback Donovan McNabb also had a strong preseason, and finally looked fully recovered from his 2006 knee surgery. The rebuilt special teams unit impressed in the preseason, with draft picks Jackson and Quintin Demps returning a punt and a kick respectivelly for touchdowns in an exhibition win over the Patriots.|$|E

In response to a perceived need for further research into this area, an analysis of 60 UK chairman’s statements was conducted in order to test for possible determinants of readability variability. Results show the introduction to the chairman’s statement is systematically easier to read than other parts of the chairman’s statement. No evidence was found to support prior research that, rather than present accounting narratives objectively, managers use readability variability to emphasise good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> obfuscate <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> The thematic structures within the chairman’s statement were investigated to explore whether they were responsible for systematic patterns in the variability of annual report readability.

40|$|In this article, we use an {{experimental}} approach {{to examine the}} effect of reporting regimes on asset prices. We examine four different reporting regimes: the no recognition (NR) regime where no expected future cash flows are recognized; the full recognition (FR) regime where both the expected good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> expected <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> pertaining to the next period cash flows are recognized in current earnings; the good news recognition (GR) regime where only the expected good news pertaining to the next period cash flows are recognized in current earnings; <b>and</b> the <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> recognition (BR) regime where only the expected <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> pertaining to the next period cash flows are recognized in current earnings. We find that the NR, BR, and GR regimes are associated with more intense asset price bubbles than the FR regime. We also find that between the BR and GR regimes, the BR regime is associated with more intense asset price bubbles than the GR regime. Our findings shed insights about how biased (non-neutral) reporting regimes could affect the price formation process. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The purpose of share option grants is to align {{the interests of}} managers with those of shareholders. However, share option compensation may encourage opportunistic managerial behaviour aimed at maximising {{the value of their}} share options. Managers may artificially decrease share prices at the grant date which tends to be the value at which the exercise price is set. 			This study will examine whether the following four methods of depressing share prices are prevalent in the UK: 			 			Retrospectively choosing the date on which the option is granted (backdating); 			Pushing forward (delaying) the release of bad (good) news; 			Timing the option grant to occur before (after) the release of good (<b>bad)</b> news; <b>and</b> 			Using impression management to dampen good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> enhance <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> 			Backdating is suggested if the option grant date coincides with market lows significantly more often than would randomly be expected. The existence of significantly negative abnormal returns around grant dates suggests that managers either opportunistically time <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> disclosures (scheduled awards) to coincide with grant dates or time grant dates (unscheduled awards) with <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> disclosures.

In the model, firms smooth earnings via the costly and economically suboptimal intertemporal {{transfer of assets}} and liabilities. As a result, the firm's stock return follows a process that conforms to an EGARCH-like statistical model. The key idea is that real earnings management generates an unobservable cost, and the market has to infer the underlying wealth of the firm from the smoothed reported earnings series. This framework {{may help explain why}} asset returns underreact to good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> overreact to <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> while no news is always good news to the market.
