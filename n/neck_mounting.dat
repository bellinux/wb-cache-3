It typically presents as a painless, rapidly enlarging, dome-shaped red or purplish nodule in a sun-exposed area {{of the head and neck}} or upper extremities. Our understanding of MCC has increased dramatically over the last several years and the pathogenesis continues to be an area of active research. The etiology is likely multifactorial with immunosuppression, UV-induced skin damage, and viral factors contributing to the development of MCC. The recent discovery of Merkel cell polyomavirus has allowed for at least one aspect of disease development to be much better understood. In most cases, treatment consists of wide local excision with adjuvant radiation therapy. The role of chemotherapeutics is still being defined. The recent advancement of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of MCC has led to an explosion research into novel therapeutic agents and strategies. This review seeks to summarize the current body of literature regarding the pathogenesis of MCC and potential targets for future therapies.

40|$|Visual {{detection}} of standing oestrus {{has been the}} traditional method of selecting cows for AI. However, over time, the display of oestrous behaviour has decreased and labour costs and herd sizes have increased, making visual {{detection of}} oestrous behaviour less practical. Thus demand for new and automated systems for selecting cows for AI has increased world-wide. This thesis aims to improve the current knowledge of systems for selecting cattle for AI and their performance under conditions typical in the Australian production environment and identify requirements and opportunities for future systems. Many proposed automated systems for detecting ovulating cows suffer from {{a high proportion of}} false positive indications. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of inseminations following a false positive attention on primary measures of reproductive performance. A stochastic model was developed that simulates the reproductive process in a year-round calving dairy herd to assess effects of changes in specificity at various combinations of sensitivity and conception rate on herd reproductive measures of economic importance. The model is to the best of my knowledge the first computer model of herd reproductive performance to include specificity for detecting ovulating cows as a variable input and include a risk of conceptus loss following artificial inseminations in pregnant cows, and a distribution for the interval from a conceptus loss to next ovulation. The simulations showed that reductions in specificity for detecting ovulating cows not only increased the number of inseminations per calving but also prolonged the intervals from calving to establishment of a sustained pregnancy. This was seen as decreases in the 100 day in-calf rate (the proportion of cows with a positive pregnancy diagnosis to an insemination on or before 100 days since calving), and increases in the 200 day not in-calf rate (the proportion of cows with negative pregnancy diagnosis results to all inseminations on or before 200 days since calving â cows with a high chance of being culled for reproductive failure). Thus specificity of ovulation detection should be an important consideration when designing algorithms and selecting cutpoints in automated systems for detecting ovulating cows. In addition the model developed could be useful when determining optimal combinations of ovulation detection sensitivity and specificity when developing automated systems for selecting cows for AI. A controlled trial was conducted to determine whether a single measurement of vaginal electrical resistance using a commercially available probe (OvatecÂ® probe), can discriminate between dioestrus and oestrus in a group of beef heifers which had been treated to synchronise oestrus. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting oestrus heifers was determined at different diagnostic cutpoints. Single measurements of vaginal electrical resistance using the OvatecÂ® probe were found to be highly discriminatory between oestrus and dioestrus and lower values of vaginal electrical resistance at the time of AI were associated with an increased chance of conception when oestrus status was unknown. In a subsequent study the temporal changes in vaginal electrical resistance relative to time of ovulation using the same probe was determined in dairy cattle. The mean vaginal electrical resistance of all cows studied varied with time from ovulation but no conclusion was able to be made regarding the ability to predict time of ovulation in individual animals. A prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate and compare the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of a <b>neck</b> <b>mounted</b> 2 -hourly activity meter system for detecting ovulating cows using 5 different activity alert algorithms in two paddock-based dairy herds with different animal environments and breeding systems. Concurrently, a second prospective observational study was conducted to assess the distribution of intervals from onset and end of increased activity to time of ovulation in a paddock-based pasture-fed dairy herd. The studies showed that monitoring cow activity with neck-mounted 2 -hourly activity meters in paddock-based dairy cows in two diverse management systems can detect a high proportion of cows about to ovulate and provide a good indication of when ovulation is likely to occur. However, the specificities and positive predictive values using the algorithms assessed may be lower than desirable. Finally, a prospective observational study was conducted to assess the potential for improving pregnancy rates to AI if the time of ovulation could be predicted with more certainty. The variations in AI to ovulation interval and the proportions of inseminations resulting in pregnancy for different AI to ovulation intervals were observed on two Australian commercial dairy farms with different reproductive management practices. There was substantial variation in the intervals from AI to ovulation within and between the two study herds and the AI to ovulation interval was associated with significant differences in pregnancy rate. In addition, the most frequent AI to ovulation interval observed in the study did not correspond to the interval with the highest observed pregnancy rate. Thus it is possible pregnancy rates may be improved with methods that allow better insemination timing relative to ovulation. In the same study cows on one of the farms were fitted with <b>neck</b> <b>mounted</b> 2 -hourly activity meters. The interval from onset of increased cow activity to time of AI was associated with pregnancy rates, suggesting that activity monitoring may be useful for identifying the optimal time to inseminate. This thesis demonstrates that inseminations after a false positive attention can have substantial negative effects on economically important measures of herd reproductive performance. It indicates that vaginal electrical resistance monitoring has the potential to be used for selecting cows for AI if this parameter can be monitored in a practical way and that 2 -hourly activity monitoring can detect a high proportion of ovulating cows and provide a useful indication of when ovulation will occur in paddock based dairy herds. This thesis also indicates that improving methods of selecting cows for AI to allow better insemination timing relative to ovulation could potentially increase pregnancy rates in some herds. Finally, this thesis provides a foundation on which to form subsequent studies to aid the development of improved systems for selecting cows for AI...|$|R
40|$|The current {{prototype}} of the JANUS robot consists of two arms and a <b>neck</b> with two <b>mounted</b> color cameras. Calibrating JANUS means to find the geometric relationships between each of these components and the reference coordinate system of the robot. The calibration procedure that we present in this report is completely vision-based: the relationships between each camera and the neck and between each arm and the neck are determined using visual measurements, {{which leads to a}} low-cost and automatic setup. For this purpose, we developed two main algorithms. The first one implements a non-linear optimization method using a quaternions formulation for camera calibration from 2 D to 3 D point or line correspondences. The second one is a real-time camera pose estimation method based on the iterative use of a paraperspective camera model. Using the results of calibration we show how we solve some classical computational stereo vision and 3 D reconstruction problems.

6000|$|And so {{much for}} a raw opinion on Japanese infantry. The cavalry were having a picnic {{on the other side}} of the parade-ground--circling right and left by sections, trying to do {{something}} with a troop, and so forth. I would fain believe that the gentlemen I saw were recruits. But they wore all their arms, and their officers were just as clever as themselves. Half of them were in white fatigue-dress and flat cap,--and wore half-boots of brown leather with short hunting-spurs and black straps; no chains. They carried carbine and sword--the sword fixed to the man, and the carbine slung over the back. No martingales, but breastplates and crupper, a huge, heavy saddle, with single hide-girth, over two numdahs, completed the equipment which a thirteen-hand pony, all mane and tail, was trying to get rid of. When you thrust a two-pound bit and bridoon into a small pony's mouth, you hurt his feelings. When the riders wear, as did my friends, white worsted gloves, they cannot take a proper hold of the reins. When they ride with both hands, sitting well on the <b>mount's</b> <b>neck,</b> knuckles level with its ears and the stirrup leathers as short as they can be, the chances of the pony getting rid of the rider are manifestly increased. Never have I seen such a wild dream of equitation as the Tokio parade-ground showed. Do you remember the picture in Alice in Wonderland, just before Alice found the Lion and the Unicorn; when she met the armed men coming through the woods? I thought of that, and I thought of the White Knight in the same classic, and I laughed aloud. Here were a set of very fair ponies, sure-footed as goats, mostly entires, and full of go. Under Japanese weights they would have made very thorough mounted infantry. And here was this blindly imitative nation trying to turn them into heavy cavalry. As long as the little beasts were gravely trotting in circles they did not mind their work. But when it came to slashing at the Turk's head they objected very much indeed. I affiliated myself to a section who, armed with long wooden swords, were enjoying some Turk's-heading. Out started a pony at the gentlest of canters, while the rider bundled all the reins into one hand, and held his sword like a lance. Then the pony shied a little shy, shook his shaggy head, and began to passage round the Turk's head. There was no pressure of knee or rein to tell him what was wanted. The man on top began kicking with the spurs from shoulder to rump, and shaking up the ironmongery in the poor brute's mouth. The pony could neither rear, nor kick, nor buck; but it shook itself free of the incubus who slid off. Three times I saw this happen. The catastrophe didn't rise to the dignity of a fall. It was the blundering collapse of incompetence plus worsted gloves, two-handed riding, and a haystack of equipment. Very often the pony went at the post, and the man delivered a back-handed cut at the Turk's head which nearly brought him out of his world-too-wide saddle. Again and again this solemn performance was repeated. I can honestly say that the ponies are very willing to break rank and leave their companions, which is what an English troop-horse fails in; but I fancy this is more due to the urgent private affairs of the pony than any skill in training. The troops charged once or twice in a terrifying canter. When the men wished to stop they leaned back and tugged, and the pony put his head to the ground, and bored all he knew. They charged me, but I was merciful, and forebore to empty half the saddles, as I assuredly could have done by throwing up my arms and yelling [...] "Hi!" [...] The saddest thing of all was the painful conscientiousness displayed by all the performers in the circus. They had to turn these rats into cavalry. They knew nothing about riding, and what they did know was wrong; but the rats must be made troop-horses. Why wouldn't the scheme work? There was a patient, pathetic wonder on the faces of the men that made me long to take one of them in my arms and try to explain things to him--bridles, for instance, and the futility of hanging on by the spurs. Just when the parade was over, and the troops were ambling off, Providence sent diagonally across the parade-ground, at a gallop, a big, rawboned man on a lathy-red American horse. The brute cracked his nostrils, and switched his flag abroad, and romped across the plain, while his rider dropped one hand and sat still, swaying lightly from the hips. The two served to scale the surroundings. Some one really ought to tell the Mikado that ponies were never intended for dragoons.|$|R
