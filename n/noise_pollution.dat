5|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>pollution</b> from {{anthropogenic}} {{activities is}} another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E

The project also had a City Environmental Quality Review, which analyzed the ferry's effects on open space, urban design, natural resources, nearby transportation, <b>noise</b> <b>pollution,</b> air quality, the environment, and public health.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} in Elvebakken was somewhat controversial in Alta, {{especially as the}} airport would be located {{so close to the}} town center, potentially causing <b>noise</b> <b>pollution.</b> An alternative at Sokkelma was considered, but this was discarded because the surrounding mountains prevented good landing conditions. The decision to build Alta Airport was made in 1961, followed by additional expropriation of land. Construction was carried out simultaneously with that of Banak and Kirkenes Airport, HÃ¸ybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports.|$|E

5|$|The Avianca Flight 52 {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK-2016). The {{aircraft was}} manufactured in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca from Pan Am in 1977. By {{the time of the}} crash, the aircraft was 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours. The 707 was equipped with four JT3D-3B engines modified with a hush kit to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>pollution.</b> Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a five-percent fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the hush kit along with an additional five-percent overburn due to the age of the aircraft. Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft's autopilot, including the altitude hold function.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival {{supersonic transport}} programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested that}} opposition to Concorde on grounds of <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E

5|$|The ground has {{attracted}} criticism from local residents. A parish council meeting in October 2001 revealed that Arsenal players {{had not been}} involved with local initiatives, despite claims during its planning phase that the ground would allow the club to develop links with the local community. Shenley Primary School reportedly failed to receive any visits from players despite repeated requests. The club responded by pointing to initiatives by its Ladies team to organise competitions at local grounds. Plans to develop new buildings and road links to the site were challenged by residents four years later; they believed {{it would lead to}} increased traffic and <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> in the area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a quarter}} of their funding went on {{repairing}} damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted {{a report to the}} NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the project for the development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and <b>noise</b> <b>pollution,</b> and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of Popular Mechanics, in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether there should be a ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the UllevÃ¥l Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the Ring Line, noise shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{problems}} such as <b>noise</b> and air <b>pollution</b> are increasingly catching peopleâs attention in recent years owing to the industrialization and urbanization all over the world. Therefore {{it is important to}} develop effective methods to present information on <b>noise</b> and air <b>pollution</b> to the public. One feasible approach is to carry out prediction based on traffic data and make <b>noise</b> and <b>pollution</b> maps. GIS is a powerful tool for prediction since its spatial analysis function could be used in analysis and calculation. In addition the available GIS platforms also provide visualization functions to display the analysis results in variety of forms, in both 2 D and 3 D. This thesis uses <b>noise</b> and air <b>pollution</b> as examples to study how to predict <b>noise</b> and <b>pollution</b> from traffic data and how to visualize the predicted pollution information in 3 D {{with the help of the}} existing visualization technology. Therefore, the thesis has two objectives. The first objective is focused on prediction of <b>noise</b> and air <b>pollution</b> using existing prediction models based on vehicle speed and traffic volume data. The original spatial road network dataset with traffic information was integrated with GIS and analysis and calculations were carried out. Road Traffic Noise-Nordic Prediction Method is used for predicting traffic noise while ARTEMIS model and OSPM model are applied for traffic air pollution. All analysis and calculations were carried out on virtual receiver points generated on ground surface and over building facades at different heights. The second objective is focused on 3 D visualization of the predicted traffic <b>noise</b> and air <b>pollution</b> in ArcScene, Google Earth as well as X 3 D respectively. In ArcScene the virtual receiver points were visualized in their actual position with different colors representing <b>noise</b> or air <b>pollution</b> level. Then KML files were created from the point shapefiles and imported into Google Earth to show the <b>noise</b> and air <b>pollution</b> level in the virtual city available in Google Earth. Finally one layer of point shapefile was selected as an example to give the 3 D scene in X 3 D. The selected layer of points was first interpolated into a continuous surface and converted into contours. Three types of models were developed in this part. First is to visualize contours in 3 D using both colors and heights to show the <b>noise</b> or air <b>pollution</b> levels. Next the interpolated surface was segmented into scattered cells displayed also in colors and heights both representing pollution intensity. The last one is using 3 D bars to show <b>noise</b> or air <b>pollution</b> in colors and lengths. The prediction results shows that the either <b>noise</b> or air <b>pollution</b> in the north part of central Stockholm is much more serious than in south part and the most polluted area appear along the highways. In the same area the pollution levels vary in different heights. The 3 D visualization in ArcScene and Google Earth could clearly present the differences. However, so far the visualization in X 3 D only gives 2 D information in 3 D, which means although the 3 D scenes were created, the height only <b>noise</b> or air <b>pollution</b> on the specific height could be represented. The real 3 D representing is still need to be studied. Â VisuCit...|$|R

5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of â Steller's sea cow and the â Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. <b>Noise</b> <b>pollution,</b> for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Paul City Council {{decided in}} late 1974 to support I-35E, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} influence of proponents. R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council to go along with it. The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying <b>noise</b> <b>pollution,</b> air pollution, vibrations, and slope stability as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street.|$|E
