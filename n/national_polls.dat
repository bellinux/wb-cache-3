5|$|Notre Dame {{nonetheless}} {{opened the}} season with a 31–7 victory over heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team's leading passer had over the entire 1963 season. Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against Purdue and then Air Force and UCLA. Notre Dame rose to first place in the <b>national</b> <b>polls</b> following a 40–0 win over Navy in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against USC, who won 20–17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod Sherman. The loss unseated Notre Dame from the top ranking in the <b>national</b> <b>polls,</b> but the team still won the MacArthur Trophy, a championship awarded by the National Football Foundation.|$|E

As a result, the Big Ten set a record for most matchups between two top 10 opponents in conference play with a total of 9 such games. Michigan played in six with a 3–3 record and Indiana played in five, winning all of them. Michigan State, Minnesota and Ohio State also played in top 10 games.|$|E
5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in <b>national</b> <b>polls,</b> often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E

In 1973, Parseghian had a perfect season and won a second national championship, topped off by a 24–23 win over Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. Both teams were undefeated going into the game, but Alabama had held the top spot in the <b>national</b> <b>polls.</b> Parseghian was named coach of the year after the season by Football News.|$|E

The next week, Tech suffered an even closer loss, losing to Syracuse in triple overtime despite a record performance from Tech quarterback Bryan Randall, who accumulated 504passing yards and fivetouchdown passes.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in <b>national</b> <b>polls</b> by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E

His performance helped the Longhorns rise at one point to the #1 ranking in the <b>national</b> <b>polls,</b> although UT lost to Texas Tech University and finished ranked third in the BCS standings. In 2008 McCoy set school records for most career touchdown passes, most touchdown passes in a season, most total touchdowns by a Texas player, most career wins, and most career passing yards. In addition to setting passing records, McCoy led the team with 561 yards rushing and eleven rushing touchdowns, establishing {{a reputation as a}} dual threat quarterback.

5|$|On August 29, 2008, McCain {{revealed}} Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as {{his surprise}} choice for running mate. McCain {{was only the}} second U.S. major-party presidential nominee (after Walter Mondale) to select a woman for his running mate and the first Republican to do so; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if McCain had been elected. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees, respectively, at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead of Obama in <b>national</b> <b>polls</b> following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him. However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly, and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the music {{produced}} by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by {{the ease with which}} record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, the Bandwagon was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based <b>national</b> <b>polls,</b> it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{win in the}} ACC Championship Game, {{its first}} against Florida State in postseason play, brought it to an 11–2 record, while Florida State's loss dropped it to a 9–4 record. Virginia Tech became the first team in college {{football}} history to win 11 consecutive games after losing its first two of the season, {{and it was the}} first team in conference history to defeat nine different ACC teams in one season. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer became only the second coach in ACC history to win four conference titles in seven years. The first to do so was Florida State's Bobby Bowden. Both teams' standings in the <b>national</b> <b>polls</b> were affected by the game. In the BCS poll, the Seminoles fell from 21st to out of the poll, while Virginia Tech rose from 15th to 13th. In the AP Poll, Tech rose to 12th, while Florida State fell to 23rd.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and <b>national</b> <b>polls</b> never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E

40|$|Conservation and {{improvement}} strategies {{should be based}} on the association between genetic and phenotypic characteristics. The objective of this work was to characterize five native Brazilian cattle breeds (Caracu, Crioulo Lageano, Curraleiro, <b>National</b> <b>Polled</b> and Pantaneiro) and two commercial breeds (Holstein and Nellore) using RAPD technique to estimate genetic distances and variability between and within breeds. Genetic relationships were investigated using 22 primers which generated 122 polymorphic bands. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that most of the genetic variation lay among individuals within populations. The genetic variabilities between pairs of breeds were statistically significant. The smallest genetic divergence was between Crioulo Lageano and Curraleiro. The <b>National</b> <b>Polled,</b> although historically considered to be of Bos taurus aquitanicus origin, similar to the Caracu, was grouped together with the other breeds of Bos taurus ibericus origin. Generally, the individual breeds formed distinct clusters except the <b>National</b> <b>Polled.</b> The RAPD technique was capable to distinguish genetically between the breeds studied; the Caracu, Crioulo Lageano, Curraleiro and Pantaneiro may be considered distinct genetic entities thereby proving the uniqueness of the populations; the <b>National</b> <b>Polled</b> {{has not been able to}} re-establish itself after its decline in the 1950 s, thereby losing its genetic identity. 200...|$|R
