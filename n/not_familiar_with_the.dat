5|$|The entire film {{received}} an advanced midnight screening on November 16, 2013 at the Shinjuku Wald 9 cinema in Shinjuku, Tokyo {{ahead of its}} November 23 release. During its release weekend, the film mostly attracted a young audience ranging from teenagers to those in their early thirties. Among this demographic, males were outnumbered by females {{at a ratio of}} 2:3 which suggested that the original game itself was mostly popular among women. In addition a significant number of patrons who were <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game were also present during the release weekend.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Tsukasa Masuko, with arrangements by Masuko and Tatsuya Nishiwaki. Masuko considered Shin Megami Tensei {{to be an}} experimental work: {{it was the first}} time he had created music for the Super Famicom, so he was <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> console's specifications. During composition, he needed to check the specifications repeatedly to see what he could do within the hardware limitations. For the PC Engine port, the music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E
5|$|Planning began a {{month before}} the {{original}} Dragon Quest was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry. The artwork that was used {{as the basis for the}} characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, Dragon Quest III.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> comic book {{when he got the}} part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E
5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of Nottingham, which seems unlikely to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule. However, {{it is also possible that}} Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that give the impression of the book's being aimed at an English audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E

25|$|Normally the {{resulting}} block is written within {{a square of}} the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block; therefore someone <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> scripts may mistake Hangul text for Hanja or Chinese text.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the things}} that cause the most {{confusion}} for people that are <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game are the Holding the Ball, Dropping the Ball, and Throwing rules. Confusion arises because a player being tackled is not allowed to hold onto the ball, but is not allowed to throw it either.|$|E
25|$|The Neapolitan Mastiff {{has a low}} {{activity}} level, even as a puppy. Visits to dog parks {{should be}} minimal, considering they can be aggressive to other dogs they are <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> ideal environment for this breed is in its home with a large yard and a fence five or six feet high.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{bystander}} intervenes {{may have}} to do with their familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs. If the bystander is familiar with the environment, {{they are more likely to}} know where to get help, where the exits are, etc. Bystanders who are in an environment in which they are <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surroundings are less likely to give help in an emergency situation.|$|E

25|$|Polish historian, Julian Kwiek, who has {{published}} existing Polish documents regarding the Kraków event {{stated that he}} is <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> documents quoted by Cichopek from outside the scientific literature. He stated that one death is confirmed in all historical sources, therefore it is questionable whether this event truly falls under {{the definition of a}} pogrom, even though most other sources refer to the event as such.|$|E
25|$|Early texts {{suggest that}} Gautama was <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{dominant}} religious teachings {{of his time}} until he left on his religious quest, which {{is said to have}} been motivated by existential concern for the human condition. The state of the Shakya clan was not a monarchy and seems to have been structured either as an oligarchy, or as a form of republic. The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the śramanic Jain and Buddhist sanghas, where monarchies tended toward Vedic Brahmanism.|$|E
25|$|In 1435, Elijah of Ferrara recounted meeting an Ethiopian Jew in Jerusalem in {{a letter}} to his children. The man told him of the ongoing {{conflict}} of his independent nation with the Christian Habesha; he relayed some of the principals of his faith, which, Ferrara concluded, balanced between Karaite and Rabbinical Judaism. His people were <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Talmud and did not observe Hanukkah, but their canon contained the book of Esther and they had an oral interpretation of the Torah. Ferrara further recorded that they had their own language, that the journey from their land lasted six months, and that the biblical Gozan river was found within their borders.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between continuity and gag-a-day strip may be blurred: a continuous story {{may still be}} delivered in the gag-a-day format. In fact, Lynn Johnston recommends it for story strips, to keep the readership and engage new audience which may be <b>not</b> very <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> background of the story.|$|R
