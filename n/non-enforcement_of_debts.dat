40|$|The {{economic}} freedom index (EFI) {{is one of}} several cross-country yardsticks that incorporate dimensions of progress and well-being that go beyond what conventional economic indicators tell us. It is a composite of 21 indicators that include “personal choice, protection of private property, and freedom of exchange. ” It {{is one of the few}} measures where the Philippines ranks higher than most of its neighbors; the Philippines was in fact 29 th among 123 countries rated for 1999, while neighboring Taiwan was only 38 th, South Korea 43 rd, Thailand 53 rd, Malaysia 57 th, and Indonesia 72 nd. This paper begins with a review of the methodological considerations in index construction such as the use of value weights and linear versus nonlinear aggregation techniques. Outcomes for the Philippines in each of the EFI’s seven areas of concern (together with their respective components) are then closely examined in terms of the validity and timeliness of the data used and the relevance of the indicators themselves in measuring “{{economic freedom}}. ” It is found that the ranking of the Philippines would even improve if the raw data on some concerns were updated. The review ends with a brief discussion of the “more comprehensive” economic freedom index and notes that the most significant and perhaps most controversial among the new index components is that on labor market flexibility, where <b>non-enforcement</b> <b>of</b> minimum wage legislation is considered a plus, while <b>non-enforcement</b> <b>of</b> all other laws is considered a minus.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} judicial review and presidential <b>non-enforcement</b> <b>of</b> statutory law. Defenders <b>of</b> <b>non-enforcement</b> regularly argue that the justification for judicial review that prevailed {{at the time of}} the founding also justifies the president in declining to enforce unconstitutional laws. The argument is unsound. This Article shows that there is essentially no historical evidence, from ratification through the first decade under the Constitution, in support <b>of</b> a <b>non-enforcement</b> power. It also shows that the framers repeatedly made statements inconsistent with the supposition that the president could refuse to enforce laws he deemed unconstitutional. In contrast, during this same period the historical record contains hundreds of discussions of judicial review. The Article then advances an explanation of why there was considerable support for judicial review but none for non-enforcement. Judicial review followed from what that generation called “expounding” the law, which meant explaining it. A court was supposed to explain the law in the course of deciding a case. Explaining the law involved examining all potentially relevant legal rules and showing how they fit together to deductively justify the judgment reached. In that context, if a statute could not be reconciled with the constitution, it would not be given effect. Since the president neither decided cases nor expounded the law, he did not enjoy a power <b>of</b> <b>non-enforcement</b> parallel to the power of judicial review...|$|R

Using essentially the representation theory of SU(2) we determine the most general SU(2) -equivariant gauge field on M×SF 2. This {{allows us to}} reduce the Yang–Mills theory on M×SF 2 down to an Abelian Higgs-type model over M. Depending on the enforcement (or <b>non-enforcement)</b> <b>of</b> a “constraint” term, the latter may (or may not) lead to the standard critically-coupled Abelian Higgs model in the commutative limit, SF 2 →S 2.

Rejecting the extant majority position that state decisions not to enforce existing property laws are categorically immune from takings liability is not to advocate that persons impacted by such decisions should be automatically or even regularly entitled to the Takings Clause’s constitutional remedy. Rather, it simply suggests that courts should {{resist the temptation to}} formulaically and categorically prohibit non-enforcement takings claims in favor of assessing those claims on the merits...|$|R
