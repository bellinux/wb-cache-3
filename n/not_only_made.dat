Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>made</b> Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.|$|E
5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels to be Run Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>made</b> the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, which <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>made</b> the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than {{buildings in the}} past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E

5|$|In 424 BC, Perdiccas {{began to}} play a {{prominent}} role in the Peloponnesian War by aiding the Spartan general Brasidas in convincing Athenian allies in Thrace to defect and ally with Sparta. After failing to convince Perdiccas II to make peace with Arrhabaeus of Lynkestis (a small region of Upper Macedonia), Brasidas agreed to aid the Macedonian fight against Arrhabaeus, although he expressed his concerns about leaving his Chalcidian allies to their own devices against Athens, as well as the fearsome Illyrian reinforcements arriving on the side of Arrhabaeus. The massive combined force commanded by Arrhabaeus apparently caused the army of Perdiccas II to flee in haste before the battle began, which enraged the Spartans under Brasidas, who proceeded to snatch pieces of the Macedonian baggage train left unprotected. Subsequently, Perdiccas II <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>made</b> peace with Athens but switched sides, blocking Peloponnesian reinforcements from reaching Brasidas via Thessaly. The treaty offered Athens economic concessions, but it also guaranteed internal stability in Macedonia since Arrhabaeus and other domestic detractors were convinced to lay down their arms and accept Perdiccas II as their suzerain lord.|$|E

25|$|Scates' {{interest}} in volleyball began when his college football coach required his players {{to try out}} for a volleyball team to stay in shape during the off season.

Hoxha tolerated no dissent {{and thousands of}} Albanians were executed, sent to state labor camps or exiled to remote areas for work.

Isolating itself completely {{from the rest of the}} world, Albania embarked on a massive defense program, including the amassing of a huge arsenal of weapons and the construction of more than 700,000 concrete military bunkers for a country with only 3 million citizens.|$|E

25|$|In post colonial India, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was {{the first}} – {{at the time the}} only – party to take {{advantage}} of visual movie media. Actors and writers of guerrilla theatre, who were inspired by the ideologies of Periyar, brought the philosophies of Tamil nationalism and anti-Brahminism to celluloid media. The movies <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>made</b> direct references to the independent Dravida Nadu that its leaders preached for but also at many times displayed party symbols within the movie. Murasoli Maran, former central minister from DMK, considered that the DMK movies reflected the faces of both the past (demonstrating the rich language and culture of Tamils) and the future (with social justice). The DMK films espoused Dravidian ideologies through use of lengthy dialogues in its initial movies. Nevertheless, as the party's political aspirations grew, the movies based on Dravidian social reformation themes were replaced with stories that would enhance star popularity.|$|E
25|$|Filipino American Theater {{ranges from}} {{topics such as}} Filipino/Filipino-American history to modern Filipino issues.

Filipino theater is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>made</b> up of colonial influences but also pre-colonial and post-colonial influences which gives the audience {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the colonialism within the country. Contemporary issues are also a huge trend within the community since the audience can relate to it more. Some common theatrical plays done by Filipino theater focuses on the historical background of the Philippines and the relationship between the Philippines and the United States. Some Filipino American productions provides personal, societal and cultural perspective from the past to now. The history of the Filipino American theater starts with indigenous tribes and their rituals then the colonization of Spain and their influences which then leads to the influences of the Filipino American War. Filipino American productions ranges from original playwrights to adaptations being done in the Philippines.|$|E
