Sensors and sensor networks are the fundamental technologies, which are deployed to collect a number of health-related signals, such as ECG and heartbeat. A typical solution for remote {{health monitoring}} is utilising a smart phone as a <b>networking</b> <b>gateway,</b> which gathers the sensor signals, with or without further processing, and then transmits to an associated medical centre or data processing server. Another key concept is the Body Area Network (BAN), which is composed {{of a number of}} interconnected wearable sensing devices to collect a series of biomedical parameters, such as ECG, EEG, blood pressure, and body temperature. Such sensor nodes are interconnected via various communication protocols such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, and WiFi. However, sensor nodes are often designed with limited memory and computing capacity; thus, sensor data are typically transmitted to another processing server, where mobile phone is commonly adopted.|$|E

40|$|ASEE 2007 IEEE 802. 11 is a {{wireless}} LAN technology {{based on a}} cellular architecture where the system is subdivided into cells. Each cell is called Basic Service Set (BSS) which is controlled by a base station called Accesses Point (AP). Access points are connected through Distribution System (DS), typically Ethernet or wireless itself. Ethernet LAN Technology uses CSMA/CD protocol; these protocols are very effective when medium is not heavily loaded. In this paper, the Wi-Fi MAC transmit and receive protocol is implemented with Verilog HDL. The individual modules of the Wifi MAC Layer Transmit and Receive Protocol confirming to the IEEE 802. 11 specification have been designed. The whole Wi-Fi Mac Layer Transmitter and Receiver are integrated. The various blocks and integrated blocks are simulated and functionality of each block is verified with test benches. Simulation results verify the correct functions of the designed Wi-Fi MAC transmit and receive protocol. The logic synthesis of the designed Wi-Fi MAC Layer Transmitter and Receiver is performed with Xilinx Synthesis Tools. Wi-Fi allows LANs (Local Area Networks) to be deployed without cabling for client devices, typically reducing the costs of network deployment and expansion. Spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. A Wi-Fi enabled device such as a PC, game console, mobile phone, MP 3 player or PDA can connect to the Internet when within range of {{a wireless}} network connected to the Internet. Wi-Fi installations can provide a secure computer <b>networking</b> <b>gateway,</b> firewall, DHCP server, intrusion detection system, and other functions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Internet of Things (IoT) is {{the result}} of many {{different}} enabling technologies such as embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, big-data, etc. used to gather, process, infer, and transmit data. Integrating all these technologies requires a comprehensive and holistic research effort to address all the challenges imposed by these technologies, especially for sensing and delivering information from physical world to cloud-hosted services. In this paper, we outline the most important issues related to standardization efforts, mobility of objects, <b>networking</b> and <b>gateway</b> access, and QoS support. In particular, we describe a novel IoT network architecture that integrates Software Defined Networking (SDN) and the Object Management Group’s Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware.

Our delay tolerant <b>networking</b> (DTN) <b>gateway</b> dynamically detects disruptions in connectivity and buffers telemetry data until connectivity is reestablished. When {{the connection is}} resumed, all buffered data is transmitted automatically in order to backfill any gaps in the telemetry stream. A DTN gateway may operate as a standalone device with multiple DTN client applications, or as a network of mobile DTN gateways which will perform multi-hop ad-hoc routing to deliver telemetry data across the telemetry network system (TmNS). Our DTN gateway also provides conventional IP routing and forwarding capabilities, including support for standard dynamic routing protocols, {{eliminating the need for}} a stand-alone IP router on the test article (TA).

5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{computer}} <b>networking,</b> an application-level <b>gateway</b> (also known as ALG or application layer gateway) consists of a security component that augments a firewall or NAT employed in a computer network. It allows customized NAT traversal filters to be plugged into the gateway to support address and port translation for certain application layer [...] "control/data" [...] protocols such as FTP, BitTorrent, SIP, RTSP, file transfer in IM applications, etc. In order for these protocols to work through NAT or a firewall, either the application has to know about an address/port number combination that allows incoming packets, or the NAT has to monitor the control traffic and open up port mappings (firewall pinhole) dynamically as required. Legitimate application data can thus be passed through the security checks of the firewall or NAT that would have otherwise restricted the traffic for not meeting its limited filter criteria.|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{architecture}} for interconnecting WSNs and the Internet {{is based}} on treating a WSN as a separate entity from the Internet. Our approach to unifying sensor networks with the Internet is instead to decouple {{the relationship between the}} API-enforced database view and the gateway, making the gateway more general by introducing application-level overlay <b>networking</b> into the <b>gateway.</b> In our approach, sensor network packets, rather than being stopped at the gateway, are instead encapsulated into IP packets, and then directed from the gateway to any number of interested applications and services residing remotely on the Internet. The basic encapsulation procedure forms an application overlay of the sensor network over the Internet. Instead of being restricted by a database API, all applications will have direct access to a networking API that allows them to query and interact with the sensor network directly via a largely transparent gateway. Applications that still desire a database view of the WSN can still query the WSN through a database API. Thus, this approach of transforming the gateway into primarily an application-level packet relay will continue to be compatible with current approaches such as TinyDB, while encouraging proliferation of new applications and services...|$|R
40|$|Early stage timing {{analysis}} on CAN traditionally relies on simulation and worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis. Despite recent progresses, {{it will be}} shown than the latter technique remains pessimistic especially in complex <b>networking</b> architectures with <b>gateways</b> and heterogeneous communication stacks. Indeed, there are many cases of practical interest where no exact WCRT analyses are available, and merely upper bounds on the response times can be derived, {{on the basis of}} which unnecessary conservative design choices may be made. Simulation, on the other hand, does not provide any guarantees per se and should only be used along with a rigorous methodology in the context of critical networks. In this presentation, we argue for the use of quantiles of the response time distribution as performance metrics providing an adjustable trade-off between safety and resource usage optimization. We explain how the exact value of the quantile to consider should be chosen wrt the criticality of the frames, and how to calibrate the simulation lengths accordingly. Also, we highlight necessary conditions that must be met (e. g., response times above the quantiles must not be correlated) and how to verify them...|$|R
