25|$|Tribe {{played with}} great success for Victoria {{immediately}} after the Second World War, taking 86 wickets at 19.25 in just 13 games and playing in three Tests under Donald Bradman in the 1946-47 Ashes series. An all-rounder, he bowled slow left-arm orthodox and chinaman and batted doggedly as a left-hander, mostly at number six or seven, compiling 7 centuries in his first class career. Despite his prolific record in first-class cricket, he was unsuccessful during the series against England and was dropped from the national team. In the Fifth Test in Sydney Ray Lindwall took 109/9, but thought that Tribe had bowled better, but with <b>no</b> <b>luck</b> to return 153/0.|$|E

25|$|At that time, {{rumors that}} Hansen would begin {{pursuing}} a vulnerable franchise {{to relocate to}} Seattle began making the rounds. Most of the discussion centered on the Sacramento Kings, a struggling franchise that {{had been trying to}} put together a plan to replace the aging Sleep Train Arena, then called the Power Balance Pavilion, for years with <b>no</b> <b>luck.</b> While Hansen had not spoken in public about his desires or pursuits for a specific team, the rumors were rampant enough that Think Big Sacramento, a community action group created by Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson to develop solutions for the Kings, composed an open letter to Hansen asking him not to pursue the city's team. Meanwhile, negotiations between McGinn, Constantine, and Hansen continued on development of a memorandum of understanding that would lay out the relationship for a public-private partnership on the new arena.|$|E
25|$|Between 22 and 25 October, {{the task}} force was {{reinforced}} by a fresh regiment of 1,460 men imported to Lat Sen from Military Region 3, GM 32. At 1800 hours 25 October, two Royalist companies were forwarded to occupy a mountaintop position atop Phou Theung. They reported reaching {{the base of the}} mountain at 2100 hours without encountering resistance. An hour later, PAVN tanks were reported moving southwards on Phou Theung. Radio contact with the companies was lost 15 minutes later, at 2215 hours. The Royalists made an emergency call for gunship support, with <b>no</b> <b>luck.</b> At 2230 hours, Communist 130mm field gun shells began to land on GM 32. Over the next five hours, all but one 75mm recoilless rifle in the heavy weapons company were destroyed in the ongoing bombardment. Then GM 32 was attacked by the PAVN 924th Battalion of the 866th Regiment, backed by tanks and armored cars. The armored force overran GM 32 in the predawn hours. The Royalists were in full retreat by 0530 hours on 26 October. When it regrouped on 31 October, GM 32 had suffered 140 dead, 190 wounded, and 53 missing.|$|E
25|$|Belafonte {{was born}} Harold George Bellanfanti Jr. at Lying-in Hospital on March 1, 1927, in Harlem, New York, {{the son of}} Melvine (née Love), a {{housekeeper}} of Jamaican descent, and Harold George Bellanfanti Sr., a Martiniquan {{who worked as a}} chef. His mother was born in Jamaica, the child of a Scottish white mother and a black father. His father also was born in Jamaica, the child of a black mother and Dutch Jewish father of Sephardi origins. Belafonte has described his grandfather, whom he never met, as “a white Dutch Jew who drifted over to the islands after chasing gold and diamonds, with <b>no</b> <b>luck</b> at all”. From 1932 to 1940, he lived with one of his grandmothers in her native country of Jamaica. When he returned to New York City, he attended George Washington High School after which he joined the Navy and served during World War II. In the 1940s, he was working as a janitor's assistant in NYC when a tenant gave him, as a gratuity, two tickets to see the American Negro Theater. He {{fell in love with the}} art form and also met Sidney Poitier. The financially struggling pair regularly purchased a single seat to local plays, trading places in between acts, after informing the other about the progression of the play. At the end of the 1940s, he took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York with the influential German director Erwin Piscator alongside Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Walter Matthau, Bea Arthur, and Sidney Poitier, while performing with the American Negro Theatre. He subsequently received a Tony Award for his participation in the Broadway revue John Murray Anderson's Almanac.|$|E

25|$|The gloom {{increased}} during tea {{and play}} was delayed {{regardless of the}} vocal protests of the 32,000 strong crowd, with some being arrested {{as they tried to}} invade the ground. When play resumed Amiss and Cowdrey – his 114th and final Test – came out to open. They stayed out long enough for Amiss to be out lbw to a Lillee swinger for his third successive duck and stumps were drawn at 15/1. In the morning Walker had Cowdrey caught behind off a ball that bounced surprisingly, but Lillee pulled up with a trapped nerve in his foot and was unable to play {{for the rest of the}} Test. With their two strike bowlers removed and the damp spot drying out Australia struggled and Denness and Edrich took full advantage, taking the score from 18/2 to 167/3 with a third wicket stand of 149 and overtaking the home side's total with ease. There were some difficult chances off the England captain, but it was the otherwise impeccable Edrich who was out for 70 edging Walker to Ian Chappell at first slip. The vice-captain was replaced by Keith Fletcher who had suffered so much in the series with Denness, but now proved that they were attractive batsmen when not faced by blistering pace and England were 273/3 by the end of the day. Walker bowled manfully and Mallett tried to stop the flow of runs, but when Walters and Chappell were brought on for long spells the game was up. Denness was almost run out on 94 and bought up his hundred with a leg-glance that just missed Marsh's gloves, but rode his luck well. He was only the fourth England captain to make a Test hundred in Australia after Andrew Stoddart's 173 in 1894–95, Archie MacLaren's 116 in 1901–02 and Peter May's 113 in 1958–59. When Walker finally had him out caught and bowled the next day he had made 188 in 492 minutes with 17 fours, still the highest Test century by an England captain in Australia. Denness and Fletcher had added 192 for the fourth wicket took take the score to 359/4, the first time England had passed 300 in the series. Fletcher made his first Ashes century in 333 minutes with only seven fours, though he and Greig added 100 runs in 71 minutes as the big South African started thumping the tired bowlers around the deserted ground. By tea the third new ball had been seen off and England were 496/4, a lead of 344. Discussion of when Denness would declare were rendered null and void when the bullish Walker ran through the England batting as the tourists lost 6 wickets for 33 runs after tea. The tall Tasmanian had already taken 3/131, but produced a spell of 5/12 as Greig was caught off a mistimed drive for 89 off 94 balls, followed later in the over by Fletcher for 146. Old was bowled by a shooter from Dymock, who bowled just as long and as well, but with <b>no</b> <b>luck.</b> Alan Knott and Geoff Arnold were caught behind glancing the ball and Underwood was bowled to dismiss England for 529, only their second score over 500 in Australia since Bodyline in 1932–33. Walker returned to the pavilion with figures of 8/143 off 42.2 overs, his best analysis in Tests.|$|E

500|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879, one of {{thirteen}} Greenbackers elected in 1878. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party included the Greenbackers in their caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation. [...] Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated.

Keith {{continues}} to question Mindy O’Dell, citing inconsistencies in his testimony. Mindy says that the other man arguing in her room was the Dean. She also says that Hank {{could have been the}} murderer, as she was not in the area {{at the time of the}} murder. Keith enters Veronica’s criminology class and arrests Hank. Keith questions him as well, and he says that Mindy set him up with the blood on his clothes, noting that he went to a convenience store before driving home. However, Keith puts him in a cell, where he is visited by Tim Foyle, and Hank tells him to find the bug that was placed on his phone.

500|$|Losing {{the court}} case proved devastating for Lucan. It had cost him an {{estimated}} £20,000, and by late 1974 his financial position was dire. As he drank more heavily and started chain-smoking, his friends began to worry. [...] In drunken conversations {{with some of}} them, including Aspinall's mother, Lady Osborne, and her son, Lucan discussed murdering his wife. Greville Howard later gave {{a statement to the}} police describing how Lucan had talked of how killing his wife might save him from bankruptcy, how her body might be disposed of in the Solent and how he [...] "would never be caught". Lucan borrowed £4,000 from his mother and asked Marcia Tucker for a loan of £100,000. Having <b>no</b> <b>luck</b> there, he wrote to Tucker's son, explaining how he wished to [...] "buy" [...] his children from Veronica; the money was not forthcoming. He turned to his friends and acquaintances, asking anyone plausible to loan him money to fund his gambling addiction. The financier James Goldsmith guaranteed a £5,000 overdraft for him, which for years remained unpaid. Lucan also applied to the discreet Edgware Trust. On request, he supplied details of his income, which was apparently around £12,000 a year from various family trusts. He was required to provide a surety and received only £3,000 of the £5,000 he asked for. Much to their managers' consternation, his four bank accounts were overdrawn; Coutts, £2,841; Lloyds, £4,379; National Westminster, £1,290; Midland, £5,667. Even though by then he was playing for much lower stakes than had previously been the case, Lucan's gambling remained completely out of control. Ranson (1994) estimates that between September and October 1974 alone, the earl ran up debts of around £50,000.|$|E
