40|$|DE 102006017279 A 1 UPAB: 20071108 NOVELTY - The device has a <b>neck</b> <b>microphone</b> (24) {{to record}} {{breathing}} of a patient. An analyzer analyzes {{a set of}} sampling values to detect an energy value for the sampling values corresponding to preset time intervals of the breathing, where the energy value describes an energy in the preset time interval in the breathing. An evaluation device detects an occurrence of hypopnea by comparing the energy value with a variable reference value depending on the patient. The analyzer analyzes the sampling values corresponding to the time interval of the breathing {{from a range of}} 100 to 500 milliseconds. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for detecting hypopnea using sampling values, which describe a breathing of a patient (2) a computer program with a program code for executing the method for detecting hypopnea. USE - Used for detecting hypopnea of a patient. ADVANTAGE - The device permits to detect the occurrence of hypopnea by comparing the energy value with the variable reference value depending on the patient in an automated and reliable manner...|$|E
40|$|Aspiration {{pneumonia}} {{caused by}} postapoplectic pharyngeal dysphagia {{is a frequent}} and potentially lethal complication of stroke. Diagnosis is currently established by video endoscopy or videofluoroscopy. Analysis of swallowing sounds as a bedside method may allow earlier diagnosis and improve follow-up. Swallowing sounds recorded by a <b>neck</b> <b>microphone</b> from patients of three groups were compared: Patients with stroke and dysphagia, patients with stroke but without dysphagia and a control group. Analysis included the sound dimensions frequency, duration and volume in correlation {{with the results of}} a video endoscopy. A total of 66 patients and controls were included into the trial: 24 patients with stroke and dysphagia, 18 with stroke but without dysphagia, and 24 controls. The total signal duration was significantly increased for patients with dysphagia against controls (978. 0 ms vs. 616. 6 ms, respectively). Comparison between both stroke groups (with and without dysphagia) missed significance. A signal length of more than one second always indicated severe dysphagia in the dataset. The trial demonstrates significant difference between healthy controls and patients with postapoplectic dysphagia. A trend towards according differences between stroke patients with and without dysphagia was not significant. Prospective studies will therefore have to show the value of acoustic analysis as a screening method...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{available}} accessories for the D600 is a stereo headset with earplugs on a <b>neck</b> string, a <b>microphone</b> {{on one of the}} earplug cables and a detachable phone holder which attaches to its bottom. It can be also used for the handsfree function of the mobile phone.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA telemetric device {{has been}} {{designed}} which allows simulta neous though independent recording of the vocalizations of diffe rent individuals within the same social group. Each animal carries around the <b>neck</b> a small <b>microphone</b> (P. M.) adjusted on a definite frequency. The receivers are tuners. The records {{can be made by}} multi-track recorders on magnetic tape or on paper recorder. Such a technique allows a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of vocal behaviour to be made for each sex, age- and status categories, in response to specific stimulating situations...|$|R
5000|$|Four {{injection}} molded {{semi-rigid plastic}} pieces constitute the circa 6 in tall figure which features printed accents on the dress and hand-painted details on hands, face and <b>neck,</b> hair, sunglasses, <b>microphone</b> and inserts in the trouser legs. Molded as one piece, {{the upper body}} of the figure including a static head is the most prominent part. The right arm with hand and microphone is also molded as one piece and attached to the upper body piece at the right shoulder by a snap-in joint with a square connector which keeps the right arm of the figure in a static position relative to the upper body piece. The lower body piece consists of the pelvic area and both legs molded as one piece. At the waist of the figure, {{the upper and lower}} body pieces are connected to each other by a flexible metal spring joint, as are the left arm piece and the upper body piece at the left shoulder. Both threaded connectors of the spring joint at the left shoulder of the figure are recessed, hiding the spring mechanism of the joint. The threaded connector of the lower body piece protrudes upward but the spring joint mechanism at the waist of the figure is concealed by a connector deeply recessed under the waist and belt portion of the jumpsuit which constitutes the bottom portion of the upper body piece.|$|R
