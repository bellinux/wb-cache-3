5|$|The first fur test allowed Sulley {{to run an}} {{obstacle}} course. Results were <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory,</b> as such objects would catch and stretch out the fur due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur would go through the objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory,</b> leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E

25|$|M.S.325 C3 No. 01 (Works no. 4120) {{was flown}} {{for the first}} time by company Chief Test Pilot Michael Détroyat early in 1933 from the factory site, Vèlizy-Villacoublay. The first test results were <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory</b> as tail {{buffeting}} was encountered leading to modifications that included lowering the tailplane and adding wing root fairings.|$|E

25|$|The Dzungars had conquered and subjugated the Uyghurs {{during the}} Dzungar conquest of Altishahr, after being invited by the Afaqi Khoja to invade.

25|$|Soon after Iqbal's {{death in}} April 1938, a {{committee}} was formed that was {{presided over by}} Chaudhary Mohammed Hussain. The initial round of the designs submitted by distinguished architects was <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory.</b> The committee suggested to innovate a new combination rather than following a specific school of architecture. The final design, thus, broke away from Mughal tradition and comprised a combination of Afghan and Moorish architecture.|$|E

25|$|The Tu-123 {{served with}} Soviet Air Force {{intelligence}} units {{stationed in the}} western border military districts until 1979. It had (theoretically) the range to cover all of Central and Western Europe, and performed well in training exercises. However, the expense of operating an expendable system was <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory.</b> This concern led to a project to develop the Tu-139 Yastreb 2, a reusable version which could land on unprepared airstrips, {{but it was never}} put into production.|$|E
25|$|In April 1978, Transport Minister Otto Lang {{announced}} {{a plan to}} provide daily scheduled airline service between the airport, Ottawa and Montreal, using de Havilland Dash 7 STOL planes. The Government of Canada would invest $5 million in improvements at the airport including a covered moving pedestrian sidewalk linking the airport with Lake Shore Boulevard. The plan was rejected by Toronto City Council, and the Canadian Transport Commission turned down the plan stating that the airport's services were <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory</b> and required upgrading.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimated}} horizontal {{speed was}} <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory</b> {{and in the}} next development, Project VII, the jet intakes were situated in the wing roots. Further improvements over Project VI were a narrower fuselage and a changed pilot's canopy. In order to improve the rate of climb, a Walter HWK 109-509 hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket was built in to give supplementary thrust. A complete mockup was built and all construction and assembly plans were finished, but the aircraft was not accepted by the Reich Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium, RLM).|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} summer of 1943 it was clear the UBS was too great a {{challenge}} and could delay the entire program.

It was clear this was <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory,</b> but with no other option available in the short term, an order for 40 preproduction Eagle Mark I systems was placed for delivery in August 1944.|$|E
25|$|The first locks {{built on}} the Toulouse plain by Pierre-Paul Riquet were {{experimental}} and were <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory.</b> They consisted of rectangular lock with wooden stilts as foundations for the side walls. This form did not properly restrain the lateral material when the lock was empty. They then collapsed on themselves. He redefined {{the shape of his}} locks to rounded side walls, thicker, and more resistant to the lateral pressure of the earth. The dimensions of the locks were then large enough for the time. Because of these rounded forms, the architecture of the locks in the Canal du Midi is called Baroque style.|$|E
25|$|Nina {{decided that}} it was time she re-discovered her lost {{memories}} and {{came to the conclusion that}} the only person who could help her was her sister, Anna Williams. Anna meets with Nina soon after. However, Nina's memories and hatred instinctively returned, and they rapidly engaged in a gun battle. The duel lasted for days and the two later agreed to meet at The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 and finish their battle. The two promised that only one would walk away from the coming battle, however, when Nina won, she refused to take Anna's life as their fight was <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory.</b>|$|E

25|$|IMT is {{occasionally}} used {{in clinical}} practice, but its role is not clear. After systematically reviewing the evidence base for IMT, the United States Preventive Services Task Force found no support for its routine use in stratification of risk for people at intermediate cardiovascular risk. However, in 2003 the European Society of Hypertension–European Society of Cardiology {{guidelines for the}} management of arterial hypertension recommended the use of IMT measurements in high-risk patients to help identify target organ damage and in 2010 the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology advocated the use of IMT on intermediate risk patients if usual risk classification was <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1930 the {{aircraft}} was tested and {{evaluated by the}} Polish Air Force. Thanks to wing mechanization (flats and slats), it had short take-off and landing. It was very advanced combination of high-lift devices in world's aviation those days. A competing designs Lublin R-X and PWS-5t2, evaluated yet in 1929, were <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory,</b> so the Polish Air Force ordered 60 PZL.2. The aircraft {{took part in the}} second contest for an army co-operation aircraft in July 1931. In spite of advanced high-lift devices and all-duralumin construction of the PZL.2, the air force decided to choose a simpler, cheaper and quite satisfactory Lublin R-XIII plane.|$|E
25|$|In Tekken 5, Nina {{decides to}} make contact with Anna in hopes of {{restoring}} her memory, but their meeting triggers Nina's lost feelings of hostility towards her sister, and she immediately opens fire. Anna retaliates, and the reunion descends into a gunfight which lasts for days. The sisters eventually reach a stalemate and agree to settle things for good and a portion of their battle {{can be seen in the}} introductory sequence of the game. During their battle in the tournament, both sisters agreed that only one would walk away from their battle alive. However, when Nina defeats Anna, she refuses to take Anna's life as she felt the fight was <b>not</b> <b>satisfactory.</b>|$|E
