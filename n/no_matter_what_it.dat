25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> took, and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier {{that was supposed to}} hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how hard she works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E
500|$|According to {{baseball}} historian John Thorn, 1839 {{is the year}} Adams became a baseball player. In an 1896 interview in The Sporting News, Adams said that [...] "soon after going to New York I began to play base ball just for exercise, {{with a number of}} other young medical men." [...] Starting in 1840, he was a player with the New York Base Ball Club. This team began play five years earlier than the New York Knickerbockers, who are credited in several baseball histories as pioneering the modern version of baseball. Adams played an early form of the game, but Thorn writes that he [...] "understood [...] to be baseball, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was called".|$|E
500|$|Talk of a {{potential}} sequel to The Terminator arose soon after its release, but several outstanding issues precluded such a production. There were technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial {{in the creation of}} the T-1000 Terminator. The production of James Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss provided the proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve the technical concerns. Perhaps more serious were the intellectual-property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation, which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel, and Carolco Pictures. Given that Hemdale was then experiencing financial problems, Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Mario Kassar, head of Carolco, to bid for the rights: [...] "I reminded Mario that this is something that we've been looking for four years, and that it should be him that should go all-out, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> takes to make this deal." [...] Carolco eventually paid Hemdale $5million for the franchise in 1990, resolving the legal gridlock.|$|E

500|$|Supporters of {{the series}} assert {{that it is a}} worthy {{interpretation}} of the book and that most of the changes were necessary. Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee, who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person, and Boyens once noted that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what,</b> <b>it</b> is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarize the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, [...] "Sure, it's not really The Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie." [...] Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the films serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of Arda (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming the whole story of The Lord of the Rings was probably impossible. This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of [...] "faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, Gomez, one of the executive producers on 13 Reasons Why, defended the series. She stated: [...] "We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what author Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's {{what we wanted to}} do," [...] Gomez told Associated Press. [...] "We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, backlash is gonna come <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what.</b> <b>It's</b> not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing." ...|$|R

2500|$|The young {{writer was}} however careful {{to clarify that}} the {{existence}} he took into consideration was not the life of [...] "instincts and personal idiosyncrasies", which he believed determined {{the lives of many}} humans, but that of a distinct set comprising [...] "personalities". He described [...] "personalities" [...] as characterized by both [...] "purpose" [...] and [...] "a much more complicated and dangerous alchemy". This differentiation, George Călinescu believed, echoed Ionescu's metaphor of man, seen as [...] "the only animal who can fail at living", and the duck, who [...] "shall remain a duck <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> does". According to Eliade, the purpose of personalities is infinity: [...] "consciously and gloriously bringing [...] to waste, into as many skies as possible, continuously fulfilling and polishing oneself, seeking ascent and not circumference." ...|$|E
2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained {{to remind me of}} the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E
