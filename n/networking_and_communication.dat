40|$|This article only {{focuses on}} an {{overview}} of the Hotel E-readiness model and model design for tourism in Southern Thailand. “The convergence of information technology (IT) and communications technology (CT) ” will be an important part of these technological innovations. The global economy has been turbulent during the last several years, and governments and enterprises are doing everything possible to inject momentum and effectuate sustainable growth. All member countries of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), aims to be ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by December 2015, have come to realize that an integrated ICT technology will enhance the competitiveness and creativity of their economies and fuel the sustainable growth of the global economy. The role that information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technologies (ICTs) can play to support economic growth, especially on tourism, has never drawn so much attention and research. According to Networked Readiness Index (NRI), Thailand has made improvement in NRI, edging up from 77 th to 74 th place in 2013 and from 74 th to 67 th place to the latest measurement released by the World Economic Forum in 2014 and ranked 3 out of 10 countries of ASEAN members.
