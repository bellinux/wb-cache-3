5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's <b>northern</b> <b>pintail.</b> Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, <b>northern</b> <b>pintail</b> has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's pintail, A. a. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>pintail</b> {{has a large}} range, {{estimated}} at , and a population {{estimated at}} 5.3–5.4 million individuals. It is therefore not believed to meet the IUCN Red List threshold criterion of a population decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations, and is evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>pintail</b> is {{a popular}} species for game {{shooting}} because of its speed, agility, and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. Although one of the world's most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.|$|E
40|$|Natural and {{anthropogenic}} Iberian wetlands {{in southern}} Europe {{are well known}} for supporting large numbers of migratory Palaearctic waterbirds each winter. However, information on the geographical origin of dabbling ducks overwintering in these wetlands is scarce and mostly limited to data from ringing recoveries. Here, we used intrinsic isotopic markers to determine the geographical origin {{of male and female}} <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> Anas acuta and Eurasian Teal Anas crecca in Extremadura, inland Iberia, a key site for overwintering dabbling ducks. Additionally, we fitted six <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> with GPS-GSM tags to complement the data derived from stable isotope analysis. Most (> 70 %) first calendar-year <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> were assigned to regions above 55 °N, flying 2600 – 5600 km from their main natal regions to Extremadura. Mean values of d 2 Hf varied significantly between male and female <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails,</b> suggesting that the sexes had different geographical origins. Data from tagged adult <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> supported the isotopic data, one male flying more than 5000 km to the coast of the Pechora Sea (Russia). Most (> 70 %) first calendar-year Eurasian Teal were assigned to the region between 48 ° and 60 °N, travelling 1500 – 4500 km to arrive in Extremadura. Male and female Eurasian Teal showed marginal differences in mean values of d 2 Hf. In migratory dabbling ducks, pairing typically occurs on the wintering grounds, and ducks in their first winter can breed the following spring. For <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails,</b> pair formation in Extremadura could occur between individuals with different geographical origins, which could contribute to the genetic variability of their offsprin...|$|R

5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the <b>northern</b> <b>pintail,</b> horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|Waterfowl, rails, {{and some}} colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility {{of these species}} is {{greatest}} during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American wigeon (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within their diets include: <b>northern</b> <b>pintail</b> (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).|$|E

5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that <b>northern</b> <b>pintail</b> and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, tundra swans, mallards, American black ducks and <b>northern</b> <b>pintail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the <b>northern</b> <b>pintail,</b> leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
50|$|Although mallards, <b>northern</b> <b>pintails,</b> {{and wood}} ducks {{are the most}} {{numerous}} waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and American Widgeon are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present, though less common.|$|R

5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>pintail's</b> {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise {{a wider range}} of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.|$|R
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>pintail</b> is a bird of open {{wetlands}} which nests on the ground, often {{some distance}} from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also {{had a significant impact}} on numbers. Nevertheless, owed to the huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, <b>northern</b> <b>pintail,</b> water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMigration and {{population}} genetic data for <b>northern</b> <b>pintails</b> (Anas acuta) and phylogenetic analysis of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses from this host in Alaska suggest that <b>northern</b> <b>pintails</b> {{are involved in}} ongoing intercontinental transmission of avian influenza. Here, we further refine this conclusion through phylogenetic analyses which demonstrate that detection of foreign lineage gene segments is spatially dependent and consistent through time. Our results show detection of foreign lineage gene segments to be most likely at sample locations on the Alaska Peninsula and least likely along the Southern Alaska Coast. Asian lineages detected at four gene segments persisted across years, suggesting maintenance in avian hosts that migrate to Alaska each year from Asia or in hosts that remain in Alaska throughout the year. Alternatively, live viruses may persist in the environment and re-infect birds in subsequent seasons...|$|R
40|$|I studied {{nutrient}} reserves, digestive organs, molt intensity, diets, {{and seasonal}} changes in food {{resources available to}} postbreeding adult male <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> (Anas acuta) and Cinnamon Teal (Anas cyanoptera) in marshes near Great Salt Lake, Utah. Total lipid and protein reserves of <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> were lower during the flightless period than before or after. For Cinnamon Teal, total protein was lowest during the flightless period, and total lipid showed a similar trend. Total mineral did not differ among plumage classes in either species. Use of nutrient reserves in these species may be an endogenous rhythm in response to increased predation risk or unpredictable food resources while flightless. Digestive organ metrics of <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> generally were lower while flightless than before or after, apparently due to decreased dietary consumption. Cinnamon Teal digestive organ metrics changed little from preflightless to flightless stages, but generally increased while postflightless. Changes in Cinnamon Teal digestive organs {{may be related to}} increased dietary intake or increased dietary fiber consumption. Total molt intensity in these species was generally high before and during wing molt, and decreased during the postflightless period. Mathematically weighting total molt scores produced results similar to those obtained without weighting, but selection of body/feather regions is critical to obtaining unbiased estimates. Changes in relative availability of plant and animal foods during July and August were marked. Animal foods made up 96 % of total foods measured in the study area during early July, but plant foods comprised 95 % of available foods by late August. Changes in abundances of food resources are probably an important determinant of diet selection in postbreeding adult ducks and ducklings in marshes near Great Salt Lake. Diets of postbreeding adult male <b>Northern</b> <b>Pintails</b> and Cinnamon Teal did not differ between species, but did among flight classes. Changes in use of food items and in use of animal and plant foods were consistent with changes in relative abundances of food resources. Postbreeding adult males of these species apparently foraged opportunistically...|$|R
