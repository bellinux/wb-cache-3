5|$|After resigning from Selznick International, Cooper went to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in June 1937. Cooper's most {{successful}} film at MGM was War Eagles. The film was postponed during World War II, and Cooper {{returned to the}} Air Force. The film was abandoned, however, and <b>never</b> <b>finished.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} 1965 victory, he <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> {{the race in}} Le Mans. In 1966, his Ford GT40 (shared with Innes Ireland) {{suffered}} an engine failure. A year later, he drove a Porsche 907 with Gerhard Mitter until their camshaft failed.|$|E

5|$|The {{dearth of}} {{artefacts}} recovered from Buckton Castle, {{and the lack}} of finely finished stonework, might indicate that the site was <b>never</b> <b>finished,</b> however the re-cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy of abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Although he <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> {{the other}} works {{intended}} to comprise Scenes from a Military Life, Balzac {{returned to the}} people and politics of Les Chouans in later works. Corentin reappears in his 1841 novel Une Ténébreuse Affaire (A Murky Business), and Hulot is featured in 1843's La Muse du département (The Provincial Muse). Later novels mention additional royalist uprisings, connecting them thematically to Les Chouans.|$|E
5|$|Brian Ellerbe {{assumed the}} title of interim coach less than five months after {{becoming}} an assistant coach. He was named full-time coach following the 25–9 (11–5) 1997–98 season in which he led the team to victories over Iowa, Minnesota and Purdue to capture the Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament championship. His subsequent teams <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> better than seventh in the conference.|$|E

5|$|I think everybody's enjoyed {{doing their}} own thing. Sharon and Caroline are young mothers, they have young children. Our {{mother and father}} were really were great parents and they hope to be as good a mother as mine, but Sharon's making her own record and will {{hopefully}} release it at some point. But we (the band) <b>never</b> <b>finished,</b> we'll keep it open.|$|E
5|$|In the 1480s, Leonardo {{received}} two very important commissions and commenced another {{work that was}} of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were <b>never</b> <b>finished,</b> and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.|$|E
5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was <b>never</b> <b>finished,</b> and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E
50|$|Though never making another {{legitimate}} {{challenge for}} the league championship, Ethnikos remained consistently competitive during the 1970s, <b>never</b> <b>finishing</b> outside of the top 10.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Clarke {{spent some}} time writing war histories. Until his {{retirement}} from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. The document was never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. Seven Assignments recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It was not his first attempt at a book. In 1925 Clarke had found a publisher for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was <b>never</b> <b>finished.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{supported}} {{the development of}} the sciences, particularly cartography; he hired a personal cartographer (Karol de Perthees) even before his election as king. A plan he initiated to map the entire territory of the Commonwealth, however, was <b>never</b> <b>finished.</b> At the Royal Castle in Warsaw, he organized an astronomical observatory and supported astronomers Jan Śniadecki and Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt. He also sponsored historical studies, including the collection, cataloging and copying of historical manuscripts. He encouraged publications of biographies of famous Polish historical figures, and sponsored their paintings and sculptures.|$|E
5|$|His The Method of Sociology first {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books published {{in the same year}} (1952): Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology (1965).|$|E

60|$|There {{the letter}} broke off, the playful affection {{of the last}} words making it almost more painful {{to think that the}} fond hand would <b>never</b> <b>finish</b> the sentence.|$|R
5|$|In 751 Ruler Z {{erected a}} stela that was <b>never</b> <b>finished,</b> paired with another with the {{portrait}} of a queen. A hieroglyphic stairway mentions someone called B'olon K'awiil at about the same time. B'olon K'awiil was king by 771 when he raised two stelae and he was mentioned at Toniná in 789. Sites to the north of Calakmul showed a reduction in its influence at this time, with new architectural styles influenced by sites further north in the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a {{favourite}} {{architect of}} Catherine's. Like Bullant, {{he became a}} more fantastical designer with time. Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau. In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France, a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine. His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> or were later substantially altered.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, {{although}} they <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly {{after the death of}} Roy Kilner in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.|$|E
5000|$|De Morga {{closed his}} {{inventory}} list {{by stating that}} there were [...] "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would <b>never</b> <b>finish,</b> nor have sufficient paper for it." ...|$|R

5|$|The club's {{return to}} the First Division was not {{immediately}} successful. Under Leslie Knighton, the club <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> better than ninth, and in 1923–24 came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone. Arsenal did no better the following season, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time, being seven points clear of the relegation places), which {{was the last straw}} for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925, and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager, Herbert Chapman in his place.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Purdue, he met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics. According to the couple, {{there was no}} real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement, except that it occurred while Armstrong was working at the NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, they moved into a house in Antelope Valley. Janet <b>never</b> <b>finished</b> her degree, a fact she regretted later in life.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Charles Stuart (born Stewart; December 3, 1755– July 9, 1828) was an American painter from Rhode Island who {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of America's foremost portraitists. His best known work is the unfinished portrait of George Washington that is {{sometimes referred to as}} The Athenaeum, begun in 1796 and <b>never</b> <b>finished.</b> Stuart retained the portrait and used it to paint 130 copies which he sold for $100 each. The image of George Washington featured in the painting has appeared on the United States one-dollar bill {{for more than a century}} and on various U.S. postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.|$|E
