40|$|Manuscripts {{should be}} typed double spaced {{on one side}} of a sheet only, with margins of about 2. 5 cm on each side of each page. B. Consecutive <b>Numbering</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parts</b> All {{manuscript}} pages, footnotes, equations, and references should be labeled in consecutive numerical order. Illustrations and tables should be cited in text in numerical order. See Section IV-G of this guide. C. Manuscript Formats See copies of the publications for examples of proper paper formats and requirements for the types of papers accepted for each publication (i. e., Full Papers, Letters, Short Papers, etc.). Full length papers generally consist of the title, byline, author affiliation, footnote (including any financial support acknowledgment), index terms, abstract, nomenclature if present, introduction, body, conclusions, reference list, list of figures and table captions, and original figures and tables for reproduction. A paper may also include appendixes, a glossary of symbols, and an acknowledgment of nonfinancial support. The abstract should be limited to 50 – 200 words and should concisely state what was done, how it was done, principal results, and their significance. The abstract will appear later in various abstracts journals and should contain the most critical information of the paper. E. References A numbered list of references must be provided {{at the end of the}} paper as a separate page or pages of the manuscript. The list should be arranged in the order of citation in text, not in alphabetical order. List only one reference per reference number. Each reference number should be enclosed by square brackets. In text, citations of references may be given simply as “in [1] [...] . ”, rather than as “in reference [1] [...] . ”. Similarly, it is not necessary to mention the authors of a reference unless the mention is relevant to the text. It is almost never useful to give dates of references in text. These will usually be deleted by Staff Editors if included. Footnotes or other words and phrases that are not part of the reference format do not belong on the reference list. Phrases such as “For example, ” should not introduce references in the list, but should instead be given in parentheses in text, followed by the reference number, i. e., “For example, see [5]. ” Sample correct formats for various types of references are as follows...|$|E

Summary: “We study pairs and m-tuples of compositions of a positive integer n with parts restricted to a subset P of positive integers. We obtain some exact enumeration results for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tuples of such compositions {{having the same}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b> Under the uniform probability model, we obtain the asymptotics for the probability that two or, more generally, m randomly and independently chosen compositions of n have the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b> For a large class of compositions, we show how a nice interplay between complex analysis and probability theory allows to get full asymptotics for this probability. Our results extend an earlier work of Bóna and Knopfmacher. While we restrict our attention to compositions, our approach is also of interest for tuples of other combinatorial structures having the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b> ...|$|R
