5000|$|These {{insects are}} {{attracted}} {{to the release of}} volatile compounds produced by injured palm trees. The larvae burrow through the hearts of palms, and their feeding can potentially kill an infested palm or serve as an avenue for secondary infections of bacterial disease. It is considered an important pest of cultivated coconut, date and oil palms, attacking thirty-five different species in twelve different families. It has also been documented as an occasional pest of sugar cane. This insect serves as vector for the Bursaphelenchus cocophilus nematode, cause of Red Ring <b>Nematode</b> <b>disease</b> in coconuts. By the time one observes symptoms, the palm is usually already dead. Weevils are infected while feeding as adults or larvae, but only female weevils carry a large internal infestation around their oviducts and are capable of transmitting the nematode during oviposition. Females are capable of laying as many as 693 eggs. Eggs will hatch in three - five days, and spend seven to eight weeks as larvae, feeding on the heart of the palm. They will emerge from the heart of the palm to pupate in a cocoon woven from palm fibers either in the boot of palm-leaf petioles, or in leaf debris {{at the base of the}} palm. Pupation can take from one to three weeks. Adults will live from five to eight weeks.|$|E

By soaking in the MiASB dsRNA solution, the hatching of RNAi treated eggs was reduced by 60 % compared to negative control and by 64 % compared to untreated control. Mortality of RNAi treated second stage juvenile (J 2) was 8. 6 times higher than that of negative control and 26 times higher than the untreated control. Inoculating the RNAi treated egg masses and J 2 to tomato seedlings showed the pathogencity was significantly reduced.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{important}} objectives of the goals of Millennium Development Goals is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Sufficient nourishment for the whole population of the world is one of the challenges of the present era. According to an estimate plant parasitic nematodes are causing much more damage annually compared to insect pests. A crop yield loss due to these tiny unseen pests in various countries is enormous. They caused projected yield loss of 12. 3 % ($ 157 billion dollars) worldwide. Out of which $ 40. 3 million is reported from India. Farmers/growers identified insect pests, and other constraints as production problems but overlooked plant parasitic <b>nematodes.</b> <b>Nematode</b> <b>diseases</b> are difficult to control because of their hidden nature and hence, more often overlooked. Plant parasitic nematodes not only cause damage individually but form disease-complexes with other micro-organism and increased the crop loss. Also the symptoms of nematode damage are not specific, resemble with the symptoms of other pathogens and abiotic stresses such as water and mineral deficiency. Future agricultural growth must come from productivity growth to address the persistent problems of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. Recommended measures against <b>nematode</b> <b>diseases</b> include use of clean nematode free planting material, resistant varieties, and crop rotations to suppress nematode infestation. Integrated nematode management can be promoted through farmers-nematologists interactions, local production of bio-control agents and strict chemical pesticide regulations.
