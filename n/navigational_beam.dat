50|$|Radio {{navigation}} (<b>navigational</b> <b>beam)</b> {{systems are}} based on the transmission of pulsed radio beams that are detected by aircraft. R. J. Dippy devised the GEE (also called AMES Type 7000) radio navigation system at TRE, where it was developed into a powerful instrument for increasing the accuracy of bombing raids.|$|E
50|$|As {{a member}} of a Resistance group during the Second World War he flew to the UK in a small plane as part of a {{dangerous}} mission, and was able to provide British intelligence with invaluable information. There he met up with Charles de Gaulle who named him Director of Research in the Forces navales fran√ßaises libres (the Navy of Free France). He became particularly interested in the detection of solar radio emissions by British Radar, which were causing military problems by jamming detection during periods of high emission, and was able to create a new radio <b>navigational</b> <b>beam</b> station.|$|E
5000|$|The {{counter measure}} to radio {{navigation}} was jamming. R. V. Jones was the MI6 science advisor and TRE staff {{worked closely with}} him, in countering the Luftwaffe's <b>navigational</b> <b>beam</b> technology to hamper the enemy's ability to do pinpoint night bombing raids {{in what has become}} known as the [...] "battle of the beams". Robert Cockburn of the TRE was responsible {{for the development of the}} Jostle IV radio jammer - the most powerful jammer device used over Europe. At 2 kW output it could block all VHF transmissions over 32-48 MHz. However, enclosed in its own pressurised container, (to prevent arcing of the high voltages inside), it was large and at 600 lb took up the entirety of the bomb bay of the Boeing Fortresses used by No. 100 Group RAF. Due to the high transmitter power, test flights had to be carried out in the vicinity of Iceland, otherwise the jamming would have blanked out all frequencies in the specified range, over a large area, as well as giving the Germans warning of the impending arrival of a jamming system.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1996, the Ultra decrypts for the {{relevant}} period {{have been available}} in the UK National Archives. Between 07:35 GMT on 10 November 1940 and 05:00 on 11 November a German signal was deciphered and given the serial number CX/JQ/444, paragraph 4. The message set out code words {{to be used by}} aircraft on an operation named [...] "Mondschein Sonate" [...] but did not give Coventry as the target or a date. It said that transmission of a figure 9 would denote [...] "KORN", and hindsight has recognised that to be the code name for Coventry. This was not realised at the time however, even though PAULA had been identified as Paris and LOGE as London. Indeed, the word KORN was used in two reports from an aircraft taking part in a raid on Southampton on 30 November, two weeks after the Coventry Blitz. Another decrypt on 11 November or early on 12 November gave <b>navigational</b> <b>beam</b> settings for Wolverhampton, Birmingham, and Coventry but no dates. There was a hiatus in Ultra decrypts from 01:15 GMT on 13 November until 02:40 on 15 November by which time the raid was well underway: Churchill could not have received new Ultra intelligence on the afternoon or evening of the attack because there was none to give him. Intelligence from captured airmen and documents did not offer an unambiguous picture either.|$|E
