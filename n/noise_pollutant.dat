The work {{described}} in this thesis was directed towards studying signal processing techniques that could best be incorporated in an apparatus that was to measure the plane wave sound power absorption coefficient of road surfaces in-situ. Road traffic noise {{has been identified as}} the greatest <b>noise</b> <b>pollutant</b> in the industrialised world with the tyre/road interaction being the major source of noise for traffic speeds in excess of 50 km/hr. Open pore bitumen asphalt material has been found to present a sound absorbing surface that is able to contribute to the mitigation of road traffic noise. This has generated research into the production of sound absorbing road surface materials which, in turn, has generated a need for an apparatus that is able to measure the sound power absorption coefficient of such materials both in the laboratory and in the field. It was considered that the development of an easily transportable apparatus was needed which would enable a single, non-skilled operator to measure rapidly the normal incident sound power absorption coefficient, over a broad frequency band, of road surfaces, in-situ. This included, for example, the measurement of the absorption coefficient of open-pore asphalt materials developed in the laboratory, the measurement of newly laid surfaces, the comparison of different surfaces, as well as determining the effect of contamination, over time, of the pores of open-pore asphalt by ingress of dust...|$|E

The effects of aircraft noise and emissions on the populations around airport are deal with annoying and sometimes dangerous. In order to address this issue, the research propose an integrating model of aircraft <b>noise</b> and <b>pollutant</b> emissions by combining effects of both <b>noise</b> and <b>pollutant</b> emissions using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to determine the healthy risk level around the airport.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of international trade, supply chains and transport increases the turnover of container terminals. Changes {{in the port}} environment and the functions of terminals have created a demand for logistics solutions and value-added services. On the other hand, these changes have also influenced the port-city interface. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the activity of container terminals and examine how the growing turnover of container units has affected the port cities. The interaction between the latter and port terminals has been discussed. The research is based on the terminals located in Polish port cities of Gdynia and Gdańsk, which play a leading role in the {{development of}} the economy in the region. The research has shown that maritime networks have an ever-growing influence on ports and port – city relationships. On the one hand, the growth of maritime logistic services has a positive influence on the labor market and transport infrastructure, which is also used by the inhabitants. On the other hand, the increase in container cargo volume has a negative impact on urban areas through a number of negative externalities (congestion, <b>noise,</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions, etc.). This creates a conflict in which the city has to bear the external effects of the port operations. In this context, solutions incorporating the sustainable development of both port and urban areas are essential...|$|E

But now, rice husk has been already used for activated carbon, briket, and main source that already been used for electronical, mechanical, medical, and even art. Meanwhile, in this research, rice husk would be used as a sound absorber, and because of <b>noise</b> <b>pollutant</b> is one of uncomfortable pollutant for us, this research is more useful. By reducing more noise, {{it would be better for}} employer work and productivity of company. 	The main purpose from the research is “The Influence of Porosity On Sound Absorption of Rice Husk Ash Particle Board” is to describe level of sound absorption from the raw material of rice husk and describe the influence of porosity to it sound absorption coefficient, also to describe potential of rice husk in sound absorption, compared to other absorber. This research was done by two test methods of sound absorption, that was direct method and impedance tube method using standing wave. 	The level of sound absorption that has been produced from each product in this paper is influenced with mass density and material porous on product. In this paper, absorption coefficient at frequency 1000 Hz has better value than absorption coefficient at frequency below 1000 Hz. Sound absorber with rice husk material has good absortion coefficient value compared to other absorber material.

40|$|Urban freight {{transport}} has many sustainable aspects. It contributes to economic vitality and {{the competitiveness of}} a region. However, the less socially and environmentally friendly effects such as <b>noise,</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions, and nuisance, are usually the central theme in designing urban {{freight transport}} policies. Restricting policies as time access restrictions and vehicle restrictions gain popularity among Dutch local authorities. More {{than half of the}} municipalities uses time access restrictions. In spite of the popularity of these policy measures, the effects on the distribution of retailers, the environment and the transport costs are not known yet. In this paper we present three case studies of food retailers, in order {{to examine the effects of}} time access restrictions and vehicle weight restrictions. We discuss the impacts on the transport costs and the distribution processes (on the retailer’s side) and the environmental impacts. To find these effects we design five scenarios, in which we vary the length of time access restrictions, the allowed weight of the weight restriction and the number of cities in which these regulations are used. In these scenarios we adapt, based on the likely reaction of the involved food retailers, the distribution activities to fit the regulations. The results show that the vehicle weight restriction as well as the time access restrictions have a negative impact on the retailers’ transport costs. In most cases we see that the policy measures also cause an increase in the pollutant CO 2 emissions that are emitted during the distribution of the goods. The time access restrictions cause a cost-increase that develops more or less convexly, as more stores are affected by this policy measure. The turning point is around 45 % of the stores affected. The weight restriction causes linear cost-increase as more stores are affected. Both policy measures affect especially the roundtrips that combine multiple less than truckload orders for different stores. The policy measures have a different effect on different retailers...|$|E

Last decade saw improved awareness of quantifiable relationship between environmental noise and health.

40|$|The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{methodology}} is {{a comprehensive}} environmental impact assessment tool whose aim is to evaluate the most relevant environmental impacts of a product or service along its life cycle. However, LCA studies often fail to include {{some of the largest}} impacts of the product system under study. Such is the case of transport noise: despite being a major source of discomfort whose significance can be likened to that of other forms of environmental pollution, it is often neglected in LCA studies. In this study, the causes for the marginality of transport noise in LCA are analyzed. Most of these causes stem from the special characteristics of <b>noise</b> as a <b>pollutant</b> (not just traffic noise but also noise from any other source), which are briefly discussed. The clash of these peculiarities with the limitations of LCA is thought to have seriously hindered the inclusion of noise within LCA. The special characteristics of <b>noise</b> as a <b>pollutant</b> (site-dependency of impacts, human perception issues, non-linearity of impacts and limited availability of data) that have hindered the inclusion of noise within LCA appear to justify a specific treatment within the LCA framework to better accommodate the assessment of its impacts...|$|R
