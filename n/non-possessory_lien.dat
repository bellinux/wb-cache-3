5000|$|The Quebec hypothèque, {{essentially}} {{equivalent to}} an American <b>non-possessory</b> <b>lien</b> or English legal charge, is an elastic, hypothecatory security interest {{that has all}} the rights of recourse (jus exigendi) of an American lien-theory mortgage or English mortgage by way of legal charge, may also be taken over movable and/or immovable property alike, and must be perfected (i.e. registered). The types as {{set forth in the}} Civil Code are: ...|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{more states}} are lien-theory states than are title-theory states. In title-theory states, a {{mortgage}} {{continues to be}} a conveyance of legal title to secure a debt, while the mortgagor still retains equitable title. In lien-theory states, mortgages and deeds of trust have been redesigned so that they now impose a <b>non-possessory</b> <b>lien</b> on the title to the mortgaged property, while the mortgagor still holds both legal and equitable title.|$|E
5000|$|Hypothec ( [...] or 16th century, from Fr. hypothèque, from Lat. hypotheca, from Gk. : hypothēkē), {{sometimes}} tacit hypothec, is a {{term used}} in mixed legal systems (e.g. Scots law, South African law, Ukrainian law (Іпотека)) to refer to an express or implied non-possessory real security over corporeal movable property. This real right in security operates by way of hypothecation, often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a preferential right to have claims paid out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default. At common law it is equivalent to an American <b>non-possessory</b> <b>lien</b> or English legal charge.|$|E
5000|$|In Quebec law, {{the word}} is {{nevertheless}} used in translations as an equivalent of hypothèque, which has a much broader meaning and encompasses the common law equivalents of, inter alia, mortgages, <b>non-possessory</b> <b>liens</b> over movables or immovables, and legal or equitable charges. Thus, art. 2660 of the Quebec Civil Code defines hypothec, providing as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{mortgage}} is {{a security}} interest in realty {{created by a}} written instrument (traditionally a deed) that either conveys legal title or hypothecates title {{by way of a}} <b>non-possessory</b> <b>lien</b> to a lender for the performance under the terms of a mortgage note. In slightly less than half of states, a mortgage creates a lien on the title to the mortgaged property. Foreclosure of that lien almost always requires a judicial proceeding declaring the debt to be due and in default and ordering a sale of the property to pay the debt. Many mortgages contain a power of sale clause, also known as nonjudicial foreclosure clause, making them equivalent to a deed of trust. Most [...] "mortgages" [...] in California are actually deeds of trust. The effective difference is that the foreclosure process can be much faster for a deed of trust than for a mortgage, on the order of 3 months rather than a year. Because this foreclosure does not require actions by the court, the transaction costs can be quite a bit less.|$|E
