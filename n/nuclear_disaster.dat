About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl <b>nuclear</b> <b>disaster</b> entered Belarusian territory, and {{about a fifth of}} Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of caesium binders and rapeseed cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of caesium-137.|$|E
5|$|The serial sees Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group {{being asked}} to examine strange {{meteorite}} showers. His investigations lead to his uncovering a conspiracy involving alien infiltration {{at the highest levels}} of the British Government. As even some of Quatermass's closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence, he is forced to use his own unsafe rocket prototype, which recently caused a <b>nuclear</b> <b>disaster</b> at an Australian testing range, to prevent the aliens from taking over mankind.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Japan {{adopted a}} new {{constitution}} emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world, until surpassed by China in 2010. This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered a major recession. In {{the beginning of the}} 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history; this triggered the Fukushima Daiichi <b>nuclear</b> <b>disaster,</b> one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.|$|E

5|$|Up to January 2011, {{market prices}} for NZ Units were largely {{set by the}} {{international}} price for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima <b>nuclear</b> <b>disaster</b> for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU prices fell to $NZ16.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{generated}} in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39% from nuclear power, {{resulting in a}} nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed), and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000. However, {{as a reaction to}} the Fukushima <b>nuclear</b> <b>disaster,</b> the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed). The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for all questions relating to energy supply and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). The agency is supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the typhoon was {{forecast}} {{to strike}} areas {{affected by the}} Fukushima Daiichi <b>nuclear</b> <b>disaster.</b> Officials prepared by installing a cover to prevent rain contamination. Ultimately, there still was rain contamination, and Ma-on's passage produced 2,000tons of radioactive water. Before the storm struck Japan, officials in Miyakonojō, Miyazaki advised the evacuation of about 900people in areas prone to mudslides. At least 300airline flights were canceled due to the storm. The typhoon also caused delays in the nation's rail system. Nippon Oil stopped shipping oil during the storm. As Ma-on moved across Japan, it produced winds of 108km/h (68mph), along with heavy rainfall of up to 1200mm (48in). Rainfall in a 24‑hour period reached 860mm (38.5in) in Umaji, Kōchi, which set a 24‑hour rainfall record and exceeded the average July precipitation by 265.5mm (10.6in). The rains flooded houses and roads in the region. High rains closed several expressways, and in Shizuoka Prefecture, a blocked road stranded 96mountain climbers. Strong winds left about 11,000people without power on Shikoku Island. The combination of winds and rain damaged the 385‑year‑old Nijō Castle in Kyoto. The typhoon injured 60people, and killed five people. One of the deaths was {{from a man who}} drowned while checking on his boat during the storm. Damage was estimated at ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E
