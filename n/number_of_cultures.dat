25|$|The {{main reason}} that {{indigenous}} languages and cultures {{have been able}} to survive here is the rugged terrain, which isolate communities. This also has the effect of dividing the state into small secluded communities, which have developed independently over time. There are 16 ethno linguistic groups recognized by the Instituto Nacional Indigenista who maintain their individual languages, customs and traditions well into the colonial period and to some extent to the present day. However, some studies put the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> in the state as high as 4,000. This makes Oaxaca the most ethnically complex of Mexico's 31 states.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 8 counties of Erzurum city with 165 farmers to determine the factors effective on hygiene and health management in stock breeding enterprises. The LIMPED software package was {{used to analyze the}} survey data using Logit Model. Four factors which are needed to consider for improving the hygiene and health conditions in stock breeding enterprises were used as dependent variables. These factors were as follows: routine health checks of the animals in the farm; cleansing hands and machine parts before milking; elaborating in the care and hygiene conditions of the animals in the farm and daily cleaning of the barn. It was concluded that age, education level and income of the farmer, regional differences, participation to agricultural extension training activities following agriculture-related broadcasts from mass media and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> race animals owned by the farm were effective on considering the hygiene and health management in stock breeding enterprises. In this context, it is necessary that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> race animals should be increased; farmers should be trained on hygiene and health issues periodically and regularly with the help of mass media means and that farmers should be encouraged to make market based production so that their income could be increased...|$|R
