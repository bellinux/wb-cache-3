5|$|In 2002, {{the hotel}} was bought by Westroc Hotels & Resorts and {{underwent}} a renovation, which was completed in 2005. Conceived anew by the architectural firm Allen+Philp, a seven-story tower with guest rooms and condominiums was built above the lobby, {{in the spirit of}} Varney's proposal. <b>New</b> <b>restaurants</b> were incorporated, including a retro-chic seasonal-American restaurant (ZuZu), and a Trader Vic's franchise at the northeast end of the property (closed in 2011). The hotel's original jet-age design was restored as much as possible, augmented with 2000s-era fixtures.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{after the}} 2015 {{election}} of Mayor Dale Fowler, Harrisburg opened {{a brand new}} theater {{on the north side}} of town, and unveiled park plaza, gateway for southeastern Illinois entertainment and culture downtown. The initiative was to bring more people downtown. Mayer Fowler wanted to start promoting Harrisburg as the destination capital of southeastern Illinois. A new movie theater and a family entertainment outlet, Z-Factor, also opened, Fowler said he was preparing new announcements including the opening of <b>new</b> <b>restaurants</b> on top of other established draws including a state-of-art gun range.|$|E
5|$|While Burger King still {{utilizes}} {{a version}} of its revamped franchising system in the United States, outside of North America its international locations licenses are still sold on a regional basis with franchises owning exclusive development rights for a region or country. These regional franchises are known as master franchises, and are responsible for opening <b>new</b> <b>restaurants,</b> licensing new third party operators, and performing standards oversight of all restaurant locations in these countries; {{one of the larger}} examples of a master franchise is Hungry Jack's, which oversees over 300 restaurants in Australia.|$|E

5|$|After this NSS {{decided not}} to obtain many {{additional}} restaurants, as it did not see value in such a strategy. From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at Ål, Jaren, Lillestrøm and Tønsberg, along with dining service on the steamship Skibladner, which ran on Mjøsa. During {{the first half of}} the 1940s it again acquired <b>new</b> <b>restaurants,</b> including the one at Kristiansand Station. In 1940 and 1941 the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss. During the late 1940s NSS also took over the restaurants at Drammen and Sarpsborg, as well as the one at Oslo Airport, Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|In 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, {{pastry chef}} {{to the future}} Louis XVIII, opened {{one of the most}} popular {{restaurants}} of the time – the Grande Taverne de Londres – in the arcades of the Palais-Royal. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing monarchy of France, in the period leading up to the French Revolution. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the French Directory's nouveau riche helped keep these <b>new</b> <b>restaurants</b> in business.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} has {{also played a}} large role in revitalizing the area, even without public aid and incentives. Developers have been {{attracted}} to the historic buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods, calling it the city's strongest asset, although they have complained about past stalemates in city government. One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without any public effort or intent, and the restoration of the music hall at the Savings Bank led to many <b>new</b> <b>restaurants</b> opening in the neighborhood. The blocks of River Street north of Monument Square have a dozen woman-owned businesses.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the station}} started construction, land {{prices in the}} {{immediate}} area have nearly doubled. Interest in the surrounding area has also grown, as many development {{companies are going to}} Hudson Yards to buy air rights; for instance Related Companies, already the developer of Hudson Yards, entered a contract to buy a $75 million-plus parcel of land between 35th and 36th Streets and between Eleventh Avenue and Hudson Boulevard, as well as land over a McDonald's to build 50 Hudson Yards. Also {{as a result of the}} subway extension, three tenants have already been found for 10 Hudson Yards, and Citigroup is considering moving to the area. Most importantly, however, the $750 million platform supporting much of Hudson Yards was built starting in January 2013; subway construction for a station that could potentially carry up to 27,000 daily passengers necessitated the construction of more buildings, as 70% of tenants are expected to come to Hudson Yards via the 7 subway extension. Additionally, <b>new</b> <b>restaurants,</b> luxury condominiums, and stores have appeared near the station and along the extension's route, and residential prices along the extension have also increased. A construction boom has occurred in the greater Hudson Yards area as well.|$|E

25|$|As the Anacostia station opened, little {{development}} had occurred, however. The closest businesses (hair salons, carry-out {{fast food}} stores, auto repair and tire shops) were three blocks away, and no plans for retail development had been submitted despite the city's action six years earlier. Nonetheless, McGrath and the nonprofit Anacostia Economic Development Corp. both believed <b>new</b> <b>restaurants,</b> new service businesses, and housing redevelopment were coming quickly.|$|E

50|$|Jack Fiorella {{was ready}} to expand again by the mid-1990s, but this time instead of a <b>new</b> <b>restaurant</b> concept, {{the plan was to}} {{replicate}} the success of his Martin City Smokestack Barbeque restaurant. Other members of the Fiorella family told Jack that he was not permitted to use the Smokestack name for his <b>new</b> <b>restaurant,</b> so both the <b>new</b> <b>restaurant</b> and Jack's existing restaurant in Martin City dropped the Smokestack name and were rebranded as Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbeque. The <b>new</b> <b>restaurant</b> was opened in 1997 at 9520 Metcalf Ave in Overland Park, Kansas. They also opened a full-service catering operation in Martin City and their third location in the historic Freight House building in the Crossroads Arts District. They began shipping their barbecue nationwide in 2000, and in October 2006 they opened a fourth location on The Country Club Plaza.
