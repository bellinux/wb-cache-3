500|$|Like the Navy, the Air Force has {{operated}} QF-4 target drones, serving with the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. It {{was expected that}} the F-4 would remain in the target role with the 82d ATRS until at least 2015, when they would be replaced by early versions of the F-16 Fighting Falcon converted to a QF-16 configuration. Several QF-4s also retain capability as manned aircraft and are maintained in historical color schemes, being displayed as part of Air Combat Command's Heritage Flight at air shows, base open houses, and other events while serving as <b>non-expendable</b> target aircraft during the week. On 19 November 2013, BAE Systems delivered the last QF-4 aerial target to the Air Force. The example had been in storage for over 20 years before being converted. Over 16 years, BAE had converted 314 F-4 and RF-4 Phantom IIs into QF-4s and QRF-4s, with each aircraft taking six months to adapt. As of December 2013, QF-4 and QRF-4 aircraft had flown over 16,000 manned and 600 unmanned training sorties, with 250 unmanned aircraft being shot down in firing exercises. The remaining QF-4s and QRF-4s held their training role until the first of 126 QF-16s were delivered by Boeing. The final flight of an Air Force QF-4 from Tyndall AFB took place on 27 May 2015 to Holloman AFB. After Tyndall AFB ceased operations, the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group at Holloman became the fleet of 22 QF-4s' last remaining operator. [...] The base continued using them to fly manned test and unmanned live fire test support and Foreign Military Sales testing, with the final unmanned flight taking place in August 2016. The type was officially retired from US military service with a four ship flight at Holloman during an event on December 21, 2016. In January 2017, the remaining airframes were to be demilitarized.|$|E

50|$|The {{mold cavity}} of a casting {{does not reflect}} the exact {{dimensions}} of the finished part due to a number of reasons. These modifications to the mold cavity are known as allowances and account for patternmaker's shrinkage, draft, machining, and distortion. In <b>non-expendable</b> processes, these allowances are imparted directly into the permanent mold, but in expendable mold processes they are imparted into the patterns, which later form the mold cavity. Note that for <b>non-expendable</b> molds an allowance is required for the dimensional change of the mold due to heating to operating temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{casting process}} is {{subdivided}} into two main categories: expendable and <b>non-expendable</b> casting. It is further {{broken down by}} the mold material, such as sand or metal, and pouring method, such as gravity, vacuum, or low pressure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-{{expendable}}</b> mold casting {{differs from}} expendable processes {{in that the}} mold need not be reformed after each production cycle. This technique includes at least four different methods: permanent, die, centrifugal, and continuous casting. This form of casting also results in improved repeatability in parts produced and delivers Near Net Shape results.|$|E
50|$|The two {{defining}} {{characteristics of}} spin casting are semi-permanent (<b>non-expendable)</b> rubber molds {{and the use}} of centrifugal force. These make the process relatively unique compared to machined die-based and expendable mold casting methods. These qualities also encourage operators to use casting materials specially formulated for low melting points and viscosities. Most spin casting is done with pewter and zinc alloys or thermoset plastics.|$|E
50|$|For {{surfaces}} of the casting that are perpendicular to the parting line of the mold a draft must be included. This is so that the casting can be released in <b>non-expendable</b> processes or the pattern can be released from the mold without destroying the mold in expendable processes. The required draft angle depends on {{the size and shape}} of the feature, the depth of the mold cavity, how the part or pattern is being removed from the mold, the pattern or part material, the mold material, and the process type. Usually the draft is not less than 1%.|$|E

5000|$|Boxer GNGP (Boxer Geniegroep) - The Boxer GNPR is an {{engineering}} and {{logistics support vehicle}} and will be deployed for the transport of troops and engineer group equipment. It provides seating for six dismounts with space available for their personal equipment and an additional separate stowage section for munitions. It may be deployed as a support vehicle with other units or used for independent assignments such as route clearance, or as a protected work location during mine clearance or demolition operations. The Boxer GNGP replaces the YPR-765 prgm/PRCO-C3 variant of the AIFV (Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle). The Royal Netherlands Army will now convert 12 of the 92 GNGP vehicles to Boxer Battle Damage Repair. (BDR) configuration. The BDR variant is able to accommodate the special equipment, tools, expendable and <b>non-expendable</b> supplies needed to carry out diagnoses, maintenance and minor repairs if required. Crew consists of an engineer commander, driver, observing commander, gunner, and five engineers.|$|E

5000|$|Preceding {{the start}} of their February 5, 2010 show, Get Loweded {{producer}} Chas Roberts announced that the current run would be the final season of Get Loweded. The last show is scheduled for June 4, 2010. This was verified on their Facebook fan page with this announcement:I've spent all month {{trying to figure out}} the best way to say this. I've spent all month looking for some poetic epic statement to round out the feeling I, we, have. I realized after much deliberation that the best way do to it is post-show, wicked drunk. That just seems appropriate. No spell check, no paranoia, just with a love of the show.Yes. Sounds good.With that love, comes a heavy heart. A heavy heart because the time is now to conclude a three year endeavor into an experiment that yielded amazing creative results. They were results that were the culmination of all the ideas that made the show what it became including garnering attention for deserved talent, building a strong, devoted fan base, creating a new take on time tested concepts and building an ideal resume addition for the performers, producers, cast and crew involved.We created acts that sucked up all expendable and <b>non-expendable</b> funds available for one show. We played with the dynamics of our individual and collective roles. We sucked up and teamed up to create, what began as one performer's selfish showcase, a show that none of us had ever seen or been a part of before.There were comparisons: Pho Bang, SSP, Dina Martina...all Re-bar originals. At the end of the day, We became something new, exciting, and dynamic which was where those comparisons came from.All that being said, it's time to call it a day. After the aforementioned three years, Get Loweded will be concluding its three year run on June 4, 2010.We will be concluding the current [...] "Golden Age" [...] Run on May 7, 2010(this ending will be amazing. TRUST ME) Our June 4 show will be a [...] "best of the old school" [...] show that will involve Inter-gender Arm Wrestling, a pregnant prize gal and all the golden oldies from this three year run.|$|E

40|$|The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Tritium Systems Group has {{developed}} and fabricated an Oxidative Tritium Decontamination System (OTDS), {{which is designed}} to reduce tritium surface contamination on various components and items. The system is configured to introduce gaseous ozone into a reaction chamber containing tritiated items that require a reduction in tritium surface contamination. Tritium surface contamination (on components and items in the reaction chamber) is removed by chemically reacting elemental tritium to tritium oxide via oxidation, while purging the reaction chamber effluent to a gas holding tank or negative pressure HVAC system. Implementing specific concentrations of ozone along with catalytic parameters, the system is able to significantly reduce surface tritium contamination on an assortment of expendable and <b>non-expendable</b> items. This paper will present the results of various experimentation involving employment of this system...|$|E
