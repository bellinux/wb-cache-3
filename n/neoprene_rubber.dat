5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to <b>neoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E

25|$|A {{passenger}} airbag was offered {{as an option}} in the Series II facelift of October 1995. The unique design allowed it to protect the not only the front passenger, but the centre passenger as well (only the entry-level GLi was offered with the optional bench seat). The Fairmont Ghia was the only trim level to receive dual airbags as standard, which also benefited from the XR6 engine, leather upholstery, extensive use of chrome and lowered suspension. With the use of <b>neoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> insulation, road and wind noise was cut off from within the cabin, contributing to vehicle refinement. Ford also dropped the XR6 station wagon from the lineup in the Series II.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{permeability}} of 13 different {{gloves to}} 13 cytotoxic agents under controlled dynamic conditions is described. METHODS: Thirteen cytotoxic agents were prepared {{at the highest}} concentrations normally encountered by pharmacy personnel. Four glove types [...] <b>neoprene,</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex, nitrile, and vinyl [...] {{were exposed to the}} cytotoxic agents for 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Tests were conducted using the middle finger of each glove. Linearity, reproducibility, and sensitivity were evaluated for each drug tested. Assays were run using liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light (HPLC-UV). Permeability testing was conducted using an original system designed to evaluate dynamic constraints, such as rubbing, stretching, and tension. RESULTS: Linearity by LC/MS/MS and HPLC-UV was confirmed at concentrations up to 1000 ng/mL for all drugs. Most glove materials were permeable at rates below ASTM recommendations over the one-hour testing period. Vinyl was the most permeable material. Carmustine permeated the widest variety of materials. Due to the high sensitivity of the analytic methods, all materials displayed low but significant permeability for at least one drug after one hour. Higher resistance to permeation was recorded for all <b>neoprene,</b> some natural <b>rubber</b> latex, and one nitrile glove. CONCLUSION: <b>Neoprene,</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex, and nitrile gloves displayed the highest resistance to permeation of the 13 cytotoxic agents studied.

50|$|Use of {{personal}} protective equipment, including {{items such as}} protective gloves, protective aprons, acid suits, safety goggles, a face shield, or safety shoes, is normally recommended when handling corrosive substances. Users should consult a safety data sheet for the specific recommendation for the corrosive substance of interest. The material of construction of the personal protective equipment is of critical importance as well. For example, although rubber gloves and rubber aprons may be made out of a chemically resistant elastomer such as nitrile <b>rubber,</b> <b>neoprene,</b> or butyl <b>rubber,</b> each of these materials has different resistance to different corrosives and {{they should not be}} substituted for each other.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{material}} used for making household gloves is latex, {{a form of}} rubber.
