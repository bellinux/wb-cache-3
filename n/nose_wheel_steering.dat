40|$|AbstractThe {{necessity}} {{of improving the}} air traffic and reducing the aviation emissions drives to investigate automatic steering for aircraft to effectively roll on the ground. This paper addresses the path following control problem of aircraft-on-ground and focuses on the task that the aircraft is required to follow the desired path on the runway by <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> automatic <b>steering.</b> The proposed approach is based on dynamical adaptive backstepping so that the system model {{does not have to}} be transformed into a canonical triangular form which is necessary in conventional backstepping design. This adaptive controller performs well despite the lack of information on the aerodynamic load and the tire cornering stiffness parameters. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{examples}} of the S2 were externally almost identical to the S1 {{with the exception of}} the new windows. From early 1969, secondary front indicator lamp nacelles were added between the headlights, and larger door handles were used in place of the S1's push-button items. During 1968 a number of Europas (and Elans) were produced bearing black-and-silver Lotus badges on the <b>nose</b> and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> in place of the customary yellow-and-green ones. The official Lotus Cars website states these [...] "black-badge" [...] vehicles were to commemorate the death earlier in 1968 of Jim Clark, Lotus's champion Formula One driver, however this is debated by other sources.|$|R
25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E
25|$|If {{an engine}} fails during taxiing or takeoff, the thrust yawing moment will force the {{aircraft}} {{to one side}} on the runway. If the airspeed is not high enough and hence, the rudder-generated side force is not powerful enough, the aircraft will deviate from the runway centerline and may even veer off the runway. The airspeed at which the aircraft, after engine failure, deviates 9.1m from the runway centerline, despite using maximum rudder but {{without the use of}} <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> is the minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG).|$|E

50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{link the}} yoke, control stick, or rudder {{directly to the}} <b>wheel</b> used for <b>steering.</b> Manipulating these controls turns the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> (the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> for tricycle landing gear, and the tail wheel for taildraggers). The connection may be a firm one in which any movement of the controls turns the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> (and vice versa), {{or it may be}} a soft one in which a spring-like mechanism twists the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> but does not force it to turn. The former provides positive steering but makes it easier to skid the steering wheel; the latter provides softer steering (making it easy to overcontrol) but reduces the probability of skidding. Aircraft with retractable gear may disable the steering mechanism wholly or partially when the gear is retracted.|$|R
50|$|Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering)</b> is {{available}} {{as an option}} on 2000 and 4000 series machines.The electronic system has 5 modes of operation, and only allows four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> below 20 km/h.|$|R

2500|$|... 5 February 2006: Two Short 360-300 freighters, modded for a DOD contract, {{operated}} by Air Cargo Carriers, were flying in formation when they collided near Watertown, Wisconsin, US. N3735W attempted to maneuver below N372AC in a right turn and struck the left/ underside of N372AC. [...] The left wing outer section of N3735W was struck and separated by {{the leading edge}} of N372AC's left wing, and the aircraft crashed, killing all three occupants. The left propeller of N3735W had struck the forward section of the left [...] "stub wing" [...] of N372AC (the structure housing the left main landing gear and hydraulic service panel). [...] N372AC sustained severe damage, including structural, engine, propeller (losing several blades), aerodynamic, and complete hydraulic failure (affecting flaps, landing gear, <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> and primary brakes). [...] The crew managed to make an emergency landing at Dodge County Airport in Juneau, WI (KUNU), but overran the runway due to the damage to the aircraft. [...] The left aileron of N3735W was found on the runway that N372AC landed on. [...] Both crewmen survived uninjured, but N372AC was damaged beyond reasonable repair.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} wing {{is made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single, or optionally double-surface, wing covered in Trilam sailcloth. The wing {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. A variety of wings and engines can be fitted, each with a different model designation. When equipped with a [...] Rotax 503 or [...] Rotax 582 two-stroke engine the aircraft is designated as a Phase II and when equipped with a [...] Rotax 912 four-stroke engine is designated as a Phase III. Wings used include the double surface Top 12.9, Top 14.9, Chronos 16 and the single surface Zoom 19. The wing designation reflects the area in square metres. The landing gear features gas-filled shock absorber suspension on all three <b>wheels,</b> <b>nose</b> whweel <b>steering</b> and a nose wheel-mounted drum brake, as well as a parking brake. The aircraft can be disassembled for storage or ground transportation, taking half an hour for set-up.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper discuses sensor {{steering}} mechanism (SSM) for a laterally guided vehicle with a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism. The authors {{have demonstrated the}} geometry of SSMs for front <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> type and reverse phase four-wheel steering type vehicles. SSMs allow stable lateral guiding performance for automated vehicles following a path with straight and curved portions created by a guideway. On other hand, no SSM has been established for a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> type vehicle. Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles include forklifts and backward moving conventional motor vehicles which are front wheel vehicles. A SSM for rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles would enable a forklift to move into any spaces using automation. This paper proposes a SSM relation for a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicle and describes the construction of experimental robotic vehicle with the proposed SSM.

50|$|The {{landing gear}} is tubular steel with springs for shock absorption. The landing gear is a fixed {{tricycle}} configuration with <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> through rudder bar deflection. The main gear {{is designed to}} fail {{in the event of}} excessive stress, thus preventing damage to the wing structure. The tricycle configuration also eases handling.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} has conventional <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> {{connected to}} the rudder pedals. The main landing gear utilizes sprung-tubes for suspension and absorbing landing loads. There is a fourth small caster-wheel under the tail, because when the pilot's seat is unoccupied the aircraft rests on its tail, due to the aircraft's empty center of gravity.|$|E
50|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration {{and all three}} sprung gear legs are made from 4130 chrome-molybdenum steel alloy. The nose wheel is free-castering. On early versions the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> was by differential braking via two finger-controlled brake handles mounted on the centre console. On later versions more conventional toe brakes were installed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{attached}} to the two rear engine mounts by y-shaped steel tubes attached to a steel tube with a shaft that slides freely with the wheel. Cables run underneath the belly directly from fixtures on the rudder pedals to the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft. This gave the ability to steer by pivoting the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft with the rudder pedals. The shock system consisted of six circular bungee cords, sometimes four for softer landings, located {{on either side of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft to ears on the top tube and the bottom shaft connected to the wheel.|$|R
3000|$|Manoeuvre similarity: Is the {{steering}} manoeuvre {{carried out in}} a similar fashion in both settings, that is without crucial differences in maximum <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angles, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rates, or <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> reversal rates 1 ? [...]...|$|R
50|$|Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> {{tends to}} be {{unstable}} because in turns the steering geometry changes hence decreasing the turn radius (over steer), rather than increase it (under steer). Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is meant for slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.|$|R
50|$|On April 19, after {{a week-long}} flight, Discovery {{conducted}} the fifth shuttle landing at KSC. The shuttle suffered extensive brake damage and a ruptured tire during landing.

50|$|Taxi {{operations}} are accomplished using the electronic <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> The steering system on aircraft without variable authority <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> requires the pilot to select master or primary steering mode. In master mode, 10 degrees of steering is possible. This mode {{is suitable for}} straight taxi, takeoff and gentle turns. Primary steering mode allows up to 45 degrees angle of turn and is suitable for slow speed aggressive steering maneuvers. On aircraft equipped with variable authority steering, the steering authority varies with ground speed.The CJ610-6 engines fitted to the Learjet 25 have very low inertia and accelerate rapidly. The time required to accelerate from idle to 100% RPM is approximately four seconds. This excellent throttle response enables rapid acceleration and precise power settings. Single engine performance is good with the single engine rate of climb approximately 1700 feet per minute at gross weight at sea level and a single engine service ceiling of approximately 21500 feet.|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} {{investigated in}} this study are (1) the design and analysis of strategies to control the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> on four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> automobiles; and (2) the estimation of lateral stability regions for a nonlinear 2 DOF vehicle;Rear Wheel Controllers are developed using linear optimal control theory under the assumption that all states are available, however, this assumption is rarely true. A methodology is then developed to use a minimum number of measurable states to obtain suboptimal rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> controllers which are less expensive and could be practically implemented. The methodology is based on achieving zero phase lag difference between yaw rate and lateral acceleration, and zero sideslip angle;It is shown analytically, using Routh Hurwith criteria, eigenvalue analysis and Lyapunov method, that at high speeds the suboptimal rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> controllers enhances the stability and improves the performance of four wheel fixed and free steering control vehicles. At low speeds, the effects of time lagged lateral tire force on front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are studied and new stability conditions are derived;The influence of vehicle rolling motion is examined and a new rear wheel controller which includes roll parameters is developed. New steady-state handling conditions for the front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are also derived;To further enhance vehicle design, the nonlinear numerical optimization method of sequential quadratic programming is used in conjunction with Routh Hurwitz criteria to determine the most restrictive stability conditions for front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles;Lyapunov second method, constrained optimization, and reverse trajectory methods are employed to estimate the lateral stability region, of a nonlinear two degree of freedom vehicle model, analytically and with minimal computation. New analytic expressions are derived for the equilibrium points for a nonlinear 2 DOF vehicle. These expressions assist in defining the outer limits of the lateral stability regions;The robustness of the rear wheel controllers are investigated via an eight degree-of-freedom nonlinear spread tire vehicle model. The results indicate that the high speed handling of four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are generally superior to the corresponding front <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles...|$|R
