While a number of companies realize the potential of blogs and encourage their employees to blog; a good chunk of them are skeptical about losing control over to this new media. Companies fear that employees may write negative things about them and this may bring significant reputation loss. Overall, companies show mixed response towards <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> on employee blogs- some companies show complete aversion, while others show resilience towards <b>negative</b> <b>posts.</b> Such mixed reactions towards <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> motivated us to probe for any positive aspects of <b>negative</b> <b>posts.</b> In particular, we investigate the relationship between <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> and readership of an employee blog. In contrast to the popular perception, our results reveal a potential positive aspect of <b>negative</b> <b>posts.</b> Our analysis suggests that <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> act as catalyst and can exponentially increase the readership to employee blogs, and suggests that there is some merit to thinking of resilience towards <b>negative</b> <b>posts.</b> Since employees typically write few <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> and largely write positive posts, the increase in readership to employee blogs generally should be enough to offset the negative effect of fe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A “low-balling {{strategy}} ” by bidding contractors {{has increasingly}} {{been recognized as}} an important issue in public infrastructure procurement. Public works contracts are often imperfect and renegotiated after the contract award. Given the expectation for ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments,</b> bidders seem motivated {{to take advantage of}} the low-balling strategy. This paper analyzes the endogeneity between the bid strategy and ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Using procurement data on rural road projects in Nepal, it shows that the bid strategy and adjustments are determined endogenously in the system. Anticipating cost and time overruns, firms would likely undercut normal bid prices. Then, ex <b>post</b> contract <b>adjustments</b> actually happen, because of their too aggressive bids. ...|$|R

For example, ICSC calculated that U.

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{firms can}} measure and manage {{influence}} of IT-enabled communication media, particularly blogs. The thesis constitutes two essays. The essays {{can be read}} independently, but they are complementary to each other. ^ The first essay measures the influence of employees 2 ̆ 7 negative blogging on their employers and suggests an approach to govern employees 2 ̆ 7 negative blogging for better results. Results indicate {{that the increase in}} <b>negative</b> <b>posts,</b> increases readership exponentially up to a certain level of <b>negative</b> <b>posting,</b> and then stabilizes beyond this point. Due to this initial exponential increase in readership, there are conditions under which <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> generate greater net positive influence on readers than if there were no <b>negative</b> <b>posts.</b> We illustrate the application of the framework using blogging data from employees at Sun Microsystems. Our empirical model accounts for inherent non-linearities, issues of endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, and potential alternative specifications. ^ The second essay investigates the influence of blogs in general new venture financing and proposes an approach to handle blogs for better financing deals. Findings indicate that eWOM of popular bloggers helps new ventures in getting higher amounts and valuations, and eWOM due to non-popular bloggers does not matter. Other findings are that the impact of negative eWOM is more than the positive eWOM. Results also show that as new ventures progress through financing stages, the effect of eWOM on financing decreases. Another contribution of this work is to gather and assimilate data from wide variety of sources such as VentureXpert, surveys, Google Blogsearch, Lexis-Nexis, Archive. org, and Hoover. Econometric analysis is designed to control for biases in sample selection, simultaneity in financing variables, and potential alternative specifications. Robustness checks such as ignoring selection bias fix, controlling for potential endogeneity bias due to unobserved quality, adding more control variables, and by dropping ventures that received multiple rounds of financing were conducted. ...|$|R

40|$|Weblogs or blogs have {{recently}} {{received a lot}} of attention, especially in the business community, with a number of firms encouraging their employees to publish blogs to reach out and connect to a wider audience. It is beginning to be recognized that employee blogs can cast a firm in either a positive or a negative light, thereby enhancing or harming the firm’s reputation. Paradoxically, under certain conditions negative postings by employees can actually help the overall reputation of the firm. The rationale for this is that <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> raise the credibility of an employee blog and attract more readers, who then will also be exposed to the positive posts on the blog. Drawing from the literature on customer advocacy and the stage model theory of information processing in cognitive psychology, we develop a model to decipher the relationship between the extent of <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> and the overall positive Word of Mouth (WOM) generated by the employee blogs for the firm. An empirical model is developed to account for the inherent non-linearities, endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity concerns, and potential alternative specifications. Our results suggest that <b>negative</b> <b>posts</b> act as a catalyst to increase the readership of an employee blog, with readership increasing exponentially in the initial stages and then stabilizing. The empirical findings are used to generate an analytical framework that firms can use to formulate employee blogging policies. We illustrate the application of the framework using blogging data from Sun Microsystems. ...|$|R

Prediction questionnaire tool was proofed to be a valuable, feasible and efficient instrument for the screening of several diseases. We previously developed an Egyptian HCV risk screening tool (EGCRISC). This study aims to validate/modify EGCRISC. A cross-sectional study testing 4579 individuals by EGCRISC {{as well as}} ELISA/PCR was performed. The sample was a stratified cluster sampling from {{urban and rural areas}} in Upper and Lower Egypt using a proportional allocation technique. The degree of agreement and positive and <b>negative</b> <b>posttest</b> probabilities were calculated. ROC curve was done and the cutoff points were customized for best performance. The total score was further classified into three levels according to the risk load. The mean age of the participants was 41. 1 ± 12. 2 in whom HCV prevalence was 8. 6 %. EGCRISC, particularly after modifying the cutoff points, has a good discriminating ability. The degree of agreement was at least 68. 1 % and the positive posttest probability ranged from 5 % to 37. 2 % whereas the <b>negative</b> <b>posttest</b> probability was in the range 1 % to 17 %. We conclude that EGCRISC is a valid tool that can potentially screen for HCV infection risk in Egypt and could diminish the demand for mass serologic screening in those apparently at minimal risk. Extensive use of electronic and self- or interviewer-administered risk-based screening strategy may simplify and promote overall screening and detection of HCV dissimilar communities...|$|R
40|$|Auditor-Client {{negotiation}} about difficult client {{accounting issues}} involves the auditor, the client, {{and various other}} parties on both the client and auditor side. On the auditor side, the Professional Practice Department {{has been reported to}} {{play a significant role in}} the financial reporting process, yet is rarely the focus of academic study. In this study, I investigate how communicating the involvement of the Professional Practice Department (PPD) to top management using different influence techniques impacts negotiated outcomes between audit partners and top management. I examine the impact of communicating the involvement of the PPD in the context of two other variables found in prior auditing literature to be important in the negotiation process, auditor type and CFO (Chief Financial Officer) preferred auditor-type. While auditors must attest that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, they also must ensure they foster a functional working relationship with the client. The auditor-client context is unique, and takes place within an on-going relationship where expectations and preferences have been established. Therefore, I examine these negotiation outcomes while incorporating a key contextual variable, auditor-type, in the negotiations. Both the CFO's preference for auditor-type, as well as actual auditor-type will be examined in addition to the specific influence tactic. I use a 3 x 2 x 2 fully factorial design to experimentally analyze the impact of two manipulated variable (influence tactic and auditor-type) and one measured variable (CFO preference for auditor-type) on two dependent variables. The two dependent variables are the CFO's willingness to <b>post</b> an <b>adjustment</b> to the financial statements and the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner. I report the results of an audit negotiation experiment in which 154 highly experienced CFOs responded to a case scenario that incorporated or measured the three key variables (influence tactic communicating PPD involvement, auditor-type and CFO preference for auditor type). My results indicate that using the most aggressive influence tactic to communicate the Professional Practice Department's involvement had a mixed effect on the CFOs willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements. The CFOs in this influence condition that were paired with an accommodating auditor-type reported a higher willingness to adjust the financial statements while CFOs paired with a proactive and advising auditor-type reported a lower willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> All CFOs reported less satisfaction with the audit partner when the most aggressive influence tactic was used to communicate the Professional Practice Department's inyolvement. Furthermore, the CFO's preference for an auditor-type significantly affects negotiation outcomes. CFOs that prefer more proactive and advising audit partners are more likely to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements, regardless of whether or not. they are informed of the Professional Practice Department's involvement. These same CFOs report a high level of satisfaction with the audit partner and their satisfaction is not impacted by the type of audit partner they are paired with. CFOs that prefer more reactive and accommodating audit partners are less willing to adjust the financial statements and report less satisfaction (dissatisfaction), when paired with proactive and advising audit partners. These results highlight the importance of the existing relationship within the auditor-client dyads and help support findings from auditor-client negotiation research which show that prevailing expectations of the CFO are a contextually important feature of audit negotiation and should be incorporated into more research. I also show that aggressive tactics can help persuade some CFOs to adjust the financial statements; however, consistently pushing too aggressively results in reduced cooperation. Furthermore, there are large costs in terms of the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner in using aggressive tactics, and therefore, practically speaking the tactic that could potentially be the most effective may result in a lost client...|$|R
