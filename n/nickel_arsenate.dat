5000|$|Erythrite or {{red cobalt}} is a {{secondary}} hydrated cobalt arsenate mineral with the formula (Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O). Erythrite and annabergite (Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O) (<b>nickel</b> <b>arsenate)</b> form a complete {{series with the}} general formula (Co,Ni)3(AsO4)2·8H2O.|$|E
50|$|Aerugite {{is a rare}} complex <b>nickel</b> <b>arsenate</b> mineral with a variably {{reported}} formula: Ni9(AsO4)2AsO6. It forms {{green to}} deep blue-green trigonal crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 4 and a specific gravity of 5.85 to 5.95.|$|E
50|$|Nickeline {{is formed}} by {{hydrothermal}} modification of ultramafic rocks and associated ore deposits, {{and may be}} formed by replacement of nickel-copper bearing sulfides (replacing pentlandite, and in association with copper arsenic sulfides), or via metasomatism of sulfide-free ultramafic rocks, where metasomatic fluids introduce sulfur, carbonate, and arsenic. This typically results in mineral assemblaged including millerite, heazelwoodite and metamorphic pentlandite-pyrite via sulfidation and associated arsenopyrite-nickeline-breithauptite. Associated minerals include: arsenopyrite, barite, silver, cobaltite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, breithauptite and maucherite. Nickeline alters to annabergite (a coating of green <b>nickel</b> <b>arsenate)</b> on exposure to moist air.|$|E
25|$|Gossans {{of nickel}} mineralisation, {{especially}} massive sulfides, are dominated in the arid Yilgarn Craton by boxworks of goethite, hematite, maghemite and ocher clays. Non-sulfide nickel minerals are typically soluble, and preserved rarely at surface as carbonates, although often can be preserved as <b>nickel</b> <b>arsenates</b> (nickeline) within gossans. Within subtropical and Arctic regions, {{it is unlikely}} gossans would be preserved or, if they are, would not contain carbonate minerals.|$|R
50|$|The nickel sulfides {{within the}} {{regolith}} have been oxidised into a complex series of weathering fronts including a rare {{expression of a}} carbonate front which {{has resulted in a}} host of unusual <b>nickel</b> carbonate, <b>arsenate</b> and silicate minerals such as gaspeite, atacamite, annabergite, carrboydite, glaucospaerite, hydrohonessite, kambaldaite, népouite, nullaginite, pecoraite, olivenite, otwayite, reevesite, retgersite, takovite and of course widgiemoolthalite.|$|R
40|$|Class II metallothioneins are sulfhydryl-containing, cysteine-rich, metal-binding {{proteins}} that sequester metal, thus preventing accumulation of potentially toxic forms of metal ions within the cell (Zhou et al., 1994). Metal ion binding occurs through {{the interactions of}} the ions with the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues (Erbe et al., 1995). The smt locus of Synechococcus PCC 7942 contains a metal-regulated gene, smtA (Morby et al., 1993). This operon encodes a class II metallothionein and a divergently transcribed repressor of smtA transcription, smtB (Morby et al., 1993). SmtB is a trans-acting repressor of expression from the smtA operator-promoter region. Metallothionein protein expression is dependent upon the interaction between these metal ions and the repressor protein which regulates the expression of metallothionein mRNA (Morby et al., 1993). Loss of the repressor gene, smtB, and subsequent unregulated transcription of smtA, {{has been shown to}} be advantageous to organisms constantly stressed with changing levels of cadmium, copper, lead, <b>nickel,</b> zinc, or <b>arsenate</b> (Gupta et al., 1993). These mutant strains, devoid of the functional repressor, show elevated levels of smtA messenger RNA even in the absence of a metal inducer. Another important resistance mechanism used by cells in response to a variety of environmenta...|$|R
5000|$|Nickel {{carbonate}} NiCO3•6H2O, hellyerite, crystallising {{with six}} water molecules, precipitates when an alkali bicarbonate {{is added to}} a Ni aqueous solution. Basic nickel carbonate, zaratite, with the formula Ni4CO3(OH)6(H2O)4, is produced when alkali carbonates are added to a nickel solution. Nickel phosphate, Ni3(PO4)2•7H2O is also insoluble. A number of other phosphates have been made, including nanoporous substances resembling zeolites named with [...] "Versailles Santa Barbara" [...] or VSB. The nanoporous nickel phosphates can accommodate sufficiently small molecules and selectively catalyse reactions on them. A <b>nickel</b> <b>arsenate,</b> Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O occurs as the mineral annabergite.|$|E
40|$|A B S TRA C T: The <b>nickel</b> <b>arsenate</b> KNiAsO 4 has a mica-like layer {{structure}} with surface charge densities similar to brittle micas. In contrast to micas it easily exchanges alkylammonium ions. The interlayers have paraffin-type chain arrangements, a in alkylammonium vermiculites and alkylamine smectites and vermiculites, {{but the very}} regular chain packing causes amarked odd/even alternation of the basal spacings. The reactions of KNiAsO 4 throw light on the exchange behaviour of micas...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the light}} blue beads (Mag-eu-lb 25) is {{coloured}} with lazurite/ultramarine (Fig.  4 a, b) and opacified with antimony. Lazurite {{in the form of}} natural mineral was detected in Islamic ceramic glazes and glass from the thirteenth–fifteenth century AD [40] but the synthetic form (ultramarine) was only in use since 1828 in Europe [41]. It is not possible to discriminate between the natural and synthetic forms of the pigment with the laser lines used, but the glass that the bead (lb 25) is made of has a high lead content (7.2 %) which differentiates it from the earlier beads series (before seventeenth century) from south Asia and the Middle East and is more similar to beads from the European series (Mag-eu-db 21 and Mag-eu-w 8) with low lead content. Mag-eu-db 1 is a low aluminium and high calcium glass with cobalt used as colourant. The associated elements with cobalt are <b>nickel,</b> <b>arsenate</b> (Co/As =  0.4) and bismuth (432.69  ppm), while cobalt blue from east of the Euphrates (such as cobalt in Zhizo beads) shows a higher ratio of Co/As (> 1) or is associated with a high iron and low manganese content (Mn/Fe <  0.1) as found in Jingdezhen glazes [29, 30]. Mag-eu-lb 1 and Mag-eu-lb 3 have the same glass composition as Mag-eu-db 1 and some of the white European beads (Mag-eu-w 5 - 7 - 10) without Ni, As, and Bi that are associated with cobalt. These beads all contain low Fe, Ti and high Sr (Table  2).|$|E
