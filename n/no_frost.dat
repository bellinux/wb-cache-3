25|$|The Mediterranean region {{occupies}} {{the rest of}} the peninsula (the greater part of it), as well as the Balearic Islands. The principal characteristic of the region is the existence of a quite lengthy period of summer drought, which may last anywhere from 2 to 4 months, but which, regardless of length, is always quite distinct. Rainfall can range from 1500mm to less than 350mm. Temperatures range from regions that have <b>no</b> <b>frost</b> for many years to those that reach -20°C, or even lower, every winter.|$|E
500|$|Storms and {{occasional}} cyclones also affect the island. Rainfall records are maintained {{in the north}} where rainfall is less than in the frequently cloud-shrouded mountains of the south. There can be wide variation in rainfall from year to year. July and August are the coldest months with average minimum temperatures of about [...] and <b>no</b> <b>frost.</b> Average maximum temperatures range from [...] in the winter to [...] in the summer. The humidity averages in the 60–70% range year round becoming more noticeable on warmer summer days than in the cooler winter months.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost <b>no</b> <b>frosts.</b> The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|R

60|$|That {{night was}} moonlight, cold, starry, {{with a silver}} sheen on the {{spectral}} spruces. During the night there came a change; it rained--first a drizzle, then a heavy downpour, and at five-thirty a roar of hail on the tent. This music did not last long. At seven o'clock the thermometer registered thirty-four degrees, but there was <b>no</b> <b>frost.</b> The morning was somewhat cloudy or foggy, with promise of clearing.|$|E

60|$|The {{bones were}} in a fair state of {{preservation}} and indicated by their intactness that the flesh had probably been picked from them by vultures as none was broken; but the pieces of equipment bore out the suggestion of their great age.

50|$|Salvia elegans has tubular red {{flowers and}} an {{attractive}} scent to the leaves {{that is similar}} to pineapple. It produces numerous erect leafy stems and flowers in the late autumn. The red flowers are attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies. In a highland temperate forest in central Mexico, pineapple sage was found {{to be one of the}} three most-visited species by hummingbirds.It is a short-day plant. The flowering season in Mexico is August onward; further north it may not flower till later autumn, and if there are <b>no</b> <b>frosts,</b> it may flower till spring.|$|R
60|$|Then deep in {{the earth}} the Fairies dwelt, and <b>no</b> <b>frost</b> or snow could harm the {{blossoms}} they tended. Every little seed was laid in the soft earth, watered, and watched. Tender roots were folded in withered leaves, that no chilling drops might reach them; and safely dreamed the flowers, till summer winds should call them forth; while lighter grew each Fairy heart, as every gentle deed was tenderly performed.|$|E
60|$|We {{struck out}} of the pines at half past five. Floating mist hid {{the lower end of}} the plateau. The morning had a cool touch but there was <b>no</b> <b>frost.</b> Crossing Middle Canyon about half way down we jogged on. Cedar trees began to show bright green against the soft gray sage. We were nearing the dark line of the cedar forest when Jim, who led, held up his hand in a warning check. We closed in around him.|$|E
60|$|By {{that time}} we had fairly {{commenced}} the fishery {{with a view to}} a winter supply. The weather was still delicious, and had begun to grow cool at nights, but as there was yet <b>no</b> <b>frost,</b> all the fish we took had to be hung up by the tail, and thus partially dried. Afterwards, when the frost fairly set in, this hanging process was dispensed with, for fish, once frozen in those regions, remain perfectly fresh during the entire winter, so that those eaten in spring are quite as good as those consumed in autumn.|$|E
5000|$|The average {{temperature}} in winter is 13.6 C. July is the coldest month {{with a mean}} temperature of 12.1 C. Frosts are uncommon, with some years recording <b>no</b> <b>frosts</b> at all. Usually, when frosts occur, they are light with temperatures rarely falling below -2 C. Winters are sunny, averaging 9-12 clear days and 9-12 overcast days per month. Snow is extremely rare, but in 2007, it reached the city center. There have been other episodes of sleet and snow in the mountains around the city, and in 2010, sleet was reported downtown again, a very rare event.|$|R
50|$|It is a shrub {{growing to}} 3 m tall. In climates with few to <b>no</b> <b>frosts,</b> this plant will grow larger and is semievergreen. Grown in climates with light to {{moderate}} freezing, plant will die {{back to the}} ground depending on cold, but will rebound in mid- to late spring. This species is more sensitive to cold than others. The leaves are bipinnate, 20-40 cm long, bearing three to 10 pairs of pinnae, each with six to 10 pairs of leaflets 15-25 mm long and 10-15 mm broad. The flowers are borne in racemes up to 20 cm long, each flower with five yellow, orange, or red petals. The fruit is a pod 6-12 cm long.|$|R

There was, however, <b>no</b> <b>frost</b> in the seaboard valleys, and at last Jimmy and his friends succeeded in hiring themselves to a contractor who was clearing land.|$|E

60|$|In {{the world}} to-day the genera of Reptiles are {{comparatively}} few and their distribution is very limited. They are more various, it is true, than are the few surviving {{members of the}} order of the amphibia which once in the Carboniferous period ruled the world. We still have the snakes, the turtles and tortoises (the Chelonia), {28} the alligators and crocodiles, and the lizards. Without exception they are creatures requiring warmth all the year round; they cannot stand exposure to cold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beings of the Mesozoic suffered under the same limitation. It was a hothouse fauna, living amidst a hothouse flora. It endured <b>no</b> <b>frosts.</b> But the world had at least attained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from the mud and swamp fauna and flora of the previous heyday of life upon earth.|$|R

60|$|Or else it {{is after}} moist and rainy weather that we notice how great a fall of leaves {{there has been}} in the night, though it may not yet be the touch that loosens the Rock-Maple leaf. The streets are thickly strewn with the trophies, and fallen Elm-leaves make a dark brown {{pavement}} under our feet. After some remarkably warm Indian-summer day or days, I perceive that it is the unusual heat which, more than anything, causes the leaves to fall, there having been, perhaps, <b>no</b> <b>frost</b> nor rain for some time. The intense heat suddenly ripens and wilts them, just as it softens and ripens peaches and other fruits, and causes them to drop.|$|E
60|$|The dusk Hetty had anxiously {{waited for}} was {{creeping}} across the prairie {{when she and}} Miss Schuyler pulled up their horses in the gloom of the birches where the trail wound down through the Cedar bluff. The weather had grown milder and great clouds rolled across the strip of sky between the branches overhead, while the narrow track amidst the whitened trunks was covered with loose snow. There was <b>no</b> <b>frost,</b> and Miss Schuyler felt unpleasantly clammy as she patted her horse, which moved restively now and then, and shook off the melting snow that dripped upon her; but Hetty seemed to notice nothing. She sat motionless in her saddle with the moisture glistening on her furs, and the thin white steam from the spume-flecked beast floating about her, staring up the trail, and when she turned and {{glanced over her shoulder}} her face showed white and drawn.|$|E
60|$|It was Christmas Eve, {{but there}} was <b>no</b> <b>frost,</b> or snow, or sparkle. It was a green Christmas, and the night was mild and dim, with hazy starlight. A little wind was {{laughing}} freakishly among the firs around Ingleside and rustling among the sere grasses along the garden walks. It {{was more like a}} night in early spring or late fall than in December; but it was Christmas Eve, and there was a light in every window of Ingleside, the glow breaking out through the whispering darkness like a flame-red blossom swung against the background of the evergreens; for the children were coming home for the Christmas reunion, as they always came--Fritz and Margaret and Laddie and Nora, and Robert's two boys in the place of Robert, who had died fourteen years ago--and the old house must put forth its best of light and good cheer to welcome them.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of an {{illustrated}} {{map of the}} town of Monrovia, Los Angeles, [s. d. ]. An aerial view of the town is pictured in the large frame at center with mountains visible in the background and the names of streets written in across the roads themselves.

60|$|When {{we stepped}} into the street next morning, the snow had ceased to fall, but the sky was magnificently, grandly savage. Great clouds in career across the valley {{momentarily}} caught and dung to the crags, but let fall <b>no</b> <b>frost,</b> and {{as the sun rose}} laggardly above the dazzlingly white wall, the snow-laden pines on the lower slopes appeared delicate as lace with distance. At intervals enormous masses of vapor, gray-white but richly shot with lavender, slid suddenly in, filling the amphitheater till all its walls were hid, then quite as suddenly shifted and streamed away. From time to time vistas opened toward the west, wondrous aisles of blinding splendor, highways leading downward to the glowing, half-hid, irridescent plain. In all my experience of the mountains I had never seen anything more gorgeous, more stupendous--what it must have meant to my bride, who had never seen a hill, I can only faintly divine.|$|E
60|$|It seemed his Genius {{discreet}} Worked on the Maker's own receipt, And made each tide {{and element}} Stewards of stipend and of rent; So {{that the common}} waters fell As costly wine into his well. He had so sped his wise affairs That he caught Nature in his snares. Early or late, the falling rain Arrived in time to swell his grain; Stream could not so perversely wind But corn of Guy's was there to grind: The siroc found it on its way, To speed his sails, to dry his hay; And the world's sun seemed to rise To drudge all day for Guy the wise. In his rich nurseries, timely skill Strong crab with nobler blood did fill; The zephyr in his garden rolled From plum-trees vegetable gold; And all the hours of the year With their own harvest honored were. There was <b>no</b> <b>frost</b> but welcome came, Nor freshet, nor midsummer flame. Belonged to wind and world the toil And venture, and to Guy the oil.|$|E
60|$|It {{was such}} a {{beautiful}} spot. Just inside the wall was a row of aspen poplars that always talked in silvery whispers and shook their dainty, heart-shaped leaves at him. Beyond them, under scattered pines, was a rockery where ferns and wild things grew. It was {{almost as good as}} a bit of woods--and Jims loved the woods, though he scarcely ever saw them. Then, past the pines, were roses just breaking into June bloom--roses in such profusion as Jims hadn't known existed, with dear little paths twisting about among the bushes. It seemed to be a garden where <b>no</b> <b>frost</b> could blight or rough wind blow. When rain fell it must fall very gently. Past the roses one saw a green lawn, sprinkled over now with the white ghosts of dandelions, and dotted with ornamental trees. The trees grew so thickly that they almost hid the house to which the garden pertained. It was a large one of grey-black stone, with stacks of huge chimneys. Jims had no idea who lived there. He had asked Aunt Augusta and Aunt Augusta had frowned and told him it did not matter who lived there and that he must never, on any account, mention the next house or its occupant to Uncle Walter. Jims would never have thought of mentioning them to Uncle Walter. But the prohibition filled him with an unholy and unsubduable curiosity. He was devoured by the desire to find out who the folks in that tabooed house were.|$|E
