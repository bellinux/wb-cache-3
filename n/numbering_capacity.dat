2500|$|The Russian Federal Service for Communications (Roskomnadzor) {{warned about}} a {{transition}} period as Russian operators {{have to change}} the <b>numbering</b> <b>capacity</b> and subscribers. Country code will be replaced from the Ukrainian +380 to Russian +7. Codes in Crimea start with 65, but in the area of [...] "7" [...] the 6 is given to Kazakhstan which shares former Soviet Union +7 with Russia, so city codes have to change. The regulator assigned 869 dialling code to Sevastopol {{and the rest of the}} peninsula received a 365 code. At the time of the unification with Russia, telephone operators and Internet service providers in Crimea and Sevastopol are connected to the outside world through the territory of Ukraine. Minister of Communications of Russia, Nikolai Nikiforov announced on his Twitter account that postal codes in Crimea will now have six-figures: to the existing five-digit number the number two will be added at the beginning. For example, the Simferopol postal code 95000 will become 295000.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998 {{the company}} began a project to create a digital {{transport}} network, which has become the technology platform {{for the development of}} communication services [...] "Central Telegraph". Under this project, the company has been allocated resource <b>numbering</b> <b>capacity</b> to connect subscribers: 213.5 thousand telephone numbers in the code [...] "095", which was replaced by the code [...] "495", 50 thousand rooms - in the code [...] "499" [...] in Moscow, and also 100 thousand numbers in the code [...] "498" [...] in the Moscow region. In 1999 {{the company began}} providing digital telephone services to subscribers in Moscow.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{popularity}} of multiple-SIM mobile phones in Brazil makes the country have more active mobile lines than inhabitants (as of November 2016, 248 million vs. 206 million), and by 2010 the country's most populous and economically important area code, 11 of metropolitan São Paulo (an area where over 20 million people live), was getting close to exhausting its available mobile numbers. Overlays and extra area codes were considered, but deemed confusing and impractical for local conditions. So, on December 10, 2010, ANATEL announced {{the inclusion of a}} ninth digit (in the format 9nnnn-nnnn) to mobile phone numbers used in the São Paulo metropolitan region (area code 11). This change was meant to increase the <b>numbering</b> <b>capacity</b> in metropolitan São Paulo from 44 million to 370 million, thereby eliminating the perennial shortage of available numbers in that area.|$|E
50|$|As of 1913, the Sunbury Water Company, which {{provides}} water to Sunbury, got its water from Little Shamokin Creek. A dam with five reservoirs was created on the creek, 1 mi east of Sunbury. Reservoir <b>Number</b> 1's <b>capacity</b> was 2,750,000 gallons. Reservoir <b>Number</b> 2's <b>capacity</b> was 2,180,000 gallons. It was {{located on the}} east bank of the creek. Reservoir <b>Number</b> 3's <b>capacity</b> was 1,900,000 gallons. It was also located on the east bank of the creek. Reservoir <b>Number</b> 4's <b>capacity</b> was 16,510,000 gallons.

5000|$|In Northern Ireland, the {{situation}} was more complicated. While {{the primary reason for}} the changes was the lack of <b>numbering</b> <b>capacity</b> in Belfast (01232), this was not the only reason. When STD codes were introduced in the 1950s, Northern Ireland was allocated only 14 area codes for 34 charging groups. Normal practice in Great Britain was to allocate one area code per charging group, but as calls to Northern Ireland were national rate from anywhere in GB, it was not seen to be necessary to differentiate between all of them. So, area codes covering multiple charge groups ("mixed" [...] areas) were created; in practice this meant that some areas had longer area codes. For example, while Enniskillen was allocated the area code 0365 (0EK5), Kesh was allocated 03656 and Lisnaskea 03657. As a result, numbers in Enniskillen could not begin with 6 or 7, as this would conflict with those of Kesh or Lisnaskea.|$|E

40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} on {{the impacts of}} closing a national dialling plan. It clarifies the differences between numbering plans and dialling plans, and shows that the closure of a dialling plan fosters a more efficient use of a numbering plan. The report draws the following conclusions: Closing the dialling plan facilitates more efficient use of the numbering plan as it releases additional numbers for use for operators, subscribers and services. Geographic significance in numbers is not automatically removed when closing the dialling plan. Removing the geographic significance in numbers fosters an even more efficient use of <b>numbering</b> <b>capacity</b> within a numbering plan. Closing the dialling plan may be a prerequisite for further possible evolution of a national numbering plan, {{but there is no}} link between a dialling plan and geographic numbering significance, i. e. a country may choose to close its dialling plan, but still keep the geographic significance of numbers. Although in many countries location portability is considered as a voluntary service aspect, closing the dialling plan and removal of geographic significance of numbers will widen the scope of location number portability to the whole country. This means that the geographic information of a number will graduall...|$|E
