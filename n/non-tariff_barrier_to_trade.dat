This mechanism of bargaining down the price of drugs on social justice grounds recently has been targeted by the US Department of Commerce as an unjustifiable <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> that should be eliminated in all OECD countries. Concerns have been raised that certain provisions in the AUSFTA may have been designed to achieve this end, in defiance of norms of democratic legitimacy, moral responsibility and the international right to health. Here we examine some implications of the UK House of Commons Report for the PBS in Australia. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Employing a {{model of}} an {{environmentally}} differentiated product market, we analyze how an emission regulation as non-tariff barriers to trade affects imports, the environment, and welfare {{in the case of}} a foreign Bertrand duopoly. Related to this issue, we reconsider the result of Moraga-González and Padrón-Fumero [Moraga-González, J. L., Padrón-Fumero, N., 2002. Environmental policy in a green market. Environmental and Resource Economics 22, 419 - 447] that a strict emission standard on a dirtier product degrades the environment and reduces the net social surplus associated with the valuation of environmental damage, if the marginal social valuation of environmental damage is larger. On the other hand, we show that a strict emission standard on a cleaner product always improves the environment and the net social surplus associated with the valuation of environmental damage.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{domestic}} product standards on the offshoring behavior of au-tomotive firms. In particular, we examine an important <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> within US fuel economy policy- the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) “Two-Fleet Rule”. By leveraging {{the removal of the}} two-fleet rule upon implementation of NAFTA, and exploiting a policy disconti-nuity based on vehicle characteristics, we present evidence that the costs of offshoring were reduced to a larger degree for varieties that were subject to US fuel economy rules. Specifically, we estimate that prices fell between 5 - 10 % for varieties subject to the CAFE Two-Fleet rule relative to varieties that were exempt from the rule. These effects are persistent, not present for manufacturers that did not offshore prior to NAFTA, and are robust to variety-specific trends. These effects also reconcile the post-NAFTA differences in implied compliance costs between cars and trucks for our treatment manufacturer (Chrysler). Overall, the results highlight the potential costs of regional enforcement of otherwise location-neutral product standards, which may act as a barrier to natural patterns of efficient specialization.

40|$|International trade {{can support}} {{economic}} development and social upliftment. However, people are often discouraged from contracting internationally due {{to the existence of}} differences in legal systems which act as a <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade.</b> This article focuses on the private law framework regulating international contracts of sale. During the twentieth century the problem of diverse laws was primarily addressed by global uniform law such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). However, uniform law is rarely complete and has to be supplemented by national law, trade usage or party agreement. Because there are gaps in the CISG the Swiss government has made a proposal for a new global contract law. But is this a feasible solution to the fragmentary state of international trade law? In Europe, signs of resistance are setting in against further harmonisation. The Proposal for a Common European Sales Law (CESL) was recently withdrawn, and now Britain has voted to leave the European Union. Rumour has it that more countries might follow. The current private law framework for international sales contracts consists of a hybrid system where international, national, state and non-state law function side by side. This article submits that universalism is not per se the most efficient approach to the regulation of international sales law and that economic forces require a more varied approach for business-to-business transactions. The biggest challenge, however, would be to manage global legal pluralism. It is concluded that contractual parties, the courts and arbitral tribunals can effectively manage pluralism on a case-by-case basis...|$|E
40|$|In {{reaction}} to modern protectionism, the European Union has reshaped its trade policy {{based on the}} principles of partnership and prioritisation. With the Market Access Partnership it has formalised a new diplomatic trade tool in third countries: the Market Access Teams. These teams are networks with multiple stakeholders and they are acting in a decentralised manner in the respective host countries. The various Market Access Teams created worldwide since 2007 underline the growing interest from the EU, Member States and businesses in offensive trade policy instruments. These instruments should be directed at opening foreign markets and eliminating obstacles to trade for European exporters. This paper analyses under what conditions Market Access Teams can effectively remove non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) for European exports in third countries. It focuses on non-tariff barriers for the European pharmaceutical industry in three Asian countries (Philippines, Indonesia and Japan). Pharmaceutical products are truly global products which are easy to transport and confronted by global competition and they heavily rely on European intellectual property rights knowledge. I argue that Market Access Teams in their composition and function are an adequate translation of the Commission’s strategic ambition to deliver more tangible results for European exporters through offensive trade policy. A Market Access Team is likely to be more successful, the greater the cohesiveness of its members, the more salient a <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> for the European Commission and the less salient that NTB in the host country.

40|$|The United States is {{the third}} largest {{consumer}} of seafood products in the world. The percentage of imported seafood consumed in the U. S. has steadily increased from 66 % in 1999 to over 84 % in 2009 (NOAA, 2010). Food safety, especially of imported foods and products from developing countries, has raised increasing concerns among American consumers and policy makers. Accordingly, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) (Ababouch et al. 2000) border inspection system is considered critical for ensuring the safety of domestic seafood consumers. However, the potential <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> posed by FDA regulations, especially for many developing country exporters have been frequently cited in the literature. This paper investigates trends and patterns in U. S. import detentions and refusals of seafood products between 2000 and 2010. Data from U. S. FDA import refusal report is used to uncover patterns of detainments and import refusals across major exporting countries, World Bank income classification and time. The analysis in this paper suggests that the FDA’s approach to food safety regulation for seafood at U. S. ports of entry does follow random selection based inspections. Instead, a system of Import Alerts results in targeted inspections and mandatory “flagging” of repeat code violation. We find evidence of increasing levels of seafood shipment detentions without physical examinations targeted at predominantly lower-middle income seafood exporting countries which make {{up the majority of}} the U. S. seafood supply.

40|$|International {{trade in}} Syria is highly {{regulated}} {{through a combination}} of tariffs and <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers.</b> At 8 % of the value of imports on average, effective tariffs are relatively low. However, <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> actually make Syria's trade restrictiveness very high. Comparing world and domestic prices of imports indeed suggests that <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> increase the domestic price of imported goods by 17 % on average, notably the result of significant quantitative restrictions. Using a computable general equilibrium model, the costs of NTBs on the Syrian economy are assessed. Simulations suggest that reallocation gains resulting from a complete removal of NTBs could be substantial. Accordingly, the key message from the analysis is that trade reform if it focuses only on tariff reduction will have limited growth benefits. On the contrary, if the Government abolishes the widespread <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade,</b> including the elimination of quantitative trade restrictions, trade policy can become the central instrument to redress Syria's growth prospects. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the {{relationship}} between exchange rates and traded goods prices typically find evidence of incomplete pass-through, usually explained by pricing-to-market behaviour. Although economic theory predicts that incomplete pass-through may also be linked <b>to</b> presence of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade,</b> variables reflecting such a link is rarely included in existing empirical models. In this paper, we estimate a pricing-to-market model for Norwegian import prices on textiles and wearing apparels, controlling explicitly for the removal of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> and the shift in imports from high-cost to low-cost countries through a Törnqvist price index based measure of foreign prices. We show that this measure of foreign prices unlike standard measures used in the literature is likely to produce unbiased estimates of the degree of pass-through, and thereby also the extent of pricing-to-market behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimated import price equation is reasonably stable and exhibits no serious forecasting failures. These findings contradict the hypothesis that pass-through has changed alongside trade policy shifts {{during the second half of}} the 1990 s and the monetary policy regime shift in 2001.

However, harmonization, in areas such as technical standards and professional services, is not pursued as a main goal by all RIAs. This is because not all RIAs pursue the same degree of economic integration. However, due to the fact that differences in national legislation in the above mentioned areas can constitute <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> and go against their ultimate goals, even RIAs pursuing lower levels of economic integration such as the formation of a free trade area (FTA) as NAFTA, have taken action directed towards the harmonization of their Member States legislation in the above mentioned areas.
