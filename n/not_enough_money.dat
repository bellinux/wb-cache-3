25|$|Five years later, in 1892, {{the church}} decided to {{demolish}} the original schoolhouse {{and replace it}} with the Parish House. The building was supposed to be cross-shaped, but that design could not be completed as there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to complete its construction. The addition of the Great Hall in the 1950s finally completed the original design. During that period, the church building itself also got a new heating system, carpet for the floor under the pews, and the current roof tiles.|$|E

In addition, in some cases bodies were not buried for days, because no one came to collect them.

Meanwhile, other diseases like malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea were not being treated properly because the health system was trying to deal with Ebola patients.

25|$|Debates {{over the}} party's policy on liquor divided the membership, forced the {{resignation}} {{of at least one}} leader, Hartley Dewart, and drove away many reform minded Liberals who supported the federal party under William Lyon Mackenzie King but found the provincial party too narrow and conservative to support. The party was so disorganized that it was led for seven years (and through two provincial elections) by an interim leader, W.E.N. Sinclair, as there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> or a sufficient level of organization, and too many divisions within the party to hold a leadership convention. By 1930, the Liberals were reduced to a small, rural and prohibitionist rump with a base in south western Ontario.|$|E

25|$|When {{there was}} <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> {{to buy food}} for the yeshiva students, Rabbi Wasserman {{traveled}} to America {{to raise money for}} the yeshiva. Rabbi Wasserman made an impression on many young Jews that he met while in the United States. Rabbi Wasserman returned to Poland although he knew his life was in danger by returning. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took a dim view of American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions.|$|E
25|$|The crusade went badly {{from the}} start – Theobald died in 1201 and the army that arrived at Venice {{in the summer of}} 1202 was one third the size that had been {{anticipated}} (4,500 knights, 9,000 squires, 20,000 men at-arms expected). Consequently, there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the aging and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt.). At the time, Venetian envoys were discussing trade terms with the Egyptians – but {{in the end it was}} decided that such discussions would have allowed them to deceive the Egyptians.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, Parliament {{gave the}} Museum Trustees a loan of £200,000 to {{purchase}} from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the Museum {{building in the}} five surrounding streets – Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street. The Trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the West, North and East sides of the Museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the Museum stands. The architect Sir John James Burnet was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down {{a few years after}} the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906–14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by King George V and Queen Mary in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, Chapman {{began writing}} a pirate film, Yellowbeard (1983), {{which came out}} of conversations between Chapman and Moon while in Los Angeles. Moon {{had always wanted to}} play Long John Silver, so Chapman began to write a script for him. Moon died in 1978 and the work stalled, {{eventually}} being rewritten by McKenna, then by Peter Cook. The film, which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate, also featured appearances from Cook, Marty Feldman, Cleese, Idle, Spike Milligan, and Cheech & Chong. It marks the last appearance of Feldman, who suffered a fatal heart attack in December 1982. The project was fraught with financial difficulties, and at times there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to pay the crew. It was released to mixed reviews. David Robinson, reviewing the film in The Times said [...] "the Monty Python style of comic anarchy requires more than scatology, rude words and funny faces." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Lusitania in 1915 created a wave of anti-German sentiment, and Gruban worried that he would find it {{difficult}} to find government work because of his nationality and thick German accent. He again contacted Booth, who again claimed to be friends with David Lloyd George and his secretary, Christopher Addison, and said that if Gruban put Booth on the Board of Directors he could [...] "do with the Ministry of Munitions what I like". Gruban immediately made Booth the chairman of his company, and over 3 months took £400 on expenses. He then claimed that this was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> for the work he did, and he should get a secret payment of 10% of the value of a contract known as the [...] "Birmingham Contract". The contract was worth £6,000, and Booth wrote a memo saying that he should have £580 or £600. Gruban refused, and Booth threw the note in the wastepaper basket. From that point onwards Booth worked {{as hard as he could}} to undermine Gruban's position, while outwardly appearing to be his friend.|$|E
500|$|Jiangshi, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Chinese vampires" [...] by Westerners, are corpses {{that are usually}} reanimated due to magical reasons. In ancient China, people always had the preference of being buried in their hometowns, and when a person dies in a land that is not their hometown, their family members hire a sorcerer to bring back their deceased family member. The family commissions the sorcerer in their village {{to travel to the}} place of the person's death, locate the corpse, and to write a spell and stick it upon the corpses's face, in which the spell-paper contains their name, birthdate, and some other words to reanimate the corpse. Once the paper is stuck upon the corpses's face, the newly created jiangshi would follow the sorcerer by hopping around, in which the sorcerer would lead it back to its hometown for burial (this was often a last-resort choice used by families with <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to hire a cart to carry the corpse back). Usually, the sorcerer would travel by night, and would at least have around three jiangshi traveling with it. But when the written spell-paper falls or is pulled off of the jiangshi (in the case the sorcerer is not paid the agreed amount for his doings, he might rip off the jiangshi's spell-paper), it gains its own consciousness, and all the power that the sorcerer formerly had over it would be lost. Instead of being an obedient corpse that followed the sorcerer, the jiangshi would be rampant and dangerous. The freed jiangshi would begin killing living creatures to absorb life essence (qì) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person's soul (魄 pò) fails to leave the deceased's body.|$|E

500|$|The Coinage Act of 1873 {{intentionally}} omitted language {{authorizing the}} coinage of “standard” silver dollars and ended the bimetallic standard {{that had been}} created by Alexander Hamilton. While the Coinage Act of 1873 stopped production of silver dollars, it was the 1874 adoption of Section 3568 of the Revised Statutes that actually removed legal tender status from silver certificates in the payment of debts exceeding five dollars. By 1875 business interests invested in silver (e.g., Western banks, mining companies) wanted the bimetallic standard restored. People began {{to refer to the}} passage of the Act as the Crime of '73. Prompted by a sharp decline in the value of silver in 1876, Congressional representatives from Nevada and Colorado, states responsible for over 40% of the world’s silver yield in the 1870s and 1880s, began lobbying for change. Further public agitation for silver use was driven by fear that there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> in the community. Members of Congress claimed ignorance that the 1873 law would lead to the demonetization of silver, despite having had three years to review the bill prior to enacting it to law. Some blamed the passage of the Act on a number of external factors including a conspiracy involving foreign investors and government conspirators. In response, the Bland–Allison Act, as it came to be known, was passed by Congress (over a Presidential veto) on 28 February 1878. [...] It did not provide for the [...] "free and unlimited coinage of silver" [...] demanded by Western miners, but it did require the United States Treasury to purchase between $2 million and $4 million of silver bullion per month from mining companies in the West, to be minted into coins.|$|E
2500|$|Genre {{pictures}} made at {{very low}} cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000.

[...] Among the established studios, Monogram was exploring fresh territory with what were being called [...] "exploitation pictures." [...] Variety defined these as [...] "films with some timely or currently controversial subject which can be exploited, capitalized on in publicity or advertising." [...] Many smaller Poverty Row firms were folding because there simply was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to go around: the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, were now [...] "taking in around 95 percent of all domestic (U.S. and Canada) rental receipts."

2500|$|Only part of {{the church}} could be built immediately, because <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> was {{available}} at first.

[...] John Crawley died just before the opening; his architectural practice was taken over by Joseph S. Hansom, who carried out the second phase of building in 1887. [...] This added to the nave at the west end, increasing the capacity. [...] Rev Charles Dawes was the benefactor for this extension. [...] More work was undertaken in 1914–1915 when the north aisle was extended and a Lady chapel was added. [...] After this was opened on 24 February 1915, the church was officially finished.
