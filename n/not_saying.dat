5|$|Betty {{is shown}} enjoying {{her new life}} in London and she later runs into Daniel in Trafalgar Square. They talk and Daniel apologizes for <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> goodbye, before asking Betty out to dinner. Betty then jokingly asks if he needs {{something}} to do, she {{is looking for a}} new assistant and Daniel tells her that he might submit his resume. As Betty then heads off to work across Trafalgar Square, the series title is superimposed onto the scene; after a moment, Ugly disappears.|$|E

25|$|This {{does not}} mean that Sanders {{believes}} God’s knowledge of the future is “limited” as some critics have charged. Rather, Sanders holds that what is referred to as “the” future is not an ontological reality—it does not exist. If it is does not exist then there is literally “no thing” or actuality for God to know. Open theists are <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> that there is a reality about which God is ignorant (which would be limited omniscience). The denial that God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events has been the single most controversial aspect of open theism.|$|E

25|$|The {{reactions}} {{by modern}} readers to his poetry have varied widely. The papyrologists and historians that first examined them were not impressed. Influenced by their backgrounds in Classical poetry, they compared the Dioscorian verses primarily to Classical standards. The most frequent objection {{was that his}} verses were obscure: the editors thought that the lines did not make sense – or at least, were <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> what the editors expected them to say. A more positive assessment was offered by Leslie MacCoull, who insisted that a reader must take Dioscorus’s Coptic background into consideration when reading the poetry. Many of the poems seemed to be praising unknown dignitaries – including an Emperor and several Dukes – and some papyrologists concluded that Dioscorus wrote the poems to get favors from government administrators (whom the papyrologists vaguely and inconsistently identified). Clement Kuehn, however, proposed that the poems be viewed not from a Classical, Hellenistic, or even a strictly Egyptian perspective, but through a lens of Byzantine culture and spirituality, in which Dioscorus and the Thebaid were so deeply immersed. Kuehn demonstrated that the poems fit neatly and masterfully into the allegorical style that was pervasive in the pictoral art and literature of the Early Byzantine Era. That is: Dioscorus, influenced by allegorical commentaries on the Homeric epics and Bible, and by the allegorical icons and church art of the 6th century, was praising Christ, Old Testament patriarchs, and the saints in heaven {{as if they were}} the Emperor, kings, and dignitaries in a Byzantine court.|$|E
