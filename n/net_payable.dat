50|$|Under {{this the}} service {{provider}} helps the client consolidate its receivables and payable positions across {{the countries of}} operation, across various currencies and reports a <b>net</b> <b>payable</b> / receivable position in each currency. This is very useful is taking business decisions on FX and capital management. Rather than purchasing the required currency in small bits and pieces across the globe, the treasury can negotiate better rates for a consolidated open position.|$|E
50|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of the ISDA Master Agreement is that the Master Agreement and all the Confirmations entered into under it form a single agreement. This is very important (especially for regulated financial companies) as it allows the parties to an ISDA Master Agreement to aggregate the amounts owing by each of them under all of the Transactions outstanding under that ISDA Master Agreement and replace them with a single <b>net</b> amount <b>payable</b> by one party to the other. Netting, dealt with under section 2(c) of the ISDA Master Agreement, allows the parties to <b>net</b> out amounts <b>payable</b> on the same day and in the same currency.|$|R
50|$|This single {{agreement}} {{concept is}} integral to the structure and forms part of the netting based protection offered by the master agreement. The fact that all transactions are the one contract reinforces the ability to close out those transactions {{and come up with}} a single <b>net</b> amount <b>payable</b> if a default occurs.|$|R
5000|$|All mineral {{and gold}} {{production}} on {{public and private}} lands in Nevada is subject to a <b>Net</b> Royalty <b>payable</b> to the State. The gross proceeds {{from the sale of}} minerals minus allowable deductions determine the taxable net proceeds. If the net proceeds from sales by a mine in the taxable year total $4 million or more, the tax rate is 5%. For less profitable mines the tax rate is graduated down to 2%. Miners' net proceeds are also subject to federal corporate income tax of 35%.|$|R
5000|$|The above only applies in {{relation}} to the 1992 Master Agreement. The 2002 Master Agreement did away with First and Second method. In practice First Method was very rarely opted for because its use required the relevant financial institutions to report their gross, rather than net, exposure under the Master Agreement. The 2002 Master Agreement also replaced the distinction between Market Quotation and Loss with a single concept, [...] "Close-out Amount". This is determined in respect of each Terminated Transaction and is, broadly, the profit or loss which would be made in incurred on entering into an equivalent Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. The aggregate of the Close-out Amounts and Unpaid Amounts {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Early Termination Amount". This is the <b>net</b> amount <b>payable</b> by one party to the other in respect of the Terminated Transactions.|$|R
40|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970 's the attempt to {{rationalize}} multinational corporations 2 Ì† 019 (MNCs) short-term liquid funds management {{led to the development}} and implementation of so-called "Netting Systems": In order to reduce the costs associated with transferring inter-affiliate payments, the idea behind these systems is to <b>net</b> out <b>payables</b> and receivables so that only this netted amount needs be transferred. Depending upon the MNCs' internal payments structure there are two possible ways of determining these fund flows: In case affiliates just sell back and forth to each other, a bilateral netting approach will suffice. Generally, though, more complex interdependencies among MNCs'-subsidiaries call for a multilateral netting system to be presented here. While scientific publications on international cash management problems have brought up applications of a great variety of methodological approaches (1), in my opinion the problem outlined above has proven to be highly suggestive to mathematical programming techniques. Starting out I will therefore describe a classical transportation-type approach (chapter 2), then develop a modified linear program (LP) in chapter 3 along with a numerical example (chapter 4), and finally draw some conclusions in chapter 5...|$|R
30|$|The SAM {{built for}} this study {{included}} sixty-four commodities and sixty-four activities, 2 four value-added components (compensation of employees, mixed income, gross operating surplus, and indirect net taxes) and four institutional sectors (households, firms, government, {{and the rest of}} the world). Insertion of financial accounts into the SAM requires the inclusion of flows related to capital accounts and financial asset (or liability) accounts (Emini and Fofack 2004) by each Institutional Sector. More specifically, net savings by institutional sector is a balance of incomes and expenditures. Together with net capital transfers (receivables and <b>payables),</b> <b>net</b> savings by institutional sector is used to accrue the non-financial flows (United Nations 2008). The resulting surplus or deficit is the net lending or borrowing, and this figure is the balancing item to move forward from the capital accounts to the financial accounts. In contrast, the financial accounts do not have any balancing item carried forward to other accounts.|$|R
