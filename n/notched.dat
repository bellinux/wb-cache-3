Previous studies show that <b>NOTCH</b> 3 protein forms multimers.

40|$|<b>Notch</b> signal {{transduction}} is evolutionarily conserved with essential functions identified in numerous species from C. elegans to H. Sapiens. <b>Notch</b> is critical during embryonic development, in the adult, and in cancer. In mammals {{there are four}} <b>Notch</b> receptors; much of our understanding of <b>Notch</b> signalling comes {{from the study of}} <b>NOTCH</b> 1. During embryogenesis, <b>Notch</b> 1 is widely expressed and is required in numerous processes including blood vessel formation and remodelling (angiogenesis). The view of <b>Notch</b> {{signal transduction}}, achieved primarily through studying <b>NOTCH</b> 1, is that <b>Notch</b> receptors undergo processing and are transported to the cell surface as a heterodimer. Ligand binding triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages leading to the release of the <b>Notch</b> intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription. In contrast to <b>NOTCH</b> 1, little is known about <b>NOTCH</b> 4; <b>Notch</b> 4 is expressed in endothelial cells of the circulatory system, trans-activation by ligand is difficult to detect, and a phenotype in mice, reported to be null for <b>Notch</b> 4 (<b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele), has not been identified. Here, further analysis of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 has revealed many features that are in contrast to <b>NOTCH</b> 1 : (i) unprocessed <b>NOTCH</b> 4 was present on the cell surface, (ii) ligand did not trans-activate <b>NOTCH</b> 4 signalling, (iii) <b>NOTCH</b> 4 inhibited <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signal transduction in a dose dependent manner, (iv) <b>NOTCH</b> 4 induced the differentiation of myoblasts, and (v) subcellular localisation of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 was different to <b>NOTCH</b> 1, and coexpression resulted in <b>NOTCH</b> 1 adopting the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 pattern of localisation. In addition, postnatal retinal angiogenesis was examined in mice carrying the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele. A delay in the expansion of the retinal vasculature was equally observed in both <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 +/- and <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 -/- mice. This suggested that <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 was not a null allele. Fittingly, the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele produced transcripts that encode for much of the extracellular domain of <b>NOTCH</b> 4. The expression pattern of this transcript was equivalent to <b>Notch</b> 4 in mouse embryos. Like full length <b>NOTCH</b> 4, expression of a cDNA based on this transcript also inhibited <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signal transduction. These studies reveal {{for the first time a}} function for <b>NOTCH</b> 4 that is, as an inhibitor of <b>NOTCH</b> 1. Accordingly it is postulated that <b>Notch</b> 4 will have a crucial function in angiogenesis, since <b>Notch</b> 1 is required for angiogenesis and <b>Notch</b> 4 is expressed in endothelial cells of the circulatory system...|$|R

Here we examine development in embryos expressing various combinations of <b>Notch</b> 1 mutant alleles. Mice homozygous for the hypomorphic <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f allele, which removes the single O -fucose glycan in epidermal growth factor-like repeat 12 (EGF 12) of the <b>Notch</b> 1 ligand binding domain (lbd), exhibit reduced growth after weaning and defective T cell development. Mice homozygous for the inactive <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd allele express <b>Notch</b> 1 missing an ~ 20 kDa internal segment including the canonical <b>Notch</b> 1 ligand binding domain, and die at embryonic day ~E 9. 5. The embryonic and vascular phenotypes of compound heterozygous <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd embryos were compared with <b>Notch</b> 1 +/ 12 f, <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / 12 f, and <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos. Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from these embryos were also examined in <b>Notch</b> signaling assays. While <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling was stronger in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compound heterozygotes compared to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos and ES cells, <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling was even stronger in embryos carrying <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f and a null <b>Notch</b> 1 allele.

However, vascular defects in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac were severe and similar to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd yolk sac. By contrast, vascular disorganization was milder in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compared to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos. The expression of <b>Notch</b> 1 target genes was low in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac and embryo head, whereas Vegf and Vegfr 2 transcripts were increased. The severity of the compound heterozygous <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac phenotype suggested that the allelic products may functionally interact. By contrast, compound heterozygotes with <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f in combination with a <b>Notch</b> 1 null allele (<b>Notch</b> 1 tm 1 Con) were capable of surviving to birth. Conclusions <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compound heterozygous embryos is more defective than in compound heterozygotes expressing a hypomorphic <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f allele and a <b>Notch</b> 1 null allele.

40|$|AbstractNotch 4 is a {{divergent}} {{member of}} the <b>Notch</b> family of receptors that is primarily expressed in the vasculature. Its expression implies an important role for <b>Notch</b> 4 in the vasculature; however, mice homozygous for the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 knockout allele are viable. Since {{little is known about}} the role of <b>Notch</b> 4 in the vasculature and how it functions, we further investigated <b>Notch</b> 4 in mice and in cultured cells. We found that the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele is not null as it expresses a truncated transcript encoding most of the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 extracellular domain. In cultured cells, <b>NOTCH</b> 4 did not signal in response to ligand. Moreover, <b>NOTCH</b> 4 inhibited signalling from the <b>NOTCH</b> 1 receptor. This is the first report of cis-inhibition of signalling by another <b>Notch</b> receptor. The <b>NOTCH</b> 4 extracellular domain also inhibits <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signalling when expressed in cis, raising the possibility that reported <b>Notch</b> 4 phenotypes may not be due to loss of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 function. To better address the role of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 in vivo, we generated a <b>Notch</b> 4 null mouse in which the entire coding region was deleted. <b>Notch</b> 4 null mice exhibited slightly delayed vessel growth in the retina, consistent with our novel finding that <b>NOTCH</b> 4 protein is expressed in the newly formed vasculature.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Notch</b> {{signaling}} {{is highly}} conserved in the metazoa and {{is critical for}} many cell fate decisions. <b>Notch</b> activation occurs following ligand binding to <b>Notch</b> extracellular domain. In vitro binding assays have identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats 11 and 12 as the ligand binding domain of Drosophila <b>Notch.</b> Here we show that an internal deletion in mouse <b>Notch</b> 1 of EGF repeats 8 – 12, including the putative ligand binding domain (lbd), is an inactivating mutation in vivo. We also show that maternal and zygotic <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd mutant embryos develop through gastrulation to mid-gestation. Results <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos died at mid-gestation with a phenotype indistinguishable from <b>Notch</b> 1 null mutants. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd was expressed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to wild type <b>Notch</b> 1, but Delta 1 binding was reduced to {{the same level as}} in <b>Notch</b> 1 null cells. In an ES cell co-culture assay, <b>Notch</b> signaling induced by Jagged 1 or Delta 1 was reduced to a similar level in <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd and <b>Notch</b> 1 null cells. However, the <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd allele was expressed similarly to wild type <b>Notch</b> 1 in <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd ES cells and embryos at E 8. 75, indicating that <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling is not essential for the <b>Notch</b> 1 gene to be expressed. In addition, maternal and zygotic <b>Notch</b> 1 mutant blastocysts developed through gastrulation.

However, the <b>Notch</b> 4 mutation displayed genetic interactions with a targeted mutation of the related <b>Notch</b> 1 gene.

Together, these findings infer that <b>Notch</b> 2 and <b>Notch</b> 3 act together to govern vascular development and smooth muscle differentiation.

We used genetic deletion to define receptor roles on stem cell function, cell proliferation/differentiation, and repair after injury. Loss of <b>Notch</b> 1 induced a transient secretory cell hyperplasia that spontaneously resolved over time. In contrast, deletion of <b>Notch</b> 2 had no secretory cell effect. Compound deletions of <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 2 resulted in a more severe secretory cell hyperplasia than deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1 alone. Furthermore, only double deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 2 decreased cell proliferation, suggesting a low threshold for maintenance of proliferation compared to differentiation. Stem cells were affected by deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1, with reduced expression of Olfm 4 and fewer LGR 5 + stem cells. Deletion of <b>Notch</b> 2 had no apparent affect on stem cell homeostasis. However, we observed impaired crypt regeneration after radiation in both <b>Notch</b> 1 - and <b>Notch</b> 2 -deleted intestine, suggesting that higher <b>Notch</b> activity is required post-injury.

40|$|EBNA 2 is {{essential}} for immortalization of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus. EBNA 2 is tethered to responsive promoters through a cellular factor, CBF 1.

However, <b>Notch</b> 2 is the predominant form expressed in spleen. The degree to which these <b>Notch</b> homologs are functionally convergent is not known. We present evidence that <b>Notch</b> 2 also signals through CBF 1. As {{is the case for}} <b>Notch</b> 1, <b>Notch</b> 2 interacted with the minimal repression domain of CBF 1 and was targeted to CBF 1 through the intracellular, subtransmembrane domain. Additional characterization suggested that the interaction domain of <b>Notch</b> may be bipartite. The intracellular domain of <b>Notch</b> 2 (<b>Notch</b> 2 IC) located to the nucleus. This activated form of <b>Notch</b> 2 transactivated expression of a target gene containing upstream CBF 1 binding sites. The use of CBF 1 mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the transcriptional repression domain revealed that activation of gene expression by <b>Notch</b> 2 is also based on masking of CBF 1 -mediated repression. Targeting of <b>Notch</b> 1 and targeting of <b>Notch</b> 2 were found to be identical and distinguishable from targeting by EBNA 2.

ChIP-seq studies show a high concordance of functional <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 3 genomic binding sites that are enriched in binding motifs for RBPJ, the transcription factor that recruits activated <b>Notch</b> to DNA. The interchangeability of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 3 was confirmed by rescue of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 -dependent T-ALL cells with activated <b>NOTCH</b> 3 and vice versa. Despite remarkable overall similarity, there are nuanced differences in chromatin landscapes near critical common <b>Notch</b> target genes, most notably at a Notch-dependent enhancer that regulates MYC, which correlates with responsiveness to <b>Notch</b> pathway inhibitors. Overall, a common oncogenomic program driven by binding of either <b>Notch</b> is sufficient to maintain T-ALL cell growth, whereas cell-context specific differences appear to influence the response of T-ALL cells to <b>Notch</b> inhibition...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>NOTCH</b> {{signaling}} can exert oncogenic or tumor suppressive {{functions and}} {{can contribute to}} chemotherapy resistance in cancer. In this study, we aimed to clarify the clinicopathological significance and the prognostic and predictive value of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression in gastric cancer (GC). METHODS <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was determined immunohistochemically in 142 primarily resected GCs using tissue microarrays and in 84 pretherapeutic biopsies from patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The results were correlated with survival, response to therapy, and clinico-pathological features. RESULTS Primarily resected patients with <b>NOTCH</b> 1 -negative tumors demonstrated worse survival. High <b>NOTCH</b> 1 expression was associated with early-stage tumors and with significantly increased survival in this subgroup. Higher <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was associated with early-stage and intestinal-type tumors and with better survival in the subgroup of intestinal-type tumors. In pretherapeutic biopsies, higher <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was more frequent in non-responding patients, but these differences were statistically not significant. CONCLUSION Our findings suggested that, in particular, <b>NOTCH</b> 1 expression indicated good prognosis in GC. The close relationship of high <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression with early tumor stages may indicate a tumor-suppressive role of <b>NOTCH</b> signaling in GC. The role of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 in neoadjuvantly treated GC is limited...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>NOTCH</b> {{activation}} plays oncogenic {{roles in}} acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). However, whether <b>NOTCH</b> is oncogenic or tumor-suppressive in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is still controversial. Herein, {{the roles of}} <b>NOTCH</b> in AML are reviewed. AML cells express <b>NOTCH</b> and <b>NOTCH</b> ligands; however, cell-autonomous activation is not observed. Activating <b>NOTCH</b> 1 mutations are rare in AML, unlike in T-ALL. <b>NOTCH</b> ligand stimulation generally suppresses the in vitro growth of AML cells but promotes transient growth of some samples. Conversely, knockdown of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 {{does not affect the}} growth of AML cells, whereas it suppresses the growth of T-ALL cells. These findings suggest that <b>NOTCH</b> is dispensable or suppressive for AML cell growth. However, the effects of <b>NOTCH</b> differ depending on cell conditions, and various stemness-relate...|$|R
40|$|The test to {{investigate}} the elastic-plastic strain behavior ahead of <b>notch</b> in plate specimen with <b>notches</b> made of steel by using strain gages under tensile monotonic load is conducted. Two kind of specimens made of SS 400 material are used. One kind of specimen is specimens with three kind of <b>notch</b> root radius and constant <b>notch</b> depth. Another kind of specimen is those with three kind of <b>notch</b> depth and constant <b>notch</b> root radius. From test result, we show the relation between strain and distance from <b>notch</b> root. Next we show the relation between strain ratio and nondimensional distance from <b>notch</b> root.
