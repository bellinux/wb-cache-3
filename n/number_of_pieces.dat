5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act {{did much to}} end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
5|$|From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries {{the art of}} the Picts is {{primarily}} known through stone sculpture, and a smaller <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> of metalwork, often of very high quality. After the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, elements of Pictish art became incorporated into the style known as Insular art, which was common over Britain and Ireland and became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of Romanesque styles.|$|E
5|$|No complete, {{unambiguous}} {{description of}} the rules of a tafl game exists, but the king's objective was to escape to (variously) the board's periphery or corners, while the greater force's objective was to capture him. Although the size of the board and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> varied, all games involved a distinctive 2:1ratio of pieces, with the lesser side having a king-piece that started in the centre.|$|E
50|$|Space Shogi follows {{standard}} shogi conventions, {{including the}} same types and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces,</b> and a similar initial setup. All the normal shogi rules apply, including drops, promotion, check, checkmate, and impasse. But pieces have the freedom of three-dimensional movement.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the house}} passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of {{restoration}} and re-creation have been undertaken and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the film}} {{featured}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> of classical music, {{as the main}} Bond girl, Kara Milovy, is a cellist. Mozart's 40th Symphony in G minor (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin's String Quartet in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (in Vienna) also features. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practising the Cello solo from the first movement of Dvořák's cello concerto in B minor. At {{the end of the}} film, Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
50|$|Trishogi has {{the same}} types and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> as shogi, and all normal shogi rules apply, {{including}} initial setup (see diagram), drops, promotion, check, and checkmate. As in shogi, pieces capture {{the same as they}} move. But the triangular geometry creates special move patterns for the pieces.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{original}} Eternity puzzle, {{it is easy}} to find large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> ways to place substantial <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> on the board whose edges all match, making it seem that the puzzle is easy. However, given the low expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible solutions, it is presumably astronomically unlikely that any given partial solution will lead to a complete solution.|$|R
50|$|Hexshogi has {{the same}} types and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> as shogi, and all normal shogi rules apply, {{including}} a similar initial setup (see diagram), drops, promotion, check, checkmate, and impasse. As in shogi, pieces capture {{the same as they}} move. But the hexagonal geometry implies special move patterns for the pieces.|$|R
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> available.|$|E
5|$|The Garden Lobby of Althorp also {{contains}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> of porcelain from reputable European manufacturers, but also several rare Oriental pieces. Of note in the Garden Lobby aside from its many plates is a Sèvres tobacco jar with double strap handles, believed to be painted by Louis Jean Thévenet in 1765, two Chelsea vases decorated with putti which metaphorically represent the four seasons, which the Red Earl had bought {{as a gift for}} his wife Charlotte, an extremely finely carved Meissen flower bowl with hundreds of tiny gilded blooms which dates to around 1745, a Meissen card box, and a blue and gold cherubic Meissen chocolate set-for-one which was believed to have been made for Marie Antoinette in 1781 as a present celebrating the birth of her son Dauphin.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the ruins}} are {{accessed}} via the modern town of Tecpán Guatemala, which replaced Iximche {{when it was}} destroyed. The modern entrance to the site is on the northern side of the ruins and includes visitor parking, a small museum, a picnic area and a football field, {{as well as the}} custodian's house. In an area of woodland to the south of the central portion of the ruins is a modern ceremonial area used by the modern Kaqchikel to carry out their rituals. This ceremonial area is linked to the ruins by a footpath and includes six concrete altars arranged around an unexcavated building. Flowers, food and drink are placed on these altars as sacrifices. The museum displays a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> from the site, including sculptures and ceramics.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{variants}} of chess {{on a smaller}} board with reduced <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> have been solved.

50|$|The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> {{produced}} started declining after 1850, {{but still}} {{continued to be}} manufactured {{until the end of}} the century when the fashion ended. Around the start of the decline or just before there appears to have been a shift towards designing the jewellery in a more gothic style.|$|R

5|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 1900s Ravel had {{established}} a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra. He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> published and performed. There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters. The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs, orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).|$|E
5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and Go, have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces,</b> or both.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E
