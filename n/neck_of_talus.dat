Here we present a case of osteoid osteoma of <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>talus</b> which was presented as ankle pain. It puzzled us until MRI was done. Diagnostic dilemma and delay can be avoided by high index of suspicion. The patient was treated with open removal of the tumor.

40|$|Talar body {{injuries}} are rare, particularly in children. To our knowledge, {{there has not}} been a single case report of bilateral talus fracture in a child till date. We report two cases of fracture bilateral talus in children. The f irst case is of a fracture separation of the distal tibial epiphysis and a fracture of the body of the talus with subluxation of ankle on right side and a fracture <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>talus</b> on left side. The second is fracture bilateral talus with epiphyseal injury of left distal tibia. A minimal or undisplaced fracture of talus is less likely to undergo avascular necrosis than a displaced fracture but even with optimal treatment, avascular necrosis may still occur. It is of prime significance that these fractures should be diagnosed well in time to avert complications. Therefore an appropriate length of follow-up is required. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{congenital}} clubfoot, residual deformities are not well-documented {{and they}} may change depending on different treatments. To identify the treatment that provides better outcome at maturity, we studied the computed tomography of two cohorts of patients affected with congenital clubfoot who were treated using two distinct protocols. Forty-seven clubfeet were treated according to the traditional protocol of our hospital and 61 were treated according to the Ponseti technique. The normal feet of the unilateral deformities served as controls. All patients were followed to skeletal maturity. The ankle torsion angle and the declination angle <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> were higher than normal but different only in patients treated with the traditional method. The calcaneocuboid angle was lower but only in patients treated with the Ponseti method. The shape of the talar joints was altered in many feet regardless of protocol. The CT images suggest the modifications of the torsion angle of the ankle, the declination angle <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus,</b> and the calcaneocuboid angle at maturity {{are related to the}} treatment protocol followed.

30|$|Gallie [12] first {{described}} the posterior approach to subtalar joint arthrodesis with insertion of bone {{block from the}} tibia without fixation in 1943. Carr et al. [4] later modified the technique by using an iliac crest graft and fully threaded screw fixation, this technique being similarly advocated by others [1, 3, 4]. However, some authors have also used either partially threaded or fully threaded screws placed with a lag technique for definitive fixation [5, 6, 22]. Different hardware configurations have been described to transfix the arthrodesis; this includes several single screw configurations and double parallel or divergent screws [9]. There are advantages and disadvantages described for each technique. Gable et al. cited a preference for placement of the screw from the posterior calcaneal tuberosity because it eliminates potential problems associated with screw placement from the dorsal <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> into the calcaneum. The talar neck approach may cause anterior ankle impingement or a stress riser at the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> that would necessitate hardware removal. This approach also can jeopardize the blood supply to the talus, causing avascular necrosis of the talar head [11, 18]. In addition, Hutchinson [16] reported the advantage of increased density in the cancellous bone <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> {{when compared with the}} calcaneum, theoretically offering more compression strength with the posterior calcaneal screw fixation approach.|$|R

40|$|Indians {{are known}} to be {{habitual}} squatters. The habitual squatting is known to cause anatomical changes {{over a period of time}} in the bones which participate in such extreme actions. In squatting the subtalar joint is involved more than any other joint.

40|$|Injuries in {{the region}} of the ankle joint are {{commonly}} encountered in clinical practice. The patient often presents with a history of inversion sprain of the ankle, resulting in symptoms of pain and discomfort. This sort of injury is often seen in sports injuries and is relatively commonly seen in the general clinical practice in other patient populations. Initial diagnoses are based in the belief that {{it is one of the}} three well known lateral ligaments of the ankle which are weaker and therefore become injured; most commonly the anterior talo-fibular ligament is implicated. However the cervical ligament <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> is often overlooked in differential diagnoses, which if ignored may leave the patient with an inherently weak lateral ankle and prone to recurring injury...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ideally, bone has the {{external}} shape and internal architecture best adapted to its function. The internal architec-ture <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> should reflect its functional adaptations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the orientation of lamellae to account for its role in transmission of various forces. Method: Twenty-five pairs of dry adult human tali were sectioned in various planes and dissected grossly to study the internal archi-tecture <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> Results: Two sets of lamellae were observed in the body <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> One set was descending from the poste-rior two-thirds of the lateral part of trochlear surface onto the posterior calcaneal facet <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> These lamellae were in the form of vertical perforated interconnected plates. The second set of trabeculae originated from medial part of trochlear surface and anterior third of the lateral part. The <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> showed the continuity of sagittal plates extending from the body to the head, which was occupied by stacked curved plates extending from infero-medial to the supero-lateral part of the head. Conclusion: We identified two sets of lamellae which we believe reflect the lines of forces of weightbearing through the talus. Clinical Relevance: These findings may help in better understanding of fracture lines in the talus,which could improve internal fixation techniques, and the design of talar prostheses...|$|R
30|$|The applied {{surgical}} {{anatomy of}} the calcaneus is complex due to the multifaceted nature of the bone and its articulations with the cuboid and the talus. The calcaneus {{is made up of}} a superior articular surface comprising three articulating facets—a posterior, middle and anterior. The sustentaculum tali is a medial bony projection supporting the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> The sinus tarsi is a calcaneal groove comprising the anterior and middle facet and the talar sulcus. Benirschke et al. [3] discuss anatomical features relevant to the understanding of managing calcaneal fractures. The lateral side of the calcaneus and its flat nature is highlighted as the most advantageous for internal fixation, but the poor soft tissue cover challenges wound healing. The medial wall is associated closely with the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle and its branches making the surgical approach challenging. The sustentaculum tali is thought to be the most stable part of the calcaneus and relies on supporting tendons in maintaining its anatomical position in most fractures [3, 4, 5].|$|R
40|$|Objective:To {{analyze the}} {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> patients with <b>talus</b> fractures and the injuries that they present. Methods:Retrospective analysis on patients hospitalized in the Institute of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital das Clínicas, School of Medicine of the University of São Paulo, between 2006 and 2011, with talus fractures. Patient profile parameters, risk factors, fracture characteristics, treatment data and acute complications were analyzed. Results:Analysis on 23 cases showed that {{men were more}} affected than women, with a ratio of 4. 8 : 1. The most frequent trauma mechanism was traffic accidents, followed by falls from a height. The most frequent type of fracture was at the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus,</b> with 17 cases. Among the 23 cases, seven had peritalar dislocation {{at the time of}} presentation, four had exposed fractures and 11 presented other associated fractures. The mean length of time between the trauma and the definitive treatment was six days, while the mean length of hospital stay was 11 days. Three patients presented acute postoperative complications.

In almost half of the cases, there were other associated fractures. The length of hospital stay was 11 days...|$|R
40|$|The term {{congenital}} vertical talus {{is applied}} to a severe congenital deformity of the foot, which resembles club foot (talipes equino-cavo-varus) in that the heel is elevated, there is dislocation of the talo-navicular joint and the foot is stiff. The displacement of the tab-navicular joint is, however, opposite in the two conditions: in club foot it is downwards and medially, whereas in {{congenital vertical talus}} the navicular bone moves upwards and laterally to lie on the dorsum of the head or <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> A further {{difference is that the}} elevated heel in vertical talus is not fixed. Rigidity of the foot is so formidable in congenital vertical talus that most authorities agree that the condition is amenable only to operative treatment. Lloyd-Roberts and Spence (1958) discussed the differential diagnosis between congenital vertical talus (Figs. 1 to 8) and idiopathic club foot, paralytic flat foot, the flat foot of cerebral palsy, the spuriously corrected club foot (Fig. 9) and the mobile talipes-calcaneo-valgus with the hindfoot in calcaneus. Among the diagnostic features they emphasised the elevated heel, the fixed foot deformity from birth and the characteristic shape of the foot. Radiographs (Figs. 2 to 4) show the vertical talus and the convex contour of the sole of the foot, and also the marked angulation between the axis <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> and first metatarsal bone in antero-posterio...|$|R
40|$|Remodelling of bone {{occurs in}} {{response}} to physical stress. Habitual squatting is associated with modifications <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> (squatting facets) and its trochlear/malleolar surfaces (trochlear extensions), and individual populations exhibit different incidences of these modifications that reflect their lifestyle. The occurrence of talar modifications was therefore investigated in a population of late Byzantine (13 th century AD) adult male skeletons. Lateral squatting facets occurred most frequently (37. 7 %), but medial (0. 6 %), combined (0. 6 %) and continuous (gutter-like) facets (0. 6 %) were also observed. Lateral (8. 0 %), medial (10. 9 %) and continuous (lateral/central/medial) extensions (4. 6 %) of the trochlear surface were all present in the late Byzantine population. There {{was no evidence of}} side dimorphism. The occurrence of lateral squatting facets in the late Byzantine population was greater than that reported for modern Europeans, but similar to that reported for some populations of modern Indians. The frequency of occurrence of trochlear extensions in the late Byzantine population was substantially less than in modern Indian populations, but similar to modern Europeans. Therefore, it is unlikely that precisely the same factors determine the expression of squatting facets and trochlear extensions...|$|R

Son secundarias a traumatismos de alta energía, generalmente accidentes de tráfico y precipitaciones desde una altura. Las fracturas del cuello desplazadas son lesiones complejas que precisan una reducción y estabilización perfectas para lograr un resultado satisfactorio.

They are secondary to traumatisms of high energy, generally traffic accidents and precipitations from a height. The fractures <b>of</b> the displaced <b>neck</b> are complex lesions that require a reduction and perfect stabilization to achieve a satisfactory result.

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} assessed {{time until}} consolidation, complications, and functional results according to Morgan from the clinical charts and radiographs of 15 arthroscopic ankle fusions. In 11 patients unilateral distraction and crossed screw placement over the fusion area through tibia and fibula were used (group A); in 4 patients a technique of bilateral distraction and parallel screw placement from the dorsal {{side of the}} tibia into the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> was used (group B). In group A there were two cases of insufficient compression at the arthrodesis site, three cases of suboptimal compression, and five cases of malposition of the screws. In all cases in group B good compression and fixation was achieved, and no case of malpositioning of screws occurred. There was nonunion in 3 of 11 patients in group A and in none of the four patients in group B. Time until fusion was 23. 3 in group A and 12. 5 weeks in group B. Functional results were better in group B. The initial experiences with our technique of bilateral distraction and parallel screw placement are therefore promising. Screw placement is easier and optimal compression and fixation are achieved. We feel that this technique should be considered when performing an arthroscopic ankle fusion...|$|R
40|$|Five {{patients}} with osteoid osteomas <b>of</b> the talar <b>neck</b> were treated at the Hospital for Special Surgery between 1981 and 1992. The course of care leading to definitive {{diagnosis and treatment}} was reviewed. All five of the patients had night pain relieved by aspi-rin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. One of the five reported associated trauma. The average time from onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis was 2. 5 years. Juxta-articular osteoid osteoma can cause a small spur that resembles a traction spur on the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> Anterior ankle impingement {{was the most common}} mis-diagnosis. Initial treatments included arthroscopic spur debridement or synovectomy, casting for fracture, and repeated nerve blocks for reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The five patients were cured by en bloc excision of the lesion. In the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, a history of relief of pain with aspirin is important. Plain radiographs and a bone scan are useful. Fine cut computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging are the best studies for making a definitive diagnosis. Localization by computed tomography guided needle placement or in-traoperative radionuclide scanning are recommended to find the lesion for excision. Intraoperative radiographs of the excised lesion should be used to confirm complete removal...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{vertical}} talus (CVT), {{also known}} as “rocker-bottom foot” deformity, is a dislocation of the talonavicular joint, with rigid dorsal dislocation of the navicular over the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> This condition is usually associated with multiple other congenital deformities and only rarely is an isolated deformity. The reported familial cases are consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. In contrast, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) {{is thought to be}} a completely distinct heterogeneous group of disorders, with foot abnormalities that typically develop a high-arched “claw foot” appearance later in life. In the present study, DNA was isolated from 36 members of a single upstate (northern) New York white family of Italian descent in which both CVT and CMT were segregating. Whole-genome linkage analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 10 K Array defined a 7 -Mb critical region on chromosome 2 q 31, which led to candidate-gene sequencing of six HOX genes and detection of a single missense mutation, M 319 K (956 T→A), in the HOXD 10 gene. In the study family, this mutation was fully penetrant and exhibited significant evidence of linkage (LOD 6. 33; θ= 0), and it very likely accounts for both CVT and CMT in heterozygotes...|$|R
30|$|The lateral {{wall of the}} calcaneus {{was then}} exposed by sharp {{dissection}} with a thin osteotome or periosteal elevator by first dissecting plantarward beneath the sheath of peroneal tendons, and then posteriorly where the distal end of calcaneofibular ligament and the lateral talocalcaneal ligament are identified and excised en-bloc. These ligaments are retracted along with the sheath of peroneal tendons which forms the posterior section of the capsule of the subtalar joint [23]. The lateral wall was sometimes surprisingly thin and comminuted. Therefore, {{it was possible to}} keep the lateral wall fragments together and attached to overlying tissue, and avoid separation by dissection, and retract it like a door to expose the depressed fracture fragment (Fig.  2 c). In cases of tongue-type fractures, it was possible to continue dissection bluntly by finger tip or blunt periosteal elevator along the superior aspect of the calcaneal tuberosity to expose the posterior portion of posterior facet. With the foot held in valgus and some degree of equinus, the lateral wall and the peroneal sheath are pulled with a small stout-toothed retractor. After sharp dissection of any remaining capsular tissue and washing out the fracture hematoma, it was possible to scout the displaced posterior articular facet. If inspection was difficult, an Inge retractor was placed into the depths of the sinus tarsi, pressing up on the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> and down on the sinus tarsi portion of the calcaneus to give a better view as far as the sustentaculum tali.|$|R
30|$|The pathoanatomy of limbs {{affected}} by tibial hemimelia has been examined. Evans and Smith [40] found either an absence or duplication of some muscles, with some muscles being functionless {{and attached to}} only one bone. Based on their results, these authors postulated a mesoblast disorder. Hovelacque and Noel suggested the same {{in their study of}} mouse embryos in 1909 [41]. Turker et al. [42] dissected limbs with complete tibial aplasia and consistently observed that the affected leg had a dimple where the skin was tethered over fibula. The saphenous and lesser saphenous veins and sural and superficial and deep peroneal nerves were all intact. The posterior tibial neurovascular bundle was found to be short and acting as a tether. The lateral and superficial posterior compartment muscles were intact with normal insertions. The anterior and deep posterior compartments did not have a discrete boundary and their tendons had anomalous courses and sometimes split. There were no identifiable posterior tibial or anterior tibial muscle bellies, but all specimens had a tendon inserting medially on the midfoot that tethered the foot in supination while three specimens had an anomalous tendon inserting onto the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus.</b> All specimens had a flat tendon-like structure on the anterior border of the fibula that wrapped around and inserted on the posterior capsule of the ankle. The abductor hallucis muscle was always present, even in feet without medial rays. No discrete plantar fascia was found. All specimens had subtalar coalitions, and some had midfoot coalitions and the talus articulated with the distal medial fibula on its posterolateral side.|$|R

Two homogenous groups of patients treated {{by one of}} the authors (EI) or under his supervision were studied. The first included 32 patients with 47 club feet reviewed at a mean age of 25 years and treated by manipulation, application of toe-to-groin plaster casts and an extensive posteromedial release. The second included 32 patients with 49 club feet reviewed at a mean age of 19 years and treated by the Ponseti manipulation technique, application of toe-to-groin plaster casts and a limited posterior release. At follow-up the shape of the subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints was found to be altered in many feet in both groups. This {{did not appear to be}} influenced significantly by the type of treatment performed. Correction of the heel varus and the increased declination angle <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> was better in the club feet of the second group, whereas reduction of the medial subluxation of the navicular was better in the first. There was a marked increase in the external ankle torsion angle in the first group and a moderate increase of this angle in the second group, in which medial subluxation of the cuboid on the anterior apophysis of the calcaneum was always corrected. Equinus was corrected in both groups but three-dimensional CT reconstruction of the whole foot showed that cavus, supination and adduction deformities were corrected much better in the second group...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{methods for}} ankle {{arthrodesis}} differ significantly, probably {{a sign that}} no method is clearly superior to others. In {{the last ten years}} there is a clear favour toward internal fixation. We retrospectively evaluate the technique and evaluate the clinical long term results of external fixation in a triangular frame. Patients and Methods From 1994 to 2001 a consecutive series of 95 patients with end stage arthritis of the ankle joint were treated. Retrospectively the case notes were evaluated regarding trauma history, medical complaints, further injuries and illnesses, walking and pain status and occupational issues and the clinical examination before arthrodesis. Mean age at the index procedure was 45. 4 years (18 - 82), 67 patients were male (70. 5 %). Via a bilateral approach the malleoli and the joint surfaces were resected. An AO fixator was applied with two Steinmann-nails inserted with approximately 8 cm distance in the distal tibia, one in the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>talus</b> and one in the dorsal calcaneus. The fixator was removed after approximately 12 weeks. Follow up examination at mean 4. 4 years included a standardised questionnaire and a clinical examination including the criteria of the AOFAS-Score and radiographs. Results: Due to different complications, 8 (8. 9 %) further surgical procedures were necessary including 1 below knee amputation. In 4 patients a non-union of the ankle arthrodesis developed (4. 5 %). The mean AOFAS score improved from 20. 8 to 69. 3 points. Conclusion Non-union rates and clinical results of arthrodesis by triangular external fixation of the ankle joint do not differ to internal fixation methods. The complication rate and the reduced patient comfort reserve this method mainly for infected arthritis and complicated soft tissue situations. </p...|$|R
