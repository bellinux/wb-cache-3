30|$|Irganox 1520 (C 25 H 44 OS 2) is a {{multifunctional}} phenolic antioxidant {{for organic}} substrates such as elastomers, plastics, adhesives, sealants, oils and lubricants. It effectively protects the substrate against thermo-oxidation during processing and long-term heat aging. It is non-staining, <b>non-discoloring,</b> low in volatility, and stable to light and heat. Irganox 1520 {{is an effective}} stabilizer {{in a wide range}} of solution polymerized, emulsion polymerized and thermoplastic elastomers including butadiene rubber (BR), styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR), nitrile–butadiene rubber (NBR), isoprene rubber (IR), styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) and styrene–isoprene–styrene (SIS), as well as natural rubber [14, 15]. It can be used with other additives such as secondary antioxidants, benzofuranone, light stabilizers and other functional stabilizers, the recommended dosage level of which is 0.05 – 0.3 % [16, 17].|$|E
40|$|NeoMTA Plus (Avalon Biomed Inc., Bradenton, FL) is a tricalcium {{silicate}} material {{similar to}} the first MTA product, ProRoot MTA (Dentsply, Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK) but with improvements such as decreased setting time, increased ion release, increased water sorption and decreased porosity. Quick-Set 2 (Avalon Biomed Inc., Bradenton, FL) is a newly formulated calcium aluminosilicate material that has a faster setting time, increased acid resistance and is <b>non-discoloring.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare healing of pulpal and periapical tissues after exposure to NeoMTA Plus and Quick-Set 2 following pulpotomy, root canal and root-end surgery procedures. One hundred eight teeth (36 for each procedure) in 6 Beagle dogs were isolated, accessed and treated with pulpotomy, root canal or root-end surgery. The materials for pulpotomy and root-end surgery were mixed to a putty-like consistency and the materials for root canals were mixed to a sealer consistency. The dogs were sacrificed at 90 days and the teeth and surrounding tissues were prepared for histological evaluation. Eighty-five teeth were evaluated and scored histologically. Specific for each procedure, specimens were scored for inflammation, quality and thickness of dentin bridging, pulp tissue response, cementum and PDL formation and apical bone healing. Both materials displayed favorable healing at 90 days. The only significant difference was higher quality of dentin bridge formation in pulpotomies exposed to NeoMTA Plus. Quick-Set 2 and NeoMTA Plus had similar effects on inflammation, dentin bridge formation, pulp response, PDL and cementum formation and apical tissue healing in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} technology has achieved great progress especially in white light emittingdiodes (LEDs). The LEDs exhibit many advantages such as long lifetime and high light efficiency. Moreover, they are environmental friendly {{compared to the}} conventional light sources. However, the key issue in widespread application of white LEDs is packaging technology. High light efficiency requires the white LEDs endure a high working temperature which will accelerate the thermal aging of packaging materials. Traditionally, epoxy resins are used in white LED packaging. However, under long time exposing to high temperature, epoxy resin will result in an obvious discoloration and yellowing phenomenon which will adversely affect the light efficiency of white LEDs. So the rapid development of white LED technology requires the packaging materials with better performance in thermal resistance and optical transmission. Compared to epoxy resin, silicone {{is a kind of}} novel packaging material for white LEDs. Its excellent performances including high light transmittance, low water absorption and <b>non-discoloring</b> behavior attract numerous attentions of white LED manufactures. What's more, the good thermal stability property makes it suitable even in high-power LED application. However, there are still some reliability issues of silicone application in white LED packaging, such as fracture, delamination and chemical corrosion. Thus the evaluation and selection of silicone for LED packaging are very important. In this study, some major failure modes of silicone in white LED packaging are discussed. To better understand the performance of silicone, a series of test methods are set up to evaluate its mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. Corresponding simulation models are used to verify the test results. Some common properties such as transmittance and infrared spectrum are also demonstrated and studied in this paper. Finally, a practical methodology has been proposed to serve as guideline for silicon selection in white LED packaging...|$|E
