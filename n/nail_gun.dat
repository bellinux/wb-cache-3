5|$|Final Destination 3 {{received}} a mixed response; some critics {{felt that the}} film was formulaic and did not bring anything new to the franchise while others praised it for being enjoyable and offering its audience what it wishes to see. Attention was given especially to death scenes involving a tanning bed and a <b>nail</b> <b>gun</b> respectively; these were favorably received, as was Winstead's performance. The film was a financial success and, {{at the time of}} its release, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise. The film was followed by two sequels—The Final Destination and Final Destination 5—released in 2009 and 2011, respectively.|$|E

The next day, Wendy and Kevin try to save Lewis at the gym; he tells them that he does not believe them shortly before two weights from the weight {{training}} machine he is using swing down and decapitate him. Ian and Erin are working at a hardware store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a <b>nail</b> <b>gun</b> and is shot repeatedly in the head. Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that whoever was next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the story, Saya finds Kohta cringing in the hallway as students run about in a panic. They hide in a classroom where Hirano is able to put together a <b>nail</b> <b>gun</b> rifle powered by gas cartridges. Kohta has an unrequited crush on Saya. Kohta provides long-range cover when Takashi rescues Alice Maresato from approaching zombies after Alice's father is killed. At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses saying this is the one thing he was good at and that he wants to protect Saya. The rest of the group, including Saya, support him.|$|E

25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail {{pull out of the}} frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular <b>nail</b> <b>gun</b> models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.|$|E

Shido permits the main group to leave the bus except for Shizuka, but Kohta expresses his disapproval of Shido's actions and grazes Shido's face with a <b>nail</b> <b>gun</b> shot. Later on, Shido watches over an orgy among his followers. He finds this behavior acceptable during the group's [...] "free time". Shido declares his followers [...] "angels that will help usher in a new age", but when Yamada disagrees and shows concern for his own family, Shido convinces his followers to eject the [...] "weak link" [...] {{for the sake of the}} New World, and they callously throw the teen off the bus and leave him to be eaten by [...] "them".|$|E
2500|$|Sam Worthington, {{who worked}} with Cameron on Avatar, stated on The Jay Leno Show that Cameron had very high {{expectations}} from everyone: he would use a <b>nail</b> <b>gun</b> to nail the film crew's cell phones to a wall above an exit door in retaliation for unwanted ringing during production. Other actors, such as Bill Paxton and Sigourney Weaver, have praised Cameron's perfectionism. Weaver said of Cameron: [...] "He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn't mind risking his own." [...] Michael Biehn has also praised Cameron, claiming [...] "Jim is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies", but added [...] "I’ve never seen him yell at anybody."

Freamon suggests that their next move is to seize Chris's truck and take hair and blood samples from both Chris and Snoop. Pearlman interjects, telling the detectives {{that they do not have}} the probable cause for these actions. Bunk suggests using Randy Wagstaff as a witness because he is able to link Chris and Snoop to the death of Curtis [...] "Lex" [...] Anderson, but Freamon insists that Randy is simply a source. Bunk becomes impatient and says that he will provide the necessary probable cause within an hour. He visits Lex's mother and pressures her into speaking up. She states that she has heard that Chris and a girl, possibly named Snoop, were responsible.|$|E
2500|$|The Coens {{minimized}} the score {{used in the}} film, leaving large sections devoid of music. The concept was Ethan's, who persuaded a skeptical Joel {{to go with the}} idea. There is some music in the movie, scored by the Coens' longtime composer, Carter Burwell, but after finding that [...] "most musical instruments didn't fit with the minimalist sound sculpture he had in mind [...] he used singing bowls, standing metal bells traditionally employed in Buddhist meditation practice that produce a sustained tone when rubbed." [...] The movie contains a [...] "mere" [...] 16 minutes of music, with several of those in the end credits. The music in the trailer was called [...] "Diabolic Clockwork" [...] by Two Steps from Hell. Sound editing and effects were provided by another longtime Coens collaborator, Skip Lievsay, who used a mixture of emphatic sounds (gun shots) and ambient noise (engine noise, prairie winds) in the mix. The Foley for the captive bolt pistol used by Chigurh was created using a pneumatic <b>nail</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Freamon {{receives}} {{word from}} Daniels and assigns Leander Sydnor and Kenneth Dozerman {{to introduce the}} specifics of the search to the patrol division. Greggs asks what she can do and Freamon asks her to raise Sergeant Thomas [...] "Herc" [...] Hauk, who is currently suspended from duty pending the results of an internal investigation. Greggs finds Herc drinking in the morning and reluctant to become involved while suspended. She goads him into accompanying her by questioning whether he is police or not. She takes him to the site of his recent traffic stop of Chris Partlow and Felicia [...] "Snoop" [...] Pearson, as he told Freamon that he fired a nail from their <b>nail</b> <b>gun</b> into the road. They find the mark but are unable to locate the nail. Herc spends the whole time questioning why IID is investigating him when Marimow has been transferred away and Daniels had already given him a mild punishment for the incident with the minister. Tired of Herc's complaints, Greggs asks what he did in order to reassure him that he will have an easier hearing. When Herc admits the falsified paperwork and stolen camera, Greggs and her partner Bunk Moreland shake their heads in disbelief. Herc experiences further dismay, concerned that he may lose more than just his sergeant's rank.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nail</b> <b>guns</b> use {{fasteners}} {{mounted in}} long strips (similar to {{a stick of}} staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending {{on the design of}} the nailgun. Some full head <b>nail</b> <b>guns,</b> especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped head so the nails can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip head nails are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full Round Head nails and ring shank nails provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. <b>Nail</b> <b>guns</b> vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.|$|R
