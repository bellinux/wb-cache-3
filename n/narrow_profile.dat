5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the <b>narrow</b> <b>profile</b> of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E
25|$|With {{the second}} series {{delivered}} the SM53 units entered service {{on most of}} street tram lines. Two exceptions were the Kampen Line and the Vestbanen Line, both which were built for the older <b>narrow</b> <b>profile</b> {{and could not be}} used by the wider trams. As the trams were unidirectional they required a balloon loop at the ends of each line, which was also lacking on the Kampen Line, and new track arrangement had to be built at Vålerenga Depot and Majorstuen Depot. The issue was availed by the 1957 opening of Grefsen Depot, which was built for unidirectional trams. The MBO50 units were rebuilt in 1959, whereby the back door was closed and the received the same interior as the new trams, with single seats all the way along the door side.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{the silicon}} ring tourniquet, or elastic ring tourniquet, was {{developed}} by Dr. Noam Gavriely, {{a professor of medicine}} and former emergency physician. The tourniquet consists of an elastic ring made of silicone, stockinet, and pull straps made from ribbon that are used to roll the device onto the limb. The silicone ring tourniquet exsanguinates the blood from the limb while the device is being rolled on, and then occludes the limb once the desired occlusion location is reached. Unlike the historical mechanical tourniquets, the device reduces the risk of nerve paralysis. The surgical tourniquet version of the device is completely sterile, and provides improved surgical accessibility due to its <b>narrow</b> <b>profile</b> that results in a larger surgical field. It {{has been found to be}} a safe alternative method for most orthopedic limb procedures, but it does not completely replace the use of contemporary tourniquet devices. More recently the silicone ring tourniquet has been used in the fields of emergency medicine and vascular procedures. Recently, Feldman et. al. reported 2 cases of pulmonary embolism after silicon ring tourniquet application in patients with traumatic injuries. The serious and potentially fatal complication was reported involving procedures performed on the lower limb when silicone ring tourniquet was used for exsanguination on the affected limb.|$|E

The collisionally <b>narrowed</b> <b>profile</b> compares more favorable to the observed profiles. Values of the line strengths and self broadening coeffiencients, determined from the least square fitting process, are presented in tabular form.

500|$|The line {{opened in}} 1904 as a [...] {{extension}} of the narrow gauge Jæren Line. It was planned {{as the first step}} of a main line along the South Coast. At Flekkefjord, there was steam ship connection, onwards to Oslo. In 1941, the line was converted to standard gauge, and in 1944 the Sørland Line was completed. The western part of the Flekkefjord Line was integrated into it, while the remaining section became the branch line that kept the name Flekkefjord Line. During the 1940s, steam locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by railcars. Following the declining traffic, in part due to the slow speeds caused by the line's <b>narrow</b> <b>profile,</b> the line was closed, with the last trains running in 1990.|$|E
500|$|The rock {{composition}} is mostly granite gneisses, although {{the northern part}} of the park has some schist. The entire area is covered by large amounts of soil, and bedrock can only be seen in cliffs and hillocks. These geological conditions result in poor soil quality. During the last glacial period the region was covered by a large glacier which had little movement because of the flat terrain. Thus the glacier did not create any moraines, which could have created larger lakes. Most lakes are created by variations in the bedrock; Ødevannet is a notable exception as is lies in a deep fault, giving it a long and <b>narrow</b> <b>profile.</b> The fault continues northeastwards, creating the Revsaksskaret cliff. The valley has a marine border at [...] AMSL, with the post-glacial rebound having dried up the land about 5000 BC. Prior to this the valley was part of a fjord. The landscape is occasionally interrupted with vegetation-less and flat screes.|$|E
500|$|Industries {{associated}} with the sea developed throughout the East End, including rope making and shipbuilding. The former location of roperies can still be identified from their long straight, <b>narrow</b> <b>profile</b> in the modern streets, for instance Ropery Street near Mile End. Shipbuilding was important from the time when Henry VIII caused ships to be built at Rotherhithe {{as a part of}} his expansion of the Royal Navy. On 31 January 1858, the largest ship of that time, the SS Great Eastern, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott Russell & Co, of Millwall. The [...] vessel was too long to fit across the river, and so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch, after this, shipbuilding on the Thames went into a long decline. Ships continued to be built at the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company at Blackwall and Canning Town until the yard closed in 1913, shortly after the launch of the Dreadnought Battleship HMS Thunderer (1911).|$|E
50|$|The {{first line}} of the U-Bahn opened in 1902, and {{construction}} has continued spasmodically since then, with the most recent line opening in 2009. The first four lines to be built were built with a <b>narrower</b> <b>profile</b> and a slightly different electrification method to the later lines. This is most noticeably seen in the narrower trains on the earlier lines, and rolling stock cannot easily be interchanged {{between the two groups}} of lines.|$|R

The first design of DVT is designed to match Mark 2 D, E & F and Mark 3 coaches. The second design has a <b>narrower</b> <b>profile,</b> similar to Mark 4 coaches, which will enable it to be converted to tilting operation if required in the future.|$|R
50|$|The frames, or ribs, of a {{circular}} arc hull {{all have the}} same radius. On Fredrik Ljungström's first models, frames were a cross-section (a single arc), but he soon realized that he needed a slightly <b>narrower</b> <b>profile</b> to cope with the sea. The result was that two arcs met at the bottom so that a slightly pointed bottom was created. The frames are tilted toward the mast so that the stern and bow lean while standing straight up.|$|R
2500|$|Stiffness (or elastic modulus) can {{in theory}} affect the ride comfort and power {{transmission}} efficiency. [...] In practice, because even a very flexible frame {{is much more}} stiff than the tires and saddle, ride comfort is ultimately more a factor of saddle choice, frame geometry, tire choice, and bicycle fit. [...] Lateral stiffness is far more difficult to achieve because of the <b>narrow</b> <b>profile</b> of a frame, and too much flexibility can affect power transmission, primarily through tire scrub on the road due to rear triangle distortion, brakes rubbing on the rims and the chain rubbing on gear mechanisms. [...] In extreme cases gears can change themselves when the rider applies high torque out of the saddle.|$|E

2500|$|Emden was {{the first}} to fire at 09:40, and scored hits on her fourth salvo: two shells {{exploded}} near the aft control station and wrecked the aft rangefinders, while a third punched through the forward rangefinder and through the bridge without exploding. These shots landed at a range of approximately the 30-degree elevation of her main guns allowed her to fire much further than British estimates. Von Müller recognised that his success in the battle required Emden to do as much damage as possible before the other ship retaliated, but despite the heavy rate of fire from the Germans over the next ten minutes (at points reaching a salvo every six seconds), the high angle of the guns and the <b>narrow</b> <b>profile</b> presented by Sydney meant that only fifteen shells hit the Australian warship, of which only five exploded. As well as the rangefinders, damage was sustained to the S2 gun when a nearby impact sent hot shrapnel into the gun crew then ignited cordite charges being stored nearby for the fight, and another shell exploded in a forward mess deck. [...] Four sailors were killed and another sixteen wounded; the only casualties aboard Sydney during the entire engagement.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began on 14 April 1955 and was {{contracted}} to Brødrene Hauge. It was originally planned to be completed on 1 August 1956, but it soon proved impossible to follow the schedule. The rock was of poorer conditions than originally thought. The porous rock meant {{that there was a}} need to repeatedly build support columns, slowing progress. By the start of 1956, [...] had been blasted. The breakthrough took place on 8 March 1956. The original blasting had only created a <b>narrow</b> <b>profile</b> {{and the rest of the}} work went to widening it. A [...] cutting was made on the south side {{of the tunnel}}, to make a place for the station. The concrete walls were finished in November 1957. A road bridge was built over the northern entrance to allow Mosseveien to pass over, and when it was completed the tracks and wiring could be installed. The tunnel became operational on 7 September 1958. The same day the old Bekkelaget Station closed and the new one opened and the old tracks were abandoned. Construction continued for another year with the demolishing of the old right-of-way and widening of Mosseveien. Total costs were 7.4 million kroner, of which NSBn paid 950,000.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} detection, using {{observations}} of the CO(2 - 1) line performed with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX), of molecular gas {{in the region of}} the outer filament of Centaurus A, a complex region known to show various signatures of an interaction between the radio jet, an H i cloud, and ionised gas filaments. We detect CO(2 - 1) at all observed locations, which were selected to represent regions with very different physical conditions. The H 2 masses of the detections range between 0. 2 × 106 and 1. 1 × 106 M⊙, for conservative choices of the CO to H 2 conversion factor. Surprisingly, the stronger detections are not coincident with the H i cloud, but instead are in the region of the ionised filaments. We also find variations in the widths of the CO(2 - 1) lines throughout the region, with broader lines in the region of the ionised gas, i. e. where the jet-cloud interaction is strongest, and with <b>narrow</b> <b>profiles</b> in the H i cloud. This may indicate that the molecular gas in the region of the ionised gas has the momentum of the jet-cloud interaction encoded in it, {{in the same way as}} the ionised gas does. These molecular clouds may therefore be the result of very efficient cooling of the down-stream gas photo- or shock-ionised by the interaction. On the other hand, the molecular clouds with <b>narrower</b> <b>profiles,</b> which are closer to or inside the H i cloud, could be pre-existing cold H 2 cores which manage to survive the effects of the passing jet...|$|R
