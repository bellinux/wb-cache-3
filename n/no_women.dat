5|$|NASA had no {{official}} policy prohibiting women, but {{the requirement that}} astronauts had to be military test pilots effectively excluded them. NASA dropped this requirement in 1965, but did not select any women as astronauts until 1978, when six women were selected, although none as pilots. After Tereshkova, <b>no</b> <b>women</b> of any nationality would fly in space again until August 1982, when the Soviet Union launched pilot-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. During the late 1970s, Glenn reportedly supported Space Shuttle Mission Specialist Judith Resnik in her career.|$|E

In the CAR, there is no national association staffer dedicated to women's football and <b>no</b> <b>women</b> on the board or in the executive committee.

5|$|According to Dyer in 1982, {{exclusion}} of netball from the Summer Olympics {{is part of}} the historical pattern of the slow growth and gradual acceptance of women's sports. Women first competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics in only three sports: tennis, croquet and golf. Women's cycling was excluded for many years despite having world championships organised by 1958. Field hockey, a sport included for men as early as 1908, was not open to competition by women until 1980. By the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, there were 159 medal events for men, but only 86 for women, and 12 for both men and women, and as late as 1996, 26 countries sent <b>no</b> <b>women</b> to the Olympics. There were still sports that excluded women at the 2000 Summer Olympics, such as boxing, wrestling and baseball. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, every country but Nauru did, and both men and women competed in 34 sports.|$|E
5|$|Dominica is {{an island}} nation located in the far eastern rim of the Caribbean Sea that lis between the French colonies of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique to the south.

The largest {{delegation}} sent by Dominica was in 1996, {{and the size of}} its delegation decreased to four in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, then to two in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Dominica's Beijing delegation also only included two athletes, although its appearance at the Olympics marked the first Dominican delegation that included <b>no</b> <b>women.</b> As of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, Dominican athletes had not won any medals. Jerome Romain, the coach accompanying the Dominican delegation, was the nation's flagbearer at the ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Germany did not {{recognize}} the new king and {{its relationship with the}} council remained tense. The council was not allowed to determine the borders of Lithuania, establish an embassy in Berlin, or begin forming a stable administrative system. It received small funds to cover its expenses only in September 1918. The situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. On 2 November, the council adopted the first provisional constitution. The decision to invite King Mindaugas II was annulled and this helped to reconcile the political factions. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers. The first government was formed on 11 November 1918, the day that Germany signed the armistice in Compiègne. The council began to organize an army, police, local government, and other institutions. It also expanded to include ethnic minorities (Jews and Belarusians). There were <b>no</b> <b>women</b> in the council, despite a petition that gathered 20,000 signatures.|$|E
5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were <b>no</b> <b>women</b> at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
