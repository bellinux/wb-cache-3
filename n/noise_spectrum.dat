5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the <b>noise</b> <b>spectrum</b> which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

This paper presents a theoretical formulation for the nonlinear <b>noise</b> <b>spectra.</b> We pay special attention to maintain gauge invariance at the nonlinear level. At small but finite voltages, explicit expressions for nonlinear <b>noise</b> <b>spectra,</b> expanded order by order in the bias, have been derived.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an exact {{formalism}} for transient current-current correlations and transient <b>noise</b> <b>spectra.</b> The exact solution of transient current correlations {{in both the}} time domain and the frequency domain are obtained. Without taking the wide band limit, we investigate transient current-current correlations with different bias voltages and different finite temperatures. Transient <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> over the whole frequency range are calculated {{and that in the}} steady-state limit are also reproduced. From transient current-current correlations and <b>noise</b> <b>spectra,</b> we analyze the frequency-dependence of electron transport for the system evolving far away from equilibrium to the steady state. Various time scales associated with the energy structure of the nanosystem are also obtained from the transient current-current correlations and transient <b>noise</b> <b>spectra.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

We have observed the <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> with a resonance frequency. Under {{the application of}} the magnetic field in the plane, the magnetic field dependences of the resonance frequency and amplitude were well interpreted by the analytical calculation based on the stochastic model. The <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> are attributable to the resistance oscillation reflecting the uniform magnetization precession which is produced by the Joule heating due to the dc current.

2500|$|White {{noise is}} a signal (or process), named by analogy to white light, {{with a flat}} {{frequency}} spectrum when plotted as a linear function of frequency (e.g., in Hz). In other words, the signal has equal power in any band of a given bandwidth (power spectral density) when the bandwidth is measured in Hz. [...] For example, with a white noise audio signal, the range of frequencies between 40 Hz and 60Hz contains {{the same amount of}} sound power as the range between 400Hz and 420Hz, since both intervals are 20Hz wide. Note that spectra are often plotted with a logarithmic frequency axis rather than a linear one, in which case equal physical widths on the printed or displayed plot do not all have the same bandwidth, with the same physical width covering more Hz at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies. In this case a white <b>noise</b> <b>spectrum</b> that is equally sampled in the logarithm of frequency (i.e., equally sampled on the X axis) will slope upwards at higher frequencies rather than being flat. However it is not unusual in practice for spectra to be calculated using linearly-spaced frequency samples but plotted on a logarithmic frequency axis, potentially leading to misunderstandings and confusion if the distinction between equally spaced linear frequency samples and equally spaced logarithmic frequency samples is not kept in mind.|$|E

40|$|Thermal <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> of nanomechanical {{resonators}} {{are used}} widely to characterize their physical properties. These spectra typically exhibit a Lorentzian response, with additional white noise due to extraneous processes. Least-squares fits of these measurements enable extraction of key {{parameters of the}} resonator, including its resonant frequency, quality factor, and stiffness. Here, we present general formulas for the uncertainties in these fit parameters due to sampling noise inherent in all thermal <b>noise</b> <b>spectra.</b> Good agreement with Monte Carlo simulation of synthetic data and measurements of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) cantilever is demonstrated.

40|$|Over an {{extended}} period of time station <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> were collected from various sources for use in estimating the detection and location performance of global networks of seismic stations. As the database of <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> enlarged and duplicate entries became available, an effort was mounted to more carefully select station <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> while discarding others. This report discusses the methodology and criteria by which the <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> were selected. It also identifies and illustrates the station <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> which survived the selection process and which currently contribute to the modeling efforts. The resulting catalog of noise statistics not only benefits those who model network performance but also those who wish to select stations on the basis of their noise level as may occur in designing networks or in selecting seismological data for analysis on the basis of station noise level. In view of the various ways by which station noise were estimated by the different contributors, it is advisable that future efforts which predict network performance have available station noise data and spectral estimation methods which are compatible with the statistics underlying seismic noise. This appropriately requires (1) averaging noise over seasonal and/or diurnal cycles, (2) averaging noise over time intervals comparable to those employed by actual detectors, and (3) using logarithmic measures of the noise...|$|R

The prominent generation-recombination (g-r) noise bulge commonly {{observed in the}} vicinity of 10 kHz in conventional MODFET's at 300 K does not appear {{in the case of the}} new InGaAs quantum-well MODFET. Instead, its <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> indicate the presence of low-intensity multiple g-r noise components superimposed on a reduced 1 /f noise. The LF noise intensity in the new device appears to be the lowest among those observed in any MODFET or MESFET. The <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> at 82 K in the new device represent nearly true 1 /f noise. This unusual low-noise behavior of the new structure suggests the effectiveness of electron confinement in the quantum well that significantaly reduces electron trapping in the n-AlGaAs, and thus eliminates the g-r noise bulge observed in conventional MODFET's...|$|R

The multiplet amplitude ratios in 1 H coupled spectra indicate that, although pure spin noise prevails in these spectra, the influence of absorbed circuit noise is still significant at the high concentrations used.

40|$|We {{show that}} vapors of {{different}} chemicals produce distinguishably different {{effects on the}} low-frequency <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> of graphene. It {{was found in a}} systematic study that some gases change the electrical resistance of graphene devices without changing their low-frequency <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> while other gases modify the <b>noise</b> <b>spectra</b> by inducing Lorentzian components with distinctive features. The characteristic frequency fc of the Lorentzian noise bulges in graphene devices is different for different chemicals and varies from fc= 10 - 20 Hz to fc= 1300 - 1600 Hz for tetrahydrofuran and chloroform vapors, respectively. The obtained results indicate that the low-frequency noise in combination with other sensing parameters can allow one to achieve the selective gas sensing with a single pristine graphene transistor. Our method of gas sensing with graphene does not require graphene surface functionalization or fabrication of an array of the devices with each tuned to a certain chemical.
