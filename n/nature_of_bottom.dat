40|$|Coal {{is one of}} the world’s most {{important}} sources of energy, fuelling almost 40 % of electricity worldwide. The burning of coal produced coal ash that mostly consists of Fly Ash and Bottom Ash. Bottom Ash (normally recognized as coal combustion residues from pulverized fuel power stations) has been categorized as solid garbage. However, the utilization of Bottom Ash in construction-related applications has received some attention within the last decade. This project aimed at determining the strength and compressibility of Kaolin, mixed with 25 %, 50 % and 60 % of bottom ash. Kaolin, in powdered forms, was mixed with Bottom Ash and compacted at optimum moisture content. The strength and compressibility of the compacted samples were determined from direct shear test, unconsolidated undrained triaxial tests, and one-dimensional consolidation test, besides the California Bearing Ratio and permeability tests. It was observed that the granular <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bottom</b> Ash increased the friction angle of Kaolin, increased the permeability and expedite the consolidation rate. However, the addition of 25 % Bottom Ash gives the highest shear strength of Kaolin while the addition of 60 % Bottom Ash gives the highest permeability and coefficient of consolidation. This results show that Bottom Ash can be used to increase the strength of soil, in particular the soft soil and also could expedite the consolidation of the soil. This is due to the granular nature of the materials that could increase the voids in the mixtures and also contribute to increase in friction angles...|$|E
40|$|In sediments sampled in Northern Adriatic Sea {{invertebrate}} benthic macrofauna {{was examined}} {{in comparison with}} both substratum bulk parameters (average grain size, sorting, total organic matter content) and attributes of grain size classes (specific organic matter content of dimensional fractions). The aims were: 1) to determine whether variations of community overall parameters (total spatial density, number of taxa) and in numerically dominant feeding types (deposit-feeders and suspension-feeders) patterns were related to changes in sediment general properties; 2) to evaluate whether the observed patterns of abundance for deposit- and filter-feeders had more valid correlates in specific properties of substratum dimensional fractions. Number of taxa and animal spatial density resulted conventionally related to substratum bulk parameters while feeding types patterns in comparison with sediment total organic matter content exibited a reciprocal negative effect; only when both feeding types and sediment structure were resolved to their specific attributes in terms of prevalence of tubicolous taxa among deposit-feeders and organic matter richness of single dimensional fractions, the analysis emphasized patterns unequally affected by specific size fractions abundance and organic matter content: deposit feeders demonstrated {{to be related to}} the presence in the substrate of intermediate grain size classes necessary for tube-building. Those intermediate fractions proved to be more adequate descriptors than average grain size or other overall sediment parameters per se of relations actually established between feeding types and the complex <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottom</b> sediments. Our results emphasize that for Northern Adriatic Sea benthic communities, sediment organic matter content may represent a factor of minor importance in comparison with other substrate attributes, for which it may be necessary a detailed analysis of sediment structure. Thus, we concluded that the complexity of soft-bottom communities may defy any simple paradigm relating macrobenthic patterns to any single sediment bulk attribute, and we propose a shift in focus towards an higher resolution of both functional groups in macrobenthic associations las already suggested in other investigations) and of substratum structural description...|$|E

In this series of experiments, roped anchors (61. 4 and 80. 8 Kg) were dragged from the stern of the research boat with several constant thrust of propelling power, and the tensile strength of rope was measured for each thrust power. The maximum value was obtained at the beginning of running anchor and this maximum value was considered as the maximum holding power of the anchor. For example, in case a 61. 4 Kg anchor was used on the seabed M measuring 13 meters in depth, the holding power of the anchor at the paid out length of 40 meters and 70 meters was 330 Kg and 390 Kg, respectively. The experimental result are as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. When the thrust of the propelling power was continuously increased, the tensile strength of anchor rope also increased to attain the first maximum value (may be just biting anchor) and, after once decreasing, increased again to the maximum at the beginning of running anchor.
