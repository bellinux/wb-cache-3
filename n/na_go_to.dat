The pair has been close friends and collaborators ever since. Nas is now widely known for his collaborations with Lil Yachty in which he gained his first wave of success breaking rap artist Lil Yachty producing record [...] "Lil Boat" [...] one of the first records to obtain notoriety after solid cosign from fashion taste maker Ian Connor. [...] "Lil Boat" [...] was released in the summer of 2015. Digital Nas got his first major label placement with [...] "Up Next 2" [...] in March 2016 on Lil Yachty's debut mixtape [...] "Lil Boat". This mixtape charted on the Hot 200 and peaked at 113, being Digital Nas's first ever Billboard placement. Digital <b>Nas</b> <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> produce several melodic breakout hits with acts such as Levi Carter, Keith Ape, PNB Rock, and many other artists.

Produced by Salaam Remi and Nas, it samples James Brown's [...] "The Boss", the percussion from James Brown's [...] "Funky Drummer" [...] and [...] "Rock Creek Park" [...] by The Blackbyrds. Its lyrics detail 3 loosely described criminal stories from different locations. The first story takes place in New York City, New York, where an alleged criminal steals the gun of a court officer, and starts shooting. The 2nd story deals with cocaine dealers from Tennessee who provide Nas with a laced blunt. The final story takes place in Los Angeles where <b>Nas</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> a violent funeral in Crenshaw with his cousin, and later kills 3 people.

Prome and Toungoo later agreed to attack Ava in 1597 but Toungoo broke off the alliance and attacked Prome in 1597. In the central mainland, Lan Xang and Lan <b>Na</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> war in 1595–96 {{and again in}} 1598–1603. Siam supported a Chiang Rai rebellion against Lan Na (Chiang Mai) in 1599. By 1601, Lan Na was divided into three spheres: Chiang Mai, Siam-backed Chiang Rai, Lan Xang-backed Nan. Chiang Mai defeated the Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai in 1602 only to submit to Ayutthaya later that year. Chiang Mai retook Nan from Lan Xang in 1603. In the western mainland, Siam invaded Lower Burma in 1600, and <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> attack Toungoo only to be driven back by Toungoo’s ally Arakan. The Portuguese garrison at Syriam switched allegiance from Arakan to Goa in 1603. Siamese vassal Martaban then entered into an alliance with Portuguese Syriam. Ava had seized cis-Salween Shan states by 1604. Siam planned to invade Ava’s vassal southern Shan states in 1605 before cancelling {{it because of the}} sudden death of its warrior king Naresuan (r. 1590–1605). Ava conquered Prome (1608), Toungoo (1610), Portuguese Syriam (1613), Siamese Martaban and Tavoy (1613), and Lan Na (1614).|$|R
5000|$|Linguist Christopher Sundita {{observed}} {{that some of}} the affixes in Marinduque Tagalog, particularly [...] "a-" [...] and [...] "ina-," [...] are affixes used in Asi (Bantoanon), a Visaya language spoken in Romblon, just south of Marinduque. Marinduque Tagalog, like the Tagalog spoken over two centuries ago, had an additional verb category, the imperative, which was used for commands and requests (e.g., Matulog ka <b>na</b> - <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> sleep). Even then, the imperative and the infinitive were used side by side in expressing commands; but in standard Tagalog, apparently the infinitive became used exclusively. And in the Eastern Marinduque dialect, the imperative affixes are very much alive.|$|R

Only EIA and EPA were present (in addition to BP and NA); however, somewhere in the middle of the recording a daughter or two plus grandkids slipped in and out - but they did not join in the storytelling. Other than that there were hardly any surrounding noises. EIA was in a storytelling mood and kept remembering humourous little anecdotes, which he recounted with a lot of accompanying gestures. In between he gave Russian summaries/retold it all in Russian - but the video files were cut in such a way as to exclude that (except where he switched to Russian in the middle of an Even narrative). The recording was done in mono with a Marantz recorder and a Sony handycam on videotape. The videofilm was transferred to the computer as. avi and later converted to mpeg 2 and wav (both called Amganov_EI_first_tractor_Esso_ 140609); these files were used for the Elan annotation. In addition, the untouched sound file from the Marantz recorder is archived under the name 'Amganov_EI_first_tractor_Marantz'. The individual anecdotes (11 in total, varying in length from 1 minute to 12 minutes) were analysed individually, as individual ELAN/Toolbox files, and are archived as separate sessions...|$|R

Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin members continued to boycott the Dáil. At a special Ard Fheis in March 1926, de Valera proposed that elected members be allowed to take their seats in the Dáil if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed. When his motion was defeated, de Valera resigned from Sinn Féin; on 16 May 1926 he founded his own party, Fianna Fáil, which was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within its political structures. He took most Sinn Féin TDs with him. De Valera's resignation meant also the loss of financial support from America. The rump Sinn Féin party could field no more than fifteen candidates, and won only six seats in the June 1927 general election, a level of support not seen since before 1916. Vice-President and de facto leader Mary MacSwiney announced that the party simply did not have the funds to contest the second election called that year, declaring [...] "no true Irish citizen can vote for any of the other parties".

This custom, known as Mameru, was simply {{out of the reach of}} materialistically poor Narsinh who had hardly anything except intransient faith in his Lord. How Krishna helped his beloved devotee is a legend depicted in 'Mameru Na Pada'. This episode is preserved vividly in the memory of Gujarati people by compositions by later poets and films. Other famous legends include: 'Hundi (Bond)' episode and 'Har Mala (Garland)' episode. The episode in which none other than Shamalsha Seth cleared a bond written by poverty-stricken beloved, is famous not only in Gujarat but in other parts of India as well. The Har Mala episode deals with the challenge given to Mehta by Ra Mandlik (1451-1472), a Chudasama king, to prove his innocence in the charges of immoral behaviour by making the Lord Himself garland Narsinh. Mehta depicts this episode. How Sri Krishna, in the guise of a wealthy merchant, helped Mehta in getting his son married is sung by the poet in Putra Vivah <b>Na</b> Pada. He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Mangrol where, at the age of 79, he is believed to have died.
