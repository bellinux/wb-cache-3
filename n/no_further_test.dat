5|$|There were <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Test</b> matches {{before the}} First World War. The 1912–13 Australian season {{was a short}} one for Macartney, {{but he was in}} rare form, scoring 125, 96, 94, 76 not out, 91, 10 and 154 in four matches, to total 646 runs at 107.66. He also took four wickets at 30.50.|$|E
5|$|Chapman played <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Test</b> cricket; in 26 Tests, {{he scored}} 925 runs {{at an average}} of 28.90 and held 32 catches. He captained England in 17 matches, winning nine and losing two with the others drawn. Under him the team {{achieved}} seven consecutive victories, equalling the English record, which was not surpassed until 2004. His nine victories came in his first nine games as captain.|$|E

30|$|This first tier allows {{an initial}} precautionary {{assessment}} already {{with a very}} limited set of data. If there are no reasons for concern (i.e. RQProduct < 1), <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>testing</b> or data evaluation is required.|$|R
2500|$|He played <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Tests</b> {{after the}} tour. His highest {{score in the}} Plunket Shield was 103 not out for Auckland against Central Districts in 1965-66. He played for Manawatu, Hawke's Bay and Franklin in the Hawke Cup between 1952 and 1971.|$|R
25|$|Because of this, the ZCU {{accepted}} that Zimbabwe were to play <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Test</b> cricket in 2004, though {{its status as}} a Test nation was unaffected.|$|E
25|$|Asgarali made <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Test</b> appearances, {{though he}} played in {{first-class}} games in Trinidad into his 40s. His son, Gregory, was also a first-class cricketer for Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} Test match—the fifth and final [...] of the series—Palairet {{retained}} his place, with Hirst and Jessop [...] {{restored to the}} side. The Australians batted throughout the first day [...] {{for a total of}} 324 runs. Overnight [...] rain then made batting [...] difficult, and England totalled [...] 183 on the second day. Palairet was dismissed for 20 by Trumble, whose bowling Altham praised as magnificent. [...] Australia [...] also struggled in their second innings, and [...] England required 263 runs to win the match. Palairet was dismissed for six, the third batsman to be bowled by Trumble in the innings, at which point England's score was 10 for 3 wickets. Lower order runs from the recalled Jessop and Hirst recovered the innings, and England won by one wicket. In Palairet's only other match against Australia that summer, [...] for Somerset, he scored 44 and 90 in a drawn game at Taunton. He made <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Test</b> appearances, and completed his brief Test career with 49 runs at an average of 12.25, against an Australian side that has been described as among the best Test teams prior to the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|A tall right-arm fast-medium bowler from Rhodesia, Lawrence {{was part}} of a new-look South African team for the series against New Zealand in 1961-62.

25|$|One {{clinical}} study has demonstrated {{the efficacy of}} IV lidocaine or oral mexilitine, though {{it should be noted}} that differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another trial has shown promise for misoprostol, while other have shown that gabapentin, venlafaxine and oral magnesium may also be effective, but <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>testing</b> was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.|$|R
500|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} reasons why Ganteaume played <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Test</b> cricket after his single match. Apart from {{the slow pace}} of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested {{that it would have been}} better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: [...] "Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly not someone who was going to bow and scrape to the white players who still dominated the region's cricket." [...] In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, My Story: The Other Side of the Coin was published, in which he criticised the West Indies [...] "establishment" [...] of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{building}} of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium for the 2007 World Cup, <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>Test</b> cricket was expected at the Recreation Ground. [...] However, due to the abandonment of the Second Test between West Indies v England on 13 February 2009 after just ten balls (due to an unfit outfield), an extra Test, called the Third Test, began at the Antigua Recreation Ground on 15 February 2009, despite concerns about the dilapidated condition of the stadium.|$|E

50|$|The Federal Communications Commission's Office of Engineering and Technology {{released}} a report dated July 31, 2007 with results from its investigation of two preliminary devices submitted. The report concluded that the devices did not reliably sense the presence of television transmissions or other incumbent users, hence are not acceptable for use in their current state and <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>testing</b> was deemed necessary.|$|R
50|$|Once {{a patient}} {{complains}} of dysphagia {{they should have}} an upper endoscopy (EGD). Commonly patients are found to have esophagitis and may have an esophageal stricture. Biopsies are usually done to look for evidence of esophagitis even if the EGD is normal. Usually <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>testing</b> is required if the diagnosis is established on EGD. Repeat endoscopy may be needed for follow up.|$|R

50|$|Telemetry {{results that}} were {{received}} for 13 seconds were good {{and it was}} found later that the crystal oscillator appeared to have failed thus stopping the computer.

50|$|Smith {{began the}} 1961-62 season with 127, putting on 244 {{for the first}} wicket with Hunte against Jamaica.

30|$|Based on the patient’s {{significant}} splenomegaly and 4 -day {{history of}} sore throat, {{the patient was}} given a presumptive diagnosis of mononucleosis. He was treated symptomatically: given IVF and anti-nausea and pain medications. After IVF, the patient’s HR decreased to 98  bpm. He was advised to avoid contact sports for the next 3 to 4  weeks. The patient was subsequently discharged with <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Drake also proves {{himself when}} he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning (Shepperd Strudwick) solve a problem in a blind-landing {{apparatus}} he is developing.

Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>testing</b> is allowed.|$|R

50|$|In 1922, Taylor and Young {{were making}} {{measurements}} with a transmitter {{located at the}} ARL and a receiver on the opposite shore of the Potomac River.

Taylor reported this to higher authorities as a potential method of detecting ships intruding into a formation, but <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>tests</b> were authorized.|$|R
50|$|In January 1930 {{he scored}} 73 not {{out against the}} MCC and was {{selected}} to play shortly afterwards in the first Test played at home by the West Indies, against England at Bridgetown.

25|$|As part of {{clinical}} decision-making, a simple, minimally invasive, in-office procedure may be performed, the rotator cuff impingement test.

If pain disappears and shoulder function remains good, <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>testing</b> is pursued.
