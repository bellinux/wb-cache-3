40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{two-dimensional}} radial column experiments to estimate longitudinal, and transverse dispersivity at the laboratory scale. The experimental device is an "annulus-and-core" device: {{it is based on}} a classical column system, of which the inlet reservoir is divided into three independent concentric zones, allowing non-uniform tracer injection. The outlet reservoir is similarly adapted, so that information on the radial distribution of concentration becomes available through mean effluent concentration measurements in each annular zone. In this study, we only investigated continuous tracer injections through the central inlet zone. An analytical solution to a similar problem was available in the literature, and was adapted to compute effluent concentrations. The influence of the simplified boundary conditions of the solution was assessed by means of a numerical model. A general methodology is suggested to obtain transport parameters from breakthrough curve analysis, involving (i) the determination of effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity from the full averaged breakthrough curve using classical one-dimensional tools and (ii) the determination of transverse dispersivity from the breakthrough curves recorded in the annular zones. Preliminary experiments were performed on a glass bead porous medium, on a gravel sand and on a <b>natural</b> <b>medium</b> <b>sand.</b> It is found that the rapidity of the test, its low cost, and the ability to simultaneously estimate three transport parameters comes at the price of potentially larger experimental errors. Transverse dispersivities were found to be higher than values previously reported in the literature, probably as a result of plume meandering, which cannot be detected nor corrected when using annulus-and-core devices.

The granular size distribution of dry blend was optimized to reduce the porosity of set material and the imitative RPC material was characterized by high silica fume content and with very low water to binder ratio. Furthermore, fine crushed aggregate and local <b>natural</b> <b>medium</b> crude <b>sand</b> were used to form mineral skeleton.

40|$|The {{sedimentation}} rate of sand grains in the hindered settling regime {{has been considered}} to assess particle shape effects. The behaviour of various particulate systems involving sand has been compared with the widely used Richardson-Zaki expression. The general form of the expression is found to hold, {{in as much as}} remaining as a suitable means to describe the hindered settling of irregular particles. The sedimentation exponent n in the Richardson-Zaki expression is found to be significantly larger for natural sand grains than for regular particles. The hindered settling effect is therefore greater, leading to lower concentration gradients than expected. The effect becomes more pronounced with increasing particle irregularity. At concentrations around 0. 4, the hindered settling velocity of fine and <b>medium</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> reduces to about 70 % of the value predicted using existing empirical expressions for n. Using appropriate expressions for the fluidization velocity and the clear water settling velocity, a simple method is discussed to evaluate the sedimentation exponent and to determine the hindered settling effect for sands of various shapes...|$|R

The clay is underlain by interbedded fine to <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> and clay to a depth of about 500 meters, which overlies granitic bedrock. Cr(VI) has been detected for about 20 years at concentration up to 16 milligrams per liter in groundwater samples collected from the shallower fine to <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> unit. The source is believed to be indiscriminate dumping of wastes resulting from production of Basic Chrome Sulfate (Cr(OH) 2 SO 4, BCS) and other reagents used by local leather tanneries. Approximately 540 kilograms of a carbohydrate-based remedial additive were injected into two wells screened in the fine to <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> unit using about 40, 000 liters of groundwater. Treatment solution make-up water was obtained from a downgradient extraction well located within the Cr(VI) plume, amended with remedial additive, and then injected into the upgradient wells to establish hydraulic control on the injection and minimize dilution. Performance monitoring included five rounds of groundwater sampling for Cr(VI), total chromium, and certain indicator parameters, including total organic carbon (TOC) as an electron donor surrogate.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{dependence}} of dispersivity on the thickness of aquifer has been investigated. The physical model {{used in the study}} consisted of a rectangular Plexiglas tank with inner dimensions of 720 mm length, 100 mm width and 1200 mm height. Sodium chloride with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 14 dS m - 1 was selected as conservative contaminant. Porous media used in the experiments consisted of homogeneous coarse and <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> particles. The experiments were performed in two different stages. In the first stage, 10 experiments in the aquifer with coarse sand particles and eight experiments in the aquifer with <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> particles with constant thickness of 100 mm and flow velocities ranging from 4. 5 x 10 - 5 to 11. 25 x 10 - 5 m sec - 1 were performed. In the second stage, experiments with thicknesses of 200 - 1000 and 100 mm layer distance were performed. The flow velocity in the second stage was maintained at 9. 0 x 10 - 5 m sec - 1 for each simulated aquifer, based on the previous studies. Results of the study indicated that: (1) the dispersivity values obtained for coarse and <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> particles with 100 mm thickness were in the range of 0. 25 - 0. 65 and 0. 11 - 0. 33 cm, respectively and the mean values of dispersivity for both aquifers were in the range of 0. 01 to 1. 0 cm which are in agreement with the findings of other researchers, (2) the dispersivity values obtained for aquifers with coarse and <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> particles and thicknesses of 200 - 1000 mm were in the range of 0. 31 - 0. 63 and 0. 14 - 0. 46 cm, respectively, which are in agreement with the findings of others as well, (3) the dispersivity of sandy porous media is independent of particle size and (4) in homogeneous sandy aquifers with coarse and medium particle size, the dispersivity is independent of aquifer thickness...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{measurements}} of near-bed sediment diffusivity profiles are reported. The observations were made over two sandy rippled beds, classified as ‘medium’ and ‘fine’ {{in terms of}} sand grain size, under slightly asymmetric regular waves. For the <b>medium</b> <b>sand,</b> the ripples that formed had relatively steep slopes, while for the fine sand, the slopes were roughly half that of the <b>medium</b> <b>sand.</b> In the <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> case, {{the form of the}} sediment diffusivity profiles was found to be constant with height above the bed, to a height equal approximately to the equivalent roughness of the bed, ks, while above this the sediment diffusivity increased linearly with height. For the case of the fine sand there was no constant region; the sediment diffusivity simply increased linearly with height from the bed. To understand the difference between the respective diffusivity profiles, advantage has been taken of the high temporal-spatial resolution available with acoustic systems. Using intra-wave ensemble averaging, detailed images have been built up of the variation in concentration with both the phase of the wave and also height above the bed. These intra-wave observations, combined with {{measurements of}} the bed forms and concepts of convective and diffusive entrainment, have been used to elucidate the mixing mechanisms that underlie the form of the diffusivity profiles observed over the two rippled beds. These mechanisms centre on coherent vortex shedding in the case of steeply rippled beds and random turbulent processes above ripples of lower steepness...|$|R

We hypothesized that the distribution of annual plants would be highly spatially autocorrelated and that this would be positively linked with the spatial distribution of erodible soil particles, soil organic matter and nutrients. Further, we hypothesized that larger vegetated patches (a relatively high vegetation cover at coarser spatial scale) will be stronger linked with erodible soil particles, organic matter and nutrients than smaller vegetated patches (a relatively low vegetation cover at coarser spatial scale). Generally, for `low cover' and `high cover' plots, spatially confined micro-elevations with a relatively high volume percentage of erodible very fine – <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> (50 – 400 μm), were linked with a higher cover of annual plants. The robustness of vegetation patchiness (expressed as the proportion of the total variance accounted for by spatial dependent variance) was significantly higher for the `high cover' plots.
