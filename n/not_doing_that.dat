[...] The director blamed piracy for the film's financial failure and felt that [...] "It's a film that, to some extent, needs the support of people who write about films. If you'd had all these guys running around talking in accented English you'd [...] your head taken off".|$|E

While on tour, former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne {{announced}} his first retirement, and invited Black Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his No More Tours tour in Costa Mesa, California. The band agreed, aside from vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who told Iommi {{in no uncertain terms}} [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> I'm not supporting a clown."

500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't there and you have to dig in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they are <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> When you look at their two big players, Henry and Vieira, [...] must do better in future." [...] Arsenal ended the month in second, five points behind leaders Chelsea.|$|E

2500|$|Variety {{reported}} in July 2009, that production on The Hangover 2 would begin in October 2010, for a May 26, 2011 release, {{following the same}} production schedule used for the first film. Also in July, Zach Galifianakis stated {{in an interview with}} Latino Review that the film will be set in Thailand, [...] "Well, I think we're going to Thailand.

2500|$|... "It {{just sort}} of happened," [...] said Amos. [...] "It started with Kels, Tash’s older cousin. Kels has been singing for years and is in {{performing}} arts school in Boston. She has a really big instrument. I thought {{we had to do}} something together that works. ‘Candle: Coventry Carol’ in itself is an ancient song, and I thought it would lend itself to that. And then Tash was thinking she wanted to do a bawdy song. And I said no. She wanted to do a bawdy British schoolboy read on a carol. And I said, “no, we’re <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> we’re not shocking grandma”. I came up with this idea of ‘Holly, Ivy and Rose’ and she really took to that idea. So in the end both of them are there. And I thought that was important because we all sing together." ...|$|E

6000|$|FIRST. To the first, to wit, {{that there}} is a fear of God that flows even from the light of nature. A people may be said to do things in a fear of God, when they act one towards another in things reasonable, and honest betwixt man and man, <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> to others they would not have done to themselves. This is that fear of God which Abraham thought the Philistines had {{destroyed}} in themselves, when he said of his wife to Abimelech, [...] "She is my sister." [...] For when Abimelech asked Abraham why he said of his wife, She is my sister; he replied, saying, [...] "I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake" [...] (Gen 20:11). I thought verily that in this place men had stifled and choked that light of nature that is in them, at least so far forth as not to suffer it to put them in fear, when their lusts were powerful in them to accomplish their ends on the object that was present before them. But this I will pass by, and come to the second thing, namely-- ...|$|E
