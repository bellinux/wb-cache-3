5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>transmission)</b> and blocking.|$|E

40|$|Snake bite causes {{significant}} {{morbidity and}} mortality in Sri Lanka. Snake venoms contain neurotoxins that block <b>neuromuscular</b> junction <b>transmission.</b> Pre-synaptic neurotoxicity most commonly causes destruction of nerve terminals with recovery by re-growth, whilst post-synaptic neurotoxicity usually involves competition at the acetylcholine receptor. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether there were long-term clinical or neurophysiological changes in snake bite survivors 1 year after their envenoming. Detailed neurophysiological tests and clinical examinations were performed on 26 snake bite victims who had presented with neurotoxicity 12 months previously, and their results were compared with controls recruited from the same communities. Significant differences were observed in some nerve conduction parameters in some snake bite cases compared with controls, predominantly in those thought to be due to elapid bites, including prolongation of sensory, motor and F-wave latencies and reduction of conduction velocities. There was no evidence of any residual deficits in <b>neuromuscular</b> junction <b>transmission.</b> These results suggest a possible demyelinating type polyneuropathy. None of the cases or controls had abnormalities on clinical examination. This is one of the few studies to report possible long-term neurological damage following systemic neurotoxicity after snake bite.

Analysis of these SMN target genes identifies Stasimon as a protein required for motor circuit function. Restoration of Stasimon expression in the motor circuit corrects defects in <b>neuromuscular</b> junction <b>transmission</b> and muscle growth in Drosophila SMN mutants and aberrant motor neuron development in SMN-deficient zebrafish.

40|$|Proctolin is a {{bioactive}} neuropeptide that modulates interneuronal and <b>neuromuscular</b> synaptic <b>transmission</b> in a {{wide variety}} of arthropods. We present several lines of evidence to propose that the orphan G protein-coupled receptor CG 6986 of Drosophila is a proctolin receptor. When expressed in mammalian cells, CG 6986 confers second messenger activation after proctolin application, with an EC 50 of 0. 3 nM. In competition-based studies, the CG 6986 receptor binds proctolin with high affinity (IC 50 = 4 nM). By microarray analysis, CG 6986 transcript is consistently detected in head mRNA of different genotypes, and under different environmental conditions. By blot analysis, anti-CG 6986 antibodies detect a band in tissue homogenates similar to the predicted size of the protein. Proctolin receptor immunosignals are found in the hindgut, heart, and in distinct neuronal populations of the CNS; such patterns correlate with previous demonstrations of proctolin biological activity, and in several instances, with areas of proctolin peptide immunosignals. The identification of a bona fide proctolin receptor provides the basis for a mechanistic analysis of this critical synaptic modulator...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivators (oximes) are {{compounds}} predominantly {{targeting the}} active {{site of the}} enzyme. Toxic effects of organophosphates nerve agents (OPNAs) are primarily related to their covalent binding to AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), critical detoxification enzymes in the blood and in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). After exposure to OPNAs, accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) overstimulates receptors and blocks <b>neuromuscular</b> junction <b>transmission</b> resulting in CNS toxicity. Current efforts at treatments for OPNA exposure are focused on non-quaternary reactivators, monoisonitrosoacetone oximes (MINA), and diacylmonoxime reactivators (DAM). However, so far only quaternary oximes have been approved for use in cases of OPNA intoxication. Five acetylcholinesterase reactivator candidates (K 027, K 075, K 127, K 203, K 282) are presented here, together with pharmacokinetic data (plasma concentration, human serum albumin binding potency).

40|$|Hereditary canine spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (HCSMA) {{features}} rapidly progressive muscle weakness that affects muscles in an apparent proximal-to-distal gradient. In the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle of homozygous HCSMA animals, motor unit tetanic failure is apparent before the appearance of muscle weakness {{and appears to be}} presynaptic in origin. We determined whether structural changes in neuromuscular junctions or muscle fibers were apparent at times when tetanic failure is prevalent. We were surprised to observe that, at ages when motor unit tetanic failure is common, the structure of neuromuscular junctions and the appearance of muscle fibers in the MG muscle were indistinguishable from those of symptom-free animals. In contrast, in more proximal muscles, many neuromuscular junctions were disassembled, with some postsynaptic specializations only partially occupied by motor nerve terminals, and muscle fiber atrophy and degeneration were also apparent. These observations suggest that the motor unit tetanic failure observed in the MG muscle in homozygous animals is not due to synaptic degeneration or to pathological processes that affect muscle fibers directly. Together with previous physiological analyses, our results suggest that motor unit failure is due to failure of <b>neuromuscular</b> synaptic <b>transmission</b> that precedes nerve or muscle degeneration...|$|R

40|$|Intracellular {{membrane}} fusion {{steps in}} eukaryotes require the syntaxin family of SNARE (soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein-attachment protein receptor) proteins. Syntaxins are regulated at several levels through interactions with regulatory proteins, including the SM (Sec 1 p/Munc 18) proteins. Key to understanding this regulation is {{the characterization of}} different SM-syntaxin binding interactions {{at the molecular level}} and in terms of their contribution to function in vivo. The most conserved SM-syntaxin binding mode is through interaction of the syntaxin's extreme N-terminal peptide with a hydrophobic pocket {{on the surface of the}} SM protein. Surprisingly, mutant versions of two different SM proteins abrogated for this binding display no discernable phenotypes in vivo. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Johnson et al. demonstrate that loss of the N-terminal binding interaction between the syntaxin UNC- 64 and the SM protein UNC- 18 severely impairs <b>neuromuscular</b> synaptic <b>transmission</b> in Caenorhabditis elegans, resulting in an unco-ordinated phenotype. In contrast, loss of a second mode of SM-syntaxin binding has no detectable effect.
