5|$|The Thanhouser {{adaption}} notably foregoes {{the famous}} Shakespearean stage directions: Exit, pursued by a bear. and allows Antigonus a peaceful exit. Another {{difference in the}} production is that following the collapse and reported death of Hermione. In the play, the audience is aligns with Leontes' view and gives <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> Hermione's death, but the Thanhouser adaptation shows the mechanism and conspiracy formed by showing Hermione's revival and departure. Instead of using the Shakespeare character of Time to frame the passage of time, the role is performed by an inter-title. The final scene is missing from the surviving print.|$|E
5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man and there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, {{and all sorts of}} exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} medieval period, {{large-scale}} conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and {{large numbers of}} converts are recorded {{within a year of}} the mission's arrival in Kent. By 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2June 597; there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> this date, but there is no other evidence for it. A letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598 mentions the number of converts made, but does not mention any baptism of the king in 597, although it is clear that by 601 he had been converted. The royal baptism probably took place at Canterbury but Bede does not mention the location.|$|E

5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival, Augustine founded the monastery of Saints Peter and Paul, which later became St Augustine's Abbey, on land {{donated by the}} king. This {{foundation}} has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it, Augustine introduced the Rule of St. Benedict into England, {{but there is no}} evidence the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule {{at the time of its}} foundation. In a letter Gregory wrote to the patriarch of Alexandria in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that a mass conversion took place. However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire. Little literary traces remain of them, however. One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.|$|E
5|$|Augustine was {{accompanied}} by Laurence of Canterbury, his eventual successor to the archbishopric, {{and a group of}} about 40 companions, some of whom were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted {{by the nature of the}} task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere. In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent. They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597. In the early medieval period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent. Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2 June 597; there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> this date, although there is no other evidence for it. Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted. His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.|$|E

The report concludes that the Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at the family members, as they could not perceive any danger from the house, its occupants or the surroundings.

500|$|Diodorus {{suggests}} that there were 1,000 Lacedemonians and 3,000 other Peloponnesians, totalling 4,000. Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by Simonides saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians. However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle. Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, [...] "helots were also there for them to see", {{but he does not}} say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle. If helots were present at the battle, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' [...] "missing" [...] 900 troops might have been Perioeci, and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.|$|E

In 1950, with an eye to taking the orchestra on international tours, he had written a letter to the American consul in Toronto admitting his former affiliation. He received his visa in November 1951 without any difficulties. After the six musicians were denied entry and before the orchestra had left for the United States, MacMillan solicited help for them from the Canadian ambassador in Washington, but his plea was unsuccessful. In January 1952 he wrote to US immigration officials trying to clear Staryk's name, lauding him as [...] "an exceptionally talented violinist and valuable member of the orchestra. I have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that he has no Communist affiliations other than that he played from ages twelve to fourteen with a Ukrainian orchestra that is under some suspicion". [...] His entreaties on behalf of Staryk did not help to exonerate the musician.|$|E

500|$|If an {{occupier}} allows {{an extremely}} dangerous activity {{to take place}} on his land without taking precautions to ensure the contractor has liability insurance and a safety plan, he may be held liable. In Bottomley v Todmorden Cricket Club [...] the Court of Appeal held that, where the defendant had allowed an independent contractor {{to set up a}} pyrotechnic display on their land without checking for public liability insurance, they were liable for the injuries suffered by the claimant. The extent to which one has to check for public liability insurance is weak; in Gwilliam v West Hertfordshire Hospital NHS Trust [...] the Court of Appeal held that where the contractor's insurance had expired {{a few days before the}} event, the occupier was not liable. In Naylor v Payling the occupier was not liable for failing to check public liability, since he had checked the contractor was accredited under the police and local government schemes required, and the contractor had been employed for 18 months before the case during which there were <b>no</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> his competency. The Court of Appeal also held that, except in special circumstances, there was no [...] "free-standing duty" [...] to take reasonable steps to ensure an independent contractor was insured.|$|R
500|$|Not {{long after}} the Goode case came the sensational trial of Professor John White Webster {{in the murder of}} George Parkman, a crime that took place at the Harvard Medical School in November 1849.

[...] Furthermore, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw was widely criticized for bias in the instructions he gave to the jury. [...] Briggs was petitioned to commute Webster's sentence by death penalty opponents, and even threatened with physical harm if he did not. [...] He refused however, stating that the evidence in the case was clear (especially after Webster gave a confession), and that there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that the court had acted with due and proper diligence.|$|E
500|$|During antiquity the Catalogue {{was almost}} universally {{considered}} {{the work of}} Hesiod. Pausanias reports, however, that the Boeotians living around Mount Helicon during his day believed that the only genuine Hesiodic poem was the Works and Days and that even the first 10 lines of that poem (the so-called [...] "hymn to Zeus") were spurious. The only other surviving expression of doubt is found in Aelian, who cites [...] "Hesiod" [...] {{for the number of}} Niobe's children, but qualifies his citation with [...] "unless these verses are not by Hesiod, but have been passed off falsely as his, like many other passages." [...] But Aelian's skepticism could have stemmed from the belief, still common today, that Hesiodic poetry was especially susceptible to [...] interpolation, and it is impossible to tell whether he regarded the entire Catalogue as spurious or not. These two passages are, in any event, isolated, and more discerning critics like Apollonius of Rhodes, Aristophanes of Byzantium and Crates of Mallus apparently found <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> the attribution to Hesiod, {{going so far as to}} cite the Catalogue in arguments concerning the content and authenticity of other Hesiodic poems.|$|E
500|$|The {{best known}} relic {{associated}} with Offa's time is Offa's Dyke, a great earthen barrier that runs approximately {{along the border}} between England and Wales. It is mentioned by the monk Asser in his biography of Alfred the Great: [...] "a certain vigorous king called Offa... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea". The dyke has not been dated by archaeological methods, but most historians find <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> Asser's attribution. Early names for the dyke in both Welsh and English also support the attribution to Offa. Despite Asser's comment that the dyke ran [...] "from sea to sea", it is now thought that the original structure only covered {{about two-thirds of the}} length of the border: in the north it ends near Llanfynydd, less than five miles (8km) from the coast, while in the south it stops at Rushock Hill, near Kington in Herefordshire, less than fifty miles (80km) from the Bristol Channel. The total length of this section is about 64 miles (103km). Other earthworks exist along the Welsh border, of which Wat's Dyke is one of the largest, but {{it is not possible to}} date them relative to each other and so it cannot be determined whether Offa's Dyke was a copy of or the inspiration for Wat's Dyke.|$|E
