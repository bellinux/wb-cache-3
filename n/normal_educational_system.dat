40|$|AbstractInclusive {{education}} is the attempt to educate persons with intellectual disabilities by integrating them {{as closely as possible}} into the normal structures of the <b>educational</b> <b>system.</b> As this necessitates various kinds of “inclusion through selective exclusion” (partial exemption from grades, special classes, special treatment by teachers, etc.), inclusive {{education is}} inherently faced by tensions. Drawing on sociological systems theory, we argue that these tensions can be assigned to three levels of the <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> – the level of the functional macrosystem of education, the level of the organization and the level of the individual (classroom) interaction. Analyzed in this way, it becomes possible to see that the dilemmas of inclusive education result from tensions between the three levels – e. g., inclusion into <b>normal</b> <b>educational</b> organizations requires exclusion from certain functions of the macrosystem of education and so on. The tensions themselves cannot be fully resolved, but they can certainly be addressed in ways that may be more satisfactory to individuals with special educational needs...|$|R

40|$|An {{adaptive}} <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> {{is complex}} to model. Such a system should allow various didactic, educational and student styles and is traditionally {{divided into four}} modules for analysis and building: Domain Knowledge Base, Tutoring, the Student Interface, and the Student. In particular, the system should adapt to differences between students and the changes in a particular student. One of the main problems when trying to develop an adaptive <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> is that definitions used for instructional design by psychologists and pedagogy experts are vague, while developers work with concrete terms like variables, stochastic values and objects. To make {{the concept of an}} adaptive <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> more concrete, this work models the simplest possible adaptive <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> that could exist. The contribution of the paper is that it gives a good description of a basic adaptive <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> and reasons about concrete solutions. The novelty in the paper is that adaptivity occurs {{in each of the four}} modules: The system selects an appropriate domain knowledge base model, an appropriate tutoring model, an appropriate (student) Interface model, and an appropriate Student model.
