25|$|Cedar Creek Lake is {{a fourth}} water source for Tarrant Regional Water District's water supply. Its <b>normal</b> <b>system</b> {{capacity}} is 322.00ft(98.15m) above sea level. When the lake gets over that point, gates from the spillway are opened, releasing water; 2005 and 2006 were dry years, sending {{the lake to}} a record low on December 12, 2006. The lake fell to 8.04ft(2.45m) below normal, at 313.96ft(95.7m). This passed the old record of 6.22ft(2m) low set on May 8, 1981. That afternoon, the lake received over 4in(102mm) of rain, causing the lake to rise about 6in(152mm). This was the first significant rainfall since April 2006. It was the big turning point for the drought in North Texas, as more rain continued through the month. By January 1, the lake was only a little over 6 feet (2 m) low. Huge rainstorms throughout January brought the lake to only 2 feet (0.6 m) low. A bit of a break came in February, as mainly snow and ice added to the lake rising. By March 31, 2007, the lake was at 322.12ft(98.18m) and the flood gates were open {{for the first time}} since April 20, 2005. Lake Benbrook, Lake Worth, and Lake Arlington also filled up in these rains. Later on, Richland-Chambers Reservoir filled up all the way, then Eagle Mountain, and then on June 30, 2007, Lake Bridgeport was full {{for the first time since}} May 15, 2001, more than six years since the flood gates had been open. It was a milestone for Tarrant regional water district having all seven of their lakes full. On the night of July 5, more than 5in(127mm) of rain fell, sending Cedar Creek lake from a half foot (15cm) over to 1.5 feet (45cm) over, beating the old 1.47ft(0m) set in November 2001.|$|E

We study galaxy groups in both,numerical simulations and observations. We use a variety of statistical tools including the spatial cross-correlation function and the local density parameter Δ_ 5 to probe differences in the density and structure of the environments of <b>normal</b> and fossil <b>systems</b> in the Millennium simulation. We find that the number density of galaxies surrounding fossil systems evolves from greater than that observed around <b>normal</b> <b>systems</b> at z= 0. 69, to lower than the <b>normal</b> <b>systems</b> by z= 0. Both fossil and <b>normal</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit an increment in their otherwise radially declining local density measure (Δ_ 5) at distances of order 2. 5 r_vir from the system centre. We show that this increment is more noticeable for fossil <b>systems</b> than <b>normal</b> <b>systems</b> and demonstrate that this difference is linked to the earlier formation epoch of fossil groups. Despite the importance of the assembly time, we show that the environment is different for fossil and non-fossil systems with similar masses and formation times along their evolution.

Our results confirm the commonly held belief that fossil systems assembled earlier than <b>normal</b> <b>systems</b> but also show that the surroundings of fossil groups could be responsible for the formation of their large magnitude gap.

25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the <b>normal</b> <b>system</b> voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E

2500|$|Stray voltage is {{any case}} of {{undesirable}} elevated electrical potential, but more precise terminology gives {{an indication of}} the source of the [...] voltage. Neutral to earth voltage (NEV) specifically refers to a difference in potential between a locally grounded object and the grounded return conductor, or neutral, of an electrical system. The neutral is theoretically at 0V potential, as any grounded object, but current flows on the neutral back to the source, somewhat elevating the neutral voltage. [...] NEV is the product of current flowing on the neutral and the finite, non-zero impedance of the neutral conductor between a given point and its source, often a distant substation. [...] NEV differs from accidentally energized objects because it is an unavoidable result of <b>normal</b> <b>system</b> operation, not an accident or a fault in materials or design.|$|E
2500|$|The World Nuclear Association argues that: [...] "Obviously sun, wind, tides {{and waves}} cannot be {{controlled}} to provide directly either continuous base-load power, or peak-load power {{when it is}} needed,..." [...] "In practical terms non-hydro renewables are therefore able to supply up to some 15–20% of the capacity of an electricity grid, though they cannot directly be applied as economic substitutes for most coal or nuclear power, however significant they become in particular areas with favourable conditions." [...] "If the fundamental opportunity of these renewables is their abundance and relatively widespread occurrence, the fundamental challenge, especially for electricity supply, is applying them to meet demand given their variable and diffuse nature. This means either {{that there must be}} reliable duplicate sources of electricity beyond the <b>normal</b> <b>system</b> reserve, or some means of electricity storage." [...] "Relatively few places have scope for pumped storage dams close to where the power is needed, and overall efficiency is less than 80%.

2500|$|Admiral Tryon was {{concerned}} that the <b>normal</b> <b>system</b> of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships to raise flags to confirm they had seen and understood, and then lowering the initial flags to signal everyone to carry it out. [...] The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing the many possible flag combinations and virtually no one knew them all. In a real battle this process might take too much time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which the flags must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter-flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships simply had to follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement. This was {{a radical departure from}} contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance The Times newspaper considered it [...] "unsound in theory and perilous in practice", whilst Rear-Admiral William Kennedy on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that [...] "the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war".|$|E

6000|$|Ireland in {{the middle}} of the eighteenth century was to England just what the American colonies would have been, if they had contained, besides the European settlers, more than twice their number of unenslaved negroes.

The Protestants and landlords were supreme; the peasants and the Catholics were prostrate in despair. The Revolution brought about in Ireland just the reverse of what it effected in England. Here it delivered the body of the nation from the attempted supremacy of a small sect. There it made a small sect supreme over the body of the nation.
