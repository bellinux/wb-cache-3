30|$|According to this work, {{we observe}} {{that both of}} {{proactive}} routing and reactive routing have specialized skills. The proactive detection method has the better packet delivery ratio and correct detection probability, but suffered from the higher routing overhead due to the periodically broadcast packets. The reactive detection method eliminates the routing overhead problem from the event-driven way, but suffered from some packet loss {{in the beginning of}} routing procedure. Therefore, we recommend that a hybrid detection method which combined the advantages of proactive routing with reactive routing is the tendency to future research direction. However, we also discover that the attacker's misbehavior action is the key factor. The attackers are able to avoid the detection mechanism, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> of routing detection used.

STZ-induced diabetic rats were given low-protein diet(5 □ protein in fodder, LPD group) or low-protein diet supplemented with α-keto acids(5 □ protein in fodder including 1 □ protein supplied by α-keto acids, LPD+α-KA group) or normal-protein diet(10 □protein in fodder, NPD group) for 8 weeks□The p 27 protein of glomerular lysate was detected with Western Blot. The extracellular matrix (ECM) protein(type IV collagen and fibronectin) of glomerular lysate and 24 h urine albumin were examined with ELISA□ Image analysis system was used to detect the diameter of each glomerulus.

In order to eliminate the problem of phase uncertainty, three different precise (known) reflection standards or one known reflection standard plus one known transmission standard should be used to calibrate symmetrical test fixtures. For the asymmetrical cases, three known standards, including at least one transmission standard, should be used. The thru-open-match (TOM) and thru-short-match (TSM) techniques are the simplest methods, and they have no bandwidth limitation. When the standards are imprecise (unknown), it is recommended to use any suitable technique, such as the thru-reflect-line, line-reflect-line, thru-short-delay, thru-open-delay,line-reflect-match, line-reflect-reflect-match, or multiline methods, to accurately determine the values of the required calibration terms and, in addition, to use the TOM or TSM method with the same imprecise standards to resolve the phase uncertainty...|$|R
