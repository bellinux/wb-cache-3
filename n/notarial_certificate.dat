50|$|For the {{purposes}} of authentication, most countries require commercial or personal documents which originate from or are signed in another country to be notarized {{before they can be}} used or officially recorded or before they can have any legal effect. To these documents a notary affixes a <b>notarial</b> <b>certificate</b> which attests to the execution of the document, usually by the person who appears before the notary, known as an appearer or constituent (U.S.). In places where lawyer notaries are the norm, a notary may also draft legal instruments known as notarial acts or deeds which have probative value and executory force, as they do in civil law jurisdictions. Originals or secondary originals are then filed and stored in the notary's archives, or protocol.|$|E
