25|$|The {{predecessor}} of CCNU is {{the combination}} of Huachung University (华中大学), Chunghua University (私立武昌中华大学) and the Pedagogical College of Zhongyuan University, with Huachung University as the main part. Huachung University was {{the largest and most}} influential mission university in south central China, and it developed from Boone College which was founded in 1903. In 1951, the public Huazhong University came into being after the Pedagogical College of Zhongyuan University merged with Huachung University. Then it was reorganized into Huazhong Higher Normal College in 1952 and later renamed Central China Normal College in 1953. In 1985, the university was formally entitled Central China Normal University and Deng Xiaoping, {{one of the founders of}} Zhongyuan University, inscribed the new name of the university. In 1993, President Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription for the university “Developing <b>normal</b> <b>education,</b> improving the nation’s quality”.|$|E
25|$|Taiwanese {{literature}} {{mainly focused}} on the Taiwanese spirit and the essence of Taiwanese culture. People in literature and the arts {{began to think about}} issues of Taiwanese culture, and attempted to establish a culture that truly belonged to Taiwan. The significant cultural movement throughout the colonial period were led by the young generation who were highly educated in formal Japanese schools. Education played such a key role in supporting the government and to a larger extent, developing economic growth of Taiwan. However, despite the government prime effort in elementary education and <b>normal</b> <b>education,</b> there was a limited number of middle schools, approximately 3 across the whole country, so the preferred choices for graduates were leaving for Tokyo or other cities to get an education. The foreign education of the young students was carried out solely by individuals' self-motivation and support from family. Education abroad got its popularity, particularly from Taichung county, with the endeavor for acquiring skills and knowledge of civilization even under the situation of neither the colonial government nor society being able to guarantee their bright future; with no job plan for these educated people after their return.|$|E
6000|$|In one {{matter the}} {{careless}} and prejudiced nature of accepted racial generalisations is particularly marked. A great and {{increasing number of}} people are persuaded that [...] "half-breeds" [...] are peculiarly evil creatures--as hunchbacks and bastards were supposed {{to be in the middle}} ages. The full legend of the wickedness of the half-breed is best to be learnt from a drunken mean white from Virginia or the Cape. The half-breed, one hears, combines all the vices of either parent, he is wretchedly poor in health and spirit, but vindictive, powerful, and dangerous to an extreme degree, his morals--the mean white has high and exacting standards--are indescribable even in whispers in a saloon, and so on, and so on. There is really not an atom of evidence an unprejudiced mind would accept to sustain any belief of the sort. There is nothing to show that the children of racial admixture are, as a class, inherently either better or worse in any respect than either parent. There is an equally baseless theory that they are better, a theory displayed to a fine degree of foolishness in the article on Shakespeare in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Both theories belong to the vast edifice of sham science that smothers the realities of modern knowledge. It may be that most [...] "half-breeds" [...] are failures in life, but that proves nothing. They are, in an enormous number of cases, illegitimate and outcast from the <b>normal</b> <b>education</b> of either race; they are brought up in homes that are the battle-grounds of conflicting cultures; they labour under a heavy premium of disadvantage. There is, of course, a passing suggestion of Darwin's to account for atavism that might go to support the theory of the vileness of half-breeds, if it had ever been proved. But, then, it never has been proved. There is no proof in the matter at all.|$|E
