5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E

In 1955 Cruikshank was named director of the AFL's newly formed Department of Social Security. He continued in that role after the AFL and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) merged in 1955. Cruikshank used his position to protect and enhance Social Security as part of the union movement's commitment to a comprehensive legislative package of federal social insurance programs, including <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance and income supports for the poor, people with disabilities and the unemployed. He created the AFL-CIO's Social Security Advisory Committee as a political group to press for higher and expanded benefits.

25|$|The United States <b>National</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> Act is a {{perennial}} {{piece of legislation}} introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Representative John Conyers (D-MI). The act would establish a universal single-payer {{health care system in}} the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare, the United Kingdom's National Health Service, and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples. The bill was first introduced in 2003 and has been reintroduced in each Congress since. During the 2009 health care debates over the bill that became the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 676 was expected to be debated and voted upon by the House in September 2009, but was never debated. In the wake of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, in which a push for universal healthcare featured prominently, single-payer proposals gained traction. John Conyers reintroduced his bill in the House of Representatives in January 2017. Four months later, the bill was supported by 112 co-sponsors, surpassing {{for the first time the}} 25% mark of co-sponsorship. In September of the same year, Bernie Sanders himself, together with 16 co-sponsors, introduced a Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate (S. 1804).|$|E

40|$|Issue addressed: There {{has been}} a growing {{national}} and global focus {{on the need to}} address social determinants of health to better achieve equitable health outcomes. In Australia, this focus is now being embedded into state, territory and Commonwealth government health policies. In this paper I use the <b>National</b> Primary <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> Strategic Framework as a case study to examine the way in which ‘health equity’ and other related terms have been framed within a current <b>national</b> <b>health</b> policy context. Discussion: Using a critically reflective approach, I argue that primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and <b>health</b> promotion professionals need to capitalise on the inclusion of terms such as ‘action on social determinants of health’, ‘health equity’ and ‘reducing inequity’ through emerging <b>national</b> <b>health</b> policies, such as the <b>National</b> Primary <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> Strategic Framework. Yet, there is also a need to proceed with caution. The way in which these terms are framed appears to deviate from the principles, values and ideologies on which they are historically based. The implications for contemporary health promotion practice in Australia are discussed. Conclusions: Primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and <b>health</b> promotion professionals working in both policy and practice contexts are encouraged to engage in critical reflective practice when interpreting and considering the implementation requirements of <b>national</b> <b>health</b> policies that incorporate a health equity focus. So what?: To build health equity in Australia, primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and <b>health</b> promotion professionals will be required to engage in the skilful reframing of current primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> policy discourses relating to health equity during health promotion planning, implementation and evaluation processes...|$|R
