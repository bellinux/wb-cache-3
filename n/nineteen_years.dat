40|$|In {{traditional}} models, {{votes are}} {{an expression of}} preferences and beliefs. Psychological theories of cognitive dissonance suggest, however, that behavior may shape preferences. In this view, {{the very act of}} voting may influence political attitudes. A vote for a candidate may lead to more favorable interpretations of his actions in the future. We test the empirical relevance of cognitive dissonance in US Presidential elections. The key problem in such a test is the endogeneity of voter choice which leads to a mechanical relationship between voting and preferences. We use the voting age restrictions to help surmount this difficulty. We examine the Presidential opinion ratings of <b>nineteen</b> and twenty <b>year</b> olds two years after the President's election. Consistent with cognitive dissonance, we find that twenty year olds (who were eligible to vote in the election) show greater polarization of opinions than comparable <b>nineteen</b> <b>year</b> olds (who were ineligible to vote). We rule out that aging drives these results in two ways. First, we find no polarization differences in years in which twenty and <b>nineteen</b> <b>year</b> olds woul...|$|R

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of nobelium is incompletely characterized {{and is known}} only in aqueous solution, in which it can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states, the latter being more stable. It was largely expected before the discovery of nobelium that in solution, it would behave like the other actinides, with the trivalent state being predominant; however, Seaborg predicted in 1949 that the +2 state would also be relatively stable for nobelium, as the No2+ ion would have the ground-state electron configuration 5f14, including the stable filled 5f14 shell.

Although Stephen had tried to continue Henry I's method of government during his reign, the younger Henry's new government characterised those <b>nineteen</b> <b>years</b> as a chaotic and troubled period, with all these problems resulting from Stephen's usurpation of the throne. Henry was also careful to show that, unlike his mother the Empress, he would listen to the advice and counsel of others.

The process of demolishing the unauthorised castles from the war continued. Efforts were made to restore the system of royal justice and the royal finances.
