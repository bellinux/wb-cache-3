5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, {{the brightest star}} in the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
5|$|The astrological symbol Pisces {{is based}} on a {{constellation}} of the same name, {{but there is also a}} second fish constellation in the <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> Piscis Austrinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E

5|$|Capella was the {{brightest}} star in the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close {{to each other in the}} sky and served as boreal pole stars at the time.|$|E

Its regular <b>Night's</b> <b>Sky</b> segment provides an overview of sights in Northern and Southern hemisphere's <b>night</b> <b>skies</b> for amateur astronomers on a month-by-month basis, and it also regularly interacts with listeners and answers questions related to astronomy and astrophysics during its monthly Ask an Astronomer segments.|$|R
50|$|Many {{works of}} fiction have {{featured}} UFOs. In most cases, as the fictional story progresses, the Earth is being invaded by hostile alien forces from outer space, usually from Mars, as depicted in early science fiction, or the people are being destroyed by alien forces, as depicted in the film Independence Day. Some fictional UFO encounters may be based on real UFO reports, such as <b>Night</b> <b>Skies.</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Skies</b> {{is based on the}} 1997 Phoenix UFO Incident.|$|R
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion {{with respect to}} the background stars. That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> performing a looping motion.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{projector}} was a -long dumbbell-shaped object, with -diameter spheres attached at {{each end}} representing the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> for {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. Connecting the two spheres was a framework that held nearly 150 individual projectors, including those dedicated to the planets, the Sun, and specific stars.|$|E

5|$|The third version {{featured}} a photocell {{to measure the}} brightness of the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> and the ship's side; the projectors' brightness was automatically controlled to balance out the difference. It was tested in September 1941 on the corvette HMCS Kamloops.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E

5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|Hordern's London debut came in January 1937, as an {{understudy}} to Bernard Lee in {{the play}} <b>Night</b> <b>Sky</b> at the Savoy Theatre. On nights {{when he was not}} required, Hordern would be called upon to undertake the duties of assistant stage manager, for which he was paid £2.10s a week. In March, Daltry, who had since formed his own company, Westminster Productions, cast Hordern as Ludovico in Othello.|$|E
