5|$|At {{the same}} time Crimean Tatars devastated Russian territories and burned and looted Moscow during the Russo-Crimean Wars. Drought and {{epidemics}} had fatally affected the Russian economy while oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government. Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572, oprichnina was wound down {{and with it the}} way Russian armies were formed also changed. Ivan IV had introduced a <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E
5|$|Brooke's {{appointment}} {{coincided with}} more trained men and better equipment becoming available. Under Brooke, new strategies and tactics were devised.

Many of these anti-tank islands were established along the already constructed stop lines, where existing defences could {{be integrated into the}} <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> and, especially, at towns and villages where there was a Home Guard to provide personnel.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} {{at home on}} February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> for his team, which was {{struggling}} in conference play. In this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation {{and went on to}} win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{promoted}} to lieutenant general in November 2008, Dutton succeeded Army Lieutenant General Jonathon Riley as Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, a position he occupied until November 2009. During his tenure, the insurgency in Afghanistan peaked. Dutton helped American General Stanley A. McChrystal, then overall commander of troops in the country, formulate a <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> to combat the insurgency, which included {{an increase in the}} number of troops. Dutton was succeeded in his post at ISAF by Lieutenant General (later General Sir) Nick Parker at the end of 2009.|$|E
5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} measurements {{revealed the}} existence of a planet with a mass of at least 7 Earths. This planet, GJ 3634 b, became the first planet to be discovered under the <b>new</b> <b>strategy.</b> The team of astronomers then followed up with transit measurements using instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope; they found that there was most likely no transit event present at the star, but they were able to discover its true mass. GJ 3634 b was published to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011.|$|E

In popular accounts, they vanished in the sky, fell sick, or took their own lives by jumping into a river and drowning. Violence in the region continued, and there were seven periods of unrest between 100 and 184. A <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> was adopted, orchestrated by the official Li Gu, that sought to appoint honest officials, exile hostile tribes, and pit tribal leaders against each other. The strategy was only partially successful.|$|E
5|$|While Shigeru Miyamoto {{had been}} the {{principal}} director of Super Mario 64, he was {{now in charge of}} several directors as a producer and supervisor of Ocarina of Time. During its development, individual parts of Ocarina of Time were handled by multiple directors—a <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> for Nintendo EAD. Four or five initial teams grew in number as needed over time, each working on different basic experiments of game design including scenario and planning, Link's actions and transforming classic 2D items into improved 3D form, camera experiments, motion capture, sound, special effects, and the flow of time. However, when progress was slower than expected, Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more hands-on directorial role.|$|E
5|$|While the N-terminal nucleotide-binding {{pocket of}} Hsp90 is most widely studied and thus targeted, {{recent studies have}} {{suggested}} that a second ATP-binding site is located in the Hsp90 C-terminus. Targeting of this region has resulted in specific reduced Hsp90-hormone interactions and has been shown to influence Hsp90 nucleotide binding. Although none of the C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors have yet to enter the clinic, the use of both N- and C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in combination represents an exciting <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> for chemotherapy.|$|E

5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} a <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> {{in the search}} for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a <b>new</b> <b>strategy,</b> which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|According to the <b>new</b> <b>strategy,</b> {{the forces}} under Girolamo Ramorino and Tomasz Łubieński {{were to leave}} the city and stay on the right bank of the Vistula, harass the Russian forces under von Rosen and von Rüdiger, capture the river {{crossings}} at Osiek, provide the city with supplies, and force Paskevich to divert some of his forces to fight them. Both forces left the city between 16 and 20 August 1831. Tomasz Łubieński's Corps headed towards Płock, broke the encirclement, and delivered much-needed supplies to Warsaw. His forces also broke the northern line of communications between Paskevich's forces and East Prussia. Girolamo Ramorino's II Corps in Podlasie defeated von Rosen's Corps in several clashes, including the battles of Międzyrzec and Rogoźnica. Ramorino's indecisiveness and disregard for orders allowed the defeated and numerically inferior Russians to retreat towards Brześć Litewski and avoid complete destruction.|$|E

5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's <b>new</b> <b>strategy</b> appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E

Stone, Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee {{to carry out the}} plan. Stone drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, Stone, Wendell Phillips and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, Stone and Phillips addressed a select committee of the Maine legislature.|$|E
