China’s <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> made greater contributions to the GDP {{of most of the}} eastern provinces. The contribution was the greatest to Guangdong Province, whose value added contributed by <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> in 2007 reached 1311.8 billion yuan, accounting for 43  % of Guangdong’s GDP. <b>National</b> <b>exports</b> made smaller contributions to the GDP of the central provinces, such as Hunan and Hubei Provinces, whose value added contributed by <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> only accounted for approximately 9  % of their provincial GDPs. Although the western provinces are the farthest from the export ports, the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to these provinces’ GDP was not the smallest. The average contribution in the western provinces was greater than the contribution in the central provinces (the arithmetic mean of the percentages of the value added of the 11 western provinces contributed by <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> was 7.8  %, whereas that of the 6 central provinces was 7  %).|$|R

30|$|First, <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> make {{significantly}} different contributions to provincial GDP in different regions in China. The contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the GDP {{of the eastern}} provinces was significantly greater than the contribution to the GDP of the provinces in other regions. The contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the GDP of the central and western provinces was small, but the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the economies of the central and western provinces was significantly greater than the foreign export dependence. Therefore, in the current international market downturn, the eastern provinces, which occupy {{a higher proportion of}} foreign trade, must accelerate their transformation to address the negative impacts of the export slump. The central and western provinces must also make full use of their comparative advantages by undertaking an industrial transformation and improving the development environment to address the indirect impacts of the export slump.|$|R

Niger has been a uranium exporter since the 1960s and has had substantial export earnings and rapid economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s.

When the uranium-led boom ended in the early 1980s the economy stagnated, and new investment since then has been limited.

30|$|Table  3 {{also shows}} the foreign export {{dependence}} of each province. The data in Table  3 {{indicate that the}} foreign export dependence {{of most of the}} eastern provinces was relatively higher. The foreign export dependence of Guangdong Province was the highest, reaching 93  % in 2007. To some extent, this explains why <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> made such a great contribution to the GDP of the eastern provinces. By comparing the foreign export dependence of each eastern province with the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to their GDP, however, we observed that the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the eastern provinces’ GDP was far less than their foreign export dependence. For example, the foreign export dependence of Guangdong Province was 93  %, whereas its value added contributed by <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> accounted for 43  % of its GDP. There are two important reasons for this: first, a large part of China’s foreign trade belongs to the processing trade (i.e., exports require the import {{of a large number of}} intermediate products), and the domestic value added rate is low. Therefore, although the foreign export dependence is higher, the percentage of the value added contributed by exports is relatively low. The economic relationships between the regions lead to high export spillover effects in the eastern provinces; in other words, the exports of these provinces require the purchase of intermediate raw materials from inland provinces, which boosts the GDPs of the inland provinces. This is why foreign export dependence cannot be used to measure the contribution of exports to provincial GDP. In fact, the contribution of exports to the eastern provinces’ economies tends to be overestimated when using foreign export dependence.|$|R
