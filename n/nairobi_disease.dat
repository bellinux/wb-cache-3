The isolation of <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> virus, Getah, Batai and Arkonam and serological {{evidence of the}} circulation of California encephalitis serogroup and Chandipura viruses have been reported {{for the first time}} in Sri Lanka. The ecology of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in areas with epidemic disease and sylvatic infection has been compared. A synchronous pattern of seroconversion in pigs and seroprevalence in cattle are more predictive of epidemic JE risk than overall porcine seroprevalence which is a good indicator of the presence of sylvatic JE rather than of human epidemic risk. Relatively modest changes in vector abundance associated with rainfall or agricultural practices have dramatic changes on the emergence of epidemic JE. Chandipura virus which is known to cause major outbreaks of encephalitis in India is endemic in Sri Lanka as are viruses belonging to the California encephalitis serogroup.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever in South Africa patients were encountered who had been bitten by ticks, but who lacked evidence of infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus or non-viral tick-borne agents.

The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905 / 2116 (42. 8 %) for CCHF virus, 70 / 1358 (5. 2 %) for Dugbe, 21 / 1358 (1. 5 %) for louping ill, 6 / 450 (1. 3 %) for West Nile, 7 / 1358 (0. 5 %) for <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease,</b> 3 / 625 (0. 5 %) for Kadam and 2 / 450 (0. 4 %) for Chenuda.

40|$|AbstractSequence {{analysis}} of the L RNA genome segment and predicted encoded L polymerase protein of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus (genus Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae) demonstrates that they are approximately {{twice the size of}} those found in viruses of other bunyavirus genera.

The identification of an ovarian tumor (OTU) -like protease motif in the L protein amino termini of the nairoviruses Dugbe, CCHF, and <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> (NSD) indicates these proteins are members of the recently described OTU-like protease family and suggests that these large proteins may be polyproteins that are autoproteolytically cleaved or involved in deubiquitination...|$|R

Little is currently known about the biology of NSDV. We have gen-erated specific antibodies against the virus nucleocapsid protein (N) and polymerase (L) and used these to characterise NSDV in infected cells and to study its distribution during in-fection in a natural host. Due to its large size and the presence of a papain-like protease (the OTU-like domain) {{it has been suggested that}} the L protein of nairoviruses undergoes an autoproteolytic cleavage into polymerase and one or more accessory proteins. Specific antibodies which recognise either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the NSDV L protein showed no evidence of L protein cleavage in NSDV-infected cells.

Tick-borne viruses are found in six different virus families (Asfarviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae) and at least 9 genera.

We have developed a real-time PCR assay for the virus genome and validated it in a pilot study of the pathogenicity induced by two different isolates of NSDV/GV. One isolate was highly adapted to tissue culture, grew in most cell lines tested, and was essentially apathogenic in sheep. The second isolate appeared to be poorly adapted to cell culture and retained pathogenicity in sheep. The real-time PCR assay for virus easily detected 4 copies or less of the viral genome, and allowed a quantitative measure of the virus in whole blood.

The virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, causes abortions and mortality in young animals in addition to haemorrhagic fevers in humans.

Genomic sequence {{information is}} limited {{for members of the}} Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes, Qalyub, Sakhalin, and Thiafora nairovirus species. We used next-generation sequencing and historical virus-culture samples to determine 14 complete and nine coding-complete nairoviral genome sequences to further characterize these species. Previously unsequenced viruses include Abu Mina, Clo Mor, Great Saltee, Hughes, Raza, Sakhalin, Soldado, and Tillamook viruses. In addition, we present genomic sequence information on additional isolates of previously sequenced Avalon, Dugbe, Sapphire II, and Zirqa viruses. Finally, we identify Tunis virus, previously thought to be a phlebovirus, as an isolate of Abu Hammad virus. Phylogenetic analyses indicate the need for reassignment of Sapphire II virus to Dera Ghazi Khan nairovirus and reassignment of Hazara, Tofla, and <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> viruses to novel species.

Clinical symptoms exhibited by persons infected by viruses belonging to this family vary from mild-to-severe diseases i. e., febrile illness, encephalitis, haemorrhagic fever and acute respiratory illness. Several arthropods-borne viruses have been discovered and classified at serological level in India in the past. Some of these are highly pathogenic as the recent emergence and spread of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and presence of antibodies against Hantavirus in humans in India have provided evidences that it may become one of the emerging diseases in this country. For many of the discovered viruses, we still need to study their relevance to human and animal health. Chittoor virus, a variant of Batai virus; Ganjam virus, an Asian variant of <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> virus; tick-borne viruses such as Bhanja, Palma and mosquito-borne viruses such as Sathuperi, Thimiri, Umbre and Ingwavuma viruses have been identified as the members of this family. As Bunyaviruses are three segmented RNA viruses, they can reassort the segments into genetically distinct viruses in target cells. This ability is believed {{to play a major role}} in evolution, pathogenesis and epidemiology of the viruses.

40|$|AbstractThe genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae) {{contains}} seven serogroups {{consisting of}} 34 predominantly tick-borne viruses, including several associated with severe human and livestock diseases [e. g., Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> (NSD), respectively]. Before this report, no comparative genetic studies or molecular detection assays {{had been developed}} for this virus genus. To characterize at least one representative {{from each of the}} seven serogroups, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers targeting the L polymerase-encoding region of the RNA genome of these viruses were successfully designed based on conserved amino acid motifs present in the predicted catalytic core region. Sequence analysis showed the nairoviruses to be a highly diverse group, exhibiting up to 39. 4 % and 46. 0 % nucleotide and amino acid identity differences, respectively. Virus genetic relationships correlated well with serologic groupings and with tick host associations. Hosts of these viruses include both the hard (family Ixodidae) and soft (family Argasidae) ticks. Virus phylogenetic analysis reveals two major monophyletic groups: hard tick and soft tick-vectored viruses. In addition, viruses vectored by Ornithodoros, Carios, and Argas genera ticks also form three separate monophyletic lineages. The striking similarities between tick and nairovirus phylogenies are consistent with possible coevolution of the viruses and their tick hosts. Fossil and phylogenetic data placing the hard tick–soft tick divergence between 120 and 92 million years ago suggest an ancient origin for viruses of the genus Nairovirus...|$|R
40|$|The Nairoviruses are an {{important}} group of tick-borne viruses that includes pathogens of man (Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and livestock animals (Dugbe virus, <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> virus (NSDV)). NSDV is found in large parts of East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as Ganjam virus). We have investigated the ability of NSDV to antagonise the induction and actions of interferon. Both pathogenic and apathogenic isolates could actively inhibit the induction of type 1 interferon, and also blocked the signalling pathways of both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Using transient expression of viral proteins or sections of viral proteins, these activities all mapped to the ovarian tumour-like protease domain (OTU) found in the viral RNA polymerase. Virus infection, or expression of this OTU domain in transfected cells, led to a great reduction in the incorporation of ubiquitin or ISG 15 protein into host cell proteins. Point mutations in the OTU that inhibited the protease activity also prevented it from antagonising interferon induction and action. Interestingly, a mutation at a peripheral site, which had little apparent effect {{on the ability of}} the OTU to inhibit ubiquitination and ISG 15 ylation, removed the ability of the OTU to block the induction of type 1 and the action of type 2 interferons, but had a lesser effect on the ability to block type 1 interferon action, suggesting that targets other tha...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> virus (NSDV) of {{the genus}} Nairovirus causes a {{haemorrhagic}} gastroenteritis in sheep and goats with mortality up to 90 %; the virus is found in East and Central Africa, and in India, where the virus is called Ganjam virus. NSDV {{is closely related to}} the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, which also causes a haemorrhagic disease. As with other nairoviruses, replication of NSDV takes place in the cytoplasm and the new virus particles bud into the Golgi apparatus; however, the effect of viral replication on cellular compartments has not been studied extensively. We have found that the overall structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi were unaffected by infection with NSDV. However, we observed that NSDV infection led to the loss of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), an oxidoreductase present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and which assists during protein folding, from the ER. Further investigation showed that NSDV-infected cells have high levels of PDI at their surface, and PDI is also secreted into the culture medium of infected cells. Another chaperone from the PDI family, ERp 57, was found to be similarly affected. Analysis of infected cells and expression of individual viral glycoproteins indicated that the NSDV PreGn glycoprotein is involved in redistribution of these soluble ER oxidoreductases. It has been suggested that extracellular PDI can activate integrins and tissue factor, which are involved respectively in pro-inflammatory responses and disseminated intravascular coagulation, both of which manifest in many viral haemorrhagic fevers.

A closely related species, Rhipicephalus zambeziensis, which has similar feeding patterns and hosts, occurs in warmer, drier areas of Africa. Species Affected R. appendiculatus mainly infests cattle, buffalo and large antelope, but it can occur on other species including sheep and goats. Immature ticks may also be seen on small antelope, carnivores, hares and other species. Geographic Distribution R. appendiculatus prefers relatively cool, shaded, shrubby or woody savannas or woodlands with at least 24 inches of annual rainfall. This tick occurs in parts of eastern, central and southeastern Africa, and can be found from sea level to 7400 feet (2300 meters). Its distribution within this area is limited to suitable environments with appropriate hosts. Life Cycle R. appendiculatus is a three-host tick. These ticks can be found on the host for several days while they feed, then they drop to the ground to develop to the next stage. R. appendiculatus mainly infests cattle, buffalo and large antelope, but it can occur on other species including sheep and goats. Immature ticks may also be seen on small antelope, carnivores, hares and other species. Adult R. appendiculatus prefer to feed in the ears, but some are found on the head. Immature ticks feed in the ears, on the head, and on the legs. In the subtropical central and southern regions of Africa, R. appendiculatus completes one life cycle, and the occurrence of adults, nymphs or larvae is seasonal, with most adult ticks found from mid-summer to late summer. In tropical areas, more than one life cycle can be completed each year, and all stages occur at one time. Up to three generations per year may be seen in areas with sufficient rainfall...|$|R
40|$|Ticks are {{important}} vectors {{of a wide}} variety of pathogens including protozoa, bacteria and viruses. Many of the viruses transmitted by ticks are of medical or veterinary importance including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Crimean- Congo hemorrhagic fever virus causing disease in humans, and African swine fever virus and <b>Nairobi</b> sheep <b>disease</b> virus affecting livestock. Although several studies have elucidated tick antimicrobial mechanisms including cellular immune responses such as nodulation, encapsulation and phagocytosis and humoral immune responses such as the JAK/STAT pathway, complement-like proteins, antimicrobial peptides, lectin like pattern-recognition molecules and lysozymes, very little is known about the innate immune response of ticks towards viral infection. This study therefore aimed to identify molecules that might be involved in the response of ticks to viral infection. The hypothesis was that TBEV infection leads to changes in the expression of immunity-related transcripts and proteins in Ixodes spp. tick cells and that at least some of these might be antiviral. Ixodes scapularis-derived cell lines IDE 8 and ISE 6 were chosen since I. scapularis is currently the only tick species with a sequenced genome and an Ixodes ricinus-derived cell line, IRE/CTVM 19, was used because I. ricinus is the natural vector of TBEV. Basic parameters required to study the responses of tick cells to infection were determined, including levels of virus infection, kinetics of virus replication and production, formation of replication complexes and uptake of dsRNA or siRNA. The cell lines IDE 8, ISE 6 and IRE/CTVM 19 were infected with either of two tick-borne flaviviruses, TBEV and Langat virus (LGTV), or with the mosquito-borne alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Infection was characterised using techniques including plaque assay, luciferase assay, immunostaining and conventional, confocal and electron microscopy. Two time points for transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of TBEVinfected IDE 8 and IRE/CTVM 19 cells were selected: day 2 post-infection (p. i.) when virus production was increasing and day 6 p. i. when virus production was decreasing. RNA and protein were isolated from TBEV-infected and mock-infected tick cells at days 2 and 6 p. i. and RNA-Seq and mass spectrometric technologies were used to identify changes in, respectively, transcript and protein abundance. Differential expression of transcripts was determined using the data analysis package DESeq resulting in a total of 43 statistically significantly differentially expressed transcripts in IDE 8 cells and 83 in IRE/CTVM 19 cells, while differential protein representation using Χ 2 test statistics with Bonferroni correction in IDEG 6 software resulted in 76 differentially represented proteins in IDE 8 cells and 129 in IRE/CTVM 19 cells. These included transcripts and proteins which could affect stages of the virus infection, including virus entry, replication, maturation and protein trafficking, and also innate immune responses such as phagocytosis, RNA interference (RNAi), the complement system, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, cell stress and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. After verification of sequencing data by qRT-PCR, the ability of several of the identified transcripts or proteins to affect virus infection was determined by knockdown experiments in IDE 8 and IRE/CTVM 19 cells using wild type LGTV, LGTV replicons or TBEV replicons. Knockdown of genes encoding proteins including the ER chaperone gp 96 and the heat-shock protein HSP 90 resulted in increased virus production in both cell lines, hinting at an antiviral role. In contrast, knockdown of calreticulin, another ER chaperone, resulted in a decrease in virus production in IRE/CTVM 19 cells but not in IDE 8 cells, implying a requirement for virus production. This functional genomics approach has identified possible novel genes/proteins involved in the interaction between flaviviruses and tick cells and also revealed that there might be antiviral innate immune pathways present in ticks additional to the exogenous RNAi pathway...|$|R
