50|$|A <b>cage</b> <b>nut</b> or <b>caged</b> <b>nut</b> (also {{called a}} captive or clip nut) {{consists}} of a (usually square) nut in a spring steel cage which wraps around the <b>nut.</b> The <b>cage</b> has two wings that when compressed allow the cage to be inserted into the square holes, for example, in the mounting rails of equipment racks. When the wings are released, they hold the nut in position behind the hole. <b>Cage</b> <b>nuts</b> conforming to this description were patented in 1952 and 1953.|$|R
50|$|Using <b>cage</b> <b>nuts</b> {{provides}} several benefits over threaded holes. It {{permits a}} range of choice of nut and bolts size (e.g. metric vs imperial) in the field, long after the equipment has been manufactured. Second, if a screw is over-tightened, the nut can be replaced, unlike a pre-threaded hole, where a hole with stripped threads becomes unusable. Third, <b>cage</b> <b>nuts</b> are easy to use on materials too thin or soft to be threaded.|$|R
50|$|Although some modern rack-mount {{equipment}} has bolt-free mounting {{compatible with}} square-hole racks, many rack-mount components are generally mounted with <b>cage</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The square-hole <b>cage</b> <b>nut</b> {{can be used}} {{wherever}} {{a square}} hole can be punched. An older alternative type of captive-nut uses a spring clip that holds the nut and slides {{on the edge of}} a thin sheet. While this type of <b>cage</b> <b>nut</b> can only position the nut a fixed distance from the edge of a thin plate, it works equally well with square and round holes. A patent for such a nut was granted in 1946.|$|R
50|$|Holes so {{arranged}} {{can either}} be tapped (usually 10-32 UNF thread, or, less often, 6mm metric) or have square holes for <b>cage</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} shape today is hexagonal, for similar reasons as the bolt head: six sides {{give a good}} {{granularity}} of angles for a tool to approach from (good in tight spots), but more (and smaller) corners would be vulnerable to being rounded off. It takes only one sixth of a rotation to obtain the next side of the hexagon and grip is optimal. However, polygons with more than six sides do not give the requisite grip and polygons with fewer than six sides take more time {{to be given a}} complete rotation. Other specialized shapes exist for certain needs, such as wingnuts for finger adjustment and captive <b>nuts</b> (e.g. <b>cage</b> <b>nuts)</b> for inaccessible areas.|$|R
50|$|The nut {{is usually}} {{slightly}} {{loose in the}} cage to allow for minor adjustments in alignment. This reduces {{the likelihood that the}} threads will be stripped during equipment installation and removal. The dimensions of the spring steel clip determines thickness of the panel to which the nut may be clipped. In the case of square-hole <b>cage</b> <b>nuts,</b> the clip dimensions determine the range of hole sizes to which the clip will securely hold the nut. In the case of slide-on <b>cage</b> <b>nuts,</b> the clip dimensions determine the distance from the panel edge to the hole.|$|R
50|$|The tapped-hole rack {{was first}} {{replaced}} by clearance-hole (Round Hole, Round Unthreaded Holes, and Versa Rail) racks. The holes are {{large enough to}} permit a bolt to be freely inserted through without binding, and bolts are fastened in place using <b>cage</b> <b>nuts.</b> In {{the event of a}} nut being stripped out or a bolt breaking, the nut can be easily removed and replaced with a new one. Production of clearance-hole racks is less expensive because tapping the holes is eliminated and replaced with fewer, less expensive, <b>cage</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A clip-on nut, {{also known}} as a sheet metal nut or a speed nut (but this is ambiguous, see speed nut), is a type of nut {{designed}} to be clipped to sheet metal. It is a type of captive nut commonly made as a <b>cage</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R
50|$|Captive nuts come in {{two basic}} styles. One type, the <b>cage</b> <b>nut</b> or clip-on nut is a {{conventional}} nut held captive by a sheet metal carrier that clips onto the part to be connected. These are generally used to attach screws to sheet metal parts too thin to be threaded, andthey can generally be attached, removed and reused with simple hand tools.|$|R
50|$|A {{common use}} for <b>cage</b> <b>nuts</b> is to mount {{equipment}} in square-holed 19-inch racks (the most common type), with 0.375 in square-hole size. There are four common sizes: UNF 10-32 and, {{to a lesser}} extent, UNC 12-24 are generally used in the United States; elsewhere, M5 (5 mm outside diameter and 0.8 mm pitch) for light and medium equipment and M6 for heavier equipment, such as servers.|$|R
50|$|Rack {{units are}} universally the same, but {{the type of}} thread can vary {{depending}} on the rack. Mounting rails can be No. 10-32 tapped (Unified Thread Standard), No. 12-24 tapped, metric M6 threaded or universal square holes. Universal square holes are becoming the most common as these allow the insertion of replaceable <b>cage</b> <b>nuts</b> for the type of thread needed. This prevents stripping of the threading on the rails and allows for more flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The next {{innovation}} in rack design {{has been the}} square-hole rack. Square-hole racks allow boltless mounting, such that the rack-mount equipment only needs to insert through and hook down into {{the lip of the}} square hole. Installation and removal of hardware in a square hole rack is very easy and boltless, where the weight of the equipment and small retention clips are all that is necessary to hold the equipment in place. Older equipment meant for round-hole or tapped-hole racks can still be used, with the use of <b>cage</b> <b>nuts</b> made for square-hole racks.|$|R
40|$|Extract] The green {{vegetable}} bug, Nezara viridula (L.), is a cosmopolitan pest, possibly originating from the Ethiopian or Mediterranean region (Hokkanen, 1986). This pentatomid {{first appeared in}} NSW in 1916 and then spread to other states of Australia (Wilson 1960). Nymphs and adults feed on stems, petioles and fruit. In Australia {{a wide range of}} vegetables, fruit, agricultural crops (particularly legumes) and developing seeds, including macadamia (Ironside, 979), are damaged by this insect. In the USA, N. viridula is a major pest of pecans (Carya illinoensis [Wangenh. ]C. Koch), causing "black pit", hich results in premature nut drop and black spotting in mature nuts (Turner, 1923). Polles et al., (1973) has shown that fourth instar nymphs and adults can cause <b>nut</b> abscission in <b>cage</b> experiments. However, only adults are known to occur in the tree crowns of pecans (Dutcher & Todd, 1983) ...|$|R
