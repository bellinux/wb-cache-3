Augustine viewed the power of resurrection <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> that of rising from the dead, but the twofold power Christ exercises over Christians: first {{in terms of their}} future resurrection, secondly in terms of their redemption. Many other Christian thinkers from Ambrosiaster to John Chrysostom followed that trend and equated the knowledge of Christ with faithful Christian living.|$|E

The new rank implied that the ships of the navy would be employed as members of a fleet, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> collections of vessels with a common purpose.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} the modern prison system was born in London, {{influenced}} by the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham. Bentham's panopticon introduced the principle of observation and control that underpins {{the design of the}} modern prison. The notion of prisoners being incarcerated as part of their punishment and <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> a holding state until trial or hanging, was at the time revolutionary. His views influenced the establishment of the first prisons used as criminal rehabilitation centers. At a time when the implementation of capital punishment for a variety of relatively trivial offences was on the decline, the notion of incarceration as a form of punishment and correction held great appeal to reform-minded thinkers and politicians.|$|E
25|$|Peter Townsend {{transformed}} {{the conception of}} poverty, viewing it <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> lack of income but as {{the configuration of the}} economic conditions that prevent people from being full members of the society (Townsend, 1979; Ferragina et al. 2016). Poverty reduces the ability of people to participate in society, effectively denying them full citizenship (as suggested by T.H. Marshall). Given that there are no universal principles by which to determine the minimum threshold of participation equating to full membership of society, Townsend argued that the appropriate measure would necessarily be relative to any particular cultural context. He suggested that in each society there should be an empirically determinable 'breakpoint' within the income distribution below which participation of individuals collapses, providing a scientific basis for fixing a poverty line and determining the extent of poverty (Ferragina et al. 2016).|$|E

25|$|Education is a {{critical}} input in human resource development and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the productivity and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force {{that is capable of}} leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It {{can be one of the}} most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> a matter of social justice but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability. Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of child labor and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.|$|E

500|$|Across {{the various}} theologies and philosophies, the common theme {{presents}} Krishna as the essence and symbol of divine love, with {{human life and}} love {{as a reflection of}} the divine. The longing and love-filled legends of Krishna and the gopis, his playful pranks as a baby, as well as his later dialogues with other characters, are philosophically treated as metaphors for the human longing for the divine and for meaning, and the play between the universals and the human soul. Krishna's lila is a theology of love-play. According to John Koller, [...] "love is presented <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> a means to salvation, it is the highest life".

He strives to replace his grandfather as Hokage so the villagers of Konohagakure will recognize him by name, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> the Hokage's grandson. He looks to Naruto as a mentor in this quest, emulating his work ethic, determination, and signature jutsu such as the Rasengan and the Sexy Jutsu among {{a variety of other}} techniques. Konohamaru insists, however, that he will only become Hokage after Naruto has been Hokage first. By the events of the series epilogue, Konohamaru has ascended to the rank of jonin and is currently captain of Team Konohamaru. Konohamaru's design caused great difficulties for Masashi Kishimoto; he intended for Konohamaru to look like a [...] "punk" [...] smaller than Naruto, yet all of his attempts resulted in a mere recreation of Naruto. He eventually gave Konohamaru small, angry-looking eyes, and was instantly happy with the design. While voiced in the Japanese anime by Ikue Ōtani, and by Akiko Koike as a stand-in, Konohamaru's adult self is voiced by Hidenori Takahashi. In the English version, Colleen O'Shaughnessey voices Konohamaru's pre-adult self, and Max Mittelman voices Konohamaru's adult self.|$|E

Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400paying visitors per day. His home was described as having {{the air of a}} fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> a spectacle.

500|$|During Stalinism, the {{preferred}} Soviet policy {{was to keep}} sensitive posts {{in the hands of}} non-Poles. As a result, [...] "all or nearly all of the directors (of the widely despised Ministry of Public Security of Poland) were Jewish" [...] as noted by Polish journalist Teresa Torańska among others. [...] A recent study by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance showed that out of 450 people in director positions in the Ministry between 1944 and 1954, 167 (37.1%) were of Jewish ethnicity, while Jews made up only 1% of the post-war Polish population. While Jews were overrepresented in various Polish communist organizations, including the security apparatus, relative to their percentage of the general population, the vast majority of Jews did not participate in the Stalinist apparatus, and indeed most were not supportive of communism. Krzysztof Szwagrzyk has quoted Jan T. Gross, who argued that many Jews who worked for the communist party cut their ties with their culture – Jewish, Polish or Russian – and tried to represent the interests of international communism only, or at least that of the local communist government. It is difficult to assess when the Polish Jews who had volunteered to serve or remain in the postwar communist security forces began to realize, however, what Soviet Jews had realized earlier, that under Stalin, as Arkady Vaksberg put it: [...] "if someone named Rabinovich was in charge of a mass execution, he was perceived <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> a Cheka boss but as a Jew..." ...|$|E

500|$|Although she is wise {{beyond her}} years, Lisa has typical {{childhood}} issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. For example, in [...] "Lost Our Lisa" [...] (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into {{allowing her to}} ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost {{and in need of}} aid from her father. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that incidents like this illustrate that [...] "Even when Lisa's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a child's body." [...] In , Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as Corey, and watches The Itchy and Scratchy Show along with Bart. He writes, [...] "One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for Itchy and Scratchy and Corey seem to be highlighted, taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she's 'no better '." [...] When she became depressed over being unable to pursue her dream as a musician due to inheriting her father's fingers and having to spend her time with Marge in being a homemaker, Lisa gives up on school and becomes a juvenile delinquent in Separate Vocations. She is stopped by Bart who encourages her to keep proving the wrong and pursue her dreams as a musician.|$|E
