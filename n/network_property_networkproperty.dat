Thus, intelligence has been associated with cognitive reserve or resilience in normal aging. Neurophysiologically, intelligence is considered as a complex capacity that is dependent on a global cognitive network rather than isolated brain areas. An association of structural as well as functional brain network characteristics with intelligence has already been reported in young adults. We investigated the relationship between global structural brain <b>network</b> <b>properties,</b> general intelligence and age in a group of 43 cognitively healthy elderly, age 60 – 85 years. Individuals were assessed cross-sectionally using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and diffusion-tensor imaging. Structural brain networks were reconstructed individually using deterministic tractography, global <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> (global efficiency, mean shortest path length, and clustering coefficient) were determined by graph theory and correlated to intelligence scores within both age groups. <b>Network</b> <b>properties</b> were significantly correlated to age, whereas no significant correlation to WAIS-R was observed. However, in a subgroup of 15 individuals aged 75 and above, the <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> were significantly correlated to WAIS-R. Our findings suggest that general intelligence and global properties of structural brain networks may not be generally associated in cognitively healthy elderly. However, we provide first evidence of an association between global structural brain <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> and general intelligence in advanced elderly.

40|$|Abstract Background Chloroplasts {{descended from}} {{cyanobacteria}} {{and have a}} drastically reduced genome following an endosymbiotic event. Many genes of the ancestral cyanobacterial genome have been transferred to the plant nuclear genome by horizontal gene transfer. However, a selective set of metabolism pathways is maintained in chloroplasts using both chloroplast genome encoded and nuclear genome encoded enzymes. As an organelle specialized for carrying out photosynthesis, does the chloroplast metabolic <b>network</b> have <b>properties</b> adapted for higher efficiency of photosynthesis? We compared metabolic <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> of chloroplasts and prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms, mostly cyanobacteria, based on metabolic maps derived from genome data to identify features of chloroplast <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> that are different from cyanobacteria and to analyze possible functional significance of those features. Results The properties of the entire metabolic network and the sub-network that consists of reactions directly connected to the Calvin Cycle have been analyzed using hypergraph representation. Results showed that the whole metabolic networks in chloroplast and cyanobacteria both possess small-world <b>network</b> <b>properties.</b> Although the number of compounds and reactions in chloroplasts is less than that in cyanobacteria, the chloroplast's metabolic network has longer average path length, a larger diameter, and is Calvin Cycle -centered, indicating an overall less-dense network structure with specific and local high density areas in chloroplasts. Moreover, chloroplast metabolic network exhibits a better modular organization than cyanobacterial ones. Enzymes involved in the same metabolic processes tend to cluster into the same module in chloroplasts. Conclusion In summary, the differences in metabolic <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> may reflect the evolutionary changes during endosymbiosis {{that led to the}} improvement of the photosynthesis efficiency in higher plants. Our findings are consistent with the notion that since the light energy absorption, transfer and conversion is highly efficient even in photosynthetic bacteria, the further improvements in photosynthetic efficiency in higher plants may rely on changes in metabolic <b>network</b> <b>properties.</b> </p...|$|R

The study used social network analysis (SNA) as the primary methodological and analytic approach to reveal the structural dimensions of the advice giving/receiving networks within the schools to delve more deeply into network relationships, collaboration, and knowledge impact.

We show that many theoretical network models used to generate networks with a particular property often lead to significant changes in <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> other than that of interest. For high levels of clustering, different procedures lead to networks that differ in degree heterogeneity and assortativity, and in broader scale measures such as R 0 and the distribution of shortest path lengths.

3000|$|Whether {{the degree}} of node {{distribution}} in brain networks follows an exponentially truncated power law or a scale-free degree distribution (power law) is still disputed [24]. However, the dispute has not obstructed the verification of the atlas-based impact on brain networks. Studies of brain networks based on different atlases on different scales and on the same scales both showed that atlases affected the quantification of <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> (small-world and scale-free properties). This impact on quantification was a comprehensive result, combining the impacts of atlases and evaluation algorithm of <b>network</b> <b>properties.</b> In the estimation of small-world properties, the construction of random networks was very critical. Random networks should {{have the capacity to}} reduce the impacts of methods to construct a connectivity matrix on small-world <b>properties</b> and provide <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> close to true random networks. As Zalesky et al. described in their studies, appropriate null networks should be used to benchmark network measures in correlation networks [86]. Otherwise, the extent of small-world properties might be overestimated with full correlation and underestimated with partial correlation [86]. Besides [...] quantification of <b>network</b> <b>properties,</b> quantification of the brain network was also affected. Most analyses of structural and functional networks were based on undirected and unweighted graphs, which might be related to the accuracy of quantification of the brain network. Poor quantification could cause an accumulation of the impacts and lead to results far from those expected.|$|R
40|$|People learn {{language}} from their social environment. As individuals {{differ in their}} social networks, they might be exposed to input with different lexical distributions, and these might influence their linguistic representations and lexical choices. In this article we test the relation between linguistic performance and 3 social <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> that should influence input variability, namely, network size, network heterogeneity, and network density. In particular, we examine how these social <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> influence lexical prediction, lexical access, and lexical use. To do so, in Study 1, participants predicted how people of different ages would name pictures, and in Study 2 participants named the pictures themselves. In both studies, we examined how participants’ social <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> related to their performance. In Study 3, we ran simulations on norms we collected to see how age variability in one’s network influences the distribution of different names in the input. In all studies, network age heterogeneity influenced performance leading to better prediction, faster response times for difficult-to-name items, and less entropy in input distribution. These results suggest that individual differences in social <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> can influence linguistic behavior. Specifically, they show that having a more heterogeneous network is associated with better performance.

Functional connectivity between neural units can be defined according to the correlation of their activity, and the functional networks of mature cultured neurones have revealed a complex network organisation. Sharing many properties with other complex networks, such as the Internet, social networks and in vivo brain networks, cultures allow the investigation of how such a network emerges in a biological system. Moreover, they allow one to investigate the influence of experimental manipulation on shaping the <b>network</b> <b>properties.</b> However, very little work compares cultures' complex <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> from different experimental conditions and many questions remain unanswered. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how the functional connectivity of cultured neurones changes under different experimental conditions. A novel toolset and protocol was developed for analysing cultures' functional connectivity within a complex network framework. Spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced changes in connectivity were quantified by comparing topological, spatial and performance properties. Robust results followed from consideration of network topology, size and density influences on the complex <b>network</b> <b>properties.</b> Results confirmed that mature culture's networks are complex, and demonstrated that these emerge from an initially random network organisation to one that supports efficient network-wide flow of information. The influence of electrical stimulation on shaping the <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> is investigated with chronic stimulation during culture development. In conclusion, one can compare complex functional <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> from multiple experimental conditions by applying a reliable link definition, and accounting for differences in network size, density and topology. The present work reveals that the functional networks of cultured neurones spontaneously evolve to a topology optimised for information processing.

40|$|International audienceWe are {{considering}} distributed network computing, in which computing entities are {{connected by a}} network modeled as a connected graph. These entities are located at the nodes of the graph, and they exchange information by message-passing along its edges. In this context, we are adopting the classical framework for local distributed decision, in which nodes must collectively decide whether their network configuration satisfies some given boolean predicate, by having each node interacting with the nodes in its vicinity only. A network configuration is accepted {{if and only if}} every node individually accepts. It is folklore that not every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> (e. g., whether the network is planar) can be decided locally whenever the computing entities are Turing machines (TM). On the other hand, it is known that every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> can be decided locally if nodes are running non-deterministic Turing machines (NTM). However, this holds only if the nodes have the ability to guess the identities of the nodes currently in the network. That is, for different sets of identities assigned to the nodes, the correct guesses of the nodes might be different. If one asks the nodes to use the same guess in the same network configuration even with different identity assignments, i. e., to perform identity-oblivious guesses, then it is known that not every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> can be decided locally. In this paper, we show that every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> can be decided locally if nodes are running alternating Turing machines (ATM), and this holds even if nodes are bounded to perform identity-oblivious guesses. More specifically, we show that, for every <b>network</b> <b>property,</b> there is a local algorithm for ATMs, with at most 2 alternations, that decides that property. To this aim, we define a hierarchy of classes of decision tasks where the lowest level contains tasks solvable with TMs, the first level those solvable with NTMs, and level k contains those tasks solvable with ATMs with k alternations. We characterize the entire hierarchy, and show that it collapses in the second level. In addition, we show separation results between the classes of <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> that are locally decidable with TMs, NTMs, and ATMs. Finally, we establish the existence of completeness results for each of these classes, using novel notions of local reduction...|$|R
