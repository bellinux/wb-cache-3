40|$|Because {{the assets}} held by {{publicly}} traded real estate companies are infrequently traded, their values must be estimated {{to determine the}} relationship between share prices and <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> for investment purposes. Alternative modeling approaches may be followed to accomplish these valuations, including income-based and transaction-based models.

ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999.

40|$|Abstract — The {{present study}} {{indicates}} what is causality relation between dimension of privately managed pension funds in Romania, measured through <b>net</b> <b>assets</b> <b>value</b> and their performances. In this way, on field literature review {{there are many}} studies which have analyzed the fluctuation of pension funds performances considering the <b>assets</b> <b>value,</b> their investment allocation, {{in order to improve}} the efficiency. The research methodology consists in testing the correlation between the two variables: <b>net</b> <b>assets</b> <b>value</b> and average level-headed return, by means of the multiple linear regression method, on the market level, as well as individually, for each pension fund. Therefore, we have tested two sets of correlations: one considering the <b>value</b> of total <b>net</b> <b>assets,</b> as the dependent variable, and the average rate assessed by the profitability of all privately managed pension funds, as the independent variable, and the other given by the dimension of each pension fund, measured throug...|$|R

25|$|Hedge fund {{administrators are}} {{responsible}} for operations, accounting, and valuation services. This back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades. Administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions, and perform various shareholder services. Hedge funds in the United States {{are not required to}} appoint an administrator, and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager. A number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement, particularly in the calculation of a fund's <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> (NAV). Some funds voluntarily employ external auditors, thereby offering a greater degree of transparency.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} by the European Commission (EC) in 2008 to accord secondary slot trading by European airlines – the practice of buying and selling take-off and landing slots at congested airports – legal recognition resulted in BMI valuing its Heathrow slot holding at £770million. Its first-time inclusion in BMI's 2007 annual report also resulted in a huge boost to the airline's <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>value,</b> which stood at only £12million the year before. It can therefore {{be argued that the}} EC's decision to legalise this practice made BMI an attractive takeover target for other Heathrow-based airlines and helped it avert bankruptcy.|$|E
40|$|Closed-end {{funds have}} been an anomaly in finance because the market prices of their shares differ from their {{aggregate}} <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> per share. They often purchase shares of restricted securities at prices which are discounted from the prices of unrestricted securities. However, restricted securities are valued {{as if they were}} unrestricted securities in the determination of fund <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>values.</b> In addition, closed-end funds hold securities which are illiquid and difficult to price. Closed-end funds' discounts and premia {{can be explained by the}} mispricing of restricted and illiquid securities. Finally, results of time series regressions over a 21 year period show that closed-end fund discounts and premia cannot be explained by the general level of stock prices.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new GMM-style {{methodology}} with good small-sample properties to assess the abnormal performance and risk exposure of a non-traded asset from a cross-section of cash flow data. We apply this method {{to a sample of}} 958 mature private equity funds spanning 24 years. Our methodology uses actual cash flow data and not intermediary self-reported <b>Net</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>Values.</b> In addition, it does not require a distributional assumption for returns. For venture capital funds, we find a high market beta and significant under-performance. For buyout funds, we find a low beta and no abnormal performance, but the sample is small. Larger funds have higher returns due to higher risk exposures and not higher alphas. We also find that <b>Net</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>Values</b> significantly overstate fund market values for the subset of mature and inactive funds. ...|$|R
25|$|Management {{fees are}} {{calculated}} {{as a percentage}} of the fund's <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> and typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being standard. They are usually expressed as an annual percentage, but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly. Management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager, whereas the performance fee provides the manager's profits. However, due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a manager's profits, and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds, such as CalPERS, for being too high.|$|E

Authorized participants may wish to invest in the ETF shares for the long-term, but they usually act as market makers on the open market, using their ability to exchange creation units with their underlying securities to provide liquidity of the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> of the underlying assets.

The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2008, during a period of market turbulence, that some lightly traded ETFs frequently had deviations of 5% or more, exceeding 10% in a handful of cases, although even for these niche ETFs, the average deviation was only a little more than 1%.

25|$|ETFs {{are similar}} in many ways to {{traditional}} mutual funds, except that shares in an ETF can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks on a stock exchange through a broker-dealer. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> (NAV). Instead, financial institutions purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks (such as 50,000 shares), called creation units. Purchases and redemptions of the creation units generally are in kind, with the institutional investor contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF, although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for {{some or all of}} the securities in the basket of assets.|$|E

The paper starts with a literature based approach for asserting the added value brought by business intelligence software in a company which will be used as a support for proposing a new method of determining the adjusted <b>net</b> <b>assets</b> <b>value.</b> These new market value oriented approaches are benchmarked for a diverse sample consisting of both BVB and NYSE listed companies.

The research presents an extensive literature review and adopts a positivist paradigm in evaluating the theoretically constructed method.
