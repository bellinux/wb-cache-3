5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A <b>naturalized</b> <b>citizen</b> had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants in the eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a <b>naturalized</b> <b>citizen.</b> He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{became a}} <b>naturalized</b> <b>citizen</b> of the United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief {{organization}} in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the exchange program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E
