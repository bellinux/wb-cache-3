5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, <b>nearly</b> 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and <b>nearly</b> 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for <b>nearly</b> 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crustaceans}} {{are consumed}} by humans, and <b>nearly</b> 10,700,000tons were produced in 2007; {{the vast majority}} of this output is of decapod crustaceans: crabs, lobsters, shrimp, crawfish, and prawns. Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns, and <b>nearly</b> 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing <b>nearly</b> half the world's total. Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely consumed, with only 118,000tons of krill being caught, despite krill having one of the greatest biomasses on the planet.|$|E

5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was <b>nearly</b> 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at <b>nearly</b> 10%, and inflation was <b>nearly</b> 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Although m1 is <b>nearly</b> rectangular, {{the width}} {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid <b>nearly</b> to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the front is virtually equal to the width at the back, so that the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still <b>nearly</b> rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at the back.|$|E

The VA paid for <b>nearly</b> 200,000 veterans to see private doctors, and average wait time to see a primary care doctor decreased from 51 to 43 days.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is <b>nearly</b> 10trillion kilometres or <b>nearly</b> 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Dartmouth {{president}} Ernest Martin Hopkins successfully lobbied the Board of Trustees {{to construct}} an independent facility for the school. $200,000 were spent to build Horace Cummings Memorial Hall, which with several major additions (built in 1945-46 and 1989) served as Thayer's only facility for <b>nearly</b> 70years. In 2004, construction began on the MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), which was completed in 2006.

5|$|In the United States {{the film}} {{remained}} unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version {{under the title}} Unsane. It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing <b>nearly</b> all of the film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of Tenebrae received <b>nearly</b> unanimously negative reviews.|$|E
