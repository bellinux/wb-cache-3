5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> (the wind is blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|Tundra {{occurs in}} the far <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> north of the taiga belt, {{including}} vast areas of northern Russia and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> is tilted towards the sun, so at any given <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
50|$|The Free State's {{advantage}} in floriculture is the opposing seasons {{of the southern}} and <b>northern</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> The province exports about 1.2 million tons of cut flowers a year.|$|R
5000|$|The FINA Swimming World Cup is an {{international}} series of short course (25 m) swimming meets organized by FINA, the International Federation for swimming. The series was started in the 1988/1989, and is open to swimmers from FINA member countries. For the 2015 edition, the series were held in long course pools instead of short course. The series has traditionally been held in the <b>northern</b> <b>hemisphere's</b> winter-time (October-February range), placing it within the normal short course competition times for many countries (with long course competition predominating in the <b>northern</b> <b>hemisphere's</b> summer months).|$|R

5|$|Hydrogeologist Philip LaMoreaux {{asserted}} in 1995 {{that the}} eruption caused significant climatic {{changes in the}} eastern Mediterranean region, Aegean Sea {{and much of the}} <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> but that was forcefully rebutted by volcanologist David Pyle a year later.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> {{the average}} size of adult {{males and females}} is about , respectively, {{averaging}} 38.5 and 50.5 tonnes (42.5 and 55.5 tons), while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is , weighing 52.5 and 63 tonnes (58 and 69.5 tons).|$|E

5|$|Major snow-prone areas {{include the}} polar regions, {{the upper half}} of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> and mountainous regions {{worldwide}} with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures.

5|$|Of {{the major}} groups of teleosts, the Elopomorpha, Clupeomorpha and Percomorpha (perches, tunas and many others) {{all have a}} {{worldwide}} distribution and are mainly marine; the Ostariophysi and Osteoglossomorpha are worldwide but mainly freshwater, the latter mainly in the tropics; the Atherinomorpha (guppies, etc.) have a worldwide distribution, both fresh and salt, but are surface-dwellers. In contrast, the Esociformes (pikes) are limited to freshwater in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> while the Salmoniformes (salmon, trout) are found in both Northern and Southern temperate zones in freshwater, some species migrating {{to and from the}} sea. The Paracanthopterygii (cods, etc.) are <b>Northern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> fish, with both salt and freshwater species.|$|E

5|$|Other jet streams also exist.
