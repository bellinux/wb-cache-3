40|$|International audienceAbstractThe primary food {{of adult}} honey bees (Apis mellifera) is honey {{prepared}} by bees from nectar, provided by plants {{in order to}} stimulate the bee’s pollination service. Nectar consists of carbohydrates, amino acids and water, {{as well as other}} minor compounds whose proportion varies among plant species and whose biological implications in the honey bee physiology require intense research. Several environmental stressors are causing the decline of bee colonies, and thereby, we tried to connect the nutritional quality of bee’s diet with the strength of the bee’s immune system. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is present in <b>nectar,</b> <b>honey</b> and adult honey bees. It has been demonstrated that ABA stimulates innate immune defences in animal cells. However, the influence of ABA on A. mellifera’s health and fitness is unknown.

The results indicate that the naturally occurring compound ABA has a positive influence in honey bee immunity. ABA emerges as a potent booster of immune defence in A. mellifera and may be useful in addressing the colony losses threatening apiculture and pollination service worldwide...|$|E
