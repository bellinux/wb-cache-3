5|$|Hurricane Dolores was {{regarded}} as the worst hurricane to strike Acapulco since 1938. Developing on June13, 1974, the system rapidly organized into a tropical storm the next day off the southern coast of Mexico. Over the following day, Dolores developed an eye-like feature and attained hurricane status. With peak winds of 80mph (130km/h), the storm made landfall near Acapulco. Once onshore, Dolores rapidly dissipated and was last <b>noted</b> <b>on</b> June17.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the five tropical systems, another storm was operationally believed to have existed in late August and early September. The ship Atlantic encountered a very heavy gale while located west of Sable Island, Nova Scotia on August31. The storm moved rapidly east-northeastward offshore Atlantic Canada. It was last <b>noted</b> <b>on</b> September2 and was thought to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. However, HURDAT no longer includes this system in its database.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne {{was one of}} {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s. The cyclone was first <b>noted</b> <b>on</b> January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward. Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8. The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years. On January11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory. The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi. Anne weakened into a depression and was last <b>noted</b> <b>on</b> January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia.|$|E
