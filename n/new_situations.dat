5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to <b>new</b> <b>situations</b> as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to <b>new</b> <b>situations.</b> As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for <b>new</b> <b>situations)</b> then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to <b>new</b> <b>situations.</b> Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E
5|$|When Alan J. W. Bell {{took over}} as producer, the plots of Last of the Summer Wine {{moved away from the}} {{original}} dialogue-packed scenes in the pub and the library; guest actors were brought in to interact with the trio in <b>new</b> <b>situations.</b> Although many of these guest appearances lasted for only one episode, some led to a permanent role on the show, as in the cases of Gordon Wharmby, Thora Hird, Jean Alexander, Stephen Lewis, Dora Bryan, Keith Clifford, Brian Murphy, Josephine Tewson, June Whitfield, Barbara Young, and Trevor Bannister. Other noted guests on the programme included John Cleese, Ron Moody, Sir Norman Wisdom, Eric Sykes, Liz Fraser, Stanley Lebor, and Philip Jackson.|$|E

Children adapt {{naturally}} to the <b>new</b> <b>situation,</b> and immediately useful customs and skills are more interesting to them than reading and writing.

25|$|With the {{development}} of slave and free states after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, <b>new</b> <b>situations</b> arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into free states.

25|$|Shyness (also called diffidence) is {{the feeling}} of apprehension, lack of comfort, or awkwardness {{especially}} {{when a person is}} around other people. This commonly occurs in <b>new</b> <b>situations</b> or with unfamiliar people. Shyness can be a characteristic of people who have low self-esteem. Stronger forms of shyness are usually referred to as social anxiety or social phobia.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Exile, {{when the}} Persians agreed that the Jews could return and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, {{chapters}} 1–4 and 29–30 were added and Deuteronomy was made the introductory book to this history, so that a story about a people about to enter the Promised Land became a story about a people about to return to the land. The legal sections of chapters 19–25 were expanded to meet <b>new</b> <b>situations</b> that had arisen, and chapters 31–34 were added as a new conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Overall a {{majority}} of military brats report having developed a kind of extra-adaptability and assimilate into <b>new</b> <b>situations</b> quickly and well, as they have done with each {{move to a new}} military base, town or country. Yet paradoxically, long-term feelings of being an outsider in relation to civilian (non-military) culture are common to {{a majority}} of military brats. For example, one major study shows that 32% of military brats feel as if they are only spectators on U.S. life, and another 48% do not feel as if they are central to any group.|$|E

25|$|While {{studies have}} {{reported}} inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that <b>new</b> <b>situations</b> require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations. Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information. Attention and recall {{have been shown to}} be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction. Wolfe (1983) cautions that educators and therapists should be made aware of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning.|$|E

According to The Hollywood Reporter, [...] "the producers are looking to make something more akin to an homage and not mimic the original. The plan is to contemporize the story with <b>new</b> <b>situations</b> and characters but still maintain a story that examines issues and poses existential questions."

[...] The Gripen is also equipped to use a number of different communications standards and systems, including SATURN secure radio, Link-16, ROVER, and satellite uplinks. Equipment for performing long range missions, such as an aerial refueling probe and onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS), was integrated upon the Gripen C/D.|$|E
500|$|Research has {{suggested}} that cognitive flexibility is related to other cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. Fluid intelligence, described {{as the ability to}} solve problems in <b>new</b> <b>situations,</b> enables fluid reasoning ability. [...] When one is able to reason fluidly, they are in turn more likely to be cognitively flexible. Furthermore, those who are able to be cognitively flexible have been shown {{to have the ability to}} switch between and/or simultaneously think about sounds and meanings, which increases their reading fluency and comprehension. Cognitive flexibility has also been shown to be related to one’s ability to cope in particular situations. For example, when individuals are better able to shift their thinking from situation to situation they will focus less on stressors within these situations.|$|E

500|$|When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{an affectionate}} and playful pet. However, it is {{reserved}} with people {{it does not}} know and naturally cautious in <b>new</b> <b>situations.</b> Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, {{and it can be}} socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal. [...] By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding. The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly. The Australian Cattle Dog's protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.|$|E
