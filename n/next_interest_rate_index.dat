50|$|A {{forward rate}} agreement's (FRA's) {{effective}} description is a cash for difference derivative contract, between two parties, benchmarked against an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index.</b> That index is commonly an {{interbank offered rate}} (-IBOR) of specific tenor in different currencies, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK. An FRA between two counterparties requires a fixed rate, notional amount, chosen <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> tenor and date to be completely specified.|$|R
50|$|An <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swap's (IRS's) {{effective}} {{description is}} a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies {{the nature of}} an exchange of payments benchmarked against an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index.</b> The most common IRS is a fixed for floating swap, whereby one party will make payments to the other based on an initially agreed fixed <b>rate</b> of <b>interest,</b> to receive back payments based on a floating <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index.</b> Each of these series of payments is termed a 'leg', so a typical IRS has both a fixed and a floating leg. The floating index is commonly an interbank offered rate (IBOR) of specific tenor in the appropriate currency of the IRS, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK.To completely determine any IRS a number of parameters must be specified for each leg; the notional principal amount (or varying notional schedule), the start and end dates and date scheduling, the fixed rate, the chosen floating <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> tenor, and day count conventions for interest calculations.|$|R
50|$|In finance, an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{derivative}} (IRD) is {{a derivative}} whose payments are determined through calculation techniques where the underlying benchmark product is an <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> {{or set of}} different <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> There are a multitude of different <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>indices</b> {{that can be used}} in this definition.|$|R

50|$|Linear IRDs {{are those}} whose net present values (PVs) are {{overwhelmingly}} (although not necessarily entirely) {{dictated by the}} one-to-one movement of the underlying <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index.</b> Examples of linear IRDs are; <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps (IRSs), forward rate agreements (FRAs), zero coupon swaps (ZCSs), cross-currency basis swaps (XCSs) and single currency basis swaps (SBSs).|$|R
5000|$|A {{short-term}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (STIR) {{future is}} a futures contract that derives its value from the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> at maturation. Common short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> futures are Eurodollar, Euribor, Euroyen, Short Sterling and Euroswiss, which are calculated on LIBOR at settlement, {{with the exception}} of Euribor which is based on Euribor. This value is calculated as 100 minus the <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> Contracts vary, but are often defined on an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> such as 3-month sterling or US dollar LIBOR.|$|R
50|$|Non-linear IRDs {{form the}} set of {{remaining}} products. Those whose PVs are commonly dictated by more than the one-to-one movement of the underlying <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index.</b> Examples of non-linear IRDs are; swaptions, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> caps and floors and constant maturity swaps (CMSs). These products' PVs are reliant upon volatility so their pricing is often more complex as {{is the nature of}} their risk management.|$|R
50|$|A cross-currency swap's (XCS's) {{effective}} {{description is}} a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies {{the nature of}} an exchange of payments benchmarked against two <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>indexes</b> denominated in two different currencies. It also specifies an initial exchange of notional currency in each different currency and the terms of that repayment of notional currency {{over the life of}} the swap.|$|R
50|$|Each {{series of}} {{payments}} (either denominated {{in the first}} currency or the second) is termed a 'leg', so a typical XCS has two legs, composed separately of interest payments and notional exchanges. To completely determine any XCS a number of parameters must be specified for each leg; the notional principal amount (or varying notional schedule including exchanges), the start and end dates and date scheduling, the chosen floating <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>indexes</b> and tenors, and day count conventions for interest calculations.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of the US property/liability (P/L) insurers stock returns using various return generating process models incorporating different <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes such as actual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes, unexpected <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes and orthogonalized market returns. Design/methodology/approach – The study follows the 1974 two-index model by Stone. In the two-index model, three different <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>indices</b> are tested one at a time to examine if <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of the insurers stock returns, if any, is vulnerable to an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> used. Findings – It is found that the US P/L insurers' stock returns are sensitivity to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes. The impact of actual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes on the stock returns is little different from that of unexpected <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes, which is consistent with findings in the banking literature. When orthogonalized market returns are used in the models in lieu of actual market returns, the statistical significance on the estimated <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of the returns improves. Consistent with extant studies of financial institution's <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity, the paper also reports that the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of insurer stock returns is time varying. Research limitations/implications – Due to the data availability, the period studied is between 1992 and 2001. However, the sample period does not weaken the findings of the study. In addition, future research could incorporate the insurers' balance sheet items to investigate which balance sheet items (i. e. investment in bonds, stocks and other items on asset side and reserves and other items on liability side) explain most <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity. Practical implications – Investors can adopt the findings of this study in creating or adjusting their portfolio with the US P/L insurers in it. The insurers stock returns are more sensitive to changes in long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> when the underwriting profit increases and the stock returns are more sensitive to changes in short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> when the underwriting profit decreases. Social implications – Although generalization is difficult and the conclusion is not as convincing as it could be because only one underwriting cycle is sampled, it is still noteworthy to recognize that the insurers' <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity is closely related to the insurance industry's underwriting cycle or performance. Originality/value – This is the first study reporting the association between the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of the US stock returns and the underwriting performance.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{interest}} indices on money supply. The motivation is to ensure stability in money supply through sustainable <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> management. The period 1990 - 2007 was covered. The Eviews software was used to carry out autoregressive analysis on the variable {{as well as an}} assessment of the effects on <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>indices</b> on money supply. The results among others show that minimum rediscount rate and savings rate have made significant positive impact on money supply. On the other hand, lending rate has made insignificant negative impact on money supply. Based on the above results the conclusion of the study the inability of the monetary authority to narrow the gap between saving and lending rate remains a key to the problem of instability in money supply, hence concerted effort must by made to strengthen the capacity of regulatory authorities to use market based options monitor and control periodic volatility in money supply through an effective <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> regimes...|$|R

50|$|A Zero {{coupon swap}} (ZCS) is a {{derivative}} contract made between two parties with terms defining two 'legs' upon which each party either makes or receives payments. One leg {{is the traditional}} fixed leg, whose cashflows are determined at the outset, usually defined by an agreed fixed <b>rate</b> of <b>interest.</b> A second leg is the traditional floating leg, whose payments at the outset are forecast but subject to change and dependent upon future publication of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> upon which the leg is benchmarked. This is same description as with the more common <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swap (IRS). A ZCS differs from an IRS in one major respect; timings of scheduled payments.

A ZCS, unlike an IRS, also only has a single payment date on each leg at the maturity of the trade. The calculation methodology for determing payments is, as a result, slightly more complicated than for IRSs.|$|R

40|$|The lack of indexed {{financial}} instruments has long puzzled economists because their benefits seem obvious. Using a two-period model with random inflation, the author shows that borrowers and lenders prefer indexed instruments when their incomes are adjusted for inflation.

In this paper, we propose a generalization of the static replication formula by exploring the linkage between replication, convexity correction and numeraire change.

On the one hand the heightened scrutiny on capital requirements forces financial institutions to implement risk management systems.

40|$|Abstract: A stylised fact of {{monetary}} policy making is that central banks do not immediately respond to new information but rather seem to prefer {{to wait until}} sufficient ‘evidence’ to warrant a change has accumulated. However, theoretical models of inflation targeting imply that an optimising central bank should continuously respond to shocks. This paper attempts to explain this stylised fact by introducing a small menu cost which is incurred every time the central bank changes the <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> It is shown that this produces a relatively large range of inaction because this cost will induce the central bank to take the option value {{of the status quo}} into account. In other words, because action is costly the central bank will have an incentive to wait and see whether or not the economy will move closer to the inflation target of its own accord. Next, the paper analyses the implications for the time series properties of <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> In particular, we examine the effect of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of aggregate demand, the slope of the Lucas supply function and the variance of demand shocks {{on the size of the}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> step and the expected length of the time period till the <b>next</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> step.
