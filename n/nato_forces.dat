5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that {{no military}} installations are permitted on the archipelago. The Soviet authorities {{were concerned that}} a permanent civilian airport {{could also be used}} by Norwegian and <b>NATO</b> <b>forces.</b> But the Soviets also needed an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and by the early 1970s, an understanding was reached between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{victories}} of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, {{relations between}} Bolivia and the U.S. improved slightly, and in November 2009 the countries entered negotiations to restore diplomatic relations. After the U.S. backed the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya by <b>NATO</b> <b>forces,</b> Morales condemned Obama, calling for his Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked. The two nations restored diplomatic relations in November 2011, although Morales refused to allow the DEA back into the country.|$|E
5|$|Pakistani {{authorities}} {{tried to}} contact their NATO counterparts {{in an effort to}} inform them of the situation but the Pakistani request reportedly failed to reach the attacking force. The helicopters returned a second time engaging Boulder border post again. A short while later communication with the NATO commanders was established and the attack was called off. All casualties were from the initial attack on the Volcano border post. Later, Major General Abbas expressed that it was beyond comprehension why the <b>NATO</b> <b>forces</b> returned to attack the second time.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{apart from}} its Staff Support Battalion and Command Information Systems Battalion, the Corps does not have {{assigned}} units any longer. Following a (<b>NATO)</b> <b>Force</b> Generation Process, the Corps will get multinational units assigned to create a tailor made organisation capable of meeting the given tasks. Since mid 2017 until mid 2018, the Corps is on stand-by as <b>NATO</b> Joint Task <b>Force</b> HQ (Land) together with its sister-HQ French Rapid Reaction Corps in Lille. Following that, in 2019 the Muenster HQ will be on stand-by again for the <b>NATO</b> Response <b>Force.</b>|$|R
5|$|The RNLAF Apaches' first {{deployment}} was in 2001 to Djibouti, Africa. They {{were also}} deployed alongside U.S. AH-64s {{in support of}} NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2004, six Dutch AH-64s were deployed {{as part of the}} Netherlands contribution to Multinational force in Iraq to support the Dutch ground forces. The Apaches performed close combat support and display of force missions, along with providing reconnaissance information to ground forces. In February 2006, the Netherlands contribution to <b>NATO</b> <b>forces</b> in Afghanistan was increased from 600 to 1,400 troops and 6 AH-64s were sent in support.|$|E
5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification, <b>NATO</b> <b>forces</b> proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} <b>NATO</b> <b>forces,</b> and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, and NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.|$|E

50|$|Aubrey Fitch began 1984 in {{her home}} port. Later in January, she {{embarked}} upon a normal schedule of training operations in the West Indies. That employment occupied her through the month of May and into June. On 22 June, the guided missile frigate put to sea to become a unit of <b>NATO's</b> Standing Naval <b>Force,</b> Atlantic, based at Plymouth, England. That deployment included visits {{to a number of}} ports in northern Europe as well as training evolutions in the Baltic Sea. Early in the fall of 1984, the <b>NATO</b> <b>force</b> visited American waters and made calls at Charleston, Savannah, and New Orleans. Late in November, the warships visited Aubrey Fitchs home port in Florida. Early in December, the <b>NATO</b> <b>force</b> headed back to Europe, leaving Aubrey Fitch at Mayport.|$|R

5|$|On 6 June 1999, two Chinooks of No. 27 Squadron left base at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, {{carrying}} paratroopers to join <b>NATO</b> <b>forces</b> {{serving in}} the Balkans; six more arrived the following week in Kosovo to support operations such as casualty evacuations and transporting vital supplies. On 12 June 1999, waves of Chinooks, escorted by Westland Lynx and American AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, were used to rapidly deploy British infantry forces into Kosovo {{as a part of}} NATO's first phase of deployment. On 10 August 1999 hundreds of Chinooks around the world, including those used by the British armed forces, were grounded due to cracking discovered in the landing gear of a British helicopter during routine inspection.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} types of {{units in the}} game. Each unit has a set of {{statistics}} which is displayed in the interface once selected. The statistics range from combat strength, fatigue, efficiency, supply and movement points. During the game, both sides {{have the option to}} request air support {{that can be used to}} attack enemy units. If the other side uses their air support, the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike and will have the option to retreat. The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all <b>NATO</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Have Blue {{was born}} out of a {{requirement}} to evade radar detection. During the Vietnam War, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) posed a significant threat to US aircraft. As such, strike aircraft during the war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The 1973 Yom Kippur War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs – the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network, central to which were medium- to long-range surveillance radars. SAMs and AAAs would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft. If the loss ratio of Israel during the Yom Kippur War was experienced by <b>NATO</b> <b>forces</b> during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks.|$|E
50|$|On 1 September 1999, the <b>NATO</b> <b>force</b> {{structure}} was reorganized. As {{result of this}} reorganization four Mediterranean maritime commands (COMEDCENT, COMEDEAST, COMEDNOREAST, COMGIBMED) were stood down, and COMSUBMED and COMMARAIRMED were transformed in special entities of NAVSOUTH, as COMSUBSOUTH and COMMARAIRNAPLES.|$|R

5|$|Vanguards {{first task}} after {{completing}} her sea trial {{at the end}} of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch. While refitting after her return, she was selected for another Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George's declining health and Vanguard briefly became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, Vanguard was involved in a number of training exercises with <b>NATO</b> <b>forces.</b> In 1953 she participated in Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Review. While she was refitting in 1955, the Admiralty announced that the ship was going to be put into reserve upon completion of the work. Vanguard was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960.|$|E
