40|$|To {{ascertain}} the extent of, and risk factors for, physical abuse among older urban American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), {{we conducted a}} chart review of 550 urban AI/AN primary care patients ≥ 50 years old seen during 1 year.

A logistic regression found younger age (P <. 001), female gender (P <. 001), current depression (P <. 001), and dependence on others for food (P <. 05) to be significant correlates of physical abuse. In only 31 % of instances of definite abuse were the <b>authorities</b> <b>notified.</b> We conclude that providers should be alert {{to the possibility of}} physical mistreatment among older urban AI/ANs.
