40|$|The {{coverage}} of catastrophic risks, {{and in particular}} of industrial and technological risks, raises multiple questions. As nuclear risk {{is considered to be}} a special risk, its coverage is not provided in a traditional way. One of the problems in {{coverage of}} the nuclear risk is that operators today still to a large extent rely upon insurers. However, nuclear insurance is provided through national pools that operate on a non-competitive basis. These pools are costly for operators and the damage covered remains insufficient. Given their dissatisfaction with these insurance pools, many <b>nuclear</b> <b>operators</b> are now looking for alternatives. Relying on the previous work of Faure and Skogh, the goal of this paper is to examine whether a risk-sharing by <b>nuclear</b> <b>operators</b> could constitute a serious alternative for the current coverage system. In order to examine this alternative we will place it in a concrete context of <b>nuclear</b> <b>operators</b> in Europe. Moreover, we do not merely want to sketch the theoretical possibilities of a risk-sharing by operators (as this has been done before in the literature). We will in addition also examine the financial consequences for <b>nuclear</b> <b>operators</b> in Europe of such a risk-sharing agreement.
