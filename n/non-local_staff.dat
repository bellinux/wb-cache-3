40|$|Objective – To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} answers from a 24 / 7 online chat reference service by comparing the responses given by local and consortia library staff using in‐house reference standards, and by assessing {{whether or not the}} questions were answered in real time. Design – Comparative analysis of online chat reference transcripts. Setting – Large academic library in Alberta, Canada. Subjects – A total of online chat reference transcripts from the first year of consortium service were analyzed for this study. Of these, 252 were answered by local library staff and 226 from consortia (non‐local) library staff. Methods – A stratified random sample of 1, 402 transcripts were collected from the first year of consortium service (beginning of October to end of April). This method was then applied monthly, resulting in a sample size of 478 transcripts. In {{the first part of the}} study, responses were coded within the transcripts with a “yes” or “no” label to determine if they met the standards set by the local university library’s reference management. Reference transaction standards included questions regarding whether or not correct information or instructions were given and if not, whether the user was referred to an authoritative source for the correct information. The second part of the study coded transcripts with a “yes” or “no” designation as to whether the user received an answer from the staff member in “real time” and if not, was further analyzed to determine why the user did not receive a real‐time response. Each transcript was coded as reflecting one of four “question categories” that included library user information, request for instruction, request for academic information, and miscellaneous/non‐library questions. Main Results – When all question types were integrated, analysis revealed that local library staff met reference transaction standards 94 % of the time. Consortia staff met these same standards 82 % of the time. The groups showed the most significant differences when separated into the question categories. Local library staff met the standards for “Library User Information” questions 97 % of the time, while consortia staff met the standards only 76 % of the time. “Request for Instruction” questions were answered with 97 % success by local library staff and with 84 % success by consortia. Local library staff met the “Request for Academic Information” standards 90 % of the time while consortia staff met these standards 87 % of the time. For “Miscellaneous Non‐Library Information” questions, 93 % of local and 83 % of consortia staff met the reference transaction standards. For the second part of the study, 89 % of local library staff answered the questions in real time, as opposed to only 69 % of <b>non‐local</b> <b>staff.</b> The three most common reasons for not answering in real time (known as deferment categories) included not knowing the answer (48 % local; 40 % consortia), technical difficulty (26 % local; 16 % consortia), and information not being available (15 % local; 31 % consortia). Conclusion – The results of this research reveal that there are differences in the quality of answers between local and <b>non‐local</b> <b>staff</b> when taking part in an online chat reference consortium, although these discrepancies vary depending on the type of question. Providing non‐local librarians with the information they need to answer questions accurately and in real time can mitigate these differences...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES This paper {{reports the}} first trial of Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) {{assessing}} associations between access to LQAS data and subsequent improvements in district programming. This trial concerns India's approach to addressing an increase in malaria-attributable deaths by training community health workers to diagnose, treat and prevent malaria, while using LQAS to monitor sub-district performance and make programme improvements. METHODS The Ministry of Health introduced LQAS into four matched high malaria burden districts (Annual Parasite Incidence > 5) (N > 5 million). In each sub-district, we sampled four populations in three 6 -monthly surveys: households, children < 5 years, people with fever in the last 2 weeks and community health workers. In three districts, trained local staff collected, analysed and used data for programme management; in one control district, <b>non-local</b> <b>staff</b> collected data and did not disseminate results. For eight indicators, we calculated the change in proportion from survey one to three and used a Difference-in-Differences test to compare the relative change between intervention and control districts. RESULTS Coverage increased from survey one to three for 24 of 32 comparisons. Difference-in-Differences tests revealed that intervention districts exhibited significantly greater change in four of six vertical strategies (insecticide treated bed-nets and indoor residual spraying), one of six treatment-seeking behaviours and four of 12 health worker capacity indicators. The control district displayed greater improvement than two intervention districts for one health worker capacity indicator. One district with poor management did not improve. CONCLUSIONS In this study, LQAS results appeared to support district managers to increase coverage in underperforming areas, especially for vertical strategies {{in the presence of}} diligent managers...|$|E
40|$|Uruzgan {{presents}} an enormously challenging operating environment for development activity. An estimated 35 - 45 per {{cent of the}} province remains outside government control, and anti-government attacks are reported, on average, every day. Much of the province, particularly outside of the provincial capital and the district centres, is {{for the most part}} inaccessible to <b>non-local</b> development <b>staff.</b> Uruzgan {{is also one of the}} most under-served provinces in Afghanistan. Adult literacy is just seven per cent for men and less than one per cent for women, less than 40 per cent of children are in school, and the maternal mortality rate is one in 40. Recent years have seen some increase in access to basic services, but the reach of government services and the efforts of development actors have been – and continue to be – hampered by insecurity. Development activities have preferenced the more accessible districts, with just 40 per cent of development actors operating outside the districts considered to be secure. But some NGOs do operate in districts where government control is tenuous, and where access is restricted. NGOs operating in these districts have adopted a range of strategies for implementing and monitoring their programs, relying to varying extents on community groups or staff and/or volunteers who are local to, and work in, the districts. But capacity at the district level is extremely low, and this mode of operating presents enormous challenges for NGOs striving to assure the quality of services delivered...|$|R
