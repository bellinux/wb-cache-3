5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the intrinsic elements of a work {{as the best way}} to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Zvi Aharoni, {{one of the}} Mossad {{agents who}} had been {{involved}} in the Eichmann capture, was placed in charge of a team of agents tasked with locating Mengele and bringing him to trial in Israel. Inquiries in Paraguay gave no clues as to his whereabouts, and they were unable to intercept any correspondence between Mengele and his wife Martha, then living in Italy. Agents following Rudel's movements did not produce any leads. Aharoni and his team followed Gerhard to a rural area near São Paulo, where they located a European man believed to be Mengele. Aharoni reported his findings to Harel, but the logistics of staging a capture, budgetary constraints, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the nation's deteriorating relationship with Egypt led the Mossad chief to call a halt to the operation in 1962.|$|E

5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of}} the game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
5|$|The first V-22 was {{rolled out}} with {{significant}} media attention in May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate {{votes in the}} Senate that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not {{to spend more money}} on the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 in an effort to cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|E
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static rocket motor, which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.|$|E

25|$|Vanuatu were undefeated {{throughout}} the tournament, defeating Papua New Guinea {{in the final}} to win the gold medal {{for the first time}} (and become the first country other than PNG to win a gold medal in men's Pacific Games cricket). Tonga defeated New Caledonia in the bronze-medal play-off. Only four teams participated in the tournament, the same as at the 2011 tournament and two less than in the women's tournament. Because the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier was held at the same time, Papua New Guinea fielded a development squad at the Pacific Games, coached by John Ovia. Fiji and Samoa did not send men's teams, despite both their women's teams competing in the games.

25|$|Education is a {{critical}} input in human resource development and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the productivity and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force {{that is capable of}} leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It {{can be one of the}} most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of social justice but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability. Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of child labor and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.|$|E

500|$|NJ Route 4 {{traverses}} east-west through Teaneck, running [...] from Hackensack to Englewood. Unlike {{all other}} municipalities situated along the highway, {{there is no}} commercial development or billboards, with the open space along the highway maintained by the Township Council's Preserve the Greenbelt Committee. Route 4 narrows from three lanes in each direction on a section between Belle Avenue and Englewood, causing rush-hour traffic backups that may extend for miles. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has discussed a series of proposed replacement projects for bridges over the highway, pending completion of feasibility studies and design work. While the township has indicated its willingness to cede space along the Greenbelt for a third lane, the lack of space for a shoulder may preclude {{the creation of a}} full three-lane route through Teaneck. In November 2013, NJDOT informed Teaneck officials that it had no plans to widen the highway, as the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> the limited funds available on replacing and repairing deteriorating bridges and infrastructure precluded the implementation of a widening project.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of radiocarbon dating {{has had a}} profound impact on archaeologyoften described as the [...] "radiocarbon revolution". [...] In the words of anthropologist R.E. Taylor, [...] " [...] data made a world prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local, regional and continental boundaries". It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a [...] date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.|$|E
