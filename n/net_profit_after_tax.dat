30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the planning horizon, no surpluses from operations are available to the investor. Putting the new distribution location in Volketswil into operation requires EUR 1.175 million (EUR 1 million for opening + EUR 0.175 million for making related capacities available). Furthermore, initial capacity changes (capacity expansions in Lahr and Hemer that require EUR 4 million in each year of the investor’s engagement, and can be balanced with annual cash inflows of EUR 2 million resulting from capacity downsizing at the production location in Porta Westfalica until {{the beginning}} of 2010) need to be considered. As financing through two credits (summed up to EUR 1 million, which is equal to the credit limit of this period) is not sufficient for the purposes mentioned above, the investor is advised to provide additional funds of EUR 2.175 million to the company to obtain increasing FTEs in the future. The credits must be repaid after 2  years (EUR 0.25 million) and 3  years (EUR 0.75 million), respectively. After the first period (i.e., at {{the beginning of}} the year 2009), the <b>net</b> operating <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> is EUR 60.447 million. It is adjusted for regular payments of the aforementioned ongoing capacity changes (balanced to cash outflows of EUR 2 million). Taking into account two new credits (EUR 0.25 million for 1  year and EUR 0.75 million for 2  years, interest rates contain risk premium due to the current total debt of EUR 2 million), a cash outflow to the investor of EUR 59.447 million is possible. After the second time period (i.e., at {{the beginning of the}} year 2010) the tax shield becomes relevant for determining the <b>net</b> operating <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> of EUR 61.994 million, as interests of EUR 0.058 million must be paid for two expiring loans (repayment amount of EUR 0.5 million). Simultaneously, a new loan (credit amount of EUR 0.75 million, interest rate 2  % p.a. + risk premium 7.5  % p.a. due to a current total debt of EUR 2.25 million and the debt limit of EUR 3 million) is taken out. The FTE of EUR 60.244 million results. After the following time period, the engagement of the investor ends. Last decisions on the adjustment of the network structure are possible at this point in time (end of the year 2010). In particular, there are cash inflows of EUR 2.7 million resulting from the liquidation of the production location in Porta Westfalica. As the rest of the configuration remains untouched (i.e., there are no further closings of locations), ongoing operations are ensured after the investor’s engagement. Three outstanding loans (summed up to EUR 2.25 million) are repaid, the related interests (summed up to EUR 0.319 million) are relevant for the calculation of the tax shield. Due to a <b>net</b> operating <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> of EUR 57.735 million, a last cash outflow to the investor of EUR 54.185 million is possible. Using the given network structure that would be available to the new holders after the investor’s engagement, a <b>net</b> operating <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> of EUR 62.125 million could be generated per year. As the latter is assumed to be a perpetuity, a residual value of EUR 460.19 million (valid at the end of the year 2010) can be calculated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{work done}} in the {{extraction}} of phenol from oil palm shells showed that it contained up to 80. 1 % purity of phenolic compounds. The oil-palm-shell-based phenol is applicable to replace petroleum-based phenol in preparation of phenol formaldehyde wood adhesives. Since {{the average price of}} petroleum-based phenol is around RM 3600 /ton, this work was done to estimate the cost of oil-palm-shell-based phenol. In this present research, three oil-palm-shell-based phenol manufacturing plants were investigated. Their manufacturing capacities are 1000 ton/year, 10 000 ton/year, and 100 000 ton/year. All the designs are based on the results from simulator DESIGN II. From the economic analysis, the cost of the oil-palm-shell-based phenol is RM 1084, RM 1008, and RM 972 per ton respectively. It shows that the cost of the oil-palm-shell-based phenol is reduced when the productivity is high. The <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> for these plants is RM 361, 530, RM 4, 140, 764 and RM 43, 943, 092 per year respectively.

For undiscounted cash flow, the pay back period is 10. 0, 8. 4, and 7. 8 years respectively including the first 3 years. For different discount rates, values of net present value and discounted break–even point vary. The discounted cash flow rate of return is 14. 0 %, 20. 0 %, and 25. 0 % respectively in these plants with related net present value becomes zero.
