50|$|The {{caffeine}} {{content of}} instant coffee is generally {{less than that}} of brewed coffee. One study comparing various home-prepared samples came to the result that regular instant coffee (<b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated)</b> has a median caffeine content of 66 mg per cup (range 29-117 mg per cup), with a median cup size of 225 ml (range 170-285 ml) and a caffeine concentration of 328 µg/ml (range 102-559 µg/ml). In comparison, drip or filter coffee was estimated to have a median caffeine content of 112 mg, with a median concentration of 621 µg/ml for the same cup size.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of snail-control {{measures}} that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants. Traditional pesticides are still used, as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated garlic or wormwood solutions. Copper metal is also a snail repellent, and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit. Caffeine has proven surprisingly toxic to snails, to the extent that spent coffee grounds (genuine coffee, and <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated)</b> make a safe and immediately effective snail-repellant and even molluscicidal mulch for pot-plants, or for wherever else the supply is adequate.|$|E
40|$|After a single-blind, randomized, {{cross-over}} protocol using {{decaffeinated coffee}} in a control experiment, {{the effect of}} an oral 250 -mg caffeine dose on plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (ANF) was assessed in eight healthy students {{who had been on}} a methylxanthine-free diet for 1 week. One to 2 h after caffeine ingestion, both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) increased by 12 mm Hg while heart rate (HR) also tended to increase. An increase in diuresis and in urinary sodium, potassium, and osmol excretion was observed within 1 h. Decaffeinated coffee induced no change in any of these parameters. Plasma epinephrine (EPI) increased gradually from 16. 6 +/- 3. 2 pg/ml (mean +/- SEM) to 45. 1 +/- 7. 9 pg/ml within 2 h after caffeine ingestion, but did <b>not</b> change after <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee (p less than 0. 001). Plasma norepinephrine (NE), renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, and vasopressin remained unchanged. Plasma ANF was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using an extremely sensitive antiserum (Kd = 10 (- 12) M) after rapid and virtually complete (90 - 103 %) extraction from plasma. In 0. 2 ml plasma, the theoretical detection limit is 1. 1 fmol/ml. Normal plasma ANF concentrations in supine subjects were 17. 9 +/- 8. 1 fmol/ml (mean +/- SD) and 11. 0 +/- 3. 3 fmol/ml in subjects in the upright position. Plasma ANF levels were not affected by coffee drinking. In conclusion, by using a new and sensitive assay for plasma ANF, we did not find that caffeine-induced diuresis is mediated by ANF...|$|R
40|$|Background : Caffeine is a {{commonly}} consumed substance found in everyday beverages. It is rapidly absorbed from the gut and can cross the blood brain barrier. Caffeine can exert it’s effects (such as stimulating lipolysis, enhancing performance and enhancing cognitive function) when doses {{as low as}} that in {{a cup of coffee}} are consumed. As caffeine is no longer a banned substance by the IOC, it is being used more frequently in sport as it has been found to enhance performance. Objectives : This study will investigate the effects caffeine has on cardiovascular parameters, cognitive function and reaction time among a physically active population. Methods : Eight participants abstained from caffeine from 8 pm the evening prior to testing. A caffeine frequency questionnaire was completed and height was measured. Participants attended three testing sessions, one week apart with the same format to each. For baseline measurements, participants had their weight recorded, blood pressure taken, completed the Stroop test and a simple reaction time test. One of three preparations was then given: caffeinated espresso, decaffeinated espresso or RB. All of the above measurements were repeated after a 40 minute period. Results : When caffeinated espresso was consumed SBP and MBP increased, DBP remained the same and HR decreased. When RB was consumed SBP, DBP and MBP all increased and HR decreased. These effects were <b>not</b> seen when <b>decaffeinated</b> espresso was taken, despite this the changes were not significantly different. The overall Stroop test times decreased in all three preparations (caffeinated espresso - 13. 9 s, decaffeinated espresso - 7. 5 s, RB - 17. 1 s) but {{there was no significant difference}} found. With regards to the reaction time test, caffeine decreased the time taken, but no significance was seen between the pre-testing values and the post-testing values. A significant difference was seen between the post-testing values for decaffeinated espresso (441 ± 70) and RB (363 ± 42). Conclusion : Overall, caffeine increased blood pressure and decreased heart rate. It increased performance in both the Stroop test and the reaction time test but not at a significant level. Future research on a larger sample may corroborate these results finding larger differences. Key Words : Caffeine, RB, Exercise, Cognitive Function, Reaction Time, Blood Pressure, Stroop Test...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} study was to compare the ability of green, black and decaffeinated black tea to modulate hepatic expression of cytochromes P 450 in the rat, and the consequences on the bioactivation of some food-borne carcinogens. Furthermore, these studies allow inferences to be drawn as to the contribution of caffeine and flavanols in the tea-mediated changes in cytochrome P 450 expression. Black tea is prepared from fresh tea leaf following oxidation of flavanols by polyphenol oxidases and consequently has a low content of these compounds. All three types of tea enhanced lauric acid hydroxylation but in the case of decaffeinated black tea no statistical significance was attained. Green tea and black tea, but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated</b> black tea, stimulated the O-dealkylations of methoxy-, ethoxy- and pentoxy-resorufin indicating upregulation of CYP 1 A and CYP 2 B. Immunoblot analysis revealed that green and black tea, but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated</b> black tea, elevated the hepatic CYP 1 A 2 apoprotein levels. Hepatic microsomes from green and black tea-treated rats, but not those from the decaffeinated black tea-treated rats, were more effective than controls in converting IQ into mutagenic species in the Ames test. It is concluded that flavanols are not responsible for the effects of tea on the cytochrome P 450 system, but caffeine could account for the increase in CYP 1 A 2 and the consequent increase in the bioactivation of IQ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Coffee {{and other}} sources of methylxanthines and risk of Type I vs Type II endometrial cancer (EC) have not been {{evaluated}} previously. Methods: Prospective cohort of 23 356 postmenopausal women with 471 Type I and 71 Type II EC cases. Results: Type I EC was statistically significantly associated with caffeinated (relative risk (RR) 0. 65 for 4 þ cups per day vsp 1 cup per month: 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 47 – 0. 89) but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated</b> (RR 0. 76; 95 % CI: 0. 50 – 1. 15) coffee intake; there were no associations with tea, cola or chocolate, or for Type II EC. The inverse association with caffeinated coffee intake was specific to women with a body mass index 30 þ kgm 2 (RR 0. 56; 95 % CI: 0. 36 – 0. 89). Conclusion: Coffee may protect against Type I EC in obese postmenopausal women. Following water and tea, coffee is the third most consumed beverage in the world (Bushman, 1998; La Vecchia and Tavani, 2007). A recent meta-analysis reported an inverse association of coffee intake with endometrial cancer (EC) risk (Je and Giovannucci, 2011). The presence of antioxidants and other chemopreventive compounds in coffee may explain its antic-arcinogenic effect (Vivani, 1993; Cavin et al, 2002). However, i...|$|E
40|$|Findings from epidemiology, {{preclinical}} {{and clinical}} {{studies indicate that}} consumption of coffee could have beneficial effects against dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The benefits appear to come from caffeinated coffee, but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee or pure caffeine itself. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to use metabolomics approach to delineate the discriminant metabolites between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, which could have contributed to the observed therapeutic benefits. Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) -based metabolomics approach was employed to characterize the metabolic differences between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed distinct separation between the two types of coffee (cumulative Q 2 = 0. 998). A total of 69 discriminant metabolites were identified based on the OPLS-DA model, with 37 and 32 metabolites detected to be higher in caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, respectively. These metabolites include several benzoate and cinnamate-derived phenolic compounds, organic acids, sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids. Our study successfully established GC-TOF-MS based metabolomics approach as a highly robust tool in discriminant analysis between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee samples. Discriminant metabolites identified in this study are biologically relevant and provide valuable insights into therapeutic research of coffee against AD. Our data also hint at possible involvement of gut microbial metabolism to enhance therapeutic potential of coffee components, which represents an interesting area fo...|$|E
40|$|Multiple human {{epidemiologic}} studies link caffeinated (but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated)</b> beverage intake {{with significant}} decreases in {{several types of}} cancer, including highly prevalent UV-associated skin carcinomas. The mechanism by which caffeine protects against skin cancer is unknown. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad 3 -related (ATR) is a replication checkpoint kinase activated by DNA stresses {{and is one of}} several targets of caffeine. Suppression of ATR, or its downstream target checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1), selectively sensitizes DNA-damaged and malignant cells to apoptosis. Agents that target this pathway are currently in clinical trials. Conversely, inhibition of other DNA damage response pathways, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and BRCA 1, promotes cancer. To determine the effect of replication checkpoint inhibition on carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic mice with diminished ATR function in skin and crossed them into a UV-sensitive background, Xpc−/−. Unlike caffeine, this genetic approach was selective and had no effect on ATM activation. These transgenic mice were viable and showed no histological abnormalities in skin. Primary keratinocytes from these mice had diminished UV-induced Chk 1 phosphorylation and twofold augmentation of apoptosis after UV exposure (P = 0. 006). With chronic UV treatment, transgenic mice remained tumor-free for significantly longer (P = 0. 003) and had 69 % fewer tumors at the end of observation of the full cohort (P = 0. 019), compared with littermate controls with the same genetic background. This study suggests that inhibition of replication checkpoint function can suppress skin carcinogenesis and supports ATR inhibition as the relevant mechanism for the protective effect of caffeinated beverage intake in human epidemiologic studies...|$|E
40|$|Several {{epidemiological}} studies have determined the associations between coffee intake level and skin cancer risk; however, {{the results were}} not yet conclusive. Herein, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cohort and case-control studies for the association between coffee intake level and malignant melanoma (MM) risk. Studies were identified through searching the PubMed and MEDLINE databases (to November, 2015). Study-specific risk estimates were pooled under the random-effects model. Two case-control studies (846 MM patients and 843 controls) and five cohort studies (including 844, 246 participants and 5, 737 MM cases) were identified. For caffeinated coffee, the pooled relative risk (RR) of MM was 0. 81 [95 % confidential interval (95 % CI) = 0. 68 - 0. 97; P-value for Q-test = 0. 003; I 2 = 63. 5 %] for those with highest versus lowest quantity of intake. In the dose-response analysis, the RR of MM was 0. 955 (95 % CI = 0. 912 - 0. 999) for per 1 cup/day increment of caffeinated coffee consumption and linearity dose-response association was found (P-value for nonlinearity = 0. 326). Strikingly, no significant association {{was found between the}} decaffeinated coffee intake level and MM risk (pooled RR = 0. 92, 95 % CI = 0. 81 - 1. 05; P-value for Q-test = 0. 967; I 2 = 0 %; highest versus lowest quantity of intake). This meta-analysis suggested that caffeinated coffee might have chemo-preventive effects against MM but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee. However, larger prospective studies and the intervention studies are warranted to confirm these findings...|$|E
40|$|Inverse {{associations}} of coffee and/or tea {{in relation to}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk have been consistently identified in studies conducted mostly in Asia where consumption patterns of such beverages differ from Europe. In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC), we identified 201 HCC cases among 486, 799 men/women, after a median follow-up of 11 years. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC incidence in relation to quintiles/categories of coffee/tea intakes. We found that increased coffee and tea intakes were consistently associated with lower HCC risk. The inverse associations were substantial, monotonic and statistically significant. Coffee consumers in the highest compared to the lowest quintile had lower HCC risk by 72 % [HR: 0. 28; 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) : 0. 16 - 0. 50, p-trend[*]<[*] 0. 001]. The corresponding association of tea with HCC risk was 0. 41 (95 % CI: 0. 22 - 0. 78, p-trend[*]=[*] 0. 003). There was no compelling evidence of heterogeneity of these associations across strata of important HCC risk factors, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C status (available in a nested case-control study). The inverse, monotonic {{associations of}} coffee intake with HCC were apparent for caffeinated (p-trend[*]=[*] 0. 009), but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated</b> (p-trend[*]=[*] 0. 45) coffee for which, however, data were available {{for a fraction of}} subjects. Results from this multicentre, European cohort study strengthen the existing evidence regarding the inverse association between coffee/tea and HCC risk. Given the apparent lack of heterogeneity of these associations by HCC risk factors and that coffee/tea are universal exposures, our results could have important implications for high HCC risk subjects...|$|E
40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{recently developed}} a mouse model of transplacental induction of lymphoma, lung and liver cancer by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP). Pregnant B 6129 SF 1 females, bred to 129 S 1 /SvIm males, were treated on day 17 of gestation with an oral dose of 15 mg/kg DBP. Beginning on day 0 of gestation, dams were given (ad lib) buffered water, 0. 5 % green tea, 0. 5 % decaffeinated green tea, caffeine or epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) (both at equivalent concentrations found in tea). The {{concentration of the}} teas (and corresponding caffeine and EGCG) was increased to 1. 0 % upon entering the second trimester, 1. 5 % at onset of the third trimester and continued at 1. 5 % until pups were weaned at 21 days of age. Offspring were raised with normal drinking water and AIN 93 G diet. Beginning at 2 months of age, offspring experienced significant mortalities due to an aggressive T-cell lymphoma as seen in our previous studies. Ingestion of caffeinated, but <b>not</b> <b>decaffeinated,</b> green tea provided modest but significant protection (P[*]=[*] 0. 03) against mortality. Caffeine provided a more robust (P[*]=[*] 0. 006) protection, but EGCG was without effect. Offspring also developed DBP-dependent lung adenomas. All treatments significantly reduced lung tumor multiplicity relative to controls (P[*]<[*] 0. 02). EGCG was most effective at decreasing tumor burden (P[*]=[*] 0. 005) by on average over 40 % compared with controls. Induction of Cytochrome P 450 (Cyp) 1 b 1 in maternal liver may reduce bioavailability of DBP to the fetus as a mechanism of chemoprevention. This is the first demonstration that maternal ingestion of green tea, during pregnancy and nursing, provides protection against transplacental carcinogenesis...|$|E
