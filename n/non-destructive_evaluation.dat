40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the microstructural characterization and failure analysis of hip implant components. The main hip components analyzed were the femoral heads and the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) liners. Previous {{research has shown that}} hip implants tend to fail by the PE liners due to adhesive and abrasive wear, delamination, and third body particles (metals, ceramics, and PE). The methods and procedures for analyzing the said failures consisted of <b>non-destructive</b> and destructive <b>evaluations.</b> <b>Non-destructive</b> <b>evaluations</b> included of techniques such as visual characterization and dye penetrant inspection (DPI) â€”which displayed macroscopic surface details and presented initial clues as to the extent and causes of the failures. The use of attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) produced transmittance spectra for the PE liners to indicate the bonds and their associated wavelength energies. The destructive evaluations included metallography and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These techniques revealed the microstructural characteristics of the metallic components and focused on microscopic cracks and abrasions from areas of delamination and adhesion in the samples.

50|$|This {{bandwidth}} is {{also known}} as the terahertz gap because it is noticeably underutilized. This is because terahertz waves are electromagnetic waves with frequencies higher than microwaves but lower than infrared radiation and visible light. These characteristics mean {{that it is difficult to}} influence terahertz radiation with conventional electronic components and devices. Electronics technology controls the flow of electrons, and is well developed for microwaves and radio frequencies. Likewise, the terahertz gap also borders optical or photonic wavelengths; the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet ranges (or spectrums), where well developed lens technologies also exist. However, the terahertz wavelength, or frequency range, appears to be useful for security screening, medical imaging, wireless communications systems, <b>non-destructive</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and chemical identification, as well as submillimeter astronomy. Finally, as a non-ionizing radiation it does not have the risks inherent in X-ray screening.|$|E

However, accurate and reliable damage quantification using the Lamb wave method is still a practical challenge, due to the complex underlying mechanism of Lamb wave propagation and damage detection. This paper presents a Lamb wave damage quantification method using a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Three damage sensitive features, namely, normalized amplitude, phase change, and correlation coefficient, were proposed to describe changes of Lamb wave characteristics caused by damage. In view of commonly used data-driven methods, the GA-based LS-SVM model using the proposed three damage sensitive features was implemented to evaluate the crack size. The GA method was adopted to optimize the model parameters. The results of GA-based LS-SVM were validated using coupon test data and lap joint component test data with naturally developed fatigue cracks.
