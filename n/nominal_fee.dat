5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a <b>nominal</b> <b>fee</b> of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E

5|$|Beardsley's former club Mansfield {{spoke to}} him about re-signing for them in May 2005, {{although}} Kidderminster demanded a £5,000 fee for him, half of which would go his former club Doncaster. He eventually joined Mansfield, now playing in League Two, on 5 August 2005 for a <b>nominal</b> <b>fee.</b> He debuted as an 82nd-minute substitute in their 3–0 home win over Torquay United on 13 August 2005. However, his 2005–06 season {{came to an end}} during a 3–2 home defeat to local rivals Notts County on 29 August 2005, when he collided with goalkeeper Kevin Pilkington and broke his leg. Beardsley had made four appearances that season, which Mansfield finished in 16th-place in League Two. He returned to the team almost a year later, on 12 August 2006, as an 88th-minute substitute in a 1–1 home draw with Stockport County. His first two goals of 2006–07 came in Mansfield's 3–0 Football League Trophy home victory against Grimsby Town on 31 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a <b>nominal</b> <b>fee</b> just over two years previous.|$|E

He was sent off during a North Riding Cup match for York's reserves against Scarborough in February 2007, but a suspension did not come into place until 14 days later, meaning he was able to play league-leaders Dagenham & Redbridge. York ranked fourth in the Conference National and Brodie played in both legs of the play-off semi-final defeat to Morecambe, losing 2–1 on aggregate, and finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal.

Ahead of York's home match against Hayes & Yeading United, the club signed Fyfield from Maidenhead United for a <b>nominal</b> <b>fee</b> and Racchi from Wrexham, where he had been on non-contract terms.

Ahead of this match, Dowson was signed and made his debut as an 85th-minute substitute. The first home match of Porter's tenure was a 0–0 draw with Darlington, which was York's first televised appearance on sports channel Premier Sports.|$|E
