40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} new Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device</b> for the MPICH Implementation of the MPI (Message Passing Interface) {{standard}} using MP{_}Lite. MP{_}Lite is a lightweight message-passing library that is not a full MPI implementation, but offers high performance MPICH (Message Passing Interface CHameleon) is a full implementation of the MPI standard that has the p 4 library as the underlying communication device for TCP/IP networks. By integrating MP{_}Lite as a Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device</b> in MPICH, a parallel programmer can utilize the full MPI implementation of MPICH as well as the high bandwidth offered by MP{_}Lite. There are several layers in the MPICH library where one can tie a new <b>device.</b> The Channel <b>Interface</b> is the lowest layer that requires very few functions to add a new device. By attaching MP{_}Lite to MPICH at the lowest level, the Channel Interface, almost all of the performance of the MP{_}Lite library can be delivered to the applications using MPICH. MP{_}Lite can be implemented either as a blocking or a non-blocking Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device.</b> The performance was measured on two separate test clusters, the PC and the Alpha miniclusters, having Gigabit Ethernet connections. The PC cluster has two 1. 8 GHz Pentium 4 PCs and the Alpha cluster has two 500 MHz Compaq DS 20 workstations. Different network interface cards like Netgear, TrendNet and SysKonnect Gigabit Ethernet cards were used for the measurements. Both the blocking and non-blocking MPICH-MP{_}Lite Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>devices</b> perform close to raw TCP, whereas a performance loss of 25 - 30 % is seen in the MPICH-p 4 Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device</b> for larger messages. The superior performance offered by the MPICH-MP{_}Lite device compared to the MPICH-p 4 device can be easily seen on the SysKonnect cards using jumbo frames. The throughput curve also improves considerably by increasing the Eager/Rendezvous threshold...|$|R
