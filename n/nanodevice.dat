30|$|An {{approach}} is developed to predict stability of carbyne-based <b>nanodevices.</b> Within this approach, the thermo-fluctuation model of instability and break of contact bond in <b>nanodevices,</b> containing carbyne chains and graphene sheets, is offered.

Possibility of synergistic effect of temperature and mechanical load on stability and value of service time of carbyne-based <b>nanodevices</b> is predicted. It is ascertained, that this synergism results in a significant (by many orders of magnitude) decrease in the lifetime of <b>nanodevices</b> containing carbyne chains.

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{development}} and experimental validation of a coupled statistical thermodynamic model allowing prediction of the structural transitions executed by a novel DNA <b>nanodevice,</b> for quantitative operational design. The efficiency of target structure formation by this <b>nanodevice,</b> implemented with a bistable DNA molecule designed to transform between three distinct structures, is modeled by coupling the isolated equilibrium models for the individual structures. A peculiar behavior is predicted for this <b>nanodevice,</b> which forms the target structure within a limited temperature range by sensing thermal variations. The predicted thermal response is then validated via fluorescence measurements to quantitatively assess whether the <b>nanodevice</b> performs as designed. Agreement between predictions and experiment was substantial, with a 0. 95 correlation for overall curve shape over a wide temperature range, from 30 C to 90 C. The obtained accuracy, which is {{comparable to that of}} conventional melting behavior prediction for DNA duplexes in isolation, ensures the applicability of the coupled model for illustrating general DNA reaction systems involving competitive duplex formation.

40|$|Histological {{staining}} of reactive stroma {{has been}} shown to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer, however, molecular markers of the stromal response to prostate cancer have not yet been fully delineated. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not the stromal biomarkers detected with a thioredoxin-targeted <b>nanodevice</b> could be used to distinguish the stroma associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia from that associated with PCA. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that a thioredoxin-targeted <b>nanodevice</b> selectively binds to reactive stroma in frozen prostate tumor tissue sections. To accomplish this, random frozen prostate tissue sections from each of 35 patients who underwent resection were incubated with the <b>nanodevice</b> and graded for fluorescent intensity. An adjacent section from each case was stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin to confirm the diagnosis. Select cases were stained with Masson's Trichrome or immunohistochemically using antibodies to thioredoxin reductase 1, thioredoxin reductase 2 or peroxiredoxin 1. Our results demonstrate that the graded intensity of <b>nanodevice</b> binding to the stroma associated with PCA was significantly higher (p =  0. 0127) than that of benign prostatic hyperplasia using the t-test. Immunohistochemical staining of adjacent sections in representative cases showed that none of the two commonly studied thioredoxin interacting protein partners mirrored the fluorescence pattern seen with the <b>nanodevice.</b> However, thioredoxin reductase 2 protein was clearly shown to be a biomarker of prostate cancer-associated reactive stroma whose presence distinguishes the stroma associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia from that associated with prostate cancer. We conclude that the signal detected by the <b>nanodevice,</b> in contrast to individual targets detected with antibodies used in this study, originates from multiple thioredoxin interacting protein partners that distinguish the M 2 neutrophil and macrophage associated inflammatory response in prostate cancer-associated stroma from the CD 4 + T-Lymphocyte linked inflammation in benign prostatic hyperplasia...|$|E

Self- assembly, however, inherently lends itself to innate disparities {{in the structure of}} nominally identical nanodevices and, consequently, wide inter-device variance in their functionality.

In this work, we discuss a statistical approach which learns measurement correlations from a small set of fully characterized nanodevices and utilizes the extracted knowledge to simplify the process {{for the rest of the}} nanodevices. More specifically, we employ various machine-learning methods which rely on a small subset of measurements to (i) predict the performances of a fabricated <b>nanodevice,</b> (ii) decide whether a <b>nanodevice</b> passes or fails a given set of specifications, and (iii) bin a <b>nanodevice</b> with regards to several sets of increasingly strict specifications.
