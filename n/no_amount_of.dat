5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that <b>no</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which <b>no</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When {{it was time to go}} home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to <b>no</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.|$|E

5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. <b>No</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E
