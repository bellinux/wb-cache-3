25|$|In the 2010–11 Australian summer, Smith played three Tests in the 2010–11 Ashes series, {{this time}} playing {{more as a}} batsman, taking the number six spot in the order. His {{performances}} were solid during the series, getting a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> and scoring two half centuries. Following the 2010–11 Ashes, Smith did not play another Test for two years, his next Test series coming against India in March 2013.|$|E

The following campaign, {{he was used}} in the same fashion in the transfer of Sébastien Frey, which saw him go to Inter Milan while Frey went in the other direction. After two seasons and a good <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starts,</b> he would eventually leave Inter by mutual agreement and re-joined Lazio, leaving for former club Porto towards the end of 2003–04, again by mutual agreement, and adding his third Portuguese national championship.|$|E
25|$|Gambhir {{scored two}} {{successive}} double-hundreds in 2002 (one of {{them against the}} visiting Zimbabweans) made him a strong contender for India's opening slot in all three forms of the game. He made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in the TVS Cup in 2003. In his third match, he scored 71 and was named Man of the Match. His maiden century (103 off 97 balls) came against Sri Lanka in 2005. In 2004, he made his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and last Test match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy but did himself no favours by getting out for 3 and 1. He made amends in his second Test, however, scoring 96 against the South Africans. His maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December 2004. Gambhir then made a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> in the home series against Pakistan in 2005, but {{was able to make}} only one half-century in six innings. He made 97 in Zimbabwe later that year, but failed to reach 30 against Sri Lanka at home, repeatedly struggling against Chaminda Vaas, and was subsequently dropped from the Test team. He was replaced in Tests by Wasim Jaffer, who made a double hundred and a hundred in seven Tests.|$|E

500|$|During {{the same}} time frame as the Hitchcock rumors, goaltender Curtis Sanford {{returned}} from his groin injury on November 13. He made his first {{start of the season}} against the Boston Bruins, losing 2–1 in a shootout. Sanford continued his strong play, posting a 3–1–2 record, 1.38 goals against average and [...]947 save percentage over his next six games. Sanford started 12 consecutive games before Steve Mason made his next start. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> might not have been as numerous, but prior to the November 23 game, Mason was hit in the head by a shot from Rick Nash during pre-game warm-ups and suffered a concussion. Mason returned from his concussion after two games, making a start against the Vancouver Canucks. Mason allowed only one goal in the game despite suffering from cramping in the third period, temporarily being replaced by Sanford for just over three minutes. Columbus won the game 2–1 in a shootout, breaking a nine-game losing streak to the Canucks. After the game, Arniel stated that Sanford was still seen as the team's number one goaltender. However, Mason started four of the next six games with the Blue Jackets going 0–5–1 during that stretch.|$|E
500|$|This {{strategic}} selection also {{applied to}} the pitchers, as Stengel leveraged his staff, starting his best pitchers against the best opponents. Although Stengel {{is best known for}} doing this with the Yankees, he also did it in his days managing Brooklyn and Boston, and to a very limited extent with the Mets. Rather than have a regular pitching rotation to maximize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> a pitcher will have, Stengel often rested pitchers longer to take advantage of situational advantages which he perceived. [...] For example, Stengel started Eddie Lopat against Cleveland whenever possible, because he regularly beat them. Stengel's 1954 Yankees had the highest [...] sabermetrics measurement of Leverage Points Average of any 20th century baseball team. [...] Leveraging became unpopular after choices of starting pitchers based on it backfired on Lopez in the 1959 World Series and on Stengel in the following year's—he waited until Game 3 to start Whitey Ford because he felt Ford would be more effective at Yankee Stadium rather than at the small Forbes Field. Ford pitched two shutouts, including Game 6 at Forbes Field, but could not pitch in the Yankees' Game 7 loss. Stengel's philosophy took another blow in 1961 when Houk used Ford in a regular rotation and the pitcher went 25–4 and won the Cy Young Award—he had never won 20 games under Stengel. Today, teams prefer, for the most part, a regular rotation.|$|E
500|$|His {{best chance}} at winning a race {{occurred}} at the [...] where, in the wet conditions, Webber ran in 2nd place, setting the 3rd fastest lap of the race after the two McLarens. Towards {{the end of the}} race, Webber was running 2nd behind Lewis Hamilton, with no further pit stops to make, when Sebastian Vettel, driver for sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso, ran into the back of him when Hamilton suddenly reduced his speed in poor visibility and heavy rain under a safety car, taking both cars out of the race. He had been lapping faster than Hamilton due to damage on the McLaren's sidepod from contact with Robert Kubica. Out of the current Formula One drivers, until his win at the 2009 German Grand Prix, Webber has had the second highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> without a win, and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "unluckiest man in modern Formula One", a title that was reinforced in Japan as Webber started the race suffering from food poisoning and vomited inside his helmet during the first safety car period. When questioned by ITV's Louise Goodman about the race ending collision Webber commented: [...] "Well it's kids, isn't it. Kids with not enough experience, doing a good job then they fuck it all up," [...] Webber was particularly critical of Hamilton's driving that led to the accident, describing his antics as [...] "shit". Webber also stated the British press attacked him for criticising their [...] "golden boy" [...] Hamilton.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} a contaminated network with an intruder. The {{task for the}} mobile agents is to decontaminate all hosts while preventing a recontamination {{and to do so}} as efficiently as possible. We study under what conditions and what cost a team of mobile agents can do this in synchronous arbitrary regular graphs using the breadth-first-search strategy. Due {{to the nature of the}} experiment we use a genetic algorithm to find the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> agents required to decontaminate a given network. The results show that there is a relation between the degree, the size of the graph, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> locations <b>of</b> the mobile agents. in particular, this relation demonstrates the possibility of improvements in reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> mobile agents used depending on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> location in arbitrary regular graphs...|$|R

From these results, 60 starting dots are recommended for a three-category classifier. When examining the variances of the estimates for the four estimation procedures (using 60 dots), no significant differences were found between procedures. Thus, only the machine clustering may be used to produce an estimate, and the stratified areal estimate computations and maximum likelihood classification can be deleted...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{surrogate}} model-based global optimization framework allowing a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> function evaluations. The method, called SpLEGO, {{is based on}} a multi-scale expected improvement (EI) framework relying on both sparse and local Gaussian process (GP) models. First, a bi-objective approach relying on a global sparse GP model is used to determine potential next sampling regions. Local GP models are then constructed within each selected region. The method subsequently employs the standard expected improvement criterion to deal with the exploration-exploitation trade-off within selected local models, leading to a decision on where to perform the next function evaluation(s). The potential of our approach is demonstrated using the so-called Sparse Pseudo-input GP as a global model. The algorithm is tested on four benchmark problems, whose <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> points ranges from 102 to 104. Our results show that SpLEGO is effective and capable of solving problems with large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> points, and it even provides significant advantages when compared with state-of-the-art EI algorithms...|$|R
