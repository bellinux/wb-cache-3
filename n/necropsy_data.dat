40|$|ABSTRACT A nutritionally adequate, {{purified}} diet {{was developed}} and used in studies to characterize selected aspects of laying hens in which fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) was induced by overfeeding. Hens consuming the diet ad libitum or intubated with the diet in quantities equivalent to usual daily energy intake maintained normal rates of lay, did not become obese, and did not develop liver hemorrhage. Overfed hens had a 33 % incidence of FLHS, {{as indicated by the}} presence of severe liver hemorrhage score, and displayed the full range of symptoms associated with spontaneous outbreaks of FLHS, including definitive lesions of hepatic reticulin. Among four groups of hens clinically classified according to rates of liver hemorrhage and egg production, there were no differences noted in total liver fat, liver fat concentration, or final body weight. Liver hemorrhage was associated with the degree of induction of liver lipogenic accessory enzymes. Serum enzyme activities indicate that overfed hens, unlike the overfed goose, retain hepatocellular membrane in-tegrity. Overfeeding caused altered reproductive performance in 72 % of hens. Alterations included erratic laying, increased incidence of double ovulations, shell defects, follicular collapse, and oviduct involution.

40|$|AIM: To {{develop a}} {{necropsy}} related audit system to record accurate information {{in relation to}} necropsy requests, necropsy rates and coronial referrals. METHODS: A simple audit form was used to record detailed <b>necropsy</b> related <b>data</b> via an integrated questionnaire design and data entry system based on available optical image scanning technology. The system recorded the numbers and locations of deaths, referrals to the coroner, clinical necropsy requests, hospital and medicolegal necropsies, the grade of clinician involved in these processes, and {{the identity of the}} consultant in charge of the case. The overall, hospital and medicolegal necropsy rates were calculated by individual consultant, specialty and for the whole hospital. Necropsy request rates and coronial referral rates were also calculated and these data were related to the grade of clinician. All data were available on a monthly or an accumulative basis. RESULTS: Of 1398 deaths, 534 (38 %) were discussed with the local coroner's office and 167 of these were accepted for further investigation. House officers and senior house officers referred over 80 % of all cases, whereas consultants referred only 2 %. There {{were no significant differences in}} case acceptance rates by grade of clinician. Clinicians made 307 hospital necropsy requests (overall hospital necropsy request rate 22 %). House officers made 65 % of all necropsy requests. Consultant necropsy requests represented 13 % of all requests. There were no significant differences in necropsy request success rates by grade of clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The referral of cases to coroners and clinical necropsy requests are still being inappropriately delegated to the most junior clinicians.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an outbreak of}} chronic Senecio spp. poisoning in grazing sheep in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, causing the death of 10 out of 860 adult sheep. Eight sick ewes were euthanized and necropsied. Cattle from this farm were also affected. Clinical signs included progressive weight loss, apathy and photosensitization. Four out of seven tested sheep had increased gamma-glutamyl transferase serum activity {{and two of them}} presented serum elevation of alkaline phosphatase. At necropsy, three out of eight ewes presented slightly irregular toughened livers with multifocal nodules, two out of eight ewes had a whitish liver with thickened fibrotic Glisson's capsule partially adhered to the diaphragm, and three out of eight ewes had smooth and grossly normal livers. Necropsy findings attributed to liver failure included hydropericardium (7 / 8), ascites (5 / 8), icterus (2 / 8), hydrothorax (1 / 8), and edema of mesentery (1 / 8). The main hepatic histological findings that allowed the establishment of the diagnosis were megalocytosis, proliferation of bile ducts and fibrosis.

40|$|While fairly {{accurate}} {{data for}} mortality rate and less reliable figures for morbidity rate for lung cancer {{are available in}} many Western countries, we have no such information in India. The reasons for this are obvious. In the first place, there is no separate column for lung cancer even in the morbidity returns regarding hospital admis-sions of the different States in the country. Secondly, {{it is a fact}} that even to-day there is no reliable machinery for the collection of vital data in India. Paucity of reliable reports regarding the incidence of lung cancer in India has led to the erroneous impression in other countries that the disease is rare in India. Doll (1953) has quoted Nath and Grewal (1935) and Gharpure (1948) as evidence of the extreme rarity of the disease. Banker (1955) has, however, corrected the statement made by Gharpure and shown that 22 cases in Gharpure's series which were shown to have chest cancer had in fact primary carcinoma of the lung. Banker studied <b>necropsy</b> <b>data</b> of 43 cases of lung cancer among 9, 210 consecutive necropsies and showed that primary cancer of the lung constituted 14. 4 %/, of cancer in all sites. Sirsat (1958) reported that at the Tata Memorial Hospital primary cancer of the lung constituted 1 % of all malignant tumours. Because there is a growing impression amongst physic. ans and surgeons that lung cancer is on the increase, a comprehensive epidemiological study is undoubtedly indicated.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a survey on the causes of moose (Alces alces) deaths at 19 European moose facilities. The age at death was recorded for 205 moose, {{and the cause of}} death for 131 adult animals. The "wasting syndrome complex" (WSC) [Shochat et al., 1997] was the single most important mortality factor in adult animals, being responsible for 47 % of all cases. Other important factors were intraspecific aggression (13 %) and malignant catarrhal fever (12 %). The number of deaths showed a peak at the age of 6 - 8 years. A similar peak was found in the age distribution of WSC cases only, suggesting an accumulative process that leads to the death of an animal once a threshold is reached. While the dominance of WSC is in accord with the American literature, the high incidence of intraspecific aggression found in this and other European surveys is not reported in North America. While in the North American literature the consumption of grass and grass products is regarded as the main factor triggering WSC, infection with whipworms (Trichuris spp.) and continuous reinfection through pasture grazing is emphasized as the main danger in Europe. Most reports of WSC in the literature concern animals that grazed in pasture-like enclosures. In no case was WSC triggered by controlled feeding of freshly cut grass fed to animals in holding pens.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State UniversityEast Coast Fever (ECF), {{caused by}} the apicomplexan parasite, Theileria parva, kills over a million cattle each year in sub-Saharan Africa. Cattle that develop ECF succumb to {{respiratory}} failure-induced pulmonary edema; however, the immunopathogenesis of these lesions is poorly understood. While Cape buffalo and cattle herds raised in T. parva endemic areas seem to develop innate resistance to disease and experience a low mortality rate, cattle herds newly introduced to regions with T. parva often experience up to a 90 % mortality rate. These findings led us to hypothesize that ECF results from immune dysregulation during acute infection in naÃ¯ve cattle. To test this hypothesis, we compared antemortem clinical pathology <b>data,</b> <b>necropsy</b> findings, and histopathology results from twenty African Boran calves and five Holstein calves infected with a lethal dose of T. parva. Infected cattle developed severe vasculitis of medium to large caliber vessels within the lungs and lymphoid organs. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that intralesional macrophages were positive for the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 17, and expressed the marker of alternative activation, CD 163. These findings, coupled with the antemortem clinical pathology results, suggest that ECF {{is a form of}} macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), an often-fatal form of immune dysregulation observed in many infectious diseases and neoplasia. In ECF, parasite-driven lymphoproliferation likely leads to secondary systemic macrophage activation syndrome, vasculitis, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure and death. These findings are discussed in Chapter 1. 	Following our discovery of the complexity of the immune response in acute T. parva, we began work to better characterize responding leukocyte populations and to define cellular phenotypes associated with both protection and harm in T. parva. Although cytotoxic CD 8 + T-cell responses specific for T. parva-infected cells correlate well with protection from T. parva challenge, other features of protective and detrimental immune responses have not yet been elucidated. To fill this gap, we developed flow-cytometric assays to assess cytotoxicity and cytokine production in bovine leukocytes. These assays enable concurrent, multi-parameter assessment of responding leukocytes, and will greatly enhance our understanding of the immune response to T. parva. The development and optimization of these assays is described in Chapter 2 Washington State University, Veterinary Microbiology and Patholog...|$|R

Havia esplenomegalia e, em alguns cÃ£es, petÃ©quias na superfÃ­cie capsular do baÃ§o. Aumento dos linfonodos mesentÃ©ricos e do timo foi observado. LesÃµes microscÃ³picas incluÃ­ram hemorragia e necrose multifocal em cÃ©lulas epiteliais tubulares renais, hepatÃ³citos e tecidos linfoides. Nos pulmÃµes, havia necrose alveolar multifocal acentuada com abundante material fibrinoso e infiltrado inflamatÃ³rio misto de intensidade variada. Ocasionais corpÃºsculos de inclusÃ£o intranucleares em Ã¡reas perifÃ©ricas Ã  necrose foram identificados em hepatÃ³citos, cÃ©lulas epiteliais de tÃºbulos renais e cÃ©lulas alveolares. Amostras de fÃ­gado, rim e pulmÃ£o foram positivas na imunofluorescÃªncia direta para herpesvÃ­rus canino tipo 1 (CHV- 1). O diagnÃ³stico de infecÃ§Ã£o por herpesvÃ­rus foi baseado nos achados de necropsia, histolÃ³gicos e de imunofluorescÃªncia positiva em tecidos usando anticorpo anti-CHV- 1. De nosso conhecimento, este Ã© o primeiro relato da identificaÃ§Ã£o do CHV- 1 no Brasil, embora achados clÃ­nico-patolÃ³gicos anteriores jÃ¡ sugerissem a presenÃ§a do agente na populaÃ§Ã£o canina do paÃ­s. The clinic and pathological findings and laboratorial testing of puppies with postmortem diagnosis of canine herpesvirus infection are described. The cases occurred in two households of Porto Alegre, RS, in April 2007 and July 2008. The puppies presented anorexia, depression, cry and dyspnea, followed by death about 24 - 72 {{hours after the}} onset of clinical signs. At necropsy multifocal pin point hemorrhages were observed in the kidneys. The liver was enlarged with petechiae and white foci on the surface. The lungs were red and did not collapse. The spleen was enlarged and, in some cases, with petechiae on the capsular surface. Mesenteric lymph nodes and thymus were enlarged. Microscopic lesions included hemorrhages and multifocal necrosis of the renal tubular epithelial cells, hepatocytes and lymphoid tissues. In the lungs there was severe multifocal alveolar necrosis with abundant fibrin deposits and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of variable intensity. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were identified in the periphery of necrotic areas in hepatocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells and alveolar cells. Samples of liver, kidney and lung were positive in the direct immunofluorescence test for canine herpes virus type 1 (CHV- 1). The diagnosis was based on epidemiological <b>data,</b> <b>necropsy</b> findings, histological lesions and positive immunofluorescence results using CHV- 1 antibody in tissue samples. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of the identification of CHV- 1 in Brazil, although previous clinic and pathological findings already suggested the presence of the virus in Brazilian canine population...|$|R
40|$|A presente dissertaÃ§Ã£o tem como objetivo geral analisar a atividade de trabalho dos necrotomistas do Departamento de Medicina Legal (DML) de uma capital do Nordeste brasileiro. Tal objetivo se desdobra nos seguintes objetivos especÃ­ficos: conhecer a organizaÃ§Ã£o e as condiÃ§Ãµes de trabalho dos necrotomistas; compreender de que maneira a estigmatizaÃ§Ã£o {{interfere}} na vida desses profissionais; detectar os traÃ§os de cooperaÃ§Ã£o e solidariedade que se manifestam em sua atividade de trabalho; lanÃ§ar luz sobre os riscos presentes nessa atividade; conhecer as estratÃ©gias que desenvolvem para lidar com a morte no seu cotidiano de trabalho; evidenciar se eles se sentem reconhecidos ou nÃ£o no seu trabalho. Participaram deste estudo os seis necrotomistas que atualmente compÃµem o quadro de profissionais do referido DML, sendo todos do sexo masculino, com idades variando entre 32 e 48 anos e tempo de serviÃ§o oscilando entre quatro e 23 anos. Do ponto de vista teÃ³rico, a PsicodinÃ¢mica do trabalho foi {{a principal}} abordagem utilizada, embora outras abordagens clÃ­nicas do trabalho tenham sido tambÃ©m convocadas. Quanto ao mÃ©todo, esta pesquisa se caracteriza por ser um estudo de campo, de natureza qualitativa, em que procurou-se combinar entrevistas semiestruturadas individuais e observaÃ§Ãµes sistemÃ¡ticas na sala de necrÃ³psias. Para a anÃ¡lise dos dados, a perspectiva adotada foi a anÃ¡lise de conteÃºdo por recorte de temas. Constatou-se que a organizaÃ§Ã£o real do trabalho dos necrotomistas Ã© marcada pela existÃªncia de algumas regras comuns, construÃ­das no exercÃ­cio da atividade. Destaca-se a precariedade das condiÃ§Ãµes de trabalho, o que traduz um investimento estatal incompatÃ­vel com as demandas desse Ã³rgÃ£o. Tais condiÃ§Ãµes, associadas a uma representaÃ§Ã£o social negativa do trabalho dos necrotomistas, que o situa no rol daquelas atividades tipificadas como trabalho sujo, repugnante, degradante, sÃ£o produtoras de um sofrimento adicional, que exigem desses trabalhadores, para alÃ©m dos esforÃ§os fÃ­sicos prÃ³prios dessa atividade, manobras psÃ­quicas para evitar resvalar no terreno do adoecimento psÃ­quico. Identificou-se que a relaÃ§Ã£o dos necrotomistas com os diversos riscos de sua atividade estÃ¡ mediada por estratÃ©gias defensivas individuais e coletivas, sem as quais a vivÃªncia do sofrimento e do medo se faria muito mais sentida. Sublinha-se, tambÃ©m, que trabalhar cotidianamente com mortes violentas constitui uma situaÃ§Ã£o potencialmente desestabilizante para esses profissionais, o que desperta a necessidade de construÃ§Ã£o de defesas emocionais e de elaboraÃ§Ãµes subjetivas, incitando a produÃ§Ã£o de formas possÃ­veis de vivenciar o mundo do trabalho e de recriar-se enquanto sujeito. Constatou-se, por fim, que se por um lado os necrotomistas percebem seu trabalho reconhecido pela direÃ§Ã£o do DML, pelos peritos, por eles mesmos e, menos frequentemente pelos familiares das vÃ­timas, por outro, o descaso do Estado, expresso em subinvestimentos em condiÃ§Ãµes tÃ©cnicas e em baixos salÃ¡rios, evidencia uma desvalorizaÃ§Ã£o da categoria. This dissertation aims at analyzing the work activity of necrotomists Department of Forensic Medicine (DMF) of a {{capital of the}} Brazilian Northeast. This goal unfolds in the following specific objectives: to know the organization and the working conditions of necrotomists; understand how stigma affects {{the lives of these}} professionals, detect traces of cooperation and solidarity manifested in their work activity; shed light about the risks present in such activity; know the strategies they develop to cope with death in their daily work; evidence if they feel recognized or not in his work. The study included six necrotomists that currently make up the cadre of that DMF, being all male, aged between 32 and 48 years and length of service ranging from four to 23 years. From a theoretical standpoint, the psychodynamics of work was the main approach used, although other clinical approaches to work have also been summoned. As for the method, this research is characterized by a field study of a qualitative nature, in which he sought to combine individual semi-structured interviews and systematic observations at <b>necropsy</b> room. For <b>data</b> analysis, the perspective adopted was content analysis by clipping issues. It was found that the actual organization of the work of necrotomists is marked by the existence of some common rules, built in exercise activity. Highlights the precariousness of working conditions, which represents a state investment incompatible with the demands of the organ. These conditions, combined with a representation of the negative social work necrotomists, which situates the list of those activities graded dirty work, disgusting, degrading, produce additional suffering, requiring these workers, in addition to physical exertion own this activity, psychic maneuvers to avoid slipping on the grounds of mental illness. It was found that the relationship of necrotomists with the various risks of their activity is mediated by individual and collective defensive strategies, without which the experience of suffering and fear would be much felt. It is emphasized, too, that work daily with violent deaths is a potentially destabilizing for these professionals, which arouses the need for building emotional defenses and elaborations subjective, urging the production of possible ways of experiencing the world of work and recreate itself as subject. It was noted, finally, that if on one hand the necrotomistas perceive their work recognized by the direction of DMF, by experts, by themselves, and less frequently by the families of the victims, on the other, the indifference of the State, expressed in underinvestment in technical conditions and low wages, shows a depreciation of the category...|$|R
40|$|Published {{studies of}} wild {{vertebrate}} populations have almost universally reported positive associations between genetic variation measured at microsatellite loci and fitness, creating {{the impression of}} ubiquity {{both in terms of}} the species and the traits involved. However, there is concern that this picture may be misleading because negative results frequently go unpublished. Here, we analyse the relationship between genotypic variation at nine highly variable microsatellite loci and neonatal fitness in 1070 Antarctic fur seal pups born at Bird Island, South Georgia. Despite our relatively large sample size, we find no significant association between three different measures of heterozygosity and two fitness traits, birth weight and survival. Furthermore, increasing genetic resolution by calculating parental relatedness also yields no association between genetic variation and fitness. Our findings are consistent with <b>necropsy</b> <b>data</b> showing that most pups die from starvation or trauma, conditions that are unlikely to be influenced strongly by genetic factors, particularly if the benefits of high heterozygosity are linked to immune-related genes. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Feline lungworms {{belonging}} to the Troglostrongylus genus have been neglected for a long time. However, recent reports of Troglostrongylus brevior and Troglostrongylus subcrenatus in domestic cats have stimulated {{the interest of the}} scientific community on these lungworms. Troglostrongylus spp. have an indirect life cycle, which overlaps that of the better known Aelurostrongylus abstrusus. Nonetheless, adult worms of both genera have a distinct morphology and localization within the respiratory system of definitive hosts and, potentially, a different epidemiology and pathogenicity. As copromicroscopy has a low specificity for metastrongyloids due to the similarities of first-stage larvae, specific morphometrical keys and/or PCR diagnostic tools are advocated. Accordingly, more clinical studies and <b>necropsy</b> <b>data</b> are needed to elucidate the impact of Troglostrongylus spp. on the health of domestic cats. This article reviews current information on Troglostrongylus spp. as well as data on their occurrence in Europe and reports specific key morphological characters for the identification of adults and larvae, which is important to refine their diagnosis and for {{a better understanding of the}} feline lungworm infections...|$|E

40|$|The veal {{industry}} is specialized in rearing male calves {{on a low}} iron milk diet, hereby obtaining white meat. As in other food animals, high levels of antimicrobial resistance have recently been detected in bacteria from veal calves, potentially threatening treatment options in both human as veterinary medicine. This worrisome observation is currently overwhelming veterinary medicine and revisions of current treatment practices (benchmarking) and the prudent use of antimicrobials in food animals are highly recommended by the European authorities. As a general introduction (Chapter 1. 1.), {{an overview of the}} typical characteristics and challenges of the Belgian white veal {{industry is}} given. A synthesis of the current knowledge on antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic, zoonotic and commensal bacteria from veal calves is provided. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) {{is the leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality in young animals in almost every cattle production system worldwide. BRD is a multifactorial disease resulting from the complex interaction of pathogens with host factors (immunity) and the environment, and is therefore also termed bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). The BRDC differs in between production systems, and knowledge on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of BRD in each production system is necessary, in order to determine effective control measures for that particular production system. In chapter 1. 2. an overview of the constitution of the BRDC in veal calves is given. From this literature review it could be concluded that, under the current organization of the industry, veal calves are at ultra-high risk of developing BRD, making antimicrobial use necessary to overcome disease. Hardly any information on the pathogens involved in the BRDC of veal calves is available. For economic reasons and due to a lack of epidemiological knowledge on diseases in veal calves, veterinarians have been tied to empiric, often blind, treatment in the veal industry for decades. In line with this problematic situation and with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, the overall objective of this doctoral thesis was to gain insights into current practices, into the epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in the Belgian white veal industry and into the underlying pathogens of respiratory disease (Chapter 2). This to provide the industry with objective data from where to install and evaluate sustainable preventive and therapeutic protocols, using less antimicrobials, in the future. At present, no information on drug use in white veal calves in Belgium is available. Therefore, the first objective was to document antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory drug use in the Belgian veal industry (Chapter 3). A prospective study was installed, monitoring group and individual drug use on 15 veal cohorts in Belgium. Treatment incidences (TI) based on animal defined daily dose (ADD), prescribed daily dose (PDD) and used daily dose (UDD) were calculated. Antimicrobial drug use was highly intensive, with on average 416. 8 ADD per 1000 animals at risk. Antimicrobial drug use consisted for 95. 8 % of oral group treatments, and only for 4. 2 % of individual administrations. BRD was the main indication for both group (53. 0 %) and individual drug use. The most frequently used antimicrobials (group treatments) were oxytetracycline (23. 7 %), amoxicillin (18. 5 %), tylosin (17. 2 %) and colistin (15. 2 %). Deviations from the leaflet recommendations were frequently encountered, with 47. 3 % of the group treatments underdosed (predominantly oxytetracycline and tylosin to treat dysbacteriosis). Based on the UDD, smaller integrations (less than 50 herds) used more antimicrobials than larger ones. Producers used higher dosages in group treatments than prescribed by the veterinarian in cohorts with a single caretaker. A large variety of antimicrobial compounds were used for individual treatments, including the critically important cephalosporins (8. 0 %) and fluoroquinolones (12. 6 %). Individual treatments were generally overdosed. Anti-inflammatory drugs were far less frequently used (TIUDD= 5. 94), mostly sodium salicylic acid in group treatments. Individually administered anti-inflammatory drugs were generally overdosed. The main conclusion was that antimicrobial drug use is highly intensive at present and that future reduction can only be achieved by reducing the number of oral group treatments. In a second study (Chapter 4. 1.), the objective was to determine the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy, beef and crossbred white veal production in Belgium. A total of 5853 calves, housed in 15 production cohorts (5 per breed), were followed during one production cycle. Causes of mortality were determined by necropsy. Morbidity was daily recorded by the producers. The total mortality risk was 5, 3 % and was significantly higher in beef veal production compared to dairy or crossbreds. The main causes of mortality were pneumonia (1. 3 % of the calves at risk), ruminal disorders (0. 7 %), idiopathic peritonitis (0. 5 %), enterotoxaemia (0. 5 %) and enteritis (0. 4 %). Idiopathic peritonitis was identified as a disease of unknown origin, specifically occurring around 8 - 10 weeks after arrival. Belgian Blue beef calves were more likely to die from pneumonia, enterotoxaemia and arthritis. Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) at necropsy was associated with chronic pneumonia and pleuritis. Of the calves, 25. 4 % was treated individually and the morbidity rate was 1. 7 cases per 1000 calf days at risk. The incidence rate of respiratory disease, diarrhea, arthritis and otitis was 0. 95, 0. 30, 0. 11 and 0. 07 cases per 1000 calf days at risk, respectively. Morbidity peaked in the first three weeks after arrival and gradually declined towards the end of the production cycle. BRD already occurred immediately after arrival, but peaked 3 weeks after arrival. A long tail in the treatment curve was observed, associated with chronic pneumonia (relapse rate= 10. 2 % on average). It could be concluded that, whereas the group of digestive diseases was responsible for most mortalities, BRD was the single leading cause. BRD was also the main cause of morbidity, and a long tail of chronic disease, associated with BVDV at necropsy, was observed. Next, the impact of BRD, diarrhea, otitis and arthritis on mortality and carcass traits was studied in a sample of 3519 white veal calves (10 cohorts) (Chapter 4. 2.). Disease registration was based on individual treatment by the producer and cause of death was determined by <b>necropsy.</b> Carcass <b>data</b> (hot carcass weight (HCW), color and fatness degree) were obtained from the slaughter houses. Average daily gain (ADG), carcass value (CV) and CV reduced by treatment costs were calculated. In comparison to non-treated calves, calves treated once for BRD showed a 0. 066 kg/day reduction in ADG and 8. 2 kg reduction of HCW, had a lower carcass value, a lower fatness degree and an increased mortality risk. The reduction in ADG, HCW, CV, fatness degree and the mortality risk increased dramatically with increasing number of BRD treatments. Calves treated multiple times for BRD also had higher odds for low carcass quality and were more likely to be classified as too red meat for white veal production. Arthritis increased the mortality risk, but reduced HCW only when associated with BRD. Otitis did not affect any of the studied parameters. Diarrhea increased the mortality risk, reduced ADG and HCW by 0. 078 kg/day and 8. 8 kg, respectively, and decreased carcass quality. It could be concluded that even under intensive coverage by oral antimicrobial group treatments, substantial economic losses occur in calves, which require individual treatment for BRD, diarrhea or arthritis. Controlling calf health by effective preventive and therapeutic strategies and in particular the prevention of chronic BRD is key for the profitability of veal operations. Because of the importance of BRD in morbidity, mortality and the associated drug use, further focus was on the identification of the pathogens involved in the BRDC of white veal calves in Belgium. In a fourth study (Chapter 5. 1.), the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in diseased, unvaccinated, routinely medicated veal calves was determined, by sampling 24 natural outbreaks of BRD in Belgium (15 herds). Bacteria were cultured from nasopharyngeal swabs and seroconversion against viruses and Mycoplasma bovis was determined on paired sera. The inclusion criterion for sampling, was 10 % of the animals with respiratory symptoms. Most outbreaks (75 %) occurred between week 2 and 4 after arrival. In 54. 2 % of the outbreaks (13 / 24), antimicrobial group treatments for BRD had already been installed before the sampling criterion was reached, and in 29. 2 % (7 / 24) calves were still receiving oral antimicrobials at sampling. At the individual calf level, Mycoplasma spp., Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida were retrieved from 70. 5 %, 21. 5 % and 26. 0 % of the swabs, respectively. At the herd level the presence of M. bovis could be confirmed on 84. 6 % of the examined herds. Serological evidence of BVDV, parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI- 3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine adenovirus 3 (BAV- 3), bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1) infection was present on 71. 4 %, 53. 3 %, 40. 0 %, 46. 7 %, 30. 0 % and 26. 7 % of the herds, respectively. At necropsy, Mycoplasma spp. could be cultured from 61. 9 % of pneumonic lungs (n= 21) and respectively 60. 0 % and 20. 0 % of the tested calves were BVDV (n= 20) and BRSV (n= 16) PCR positive. It can be concluded that BRD in white veal calves is of slow progressive nature rather than massive acute outbreaks, likely due to the presence of maternal immunity and the frequently applied metaphylactic antimicrobial therapy. Under such conditions the peak incidence is reached on average at week 3 post arrival. At that time, next to a variable viral component in the individual calf, (multi) resistant Pasteurellaceae are prevalent. Overall, M. bovis and BVDV appear to play an important role in both the initiation of BRD (acute outbreak) as in lethal chronic cases. In a final study (Chapter 5. 2.), the seroepidemiology of respiratory infections along the white veal production cycle and their association with BRD and carcass traits was determined. Also, the potential value of total and respiratory pathogen specific antibody levels at arrival to predict subsequent BRD and suboptimal carcass traits was evaluated. A total of 467 calves, housed in 15 veal herds, were sampled at arrival and 6, 12 and 24 weeks later. Antibody levels to 7 respiratory pathogens were determined at each time point by semi-quantitative ELISA. Circulation of PI- 3, BAV- 3 and M. bovis was detected in all studied herds. For BVDV, BRSV, BHV- 1 and M. haemolytica 93. 3 % (13 / 15), 80. 0 % (12 / 15), 53. 3 % (8 / 15) and 86. 7 % (13 / 15) of the herds were infected, respectively. The respiratory disease peak in the first 6 weeks after arrival was associated with seroconversion to M. bovis (44. 2 % of the calves) and BVDV (32. 0 %). More than 50 % of the calves seroconverted to at least one virus in this period, whereas seroconversion to M. haemolytica was not associated with the BRD peak. The prevalence of calves, persistently (PI) and transiently infected with BVDV, was 0. 6 % and 1. 5 %, respectively. PI calves had very low survival chances. With exception of M. bovis (10, 7 % of the calves on average), maternal antibodies were abundantly present at arrival for most pathogens, with little variation between herds. A worrisome 40. 1 % of the calves on average, ranging from 24. 0 to 59. 9 %, had low total IgG levels at arrival, suggesting failure of passive transfer. Calves, seropositive to PI- 3 and M. bovis at arrival, had a decreased and increased risk for BRD, respectively. Low (< 8 g/L) total IgG at arrival tended towards an increased BRD risk. No associations with carcass traits were found. Under the current medical management, the serostatus for respiratory pathogens at arrival was of little practical use to classify veal calves according to BRD risk or to predict carcass traits. To help improve the validity of epidemiological studies in the veal industry, standard case definitions should be provided and group antimicrobial treatments avoided. In the general discussion (Chapter 6), first, the value of the applied study methodology for veal calf health monitoring systems and future holistic studies is discussed. With the obtained insights into the epidemiology of veal calf diseases (predominantly BRD) in mind, the general discussion mainly aimed at critically reflecting on the current (medical) management practices. A series of possible short and long term measures to control BRD and reduce antimicrobial use, to be evaluate in the future, is proposed. Overall, it could be concluded that BRD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in veal calves and subsequently the main indication for the highly intensive drug use in the Belgian veal industry. Despite the frequent antimicrobial coverage, the economic consequences of disease in calves requiring individual treatment were devastating. Almost every BRD pathogen was present on each herd, with a viral component in over 50 % of the calves. Overall M. bovis and BVDV were most prevalent in acute and chronic BRD in white veal calves. The high prevalence of calves with insufficient levels of IgG at arrival is worrisome and requires attention at the herds of origin. Both the applied monitoring techniques as the obtained results can guide the veal industry in their search for evidence based preventive and therapeutic protocols, reducing antimicrobial use, while maintaining production results and animal welfare standards. More in specific, modifying current medical management towards M. bovis, exclusion of PI animals from veal production, vaccination and optimization of maternal immunity might be beneficial measures to reduce the BRD incidence and herewith associated antimicrobial use in veal calves...|$|R

The technique is reliable but by no means infallible and it should not be regarded as a final diagnostic work-up. Its value lies in selecting patients with thyroid nodules for surgery. In the present series of 304 patients, 79 underwent operation and 37 malignancies were found. The incidence of malignancy among the surgically excised nodules was 47 %, in contrast to 14 % in the past. We estimated that 268 operations would be required to salvage the same number of malignancies without the use of fine needle aspiration biopsy. Whether one should excise a "cold " thyroid nodule or manage it conservatively is a question that con-tinues to provoke controversy. 1 - 3 The main reason for such a problem to exist is that thyroid nodules are common while the incidence of thyroid cancer is low.
