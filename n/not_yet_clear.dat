5|$|Studies of {{children}} who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not.

5|$|The vulcanoids are a {{hypothetical}} population of asteroids that orbit the Sun in a dynamically stable zone inside {{the orbit of}} the planet Mercury.

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear,</b> and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The names at {{that point}} {{remained}} unofficial, but in 2016 the IAU organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardise proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognised the names of exoplanets and their host stars that were produced by the competition. Epsilon Eridani is now listed as Ran in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

5|$|India {{had been}} {{approached}} {{as a possible}} customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968, but had declined, partly {{on the grounds that}} it was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear</b> if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service. India had already its Marut fighter-bomber, and tried to upgrade it with new engines, until the new project collapsed. A decade later IAF would become the largest single export customer, with a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the local name Shamsher ("Sword of Justice").|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear</b> whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces {{make and break}} contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear</b> if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E

5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear.</b> Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide bonds, are sufficient to inhibit degradation. The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size, either at the protein terminus or internally, has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, it is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear</b> {{whether the}} {{citizenship}} rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly {{available to them}} as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms {{does not apply to}} all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC régime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.|$|E
5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate {{guarding}} {{during the period}} females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly {{on the side and}} following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear</b> to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.|$|E
5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>clear</b> whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
