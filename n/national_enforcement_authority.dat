In addition, more surveillance activities by authorities are needed to find out whether the information on the SVHC contents in the suppliers’ responses is correct or not. Fines or other enforcing measures that are already foreseen in legislation as described above should be applied to increase compliance. If consumers make informed purchasing choices and prefer SVHC-free articles, companies could profit from the competitive advantage using the information duty and the efforts to substitute SVHCs for a transparent and trustworthy communication with consumers.|$|R

30|$|In this article, {{the authors}} have {{evaluated}} the development, challenges, and limitations to implementation of REACH in the occupational setting {{in order to examine}} to what extent the REACH ‘ideals’ can be achieved. In some respects, this has proven challenging because of the current ‘state of the art’ with REACH as well as knowledge and experience of those implementing the legislation. There is clearly ambiguity in the minds of some regarding the application of REACH in their business aspects, and concerns that the legislation is placing a disproportionate burden on industry. The regulation is still at an early stage of implementation after 6 years and not all of the tools have fully been used or exploited to their full potential. Quality control processes like dossier evaluation, substance evaluation and regulatory processes like SVHC identification, authorisation and restriction have just started. Some inherent legal aspects of the process may hinder to reach the objectives in relation to health and safety at work, especially competing objectives and those provisions that narrow the scope of REACH. By the establishment of raised awareness, good work practices, improved communication, further guidelines, and decisions of the <b>national</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authorities</b> as well as the European Court of Justice compliance problems will be reduced. Therefore, the authors are confident that with more routine experience of the REACH processes and with support from all parties involved, improvements in workplace health and safety standards can be achieved although the outlined ‘ideal REACH world’ cannot be achieved.|$|R
50|$|Phoolan {{leads her}} new gang with courage, generosity, humility and shrewdness. Her {{stockpile}} and her legend grows. She becomes known as Phoolan Devi, the bandit queen. In February 1981, Baba Mustakim informs {{her of a}} large wedding in Behmai, with Thakur Shri Ram in attendance. As Phoolan departs, Baba Mustakim warns her to remain low key. Phoolan attacks the wedding party and her gang exacts revenge from the entire Thakur clan of Behmai. They round up the men and beat them up. Many of the men are finally shot. This act of vengeance brings her {{to the attention of}} the <b>national</b> law <b>enforcement</b> <b>authorities</b> (in New Delhi). The top police officials now begin a massive manhunt for Phoolan, and Thakur Shri Ram relishes the opportunity to come to their aid.|$|R
30|$|The REACH {{information}} {{right for}} consumers about candidate list substances {{has been in}} force now for nearly 10  years and several studies have revealed since, {{that a large number}} of suppliers do not fulfill their obligations as foreseen. The data presented show that some companies take their responsibility for a trustful communication with the consumer seriously and have a very ambitious management system for minimizing dangerous substances in their production chains. On the other hand, the quality of answers received by the majority of suppliers is still insufficient. This indicates that the situation has apparently not improved satisfactorily. The aims of the REACH ‘right to know’ are ambitious, but apparently many suppliers are not aware of their communication duty and the concomitant advantages for them. There are also some doubts whether all suppliers’ answers are correct. The number of respondents who announce that their articles contain more than 0.1 % of an SVHC is extremely low considering the targeted choice of articles in the present study, while publicly available data indicate that a lot of consumer articles today still contain SVHCs above the threshold of 0.1 %. Without chemical analysis, it is not possible to decide whether the answers received are correct or not. Such checks are under the responsibility of the <b>national</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authorities.</b> Companies could be fined if they do not meet their information duties. In Germany, the fines foreseen for administrative offence are up to 50.000 Euros [45], but apparently such a sanction has not been imposed so far. Competent authorities call also for sanctions in cases where the company did not act with due diligence and relied on the information received by the supplier without making sufficient efforts to find out whether this information is correct [12]. Reasonable diligence would furthermore include the duty to consider information in the press, data published by consumer organizations, news about article recalls due to SVHCs, or knowledge about the expected presence of SVHCs in a certain article group or material. Due diligence can also include analytical testing commissioned by the company. Companies that provided wrong information about the SVHC content in their articles are required by law to pay for costs resulting from analytical surveillance tests by the <b>enforcement</b> <b>authorities</b> [12].|$|R
