5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Strategic Hamlet Program and the {{intensified}} military operations of 1962, the events at Ap Bac placed additional pressure on Diem's government because they showed it was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> {{to cope with the}} resurgence of the Viet Cong, particularly in the Mekong delta.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the Lithuanians were <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> {{to accept}} Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had {{little impact on}} further developments. The {{majority}} of the population and the nobility remained pagan; his subjects were not required to convert. The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice of Christianity and intermarriage were well tolerated.|$|E

50|$|The self-as-target bias {{is another}} closely linked {{phenomenon}} with the spotlight effect. This concept describes when someone believes that events are disproportionately directed towards him or herself. For example, {{if a student}} had an assignment due in class and did <b>not</b> <b>prepare</b> {{as well as they}} should have, the student may start to panic and think that simply because they did <b>not</b> <b>prepare</b> well, the teacher will know and call on them for answers.|$|R
5|$|On 28 July 1914, the First World War began; On 4 August, Germany invaded Belgium and the United Kingdom {{entered the}} war to uphold the Treaty of London (1839). Britain faced a {{continental}} war it was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to fight; the Expeditionary Force was dispatched but the country lacked the forces required for the protracted war envisioned by the military leadership.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} four ships was plagued with {{difficulties}} as the Soviet shipbuilding and related industries were <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to build such large ships. One battleship, Sovetskaya Belorussiya, was cancelled on 19 October 1940 after serious construction flaws were found. Construction {{of the other three}} ships was suspended shortly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, and never resumed. All three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the news}} that Stephen was {{gathering}} support in England, the Norman nobility had gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring his elder brother Theobald king. The Normans argued that the count, as the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the Duchy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen's coronation was to occur the next day. Theobald's support immediately ebbed away, as the barons were <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to implement changes {{over the objections of}} his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E
5|$|Henry II died in 1189 and was {{succeeded by}} Richard I. Rhys {{considered}} {{that he was}} no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Gower and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.|$|E

5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for.|$|E
5|$|Neither paramountcy nor the {{subsidiary}} alliances {{could continue}} after Indian independence. The British took {{the view that}} {{because they had been}} established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan. At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.|$|E

The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed it was discovered that No. 46233 would require a new firebox tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to spend further money at this time and the engine became a static exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E

During the service, CeCe's dress is ruined when Jim changes her diaper. Jim scrambles to replace the gown, and CeCe is eventually baptized in an Arcade Fire T-shirt he found in the back of his car. At the end of the mass, the minister announces there will be a reception hosted by Jim and Pam, who panic because the reception was for family only and they are <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for so many guests.|$|E

5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E
5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> {{for such}} an attack. French {{soldiers}} had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The second {{element of}} the {{auxiliary}} forces was the Yeomanry, 38 regiments of volunteer cavalry which had historically {{been used as a}} form of internal security police, deployed to suppress local riots and provide a show of force to support the authorities. Recruits to the force were usually personally wealthy, providing their own horses and uniforms, and units were often heavily bankrolled by their senior officers. Training requirements were low, with an annual eight-day camp. The regiments were liable to be called out for defence against an invasion or an insurrection, and were <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for effective mobilisation; the units possessed no transport resources, or even a designated quartermaster.|$|E
