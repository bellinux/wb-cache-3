5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the <b>natural</b> <b>father.</b> However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E
5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled after those of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and not just at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his <b>natural</b> <b>father</b> were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E

Marseille initially assumed {{the name of his}} stepfather at school (a matter he had a difficult time accepting) but he reverted to his father's name of Marseille in adulthood. He acquired the reputation of being a rebel from a lack of discipline, a characteristic that plagued him early on in his Luftwaffe career. Marseille also had a difficult relationship with his <b>natural</b> <b>father</b> whom he refused to visit in Hamburg for some time after the divorce. Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father, who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that was to initially hamper his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe. However, the rapproachment with his father did not last and he did not see him again thereafter.|$|E

5|$|After {{the divorce}} was finalized, Boyce courted Virginia Dorcas Lee, a vocalist from Oak Park, Illinois, who was 23years his junior and the eldest child of Virginia and John Adams Lee, a former Lieutenant Governor of Missouri. Both Virginia's parents and Boyce's son Ben opposed the relationship. In May 1910, after the planned {{marriage}} was announced, an infuriated Ben scuffled with his father outside the Blackstone Hotel and Boyce sustained a facial wound. Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $5 and court costs. Two days later, Boyce and Virginia married and went to Europe on an extended honeymoon. Almost immediately, there was speculation amongst family members and in newspapers about problems within the marriage. On April 9, 1911, Boyce and Virginia had a daughter, whom they named Virginia. A few months later, in December 1911, Boyce signed an agreement to support and educate their infant daughter. After Boyce's wife filed for divorce in March 1912, she moved to Santa Barbara, California, with their daughter and her parents. Boyce did not contest the divorce and arranged for a $100,000 settlement. Years later, the elder Virginia married Richard Roberts, a New York banker, and moved with her and Boyce's daughter to Greenwich, Connecticut. The younger Virginia took the surname Roberts. She did not meet her <b>natural</b> <b>father,</b> Boyce, until she was eight years old.|$|E

60|$|Sect. 76. Thus the <b>natural</b> <b>fathers</b> of families, by an insensible change, {{became the}} politic monarchs of them too: {{and as they}} chanced to live long, and leave able and worthy heirs, for several successions, or otherwise; so they laid the {{foundations}} of hereditary, or elective kingdoms, under several constitutions and mannors, according as chance, contrivance, or occasions happened to mould them. But if princes have their titles in their fathers right, and it be a sufficient proof of the <b>natural</b> right of <b>fathers</b> to political authority, because they commonly were those in whose hands we find, de facto, the exercise of government: I say, if this argument be good, it will as strongly prove, that all princes, nay princes only, ought to be priests, since it is as certain, that in the beginning, {{the father of the}} family was priest, as that he was ruler in his own houshold.|$|R
40|$|Actual genetic ties do {{not always}} establish, or even help to establish, legal {{paternity}} of children born of consensual sex, that is, male parental rights and/or duties as {{of the time of}} birth. Paternity status, typically governed by state law, is often dependent upon the marital status of the mothers, or the nonsex acts of men preconception, prebirth, or shortly after birth. For example, husbands of mothers are often deemed parents at birth because genetic ties are presumed. Thus, for nonmarital children born to certain married women, legal paternity is not founded on actual genetic ties. Similarly, actual male genetic ties may not lead to paternity when children are born of sex to unmarried women. Again preconception, prebirth or at birth conduct may be important. The 1983 United States Supreme Court decision in Lehr v. Robertson recognizes that American states can require <b>natural</b> <b>fathers,</b> at least in the adoption setting, to do more than prove genetic ties in order to acquire paternity. When such fathers do enough, they acquire “substantial” federal constitutional childrearing interests so that any proposed adoption requires their consent. When such fathers do not do enough, Lehr allows states to deny them legal parentage. Lehr does forbid states from omitting too many <b>natural</b> <b>fathers</b> from governmental schemes for eliminating parental interests. And Lehr does not forbid a state, at least within adoption, from designating legal paternity for a nonmarital child in a man with no genetic ties. Many American states, in fact, say that genetic ties alone are an insufficient basis for legal paternity. And, within adoption, and often elsewhere, states recognize childrearing interests in nonmarital children for certain nongenetic fathers. The U. S. Supreme Court has said little since Lehr about male parentage under law for nonmarital children born of sex. It has, however, spoken on legal paternity for children of married mothers whose husbands are not the genetic fathers, a different breed of nonmarital children. In Michael H. v. Gerald D. in 1989, the court recognized that an American state could create an irrebuttable presumption of genetic ties in a husband for a child born during marriage where the marriage remains intact after birth and the married couple chooses to raise the child. After reviewing Lehr and Michael H., we find the Lehr guidelines have not been properly followed in and outside of adoption, including safe haven and custody/visitation settings. We also review American paternity laws in child support, torts and inheritance settings where male childrearing is not always at issue. Along the way we explore the possible expansion of Lehr’s childrearing opportunity interests in children born of sex to those uninvolved in sex. We conclude that Lehr rights should be expanded to <b>natural</b> <b>fathers</b> outside adoption and to certain nongenetic parents, including both women and men...|$|R

25|$|In Dune, the Bene Gesserit {{breeding}} scheme is, in theory, to {{have come}} to full fruition from the union of an Atreides daughter (planned to be born of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the Duke Leto Atreides) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, nephew of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (himself secretly the <b>natural</b> <b>father</b> of the Lady Jessica). This plan is disrupted when Jessica chooses to conceive an Atreides son rather than the daughter she had been ordered to produce. This son, Paul Atreides, later proves to be the Kwisatz Haderach, born a generation early. Political intrigue results in Paul's rise to power as Emperor of the Known Universe, secured by his stranglehold on the melange supply. A decade later, in Dune Messiah, the Bene Gesserit are frustrated {{to be at the}} mercy of their own creation, but a conspiracy to remove Paul from power fails. He realizes, however, that while prescience grants knowledge, absolute control of outcomes is not possible due to interference patterns caused by their own actions. Despising the religion that has risen up around him and seeing where it will lead, Paul walks into the desert seeking death in hopes that he can change the course of the future. Paul's son Leto II is also a Kwisatz Haderach; seeing the same future, Leto decides to do what his father could not. He takes control of both the empire and the Bene Gesserit breeding program in Children of Dune, and begins his own transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid to give himself the time he needs for his Golden Path to be fully realized. Thirty-five hundred years later, his breeding plan produces Siona Atreides, the first in a line of humans who are able to disappear from prescient sight, and Leto allows himself to be assassinated. After 1,500 more years (as chronicled in Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune), the Bene Gesserit have restored their breeding program. However, they are too terrified of the consequences of producing another Kwisatz Haderach, so instead breed for special individuals of great talent and usefulness in order to amplify certain human characteristics and preserve them. Now aware of Leto's Golden Path, the Bene Gesserit widen their goals of advancing humanity and saving it from extinction.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tradition}} of differentiating between the {{coat of arms}} proper and a lozenge granted to women did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, usually men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father or mother or even both (or {{a member of a}} clan who had adopted them). But also men or women could permanently adopt the arms of their wives or husbands and transmit them to their children even after remarriages. The brisure was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat(s) of arms of their parent(s) and transmit them to all their children. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had adopted a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the trend of the nobility titled marrying [...] "commoners" [...] and passing on their title to their spouse and children, forbidden in the Middle Ages. An illegitimate child could adopt her/his mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but was often adopted and raised by the <b>natural</b> <b>father's</b> family, thereby acquiring the father's surname and title.|$|R
