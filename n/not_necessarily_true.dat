The donkey walk and the Great Blessing of Waters on Epiphany were {{the two most important}} Muscovite court ceremonies, emphasizing the tsar's respect for the Orthodox Church, projecting an image (<b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true)</b> of harmony in politics. Similar rituals in other cities existed until 1678 until Moscow monopolized the ritual. The tradition was abolished by Peter I.|$|E
25|$|Discussing ethical issues, Ruse {{distinguishes between}} {{involuntary}} inclination and willful behavior, arguing that while a homosexual orientation is morally blameless, this is <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true</b> of homosexual behavior. Ruse finds {{no justification for}} homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity, but nevertheless maintains on utilitarian grounds {{that people should be}} free to be promiscuous. He criticizes ethical arguments that appeal to scientific claims about the naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexuality, for example the views of the Greek philosopher Plato, according to whom homosexual behavior did not occur in animals. Ruse finds this claim to be mistaken, and dismisses the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. Ruse argues that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian theories of the just state must affirm the moral worth of homosexual relationships and support equal rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals.|$|E

25|$|The Irgun sent {{warnings}} by telephone, {{including one}} to the hotel's own switchboard, which, possibly because hoax bomb warnings were rife at the time, the staff decided to ignore, but none directly to the British authorities. From {{the fact that a}} bomb search had already been carried out, it appears that a hoax call or tip-off had been received at the hotel earlier that day. Subsequent telephone calls from a concerned Palestine Post staff member and the police caused increasing alarm, and the hotel manager was notified. In the closing minutes before the explosion, he called an unknown British officer, but no evacuation was ordered. Controversy has arisen over the timing and adequacy of the warnings and, based on the <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true</b> assumption that {{the number of people in}} the blast zone would have been reduced, the reasons why the hotel was not evacuated.|$|E
25|$|Though Newsweek {{reported}} that the FBI had a file regarding Gamergate, no arrests have been made nor charges filed, {{and parts of the}} FBI investigation into the threats had been closed in September 2015 {{due to a lack of}} leads. Former FBI supervisory special agent for cybercrimes, Tim Ryan, stated that cyberharassment cases are a low priority for authorities because it is difficult to track down the perpetrator and they have lower penalties compared to other crimes they are tasked to enforce. In June 2015, the US Supreme Court ruled in Elonis v. United States that harassing messages sent online are <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true</b> threats that would be prosecutable under criminal law and, according to Pacific Standard, this poses a further challenge in policing Gamergate-related harassment. However, the Court's decision also suggested that if threats made over social media were found to be true threats, they should be treated the same as threats made in other forms of communication.|$|E
25|$|It was {{probably}} {{around this time}} that Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered St Paul's Cathedral. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied the architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of Bernini, the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, {{he made his first}} design for St Paul's. A week later, however, the Great Fire destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of 51 churches; however, it is <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true</b> to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.|$|E

25|$|While the IRB was {{instrumental}} in the establishment of the Volunteers, they were never able to gain complete control of the organisation. This was compounded after John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, took an active interest. Though some well known Redmond supporters had joined the Volunteers, the attitude of Redmond and the Party was largely one of opposition, though by the Summer of 1914, it was clear the IPP needed to control the Volunteers if they were not to be a threat to their authority. The majority of the IV members, like the nation as a whole, were supporters of Redmond (though this was <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true</b> of the organisation's leadership), and, armed with this knowledge, Redmond sought IPP influence, if not outright control of the Volunteers. Negotiations between MacNeil and Redmond over the latter's future role continued inconclusively for several weeks, until on 9 June Redmond issued an ultimatum, through the press, demanding the Provisional Committee co-opt twenty-five IPP nominees. With several IPP members and their supporters on the committee already, this would give them a majority of seats, and effective control.|$|E
500|$|Putnam's best-known work {{concerns}} {{philosophy of}} mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers {{published in the}} late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability.

[...] Pain, according to Putnam's papers, may correspond to utterly different physical states {{of the nervous system}} in different organisms, and yet they all experience the same mental state of [...] "being in pain".|$|E
500|$|Like other {{precipitation}} in cumulonimbus clouds, hail {{begins as}} water droplets. As the droplets rise {{and the temperature}} goes below freezing, they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei. A cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure. [...] This means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers, alternating with layers that are thin, white and opaque. [...] Former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents, falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted. [...] This up and down motion {{was thought to be}} responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone. [...] New research, based on theory as well as field study, has shown this is <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E

Gaskin {{challenges}} the first {{premise of the}} argument from moral objectivity, arguing {{that it must be}} shown why absolute and objective morality entails that morality is commanded by God, rather than simply a human invention. [...] It could be the consent of humanity that gives it moral force, for example. American philosopher Michael Martin argues that it is <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true</b> that objective moral truths must entail the existence of God, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations: he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and, even if a supernatural explanation is necessary, it {{does not have to be}} God (polytheism is a viable alternative). Martin also argues that a non-objective account of ethics might be acceptable and {{challenges the}} view that a subjective account of morality would lead to moral anarchy.|$|E
500|$|Corals in Gotland {{with daily}} growth {{markings}} {{have been found}} in association with abundant chitinozoans, which allow the detection of seasonal variation in chitinozoan abundance. A peak in abundance during the late autumn months is observed, with the maxima for different species occurring on different dates. Such a pattern is also observed in modern-day tropical zooplankton. The diversity of living habits is also reflected by the depth of water and distance from the shore. [...] Different species are found in highest abundance at different depths. [...] While deeper waters around 40km from the shoreline are generally the optimal environment, some species appear to prefer very shallow water. On the whole, chitinozoans are less abundant in turbulent waters or reef environments, implying an aversion to such regimes when alive, if it is not an effect of sedimentary focusing. [...] Chitinozoans also become rarer in shallower water - although the reverse is <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>true.</b> They cannot survive freshwater input.|$|E
