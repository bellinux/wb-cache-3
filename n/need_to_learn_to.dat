5|$|In December, City manager Stuart Pearce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} Samaras {{would have to}} 'toughen up', {{if he wanted to}} be a success in the Premier League. He said that Samaras' all round game wasn't good enough, and that he would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> pass the ball better and compete more effectively. Some fans had criticised Pearce for signing Samaras, along with other foreign players, who had not settled in well enough to the English game. On 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2–1.|$|E

40|$|Women’s fear of {{violence}} can impact negatively on their {{active participation in}} life. An ageing survey conducted with 2620 Australian respondents aged 50 to 90 years examined aspects of work, learning, social, spiritual and emotional status, health, vision, home, life events, demographics, and asked an open ended question about what being actively engaged in life meant. Ordinal regression was carried out on two dependent variables: wanting and <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> discourage violence. Analyses found that as women’s age increased, those on lower incomes {{were more likely than}} others <b>to</b> say they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> discourage violence against them. This paper investigates the variables associated with the findings - transport, finances, news media, home safety, and reduced social interactions. Results highlight the importance of understanding women’s fear in the context of personal and social issues, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>learning</b> opportunities <b>to</b> improve safety and social engagement...|$|R

At a November 2011 meeting between the two groups, HaKohen was quoted as saying: [...] "The first step towards achieving peace is for both populations {{to learn to be}} good neighbors. And this is less relevant to people in Tel Aviv than it is to ethnic Jews living here in Samaria. ... Both populations <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> see and accept the other as indigenous and belonging here. The closest people in the world to the Jewish people are the Arabs. Any hostility between our two peoples is completely unnatural and the result of foreign powers exploiting both populations. ... If we examine the last two decades, we see that thousands of people have been killed on both sides and that our two populations have been forcibly segregated. ... Both peoples have also suffered several other injustices. Thousands of Jews have been forcibly expelled from their homes and turned into refugees. Entire towns and villages have been destroyed. And Arabs have their freedom of movement restricted by a military bureaucracy every day of their lives. ... Before Oslo there were no checkpoints or walls here and everyone could travel wherever they liked. Peoples lived together in a situation that may not have been perfect but was still much better than the situation we see today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2002 Bangladesh {{lost two}} Tests and three ODIs against Sri Lanka. At this point, {{they had lost}} ten of their first eleven Tests; only South Africa had {{struggled}} as much in their introduction to Test cricket, also losing ten of their first eleven matches. Chappell blamed Bangladesh's batsmen for the loss, saying [...] "they commit the same mistakes again and again, and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> apply themselves, to bat in sessions". In April, former Pakistan Test cricketer Mohsin Kamal replaced Chappell as coach. When Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka in July and August {{they were on the}} receiving end of Sri Lanka's largest margin of victory in Test cricket: an innings and 196runs. Bangladesh lost both Tests and all three ODIs on the tour, recording their 50th defeat in 53 ODIs. Repeated poor performances prompted people to question whether Bangladesh had been granted Test status too soon. Test and ODI whitewashes followed in South Africa in October. Wisden noted that [...] "Time and again... came the mantra that [...] would learn from the experience, that they could only improve by playing against the best, that there was genuine talent in the squad. But it wore thin." [...] The final defeat set a record for most consecutive losses in ODIs (23), beating the previous record, which was also held by Bangladesh. When the West Indies toured in November and December, Bangladesh lost both Test and two out of the three ODIs, and one ended in no result. South Africa hosted the 2003 World Cup in February and March. Bangladesh lost five of their six matches (one ended in no result), including fixtures against Canada, who hadn't played international cricket since the 1979 World Cup, and Kenya, who eventually made the semifinals of the tournament.|$|E

2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E
