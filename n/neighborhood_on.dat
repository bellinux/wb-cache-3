5|$|In 1910, {{the family}} moved to a <b>neighborhood</b> <b>on</b> Figueroa Street where they were the only Chinese on their block, living {{alongside}} mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese language school afternoons and on Saturdays.|$|E
5|$|San Marco, which {{eventually}} gave {{its name to}} the former area of South Jacksonville, broke ground in 1925 as the city's most ambitious development. It was constructed over 80 acres of the former Villa Alexandria estate, which had deteriorated after Martha Reed Mitchell's death in 1902. The developer was Telfair Stockton, who had previously established the exclusive Avondale <b>neighborhood</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of the}} river. San Marco, designed as a fashionable, upscale development in keeping with Villa Alexandria's reputation, comprised 250 lots and a commercial district. It was remarkably successful from the beginning; apparently driven by land speculation, San Marco shattered local records by selling every lot within three hours of putting them up for sale, even though very little work had begun.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the RTA (since re-branded as Sound Transit) began {{exploring}} alignment {{options for}} the Northgate segment, with residents voicing their opposition to at-grade or elevated alignments {{in favor of an}} underground route. Following several rounds of public hearings in 2000, the Sound Transit Board narrowed down the routing options to a tunnel under 12th Avenue and an elevated alignment along Interstate 5 to the west of Roosevelt's commercial district, each with a station at Northeast 65th Street. Further discussion on the two remaining choices in 2004 led to divides in the Sound Transit Board; community and business groups in Roosevelt favored an underground alignment, while Seattle mayor Greg Nickels supported the elevated station, which was less costly and closer to the Green Lake <b>neighborhood.</b> <b>On</b> January 28, 2005, the Sound Transit Board unanimously approved an underground alignment with a station along 12th Avenue NE between NE 65th and 67th streets, citing a smaller-than-expected difference in cost compared to the elevated option.|$|E

5|$|Lester Burnham is {{a middle-aged}} {{advertising}} executive and magazine writer who despises his job. He is unhappily married to Carolyn, a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious {{real estate broker}} who grows red roses in their yard; their teenage daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are the Fitts family, consisting of a homophobic retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife, Barbara, and their teenage son, Ricky, who constantly films his surroundings with a camcorder, collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom. His part-time job as a bar caterer and waiter serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealings. Frank is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live nearby, welcome the Fitts family to the <b>neighborhood.</b> <b>On</b> the way to school, Frank reveals his homophobia while he angrily discusses the incident with Ricky.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel <b>neighborhood.</b> <b>On</b> August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards <b>neighborhood</b> <b>on</b> Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E

5|$|Though {{sentenced to}} six years in prison, Francisco Rafael was {{released}} on 4 March 2008 {{after a year and}} five months behind bars. His lawyer confirmed that he was released for the time he had previously served in Mexico. Once released, he was deported to Mexico through the Paso del Norte International Bridge ("Santa Fe") international bridge in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and El Paso, Texas. He had no pending charges in his home country. Mexican authorities watched Francisco Rafael from a distance as he merged through the multitude of people close to the border. It was unknown if his family was notified of his deportation but the authorities allege that shortly after his arrival he took a flight to Tijuana to see his wife and children. Upon his arrival, Francisco Rafael moved to Mazatlán before deciding to move to Los Cabos, a resort town in the Baja California peninsula. The former drug lord lived there with his wife in Cumbres del Tezal, an upper-middle-class <b>neighborhood</b> <b>on</b> a hill and with view towards the Arco de Cabo San Lucas. Instead of his actual name, Francisco Rafael went by his pseudonym Mauro Vázquez, and posed as a businessman, avid motorcyclist, and music producer.|$|E
