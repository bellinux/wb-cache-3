25|$|The two's {{complement}} of zero is zero: inverting gives all ones, and adding one changes the ones back to zeros (since the overflow is ignored). Furthermore, the two's {{complement of}} the most <b>negative</b> <b>number</b> representable (e.g. a one as the most-significant bit and all other bits zero) is itself. Hence, {{there appears to be}} an 'extra' <b>negative</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the 9th century, Islamic mathematicians were {{familiar}} with <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> from the works of Indian mathematicians, but the recognition and use of <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> during this period remained timid. Al-Khwarizmi in his Al-jabr wa'l-muqabala (from which we get the word [...] "algebra") did not use <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> or <b>negative</b> coefficients. But within fifty years, Abu Kamil illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication , and al-Karaji wrote in his al-Fakhrī that [...] "negative quantities must be counted as terms". In the 10th century, Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī considered debts as <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> in A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen.|$|R
25|$|The engine {{represents}} negative {{numbers as}} ten's complements. Subtraction amounts to {{addition of a}} <b>negative</b> <b>number.</b> This works {{in the same manner}} that modern computers perform subtraction, known as two's complement.|$|E
25|$|Brahmagupta's Brahmasphuṭasiddhanta is {{the first}} book that {{mentions}} zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers. Zero plus a positive number is the positive number and <b>negative</b> <b>number</b> plus zero is a <b>negative</b> <b>number</b> etc. The Brahmasphutasiddhanta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as {{was done by the}} Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.|$|E
25|$|Also {{note that}} every <b>negative</b> <b>number,</b> {{including}} negative fractions, {{is less than}} zero, and every positive number, including positive fractions, is greater than zero, so every negative fraction is less than any positive fraction.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th century, Nicolas Chuquet, a Frenchman, used <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> as exponents but {{referred}} to them as “absurd numbers.” In his 1544 Arithmetica Integra Michael Stifel also dealt with <b>negative</b> <b>numbers,</b> also calling them numeri absurdi.|$|R
2500|$|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was {{the first}} {{mathematician}} to systematically employ <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> {{as part of a}} coherent mathematical system, the infinitesimal calculus.

5|$|One of the Han's {{greatest}} mathematical advancements was the world's {{first use}} of <b>negative</b> <b>numbers.</b> <b>Negative</b> <b>numbers</b> {{first appeared in the}} Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as black counting rods, where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods. <b>Negative</b> <b>numbers</b> were also used by the Greek mathematician Diophantus around 275 AD, and in the 7th-century AD Bakhshali manuscript of Gandhara, South Asia, but were not widely accepted in Europe until the 16th century AD.|$|R

2500|$|In A.D. 1759, Francis Maseres, an English mathematician, {{wrote that}} <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> [...] "darken the very whole doctrines of the {{equations}} and make {{dark of the}} things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple".

25|$|In {{computer}} science a partial function {{corresponds to a}} subroutine that raises an exception or loops forever.

25|$|A {{positive}} or <b>negative</b> <b>number</b> when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator.

25|$|Cardano {{noticed that}} Tartaglia's method {{sometimes}} {{required him to}} extract the square root of a <b>negative</b> <b>number.</b> He even included a calculation with these complex numbers in Ars Magna, {{but he did not}} really understand it.

25|$|Every nonnegative {{real number}} has a square root in R, {{although}} no <b>negative</b> <b>number</b> does. This {{shows that the}} order on R is determined by its algebraic structure. Also, every polynomial of odd degree admits at least one real root: these two properties make R the premier example of a real closed field. Proving {{this is the first}} half of one proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.|$|E
25|$|This method {{produces}} {{electricity to}} supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity {{is used to}} pump water into the higher reservoir. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. Pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale grid energy storage and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a <b>negative</b> <b>number</b> in listings.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} {{negative}} being {{the same number}} is detected as an overflow condition since there was a carry into but {{not out of the}} most-significant bit. This can lead to unexpected bugs in that an unchecked implementation of absolute value could return a <b>negative</b> <b>number</b> {{in the case of the}} minimum negative. The abs family of integer functions in C typically has this behaviour. This is also true for Java. In this case it is for the developer to decide if there will be a check for the minimum negative value before the call of the function.|$|E
50|$|Another topic {{dealt with}} in the Arithmetica integra are <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> (which Stifel calls numeri absurdi). <b>Negative</b> <b>numbers</b> were refused and {{considered}} as preposterous by the authorities at that time. Stifel however, used <b>negative</b> <b>numbers</b> equal to the other numbers. He also discussed the properties of irrational numbers and if the irrationals are real numbers, or only fictitious (AI page 103). Stifel found them very useful for mathematics, and not dispensable. Further issues were a method of calculating roots of higher order by using binomial coefficients and sequences.|$|R
