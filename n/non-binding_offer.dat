We find three main results. First, stable matches are the prevalent outcome. Second, in markets with multiple stable matches, the median stable match is selected most frequently. Third, the cardinal representation of ordinal preferences substantially impacts which stable match gets selected. Furthermore, the endogenous dynamic paths that lead to stability exhibit several persistent features...|$|R

40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT: On 27 September 2010, {{the much}} {{anticipated}} entry of Walmart to the South African retail sector was announced. Walmart Stores Incorporated publicised {{that they would}} make a <b>non-binding</b> <b>offer</b> of R 148 per share for the entire number of Massmart Holding’s outstanding shares. The offer presented a premium of 19. 2 percent and valued Massmart at R 31 billion rand. Walmart later altered the offer to purchase 51 percent of the outstanding shares at the same offer price which Massmart consequently accepted. This concluded the largest investment by an American company, the tenth largest corporate transaction in South Africa and the fifth largest acquisition by Walmart. From a Massmart shareholders’ perspective, was it the correct decision to accept Walmart’s offer? Academic literature suggests that most mergers and acquisitions fail {{to live up to}} their expectations and ultimately fail to create shareholder value. Some of the most common reasons listed are the failure to determine the fair market value of an acquisition and engaging in mergers and acquisitions for the wrong reasons. Another common pitfall is that valuation methods in general do not link the company’s strategy to the valuation process, to assess the potential impact of the merger or acquisition on company performance. This case study based research report analyses the Walmart-Massmart acquisition to review Walmart’s offer price. The analysis links both companies’ business model and strategy to the valuation process, to determine the outcome on shareholder value within Massmart following the acquisition...|$|E

Before {{the start of the}} bargaining process, the sender has private information about the receiver 2 ̆ 019 s bargaining power. His settlement offers may convey this private information so that they change the receiver 2 ̆ 019 s expectations and, by loss aversion, preferences.

When side-payments are <b>non-binding,</b> proposers <b>offer</b> nothing and conflicts always arise. Laboratory experiments confirm that binding side-payments reduce conflicts. However, 30 % of responders reject binding offers, and offers are more egalitarian than predicted. Surprisingly, non-binding side-payments also improve efficiency, although less than binding.

30|$|Prior to {{offering}} any statements {{regarding the}} different participation rates of poor and non-poor young individuals in fee-based and non-contributory organisations, we should discuss the possible selection {{effects of these}} organisations. The most straightforward approach would be to divide music, sport or culture clubs into fee-based and non-contributory activities and analyse the different participation rates based on this differentiation. However, the PASS information does not facilitate this differentiation and we cannot use other data {{because of the small}} number of needy young individuals. Therefore, we employ activities in church communities as a proxy for non-contributory organisations. In addition to youth services and confirmation preparation, the open youth work of churches provides examples of <b>non-binding</b> <b>offers</b> that occur in the course of leisure activities, educational work and independent youth-cultural development (Höß 2004). In the open youth work of churches, shared activities and social relationships with peers occupy the foreground, whereas the reference to the church as institution is of minor importance (EKD 2010). To control for possible entry barriers, we additionally take into account the individual religious persuasion in the multivariate analysis. Furthermore, church communities are a major organiser of youth leisure activities. Approximately 660, 000 young individuals aged between 7 and 28 years are organised in the Catholic Church (Deutsche Bischofskonferenz 2012) and the Protestant youth organisation represents the interests of approximately 1.2 million young people (AEJ 2010). A 2007 study in cooperation with the Free University of Berlin reveals that 10 per cent of all German youths participate or have participated in activities offered by the Protestant youth organisation (EKD 2010). The different leisure activities vary from youth clubs and disco evenings to cultural offerings and adventure-based learning activities and are mostly free of charge. Moreover, a membership in one of the church-related groups costs between €  15 and €  25 (DPSG 2011; KJG 2011) and allows participation in workshops and day trips. Thus, leisure activities organised by the church are substantially more affordable than those of most clubs and other organised groups.|$|R

40|$|Explicit {{contracts}} are used most frequently by theorists to model many relationships, ranging from labor markets to investment projects. Experimental evidence has accumulated recently highlighting {{the limitations of}} formal and explicit contracts in certain situations, and has documented environments in which informal and implicit {{contracts are}} more efficient. This paper compares the performance of explicit and implicit contracts in a new partnership environment in which both contracting parties must incur effort to generate a joint surplus, and one (“strong”) agent controls the surplus division. In the treatment in which the strong agent makes a <b>non-binding</b> “bonus ” <b>offer</b> to the weak agent, this unenforceable promise doubles the rate of joint high effort compared to a baseline with no promise. The strong agents most frequently offered a bonus to split the gains of the high effort equally, but actually delivered this bonus amount only about one-quarter of the time. An explicit and enforceable contract offer performs substantially better, raising {{the rate of the}} most efficient outcome by over 200 percent relative to the baseline. Interestingly, the initial bonus offer helped agents to coordinate their effort choices...|$|R
