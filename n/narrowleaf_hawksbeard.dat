50|$|Crepis tectorum, the <b>narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard</b> or narrow-leaved hawk's-beard, is {{an annual}} or winter annual plant that grows to 30 - 100 cm high. It is an {{invasive}} species and during maturity {{it has one}} main stem, which is branched, hairless, and leafy. The leaves are arranged in an alternate manner and are less than 0.5 in wide. The Greek word krepis means sandal or slipper which resembles {{the shape of the}} seed. <b>Narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard</b> originated in Siberia and was introduced to Canada around 1890.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} now {{naturalized}} {{in much of}} Canada, Greenland, and northern parts of the United States including Alaska. <b>Narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard</b> is now commonly found in the parkland zone of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Crepis tectorum is found in waste areas, conventional tillage, reduced tillage, forage and hay fields, and roadsides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard</b> {{responds}} best to a fall {{application of}} 2,4-DB herbicide. Non-chemical methods of control include spring or fall tillage to control winter annuals and the correct use of agronomic {{practices such as}} fertilization for the control of annuals. Biological control {{can be achieved by}} insects, non-domestic animals, microorganisms, and viruses. However, the use of biological control can be risky and should always be approached with caution.|$|E
50|$|Crepis tectorum is {{an annual}} weed that grows in {{cultivated}} fields and roadsides. It is very invasive {{so it can}} take over a field and lead to serious ecological impacts for the surrounding. Crepis tectorum is able to grow in calcareous soil as well as soil that does not contain lime. However, it grows best in nutrient rich soils containing clays and loams. It also thrives in dry, coarse soil. It grows with other species in the wild however, it becomes infectious if not controlled by humans. It can easily be removed by hand, although it can be controlled better by chemical means. The presence of the <b>Narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard</b> is damaging to the soil and other species of plants nearby as it generally takes over the area. The temperature range for germination is 2 - 4 C, with an optimum depth of 3 - 4 cm. Narrow-leaved hawksbeard grows on both calcareous and lime-deficient soils.|$|E
40|$|White sweetclover and <b>narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard</b> are nonindigenous {{invasive}} {{plant species}} in Alaska that are rapidly spreading, including into {{areas that are}} otherwise free of nonindigenous plants. There has been concern that native moose could be dispersing germinable seed from these plants after ingestion. To address this concern, a study was conducted involving tame moose at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station, Matanuska Experiment Farm, Palmer, AK. Objectives were to determine if seeds from these two plant species could survive mastication and digestive passage through moose, whether this passage impacted seed germination, and whether seed passage rates {{were the same as}} similar sized Cr-mordanted fiber. In this study, <b>narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard</b> seed rarely survived mastication and digestion with only five seedlings recovered from 42, 000 germinable seed fed to the moose. About 16 % of germinable white sweetclover seed (3, 595 of 22, 000) fed to the moose produced seedlings. Most of the sweetclover seedlings came from feces produced 2 and 3 d after feeding. In two moose, sweetclover seedlings were grown from fecal material that was passed 11 d after feeding, raising the possibility that seeds could be transported long distances after ingestion. Cr-mordanted fiber passage did not closely follow seedling producing seed, possibly because time in the rumen might reduce seed germination. Once roadsides in Alaska become infested with white sweetclover, moose can then serve as a transport vector of these weeds into river channels and floodplains, which are distant from roads. This information will impact white sweetclover management programs and alert land managers to the potential for other instances of wildlife-mediated seed dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Soil-borne pests affect both {{quantity}} of forest nursery seedlings available for lifting and shipping {{as well as}} quality (morphological and physiological characteristics) of shipped seedlings destined {{for a variety of}} out-planting sites. Broad groups of significant pests in north central states nurseries of the USA include soil-borne fungi (e. g. Cylindrocladium spp., Fusarium spp., and pythiaceous fungi), insects (e. g. white grubs and cutworms), and weeds (e. g. horseweed, <b>narrowleaf</b> <b>hawksbeard,</b> and chickweed). Since the 1950 ’s much reliance has been placed on pre-plant chemical fumigation of nursery soils to manage these pests in conifer and hardwood seedling fields. Integrated pest management (IPM) has been the stated goal for USDA Forest Service nurseries since the late 1980 ’s as an outcome of environmental assessments conducted for each one. The IPM plans developed by these federal nurseries were focused on tolerable levels of control for significant pests in each nursery. The aim of these plans is to reduce the reliance on ”single-shot” treatments, such as pre-plant soil fumigation with methyl bromide- chloropicrin. Commercial, industrial, and state forest nurseries in the north central region have varied in their approach and commitment to an IPM goal...|$|E
