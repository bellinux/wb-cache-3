Originally inspired {{to sample the}} hip hop artists he was signed to work with in the studio, the album consists of samples by more popular hip hop artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Despite being described as electronic music, IDM and glitch and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> music a hip hop audience is used to hearing, Herren felt that his music was closer to hip hop.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and {{for the development of}} their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I {{think it is a}} fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as {{we are part of}} his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

500|$|One review {{about the}} soundtrack said that, [...] "this is no {{ordinary}} album and will be preferred by musical elites. Infused with classical music and Rajasthani folk music, {{it is a good}} quality album coming out of Salim-Sulaiman. But the shortcoming comes in the form that this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> music that'll please every ear." [...] Another review, in a similar tone, said that the album [...] "works only for those who are either followers of classical music or enjoy hearing songs with a Rajasthani folk music base. There is no doubt that composers good quality throughout, but overall the album caters only to a niche audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} video was mostly positive. Adam Fairholm from the Internet Music Video Database praised Shakira's dance moves and {{flexibility in the}} video and complimented Nava's direction. James Montgomery from MTV also commended Shakira's dancing, noting that she [...] "even manages to out-Beyoncé". He also complimented Shakira's body, commenting that her posterior is the [...] "breakout star of the video". Anna Pickard from The Guardian appreciated the originality of the video and noted that [...] "the moves contained in this video are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing you see every day". Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E

[...] John Bush from AllMusic listed the track as one of his album track picks while Michaelangelo Matos from Spin called it one of the album's best moments that were [...] "less about the successive climaxes than steady-state flow." [...] Jack Smith from BBC Music described the song as [...] "cutting edge" [...] and [...] "hook-laden", while highlighting it as [...] "a welcome return" [...] for Burgess.|$|E

500|$|Various {{historians and}} biographers have characterised Lenin's {{administration}} as totalitarian, {{and as a}} police state, and many have {{described it as a}} one-party dictatorship. Several such scholars have described Lenin as a dictator; Ryan stated that he was [...] "not a dictator in the sense that all his recommendations were accepted and implemented", for many of his colleagues disagreed with him on various issues. Fischer noted that while [...] "Lenin was a dictator, [...] <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dictator Stalin later became", while Volkogonov believed that whereas Lenin established a [...] "dictatorship of the Party", it would only be under Stalin that the Soviet Union became the [...] "dictatorship of one man".|$|E

500|$|Inseminoid {{attracted}} positive critical reception on {{its original}} release. In terms of box office performance, it reached {{a high of}} fifth position in the 1981 British charts. At one point it ranked seventh {{at the box office}} in France, while in the United States it proceeded to enter the Los Angeles Times list of top ten films. American director Roger Corman congratulated Warren on the film and considered commissioning him for further productions. However, a private screening had failed to impress members of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, who dismissed Inseminoid as [...] "'Commercial rubbish! ...

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though {{he also says}} that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.|$|E

[...] "These are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> colors the audience is used to seeing," [...] he noted. [...] "These are much more dramatic in strength, in saturation. Comic strip art is usually done with very simple and primitive ideas and emotions," [...] Storaro theorized. [...] "One of the elements is that the story is usually told in vignette, so what {{we tried to do}} is never move the camera at all. Never. Try to make everything work into the frame." [...] For the matte paintings, Ellenshaw and Lloyd executed over 57 paintings on glass, which were then optically combined with the live action. For a brief sequence in which The Kid dashes in front of a speeding locomotive, only [...] of real track was laid; the train itself was a [...] scale model, and the surrounding train yard a matte painting.|$|E

500|$|Paramount {{felt the}} film was too {{controversial}} for release, giving it only a few preview showings and a one-week run in Detroit before shelving it. The film's first theatrical release occurred in France on July 7, 1982. In the United Kingdom, {{it was part of}} the 37th Edinburgh International Film Festival and the 27th London Film Festival in 1983, and was released late that year by United International Pictures. It received positive reviews in both countries. Lisa Dombrowski of Film Comment notes, [...] "In the end, Sam Fuller's White Dog was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests, as support for freedom of expression took a back seat to Paramount's bottom line and the NAACP's ongoing battles with Hollywood over representation and employment. A Sam Fuller thriller was simply <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> antiracist picture that a major studio knew how to market in 1981 or that African-American organizations wanted Hollywood to make at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{folding the}} Colonels, Brown stated that {{basketball}} was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> business {{he wanted to}} be involved in. Despite this declaration, he purchased half-ownership in the NBA's Buffalo Braves later in 1976. The Braves had posted a dismal 30–52 record in the 1975–76 season, and Brown immediately set out to make moves that would improve the franchise's fortunes in the next season. He re-signed All Star guard Randy Smith, who had threatened to leave as a free agent, then traded the club's first-round draft pick to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Swen Nater. In a single day, he made two significant trades. In the first, he swapped reigning Rookie of the Year Adrian Dantley for the Indiana Pacers' Billy Knight, who was second in the league in scoring the previous season. Four hours later, he acquired Nate [...] "Tiny" [...] Archibald from the New York Nets for George Johnson and a first-round draft pick in 1979. In 1977, Brown purchased the remaining share of the team from owner Paul Snyder.|$|E
500|$|A review from Idolator {{said that}} the futuristic theme to the video {{might have been better}} suited to the {{previous}} international single, [...] "Commander."

[...] The reviewer concluded that [...] "it's hard to imagine better uses for a touch screen than getting {{as close as possible to}} the carefree fun on display here." [...] Steven Gottlieb of Video Static said, [...] " [...] a casual and sunny pop video gets a bit of a twist, or a flick, via an interface that's swiped from your iPhone...It's possibly <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> finger manipulation some Kelly Rowland fans have been dreaming about, but even they should admit it's a clever conceit." ...|$|E
