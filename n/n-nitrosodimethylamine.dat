50|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{discussion}} about chloramine has focused on <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (NDMA), and {{it is critical to}} distinguish between chloramine and NDMA. NDMA can be a byproduct of chloramination or chlorination, but drinking water is not a major source of exposure to NDMA. The biggest sources of human exposure to NDMA are tobacco smoke, chewing tobacco, bacon and other cured meats, beer, fish, cheese, toiletries, shampoos, cleansers, interior air of cars, and household pesticides.

40|$|Nitrosamines is {{a family}} of potent carcinogens, have been of concern for many decades due to their {{occurrence}} in foods, industrial workplace environments, and as groundwater contaminants. Human exposure to nitrosamines can result from formation of N nitroso compounds either in food during storage or preparation or in vivo, usually in the stomach. <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> {{is one of the}} main N-nitroso compound which is commonly found in drinking water and is a potent hepatotoxin, carcinogen and mutagen and it induces fibrosis and cirrhosis in liver. All identified health risks associated with <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> in drinking water incorporates all relevant routes of exposure from drinking water—namely, ingestion as well as skin absorption from showering and bathing. The toxicity produced by <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> is mediated by its reactive metabolites and not by the parent compound. Decontamination of <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> relies mostly on UV irradiation, but these methods are rather impractical and expensive when applied to municipal and wastewater treatment. <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. When administered orally, <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> induced liver hemangiosarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and kidney and lung tumors in mice. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated as causative agents in many degenerative diseases, and also in the promotion phase in carcinogenesis. Toxic effects of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine,</b> a potent carcinogenic and mutagenic substance, were also proposed to be due to reactive oxygen species formed by its metabolic activation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Beer, nonfat dry milk, fried {{bacon and}} {{microwave}} baked fish were treated under simulated gastric and extreme nitrosation conditions to estimate their capacity for generation of endogenously formed N-nitrosamines.

The {{levels in the}} other food products were not increased under the same simulated gastric conditions (p < 0. 05). Extreme nitrosation illustrated that food has a large nitrosatable amine content. Beer produced elevated levels of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine,</b> N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosopyrrolidine and N-nitrosomorpholine. Nonfat dry milk produced elevated levels of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine,</b> N-nitrosopiperidine, N-nitrosopyrrolidine and N-nitrosomorpholine.

40|$|Under normal {{conditions}} a possible <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> formation in vivo cannot directly be monitored in urine {{due to high}} metabolic conversion rate (> 99. 9 %). Own ex-periments showed an increased excretion rate (up to 2. 4 %) if ethanol was administered simultaneously. This model was used for monitoring experiments with repect to in vivo for-mation of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine.</b> Amidopyrine, as a com-pound which is easily nitrosated, was administered (single oral dose of 500 mg) to volunteers.

40|$|Oxidation of {{unsymmetrical}} dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) during a water treatment has several disadvantages including formation of stable toxic byproducts. Effectiveness of treatment methods {{in relation to}} UDMH transformation products is currently poorly studied. This work considers the effectiveness of chemical oxidants in respect to main metabolites of UDMH – 1 -formyl- 2, 2 -dimethylhydrazine, dimethylaminoacetontrile, <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> and 1 -methyl- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole. Experiments on chemical oxidation by Fenton's reagent, potassium permanganate and sodium nitrite were conducted. Quantitative determination was performed by HPLC. Oxidation products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in combination with solid-phase microextraction. 1 -Formyl- 2, 2 -dimethylhydrazine was completely oxidized by Fenton's reagent with formation of formaldehyde N-formyl-N-methyl-hydrazone, 1, 4 -dihydro- 1, 4 -dimethyl- 5 H-tetrazol- 5 -one {{by the action of}} potassium permanganate and N-methyl-N-nitro-methanamine in the presence of sodium nitrite. Oxidation of 1 -formyl- 2, 2 -dimethylhydrazine also resulted in formation of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine.</b> Oxidation of dimethylaminoacetontrile proceeded with formation of hydroxyacetonitrile, dimethylformamide and 1, 2, 5 -trimethylpyrrole. After 30 days, dimethylaminoacetontrile was not detected in the presence of Fenton’s reagent and potassium permanganate, but it’s concentration in samples with sodium nitrite was 77. 3 mg/L. In the presence of Fenton’s reagent, potassium permanganate and sodium nitrite after 30 days, <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> concentration decreased by 85, 80 and 50 %, respectively.

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that certain disinfection practices may result {{in the formation of}} significant amounts of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (NDMA), and quite likely other nitroso compounds in drinking water. These compounds are believed formed when chlorine is added to water containing ammonia, and certain organic nitrogen compounds ("precursors"). Measurements in several drinking water distribution systems suggest that unprotected sources receiving point and non-point waste discharges are particularly susceptible to their formation, especially when chloramination is practiced. The formation of NDMA and possibly other nitroso compounds in drinking water is an emerging concern because they are generally carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic (Loeppky et al., 1994; O'Neill et al., 1984). For example, the nitrosamine, <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine,</b> NDMA (CH 3) 2 NNO) is a particularly potent carcinogen.

40|$|Background: The major {{potential}} site of acid nitrosation is the proximal stomach, an anatomical site prone to a rising incidence of metaplasia and adenocarcinoma. Nitrite, a pre-carcinogen present in saliva, {{can be converted}} to nitrosating species and N-nitroso compounds by acidification at low gastric pH in the presence of thiocyanate. Aims: To assess the effect of lipid and ascorbic acid on the nitrosative chemistry under conditions simulating the human proximal stomach. Methods: The nitrosative chemistry was modelled in vitro by measuring the nitrosation of four secondary amines under conditions simulating the proximal stomach. The N-nitrosamines formed were measured by gas chromatography–ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry, while nitric oxide and oxygen levels were measured amperometrically. Results: In absence of lipid, nitrosative stress was inhibited by ascorbic acid through conversion of nitrosating species to nitric oxide. Addition of ascorbic acid reduced the amount of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> formed by fivefold, N-nitrosomorpholine by. 1000 -fold, and totally prevented the formation of N-nitrosodiethylamine and N-nitrosopiperidine.

In this study, {{the correlation between}} gene expression and biological removal of the water contaminant <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (NDMA) is explored. NDMA is a hydrophilic, potent carcinogen that has gained recent notoriety due to its environmental persistence and emergence as a widespread micropollutant in the subsurface environment. In this study, we demonstrate that Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA 1 can constitutively degrade NDMA and that activity toward this compound is enhanced by approximately 500 -fold after growth on propane. Transcriptomic analysis of RHA 1 and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR assays demonstrate that growth on propane elicits the upregulation of gene clusters associated with (i) the oxidation of propane and (ii) the oxidation of substituted benzenes. Deletion mutagenesis of prmA, the gene encoding the large hydroxylase component of propane monooxygenase, abolished both growth on propane and removal of NDMA. These results demonstrate that propane monooxygenase is responsible for NDMA degradation by RHA 1 and explain the enhanced cometabolic degradation of NDMA {{in the presence of}} propane.
