She also cited her work as a dancer as being one of many inspirations for the songs on Pretty on the Inside: [...] "I was blonde, wore makeup, had to support my band by dancing, and had to play this ridiculous archetype at work... so I took, you know, high heels and white pumps, and I had a wiglet—I just took that and messed with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. <b>Not</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> flop movie." ...|$|E

[...] In the documentary, <b>Not</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Girl (1995), Bjelland revealed: [...] "You know, I really hate to talk about it because she's great now, but in my childhood she was very abusive... like I said, though, it probably did help my creativity a lot. I was always grounded. I hate to talk about it because I feel like she doesn't think that she did it, but she was [...] and it influenced my life quite a great deal." ...|$|E

[...] Chris Davis of Memphis Flyer wrote, [...] "This locally produced feature directed by Brett Hanover uses materials created by the Church of Scientology and stories told by former members of L.

6000|$|Looking {{towards the}} Rokel River, {{we see the}} Fourah Bay and College, a large and {{handsome}} building, now terribly out of repair. This establishment, the 'Farran's House' of old maps, is well known to readers of propagandist works; it opened on February 18, 1828, with six pupils, {{one of whom was}} the 'boy Ajai,' now Bishop Crowther of the Niger territory. The Church Missionary Society has spent upon it a small treasury of money; at present it ranks as a manner of university, having been affiliated in May 1876 to that of Durham. Sealed papers are sent out from England, but perhaps the local examiners are easy distributors of B.A.s and so forth to the golden youth of Sá Leone. It is free to all, irrespective of religious denomination, a liberal concession which does it high honour. The academical twelve-month has three terms; and there are three scholarships, each worth 40l. per annum, open for competition every year. <b>Not</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> maximum of sixteen students, whose total is steadily diminishing.
