5|$|After the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, the Bankes family regained their properties. Rather than rebuild Corfe Castle, the eldest son Ralph Bankes built a house on their other Dorset estate near Wimborne Minster. In 1663, he commissioned Sir Roger Pratt to design a <b>new</b> <b>house</b> to be known as Kingston Hall on the current site, based on Clarendon House which he had visited several times. Construction started the same year, and was completed by 1665.|$|E
5|$|As the two grew older, {{the letters}} became fewer and farther between. There {{was also a}} great deal that they kept to themselves. Jefferson said nothing about his {{construction}} of a <b>new</b> <b>house,</b> domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams {{did not mention the}} troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E

40|$|The {{supply of}} <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> in Australia has been {{experiencing}} a low increase rate since the 1990 s {{in conjunction with}} an increasingly strong housing demand. On the contrary, residential construction costs across Australia&# 039;s states maintained dramatic increases simultaneously. Economic theory suggests that <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> supply is correlated to the costs of residential constructions. However, few empirical {{studies have focused on}} examining this relationship for Australian housing markets. To comprehensively investigate the relationship between the supply of <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> and residential construction costs a function for <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> supply considering the effects of regional heterogeneities is introduced in this study. By estimating a panel error correction model (ECM) applicable for quantifying the correlation with regional heterogeneities, this research identifies that a causal link and a strong correlation exist in between <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> supply and residential construction costs in Australia...|$|R
5|$|Bruce's <b>new</b> <b>house</b> was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and was the work of the smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
5|$|In 1745, Brettingham {{designed}} Gunton Hall in Norfolk for Sir William Harbord, {{three years}} after the former house on the site was gutted by fire. The <b>new</b> <b>house</b> of brick had a principal facade like that of Hanworth Hall, however, this larger house was seven bays deep, and had a large service wing on its western side.

5|$|The Campbells {{continued}} {{to add to}} the castle, building a <b>new</b> <b>house</b> over the old west range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the castle, and the Captains ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House, some 2km to the south-east, until this too burned down in 1940. Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{explanations}} for why some communities block <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> construction focus on incumbent home owner incentives to block entry.

5|$|A notable {{cultural}} {{trait of}} Chiprovtsi shared {{with much of}} the region is the veneration of a family patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava. The practice exists since time immemorial and the family saint is thought to have been chosen by the taking of a random candle by an unaware person. The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and when a family member or a foreign settler moves out or builds a <b>new</b> <b>house,</b> they adopt a new svetets.|$|E
5|$|After {{living in}} his <b>new</b> <b>house</b> for three years, Big Jim died of {{tuberculosis}} on October14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, {{lived in the house}} until after the Civil War.

The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related financial stress from which the family could not recover.|$|E

When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her.
