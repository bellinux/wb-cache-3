5|$|By 1976, {{after the}} city's {{residents}} had endured {{a spike in}} crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. In downtown Fairbanks, overcrowding, traffic problems, and drunken rambunctiousness caused by pipeline workers pushed businesses to move into malls built away from downtown. <b>New</b> <b>commercial</b> centers like Gavora Mall, Bentley Mall, and others {{away from the city}} center drove the construction of freeways that bypassed downtown Fairbanks.|$|E

The Seven Network's 7HD {{was the first to}} launch on 15 October and became available through Prime Television on 29 October. This was followed by the launch of Ten HD on 16 December. The majority of the programming on the high-definition channels was simulcast from the parent channel.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese {{ideology}} of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building <b>new</b> <b>commercial</b> ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1335, {{the delegates}} of John of Bohemia {{and the new}} King of Poland, Casimir III, entered into {{negotiations}} in Trencsén {{to put an end}} to the conflicts between the two countries. With Charles's mediation, a compromise was reached on 24August: John of Bohemia renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged John of Bohemia's suzerainty in Silesia. On 3September, Charles signed an alliance with John of Bohemia in Visegrád, which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria. Upon Charles's invitation, John of Bohemia and Casimir of Poland met in Visegrád in November. During the Congress of Visegrád, the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had worked out in Trencsén. CasimirIII also promised to pay 400,000 groschen to John of Bohemia, but a part of this indemnification (120,000 groschen) was finally paid off by Charles instead of his brother-in-law. The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs, and a <b>new</b> <b>commercial</b> route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{continued}} {{to expand his}} practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and {{a lawyer for the}} <b>new</b> <b>Commercial</b> Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.|$|E

5|$|The {{years of}} Mary's reign were {{consistently}} wet. The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine. Another {{problem was the}} decline of the Antwerp cloth trade. Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from Spain's enormously lucrative trade with the New World. The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone illicit trade or piracy against her husband. In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued Northumberland's policy of seeking out <b>new</b> <b>commercial</b> opportunities. She granted a royal charter to the Muscovy Company, whose first governor was Sebastian Cabot, and commissioned a world atlas from Diogo Homem. Adventurers such as John Lok and William Towerson sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>new</b> <b>{{commercial}}</b> climate glam metal {{bands like}} Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up, Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991, and {{while many of}} these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands' commercial viability during the decade. In 1995 Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Guns N' Roses' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident? Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997. Axl Rose, the only original member, worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete. Slash and McKagan eventually rejoined the band in 2016 and went on the Not in this Lifetime... Tour with them.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a <b>new</b> <b>commercial</b> treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E
