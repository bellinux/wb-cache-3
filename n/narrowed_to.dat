5|$|Describing {{himself as}} a {{descendant}} of the culture and traditions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Piłsudski believed in a multicultural Poland - a home of nations, recognizing numerous ethnic and religious nationalities and finally existing in strong historical alliance with independent states of Lithuania and Ukraine.

5|$|Numerous {{candidates}} {{entered the}} Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules. On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.|$|E

5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E
5|$|Bartley and ÓBriain {{conceived}} {{of the film}} after Bartley returned from documenting {{the aftermath of the}} 1999 Vargas mudslides for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, Bord Scannán na hÉireann (BSÉ), for a development grant. At BSÉ's request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the €200,000 production was provided by BSÉ and several European broadcasters. Bartley and ÓBriain shot more than 200hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> concentrate more on the coup attempt.|$|E

While resurrection of the P-16 was discussed in the Swiss press (FFA had continued theoretical development the aircraft at its own expense, with its final variant, the AR-7, to be equipped with a Rolls-Royce RB168-25 engine), the choice <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> the Milan (a joint Swiss-French prototype variant of the Mirage III) and the American A-7G Corsair II, each of which had strong advocates within the Swiss Air Force.|$|E

Tony Todd and Wendy Makkena were cast as CIA Director Graham and the National Intelligence Director, General Mary Beckman. The casting for Beckman was <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> Makkena and Bonita Friedericy, with Mekenna ultimately being chosen. However, Mekenna only appeared in the pilot, and was replaced in the following episode by Friedericy as General Diane Beckman.|$|E
5|$|Mayor John Curtis began {{a public}} process {{to replace the}} flag in 2013, in {{response}} to the second NAVA survey, consulting with local vexillologists and residents for ideas. In May 2014, the flag replacement process was <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> two options by a three-member committee, both consisting of simple renditions of Utah Lake and nearby mountains, with one option having three stars to represent life in Provo. The designs were not well received by residents, leading Mayor Curtis to propose a public design contest to end in early June. A consensus was reached by residents to not use the color red in the new flag, as it is used by the University of Utah, a rival to Provo's Brigham Young University.|$|E

5|$|The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking {{alternatives}} for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. The alternatives were <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle, in 2003. The project's preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, {{was chosen by}} WSDOT in 2011. The $4.56 billion megaproject, which encompasses the SR520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and electronic tolls on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y {{with the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, {{or at the}} Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was considered, {{but in the end}} it was decided that a remote location would be best. A site in the vicinity of Los Angeles was rejected on security grounds, and one near Reno, Nevada as being too inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was <b>narrowed</b> <b>to</b> the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the West Coast of the United States for a Japanese attack not to be an issue, and the population density was low.|$|E
