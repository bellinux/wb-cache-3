5000|$|A {{wide range}} of other {{pharmacological}} drugs have been evaluated to determine their efficacy in reducing the frequency or severity of migraine attacks.

40|$|<b>Nimodipine</b> is a Ca 2 +-channel {{antagonist}} mainly {{used for}} the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) to prevent cerebral vasospasms. However, it is not clear if the better outcome of nimodipine-treated patients is mainly due to vasodilatation or whether other cellular neuroprotective or neuregenerative effects of <b>nimodipine</b> are involved. We analysed PC 12 cells after different stress stimuli with or without <b>nimodipine</b> pretreatment.

40|$|<b>Nimodipine</b> is an L-type {{calcium channel}} blocker and is used to treat {{vasospasm}} in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Its putative mechanism of action is relaxation of smooth muscle cells in cerebral arteries. In addition, <b>nimodipine</b> may have pleiotropic effects against vasospasm. Systemic hypotension is an adverse effect when patients are treated with oral or intravenous <b>nimodipine.</b> Intracranial administration of <b>nimodipine</b> formulations may produce higher concentration of <b>nimodipine</b> in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than is possible to achieve orally or intravenously, while resulting in lower incidence of systemic hypotension. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide information on plasma and CSF levels of <b>nimodipine</b> in beagle dogs as a comparative data for development of experimental intracranial treatment modalities. Plasma levels of <b>nimodipine</b> were measured after current 30 and 60 mg single oral dose of <b>nimodipine</b> (Nimotop(A (R)) 30 mg tablets), a single intravenous bolus 0. 72 mg/dog of <b>nimodipine</b> (Nimotop(A (R)) 0. 2 mg/ml infusion solution) and CSF levels after 60 mg single oral dose of <b>nimodipine.</b> CSF/Plasma concentration ratio of <b>nimodipine</b> after oral administration of 60 mg at 1 h was 0. 013 +/- A 0. 0005.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that inflammation {{plays a major}} role in the pathogenesis of neural damage caused by deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain. <b>Nimodipine</b> has received attention as a drug that might improve learning and reduce cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanism of action is poorly known. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that <b>nimodipine</b> inhibited Aβ-stimulated IL- 1 β release from microglia. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cultures of N 13 microglia cells or primary mouse microglia were treated with <b>nimodipine,</b> and intracellular accumulation and release of IL- 1 β in response to Aβ or to the P 2 receptor agonists ATP and benzoyl ATP (BzATP) were measured. Accumulation of IL- 1 β was measured in vivo after intrahippocampal inoculation of Aβ in the absence or presence of <b>nimodipine.</b> The effect of <b>nimodipine</b> on Aβ-triggered cytotoxicity was also investigated. KEY RESULTS: We show here that <b>nimodipine</b> dose-dependently inhibited Aβ-stimulated IL- 1 β synthesis and release from primary microglia and microglia cell lines. Furthermore, <b>nimodipine</b> also inhibited Aβ-induced IL- 1 βin vivo accumulation at concentrations known to be reached in the CNS. Finally, <b>nimodipine</b> protected microglia from Aβ-dependent cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These data suggest that alleviation of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease following <b>nimodipine</b> administration might be due to an anti-inflammatory effect and point to a novel role for <b>nimodipine</b> as a centrally acting anti-inflammatory drug...|$|E
