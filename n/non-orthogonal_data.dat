50|$|One of Unix's several {{groundbreaking}} advances was abstract devices, which {{removed the}} need for a program to know or care what kind of devices it was communicating with. Older operating systems forced upon the programmer a record structure and frequently <b>non-orthogonal</b> <b>data</b> semantics and device control. Unix eliminated this complexity with the concept of a data stream: an ordered sequence of data bytes which can be read until the end of file. A program may also write bytes as desired and need not (and can't easily) declare how many there will be, or how they will be grouped.|$|E
40|$|Factor {{analysis}} for <b>non-orthogonal</b> <b>data</b> {{was done to}} assess the straight and interaction effects of certain genetic and environmental factors on birth weight. While the interaction effects did not assume any significance, straight effects of gestational age, parity, mother's weight, and sex were significant in influencing the birth weight. Mother's height and socio-economic status of the family had no significant effect on birth weight. Step-up multiple regression analysis showed that contribution to the total variance explained (R 2 x 100 = 29. 7 per cent) in birth weight was about 15, 7, 5, and 2 per cent, respectively, from gestational age, parity, mother's weight, and sex of the baby. Correction of the mean weight curve was done by successive graphic approximation method and residuals were further minimized...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} written {{primarily}} {{to illustrate the}} process of fitting constants to <b>non-orthogonal</b> <b>data.</b> The design of the experiment, on the pruning of lower branches of coffee-trees, was systematic (see plan at the beginning). Three constants were fitted, representing respectively the treatment contrast, the difference between upper and {{lower half of the}} field and the linear gradient of fertility across the field. The use of the residual sum of squares for the estimation of error is not, of course, logically correct but it is unlikely to lead to seriously wrong conclusions if caution is exercised. In the event, the procedure failed to eliminate any soil heterogeneity (see Analysis of Variance, p. 288). Inspection of the data showed that much of the heterogeneity would have appeared in a quadratic term in the gradient. When, as here, the number of data is very small, it is particularly dangerous to allow the data to suggest the scheme of adjustment, because this will lead to an over-estimation of the precision of the experiment. The conclusion was that not pruning the lower branches of tree gave an increase in yield of 104 ± 50 kg (dry fruits) per plot, with a general mean of 743 kg per plot...|$|E

50|$|Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System {{technology}} {{was developed by}} Simbex (Lebanon, NH) {{with support from the}} National Institutes of Health (NIH; R44HD40743 and R01HD048638) to measure and record in vivo head impact exposure (i.e. frequency, location, and kinematics of head impact). Since 2003, the core technology, which includes an array of <b>non-orthogonal</b> accelerometers, <b>data</b> acquisition, RF telemetry hardware, and post-processing software, has been used in a variety of sport and military applications to investigate the relationship between head kinematics and brain injury. This research has enabled and contributed to improved helmet design and testing methods, changes to sporting rules and regulations, and novel approaches to improve player safety. Additionally, HIT System technology is the essential feature of Riddell’s Sideline Response System (SRS) - a real-time monitoring tool used by American football teams to manage an athlete’s head impact exposure.|$|R
40|$|Instability {{is related}} to {{exponentially}} growing eigenmodes. Interestingly, when finite time intervals are considered, growth rates of certain initial perturbations can exceed the growth rates of the most unstable modes. Moreover, even when all modes are damped, such particular initial perturbations can still grow during finite time intervals. The perturbations with the largest growth rates are called singular vectors (SVs) or optimal perturbations. They not only {{play an important role}} in atmospheric ensemble predictions, but also for the theory of instability and turbulence. Starting point for a classical SV-analysis is a linear dynamical system with a known system matrix. In contrast to this traditional approach, measured data are used here to estimate the linear propagator. For this estimation, a method is applied that uses the covariances of the measured time series to find the principal oscillation patterns (POPs) that are the empirically estimated linear eigenmodes of the system. By using the singular value decomposition (SVD), we can estimate the modes of maximal growth of the propagator which are thus the empirically estimated SVs. These modes can be understood as a superposition of POPs that form a complete but in general <b>non-orthogonal</b> basis. The <b>data</b> used, originate from a differentially heated rotating annulus laboratory experiment. This experiment is an analogue of the earth's atmosphere and is used to study the development of baroclinic waves in a well controlled and reproducible way without the need of numerical approximations. Baroclinic waves form the background for many studies on SV growth and it is thus straight forward to apply the technique of empirical SV estimation to these laboratory data. To test the method of SV estimation, we use a quasi-geostrophic barotropic model and compare the known SVs from that model with SVs estimated from a surrogate data set that was generated with the help of the exact model propagator and some random noise. In that context, we also address the question of the appropriate filter technique to remove noise from the data prior to the empirical SV-analysis. We ask whether there is an objective mean to distinguish between noise and signal. Finally, we compare the results with earlier findings from a numerical low-order model of baroclinic waves for which the system matrix is known. The results from the low-order model suggested that irregular flows have in general larger SV growth rates. These findings have been used to explain the gradual increase of irregularity when the rotation rate of the annulus is increased while keeping the radial temperature contrast constant. This simple picture cannot be confirmed by the laboratory data. The singular value spectrum becomes rather broad for irregular flows similar to the SV spectrum of atmospheric models. Thus the irregularity might be related to the presence of a large number of SVs with similar growth rates and not to few SVs with exceptional large growth rates...|$|R
40|$|Multiple linear {{regression}} {{is a widely}} used statistical method. Its application, especially in the sciences, social sciences, and economics assists administrators in evaluating programs and planners in predicting future situations. The method is so common that most institutions have in their computer operation some standard programs {{to deal with the}} calculations. These traditional approaches use the method of least squares and yield an unbiased estimate of the parameters. The general linear model used is Y = Xβ+ e, where E(e) = 0, E(ee`) = σ 2 In and X is (n x p) and full rank. The least squares estimate of the unknown parameter vector β is then given by β = (X'X) - 1 X̀Y. This approach, however, often produces unsatisfactory (or even inaccurate) results if the data vectors are ill-conditioned. Such ill-conditioning is a result of <b>non-orthogonal</b> <b>data</b> vectors and inter-correlation of response variables that are unfortunately quite common in all fields. In recent years it has become obvious that for these applications the unbiased estimate is not necessarily the best over-all in terms of mean square error. A biased estimate may actually be of more value in analysis and prediction. Ridge estimators are biased estimators that have proved useful in these cases. In their basic form β(k) = [(X'X) + kI]- 1 X́Y, they differ from the least squares estimator in that they have a small positive constant added to the diagonal elements of the X́X matrix. This thesis will first deal with the situations in which the least squares approach is not adequate and the cases where the ridge estimate contributes to a usable solution. The significant work which has been done in the field will be surveyed and the main problem of determining an appropriate constant k for the ridge estimate will be considered. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|E
