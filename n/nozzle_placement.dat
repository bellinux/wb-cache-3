40|$|Generating anatomically {{realistic}} three-dimensional (3 D) {{models of}} the human sinonasal cavity for numerical investigations of sprayed drug transport presents a host of methodological ambiguities. For example, subject-specific radiographic images used for 3 D reconstructions typically exclude spray bottles. Subtracting a bottle contour from the 3 D airspace and dilating the anterior nasal vestibule for <b>nozzle</b> <b>placement</b> augment the complexity of model-building. So, we explored the question: how essential are these steps to adequately simulate nasal airflow and identify the optimal delivery conditions for intranasal sprays? In particular, we focused on particle deposition patterns in the maxillary sinus, a critical target site for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The models were reconstructed from post-surgery computed tomography scans for a 39 -year-old Caucasian male, with CRS history. Inspiratory airflow patterns during resting breathing are reliably tracked through CFD-based steady state laminar-viscous modeling and such regimes portray relative lack of sensitivity to inlet perturbations. Consequently, we hypothesized that the posterior airflow transport and the particle deposition trends should not be radically affected by the nozzle subtraction and vestibular dilation. The study involved 1 base model and 2 derived models; the latter two with nozzle contours (two different orientations) subtracted from the dilated anterior segment of the left vestibule. We analyzed spray transport in the left maxillary sinus for multiple release conditions. Similar release points, localized on an approximately 2 mm-by- 4. 5 mm contour, facilitated improved maxillary deposition in all three test cases. This suggests functional redundancy of nozzle insertion in a 3 D numerical model for identifying the optimal spray release locations. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|In industry, mixing {{tanks are}} used to {{homogenize}} two or more different products that have been combined. This work investigates the use of graph-based evolutionary algorithms (GBEAs) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to seek an enhanced design for a hydraulic mixing nozzle. This work also outlines a method for a numerical specification of a nozzle design and generation of a properly formulated CFD model to analyze it. The impact of choice of graph on the optimization process is examined using four different graphs: cycle, hypercube, toroid, and Peterson. Conclusions about the general type of nozzles designed by each graph type are included {{in order to identify}} the design strengths associated with each graph. This work provides insight into the considerations required to obtain more desirable performance from a mixing nozzle. Characteristics that influence jet distance and trajectory are reviewed. Some of these characteristics include the shape and size of horn used to guide the jet and the open entrainment area between the horn and the jet. The relative importance of each of these traits and which traits have the most significant impact on the quality of a given design are also explored. Suggestions for nozzle design are summarized. This information allows the most limiting factors of a tank mixing design to be mitigated to the largest extent possible.;This work illustrates that using magnification ratio or velocity alone does not result in an optimized design. These factors must be weighted to obtain a design that balances these factors for the geometry of fluid volume to be mixed. Additionally, this work shows that <b>nozzle</b> <b>placement</b> is perhaps more significant than nozzle design for optimum mixing with minimum power consumption...|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” The {{advantages}} of using multi-head gantry machines in {{printed circuit board}} assembly are flexibility and efficiency combined with a relatively low acquisition price. However, the practical efficiency of this machine type depends on several difficult decisions that have to be made by a machine operator. In this paper two basic problems that {{have a significant effect on}} the use of a gantry machine are considered. The first problem deals with the pick-ups of the components using the <b>nozzles</b> in the <b>placement</b> arm and the second problem is about selecting suitable <b>nozzles</b> into the <b>placement</b> arm. The goal is to achieve a better understanding of the difficulty of these two problems and build up effective algorithms that can be used to solve problems in a restricted environment where the rest of the factors, such as the placement order of the components or the component to feeder slot assignment, are fixed.

50|$|A wet direct port nitrous system {{introduces}} nitrous {{and fuel}} directly into each intake port on the engine. These systems are {{also known as}} direct port nitrous systems. Normally, these systems combine nitrous and fuel through several nozzles similar in design to a wet single-point nozzle, which mixes and meters the nitrous and fuel delivered to each cylinder individually, allowing each cylinder's nitrous/fuel ratio to be adjusted without affecting the other cylinders. Note {{that there are still}} several ways to introduce nitrous through a direct port system. There are several different types of <b>nozzles</b> and <b>placements</b> ranging from fogger nozzles that requires one to drill and tap the manifold, to specialty direct port E.F.I. nozzles that fit into the fuel injector ports along with the fuel injectors.|$|R
40|$|Large {{air-cooled}} {{heat exchangers}} (ACHEs) are most popularly {{implemented in the}} petrochemical and power industries at arid locations. They operate on a simple concept of convective heat transfer, whereby air in the surrounding atmosphere is caused to flow across a tube bundle, which in turn transports a process fluid. The distribution {{and direction of the}} process fluid flow may furthermore be guided via a set of appropriately located header boxes, which essentially consist of a collection of welded flat plates and nozzle attachments. Perforations on one of the faces of these boxes serve as an interface to the tube bundle. The overall design and construction of an ACHE is commonly regulated by an American Petroleum Institute (API) standard, which is required to be used in conjunction with acceptable design codes. In spite of this, the design of certain header box configurations remains of prominent concern. It is the focus of the present study to investigate the approach adopted for a header box variant labelled as the removable cover type. In this configuration, one of the plates used to construct the header box is fastened and sealed by a collection of bolted joints and a gasket, allowing it to be removed. One appropriate design code for the header box equipment is the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) boiler and pressure vessel code. However, it provides no specific approach pertaining to the removable cover design. Instead it has been commonplace in industry for a number of aspects from this code to be synthesized, together with a collection of assumptions surrounding the header box behaviour, into an all encompassing design by rule approach. In this approach, the header box behaviour is accepted as being planar, whilst circumstances such as nozzle attachments and associated loading would suggest that a more comprehensive approach should be undertaken. The aim of the present study is therefore to critically evaluate the current practice, and establish its adequacy. To do so, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) of an example header box design is developed. Subsequent comparisons with the stress distribution predicted via current practice show that the existing analytical model gives inaccurate and, in cases, overly conservative results. A new analytical approach developed from rigid frame theory is demonstrated to provide improved correlation with FEM. The linear elastic design by analysis approach, presented in the ASME code, is also utilised as a method for establishing design adequacy. Results obtained via design by analysis incorporating the finite element method are shown to be less conservative than those arising from design by rule methods. The design by analysis approach is also used to conduct a more detailed investigation of <b>nozzle</b> <b>placement</b> and external loading. In general, the effect of including a nozzle did not result in a significant increase in side plate stress, with failure more likely to occur within the nozzle wall.

40|$|The {{management}} of combustion dynamics in gas turbine combustors {{has become more}} challenging as strict NOx/CO emission standards have led to engine operation in a narrow, lean regime. While premixed or partially premixed combustor configurations such as the Lean Premixed Pre-vaporized (LPP), Rich Quench Lean burn (RQL), and Lean Direct Injection (LDI) have shown a potential for reduced NOx emissions, they promote a coupling between acoustics, hydrodynamics and combustion {{that can lead to}} combustion instabilities. These couplings can be quite complex, and their detailed understanding is a pre-requisite to any engine development program and for the development of predictive capability for combustion instabilities through high-fidelity models. ^ The overarching goal of this project is to assess the capability of high-fidelity simulation to predict combustion dynamics in low-emissions gas turbine combustors. A prototypical lean-direct-inject combustor was designed in a modular configuration so that a suitable geometry could be found by test. The combustor comprised a variable length air plenum and combustion chamber, air swirler, and fuel nozzle located inside a subsonic venturi. The venturi cross section and the fuel nozzle were consistent with previous studies. ^ Test pressure was 1 MPa and variables included geometry and acoustic resonance, inlet temperatures, equivalence ratio, and type of liquid fuel. High-frequency pressure measurements in a well-instrumented metal chamber yielded frequencies and mode shapes as a function of inlet air temperature, equivalence ratio, fuel <b>nozzle</b> <b>placement,</b> and combustor acoustic resonances. The parametric survey was a significant effort, with over 105 tests on eight geometric configurations. A good dataset was obtained {{that could be used for}} both operating-point-dependent quantitative comparisons, and testing the ability of the simulation to predict more global trends. ^ Results showed a very strong dependence of instability amplitude on the geometric configuration of the combustor, i. e., its acoustic resonance characteristics, with measured pressure fluctuation amplitudes ranged from 5 kPa (0. 5 % of mean pressure) to 200 kPa (~ 20 % of mean pressure) depending on combustor geometry. The stability behavior also showed a consistent and pronounced dependence on equivalence ratio and inlet air temperature. Instability amplitude increased with higher equivalence ratio and with lower inlet air temperature. A pronounced effect of fuel nozzle location on the combustion dynamics was also observed. Combustion instabilities with the fuel nozzle at the throat of the venturi throat were stronger than in the configuration with fuel nozzle 2. 6 mm upstream of the nozzle. ^ A second set of dynamics data was based on high-response-rate laser-based combustion diagnostics using an optically accessible combustor section. High-frequency measurements of OH*-chemiluminescence and OH-PLIF and velocity fields using PIV were obtained at a relatively stable, low equivalence ratio case and a less stable case at higher equivalence ratio. PIV measurements were performed at 5 kHz for non-reacting flow but glare from the cylindrical quartz chamber limited the field of view to a small region in the combustor. ^ Quantitative and qualitative comparisons were made for five different combinations of geometry and operating condition that yielded discriminating stability behavior in the experiment with simulations that were carried out concurrently. Comparisons were made on the basis of trends and pressure mode data as well as with OH-PLIF measurements for the baseline geometry at equivalence ratios of 0. 44 and 0. 6. Overall, the ability of the simulation to match experimental data and trends was encouraging. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) analysis was performed on two sets of computations - a global 2 -step chemistry mechanism and an 18 -step chemistry mechanism - and the OH-PLIF images to allow comparison of dynamic patterns of heat release and OH distribution in the combustion zone. The DMD analysis was able to identify similar dominant unstable modes in the combustor. ^ Recommendations for future work are based on the continued requirement for quantitative and spatio-temporally resolved data for direct comparison with computational efforts to develop predictive capabilities for combustion instabilities at relevant operating conditions. Discriminating instability behavior for the prototypical combustor demonstrated in this study is critical for any robust validation effort Unit physics based scaling of the current effort to multi-element combustors along with improvement in diagnostic techniques and analysis efforts are recommended for advancement in understanding of the complex physics in the multi-phase, three dimensional and turbulent combustion processes in the LDI combustor. ...|$|E

50|$|Overhead gantry-style {{positioning}} system's placement head {{is mounted}} on a gantry beam (X-axis). During the sequence, the beam moves perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} placement head movement, which offers two degrees of freedom (X and Y alignment) in a plane parallel to the machine table. The PCB and feeders keep stationary during placement. The PCB is located on the table by identifying global and local fiducials through a vision system. This placement head moves along the axis beams to pick components from a feeder, and then moves into position to place the components. A vacuum <b>nozzle</b> on the <b>placement</b> head moves up and down vertically to provide Z-axis and rotates in the horizontal plane to provide theta angular alignment. Sometimes a secondary vision system is also applied to check the correctness and alignment of the components after pick-up and before placement.As the PCB and feeders remain stationary in the placement sequence, the additional sources of positional inaccuracy are eliminated. Overhead gantry-style machine has the best placement accuracy among all types and is utilized by flexible placers exclusively. It offers greater flexibility and accuracy, but cannot match the speeds of other styles. Machines with multiple gantries can achieve faster speed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of environmental contaminants {{that contribute to}} smog and soot is a worldwide goal that has seen an increased focus in recent years. In the United States, for example, {{it is estimated that}} by 2014 new rules will lead to a 71 % {{reduction of}} sulfur dioxide emissions and 52 % of nitrogen oxide emissions as compared to 2005 level. Thus, medium-sized plants (100 - 500 MW) that currently do not have flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units or selective catalytic reduction systems (SCRs) will be required to adapt. Similar emission reduction efforts are expected to be adopted globally, albeit at different levels. Wet-scrubber FGD is characterized {{as one of the most}} effective SO 2 removal techniques with low operating costs. However capital cost for implementation is considered high. Hence an effective optimization procedure is required to reduce these capital costs of conversion. Power plants commonly use a lime slurry spray reaction to reduce SO 2 emissions. Control of the droplets throughout the tower geometry is essential to ensuring maximum reduction while minimizing scale. The liquid slurry is known to have density, surface tension and viscosity values that deviate from standard water spray characteristics, which complicates process optimization. In order to improve the scrubber, <b>nozzle</b> characteristics and <b>placement</b> must be optimized to reduce the cost of the system implementation and mitigate risks of inadequate pollution reduction. A series of large flow rate, hydraulic, hollow cone sprays were investigated for this study. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to examine potential scrubber designs for optimization of the system. Nozzle parameters were modeled to allow particle tracking through the system. An ANSYS Fluent Lagrangian particle tracking method was used with heat and mass transfer. The alkaline sorbent material and SO 2 reaction is modeled to determine uniformity and efficacy of the system. Volumetric chemistry mechanisms were used to simulate the reaction. These results demonstrate the expected liquid-gas interaction relative to the system efficiency. Drop size, liquid rheology, and spray array layout were examined to achieve SO 2 removal above 90 %. Wall impingement and flow pattern results were evaluated due to their impact in minimizing equipment plugging and corrosion required as for long-term scrubber utilization...|$|R
