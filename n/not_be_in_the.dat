So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E
5|$|The planned mosque will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman {{architecture}} style. It {{will have}} a concrete and glass dome, and two 55 meter high minarets. The mosque will have the bazaar and entrance on the ground floor, lecture halls in the basement, the prayer area on the upper floor and include a Muslim library. A well {{is intended to be}} placed in the center to connect the two levels and to create a pleasant atmosphere. The mosque consists of flat-like wall screens which form a dome in the center.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing {{that he had been}} told that the load times and glitches in his review copy would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final version of the game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, {{but when he was}} unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} the takeover may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger {{could lead to a}} rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{light was}} again poor {{on the fourth}} day, but England did not appeal against it. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} to erase the deficit and build a lead, to force Australia to chase a target on an erratic surface if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Bradman thought that rain might come, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensive leg theory so England would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead should a sticky wicket arise. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Menzel {{suggested}} that Arnold had seen clouds of snow blown {{from the mountains}} south of Mt. Rainier.

25|$|The first {{murder victim}} of Dennis Nilsen was {{identified}} in 2006 as 14-year-old Stephen Dean Holmes. Formal identification was confirmed via {{a combination of}} circumstantial evidence and by Nilsen identifying {{a photograph of the}} youth shown to him by police (all bone fragments found at Melrose Avenue had been destroyed). Nilsen was not charged with this murder as the Crown Prosecution Service decided that a prosecution would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public interest, and would not contribute to his current sentence.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the {{government}} stopped issuing consents for more new marine farms while they reformed the legislation. The consents had operated under a system overseen {{by both the}} Ministry of Fisheries and the regional councils. The reforms aimed to streamline these applications for both freshwater and marine farms. Industry farmers objected to the moratorium, {{on the grounds that}} delaying expansion and diversification could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interest of the industry. Māori groups considered they were especially affected since they were the main applicants for coastal farms.|$|E
25|$|But, at {{the quantum}} phase transition, the {{localization}} lengths of the electrons becomes infinite (i.e. they delocalize) and this compromises the Fermi-liquid assumption of an inherently free electron gas (where individual electrons must be well-distinguished). The quantum Hall transition will therefore <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fermi-liquid universality class, {{but in the}} F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical percolation picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) {{and we need to}} understand the delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, Bartlett and Van Buren {{noted that}} lunar laser ranging had {{detected}} a 2-km offset between the moon’s center of figure and its center of mass. This indicates an asymmetry {{in the distribution}} of Fe (abundant in the Moon's core) and Al (abundant in its crust and mantle). If pressure did not contribute equally to spacetime curvature as does mass-energy, the moon would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orbit predicted by classical mechanics.

25|$|Colvin {{is nervous}} about {{meeting with the}} mayor because of his history with the police force but finds that Carcetti will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meeting due to his meeting with the {{governor}} in Annapolis. Steintorf and Gerry are skeptical about the technique, characterizing it as tracking of students and leaving a subgroup behind. Colvin claims that the children are already being left behind and laughs about the system's refusal to admit its failings. Steintorf brings the meeting to a swift close. As they leave Colvin berates his shortcomings in the political arena. Parenti blames the failure on the process and seeks consolation in his academic findings.|$|E

During this time Rafsanjani relocated from Tehran to Qom, where the country's religious leaders sit. However, for the most part, Rafsanjani was silent about the controversial 12 June election and its aftermath.|$|E
