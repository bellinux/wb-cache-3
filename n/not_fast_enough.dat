This was <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to advance to the next round, and they were eliminated from competition.|$|E
5|$|Malawi competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, {{which was}} held from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The country's {{participation}} at London marked its ninth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two track and field athletes; Mike Tebulo and Ambwene Simukonda, and one swimmer; Joyce Tafatatha. Tebulo and Simukonda qualified through wildcard places for their respective events. Tebulo {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening and closing ceremonies. Tebulo finished 44th in the men's marathon, while Simukonda did not advance beyond {{the first round of the}} women's 400 metres. Tafatatha won her heat in the women's 50 metre freestyle but her time was <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to allow her to progress into the semi-finals of the event.|$|E

5|$|Nhu {{then decided}} that his men {{would go to}} Lâm Thao to {{reinforce}} their colleagues. On the way, they stopped at {{the nearby town of}} Kinh Khe, where the instructor, Nguyen Quang Kinh, and one of his two wives were slain by VNQDĐ members in an apparent revenge killing. Kinh had previously been affiliated with the VNQDĐ, whose members took him away. His wife had tried to follow him, so the VNQDĐ captured her as well. French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been killed because he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through Lâm Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's control on the town until the afternoon. They were hopeful that the attack in Yên Bái would have been successfully completed by then, and that the mutineers and people of Yên Bái would come to Lâm Thao and stage their forces before attacking the barracks at Phu Tho. However, they were <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E
5|$|L'Hermite's {{three other}} ships all survived the {{hurricane}} relatively intact {{and were able}} to continue their journey to Europe unimpeded, the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms. In late September the squadron broke up, Régulus sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October, the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year. Président was less successful: at 03:30 on 27 September, while sailing in the Bay of Biscay at , Captain Labrosse sighted six ships of the line. This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, which had been sent to the Bay of Biscay to await the return of Willaumez from the Caribbean. Immediately giving chase, Louis found that his ships of the line were <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to catch the French frigate, which began to outdistance {{the main body of the}} squadron. However one of the small 18-gun sloops attached to the squadron, HMS Despatch under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate, coming within firing range at 18:45.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{their opponents}} {{were able to}} lift and the final saw Steve Lundquist of the United States set a new world record of 1m 1.65s; Evans took bronze, 0.98s behind silver medallist Davis. Evans was unable to {{maintain}} the pace that he had set in the heats, clocking a time 0.10s slower. In the 200m, Evans came second in his heat but was <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to make the final, swimming 1.47s slower than the slowest qualifier to finish 17th. The final event for Evans was the 4×100m medley relay. Evans was joined by Kerry, while Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell swum the butterfly and freestyle respectively. The Americans were overwhelming favourites, boasting the gold medallists {{in three of the}} respective individual events. The hosts easily won the gold by almost four seconds; Evans and the Australians were third, relegated from the silver medal by just 0.02s by the Canadian team, having been in the bronze medal position at every change. Evans recorded the second-fastest breaststroke split, slower than Lundquist, but quicker than the rest, including Davis.|$|E

However, the fluxional process is <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to produce averaging in the IR spectrum. Thus, three absorptions are seen for each isomer. The νCO bands for bridging CO ligands are around 1780cm−1 whereas νCO bands for terminal CO ligands are about 1980cm−1.|$|E

25|$|The Plano Real ("Real Plan"), instituted in {{the spring}} 1994, sought to break inflationary {{expectations}} by pegging the real to the US dollar. Inflation was brought down to single digit annual figures, but <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the transition phase of the Plano Real. This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, no shortage of foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of the debt crisis of the 1980s faded.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{released its}} final report on December 15, 1998. It documented ambiguities and confusion {{in both the}} French and UN responses. Regarding Opération Turquoise, it regretted that the intervention took place too late, though it noted that this {{was better than the}} non-response from the UN and the opposition by the U.S. and U.K. governments to such a response. The report documented mixed success at disarming the Rwandan Army and militias, but a definite and systematic attempt (though <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> as far as then-General Paul Kagame of the opposing RPF forces was concerned, in documentation of the latter's communications with the French forces).|$|E

Beth Morgan hit Nitschke away and {{attempted}} to runs to take England to seven runs and a victory, but was <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> for Cameron's throw and was run out, tying the scores once again. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the match—Cameron scored the solitary six.|$|E

On spotting the Président, the squadron gave chase but the ships of the line were <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to catch her. However, Dispatch {{was able to get}} within firing range. Dispatch proceeded to harry Président with her forward guns, forcing Président to turn towards Blanche. Seeing Président turn, Louis ordered Canopus to fire, even though the range was extreme. Realizing {{that the rest of the}} British squadron would arrive shortly, Président struck, surrendering to Dispatch. Président had suffered only minor damage and neither side suffered any casualties. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS President. Hawkins had been made post-captain two days prior to the action.|$|E
25|$|Kawauchi {{improved}} his half marathon best to 1:02:40 at the Kagawa Marugame Half Marathon in February 2011, finishing inside the top ten. He {{set his sights}} on a top eight finish at the Tokyo Marathon later that month but exceeded his own expectations by running a time of 2:08:37 hours and taking third place. As the best Japanese performer, he earned selection for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. In June he entered the Okinoshima Ultramarathon and led the 50km race right up to the last 600 metres, at which point he collapsed due to heat stroke and failed to finish the race. At the World Championship Marathon held in Daegu he finished in 18th place – a performance which helped the Japanese team including Hiroyuki Horibata and Kentaro Nakamoto to a silver medal in the 2011 World Marathon Cup. He competed extensively {{towards the end of the}} year and his form held well: he managed fourth at the Osaka Marathon, then took third at the Fukuoka Marathon. The latter was an Olympic qualifying race and he was the first placed Japanese. The Japan Association of Athletics Federations played down his selection choices, saying his time of 2:09:57 was <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough,</b> but Kawauchi upturned tradition by saying the race was a warm-up for the second qualifier in Tokyo – Japanese runners rarely enter both selection races due to their proximity in the running calendar. Only two weeks later Kawauchi entered the Hofu Marathon and was runner-up behind Mongolia's Serod Bat-Ochir. He remarked that the fatigue from the previous race had hurt his chances of winning the race.|$|E

Peel realised Verity was an intelligent bowler who had excellent control of where he pitched the ball, but believed he was <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to be effective for Yorkshire. Meanwhile, critics in Rawdon began to see increased potential in his batting, which improved steadily; by 1924, the Yorkshire Evening Post described Verity as [...] "one of the most promising cricketers in the Leeds district".|$|E
