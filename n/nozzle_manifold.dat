40|$|Following the {{consensus}} of a workshop in Turbulence Modelling for Liquid Rocket Thrust Chambers, the current effort was undertaken to {{study the effects of}} second-order closure on the predictions of thermochemical flow fields. To reduce the instability and computational intensity of the full second-order Reynolds Stress Model, an Algebraic Stress Model (ASM) coupled with a two-layer near wall treatment was developed. Various test problems, including the compressible boundary layer with adiabatic and cooled walls, recirculating flows, swirling flows, and the entire SSME nozzle flow were studied to assess the performance of the current model. Detailed calculations for the SSME exit wall flow around the <b>nozzle</b> <b>manifold</b> were executed. As to the overall flow predictions, the ASM removes another assumption for appropriate comparison with experimental data to account for the non-isotropic turbulence effects...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{operation}} of a condensing heat exchanger under typical coal-fired flue gas conditions was investigated in Phase 1, Task 3 of the Multiple Pollutant Removal Using the Condensing Heat Exchanger test program. The specific goal of this task {{was to determine the}} amount of wear, if any, on the Teflon{reg_sign}-covered heat transfer tubes in a condensing heat exchanger. A pilot-scale single-stage condensing heat exchanger (CHX{reg_sign}) was operated under typical coal-fired flue gas conditions on a continuous basis for a period of approximately 10 months. Operating conditions and particulate loadings for the test unit were monitored, Teflon{reg_sign} film thickness measurements were conducted, and surface replications (which duplicate the surface finish at the microscopic level) were taken at various times during the test. Data from the test indicate that virtually no decrease in Teflon{reg_sign} thickness was observed for the coating on the first two rows of heat exchanger tubes, even at high inlet particulate loadings (400 mg/dscm [0. 35 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu]). Evidence of wear was present only at the microscopic level, and even then was very minor in severity. Operation at high inlet particulate loadings resulted in accumulated ash deposits within the heat exchanger.

40|$|Abstract;- Aircrafts {{need to be}} {{grounded}} for want of routine scheduled maintenance and inspection after certain period of flying hours. During such maintenance practices, the turbo-propeller engines are kept dismantled, un-installed and non-operative conditions {{for a longer period}} even up to two years. During this non-operative period, the engines and components are susceptible to extensive chronic corrosion hazards. To prevent this hazard, the engines and components are required to be preserved both internally and externally from corrosion that is the engine components such as turbine, turbine blades, compressor, fuel nozzles, fuel system pipelines, diffuser, combustion cum mixing chamber, expansion <b>nozzle</b> and exhaust <b>manifold.</b> Over the long experience of operating the aircrafts, it has been observed that the appliance provided by the manufacturer is only meant for internal corrosion preservation purposes of the operative and installed engines and cannot be used for external corrosion preservation of non-operative and uninstalled engines which led to drastic reduction of engine lives and unsafe operating conditions to the aircrafts due to inherent materialistic corrosive effects. The material of the turbine blades could not able to withstand its designed high combustion temperature due to the corrosion problems, which leads to unsafe engine conditions. The problem was attributable to the design factor that the high pressure cock in the fuel supply syste...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 66 To {{compete in}} today?s {{economic}} climate, petrochemical plants are strategizing on continuous long-term operation to reduce maintenance costs and increase productivity. This strategy {{has led some}} plants to go from eight years between turnarounds to 10 years. For rotating machinery such as mechanical-drive steam turbines, one factor that affects this strategy is heavy deposition on steam turbine internals, caused by impurities in the steam. These impurities results in fouling on the blade and nozzle path surfaces due to contaminated materials such as silica and sodium in the steam. As a result, turbine performance tends to deteriorate gradually. This paper introduces an innovative online washing technique to minimize the impact cause by fouling of the steam path for large multistage condensing steam turbines. This technique, although applied here to extracting-condensing turbines, is also applicable to large condensing turbines. The new technology has water injection nozzles location in the steam chest of the extraction valve rack. The injection <b>nozzles</b> are <b>manifold</b> to a water supply source, which controls a set point temperature, by controlling the water injection rate. The objective is to directly wash off deposits adhering to the blades and nozzles on the low-pressure side with minimal power turndown, and without impacting the turbine?s long-term performance. Erosion damage and thermal stress of internal parts such as chest valves and blades due to the injected water {{had to be taken}} into consideration. To properly achieve this objective, and considering the potential for damage during the online wash, a new extraction valve box had to be designed. The new design had to consider the effects of optimizing the mixing zone of the steam and water injection to generate a specific particle size, moisture propagation through condensing section, mechanical deflection of stationary components, and the overall thermodynamic analysis of each stage during the online wash. A prototype model was built and several experiments carried out based on the practical operating condition of actual steam turbines. This paper discusses the evaluations made from the model, by presenting the thermodynamic analysis results, and the finite element analysis (FEA) that was used to evaluate the strength of the internal parts during actual online washing. The final design was a compact extraction box that could replace existing models without any machining of the casing. To date there are two such installations worldwide. These are operating effectively without incident. This paper also discusses online washing test results, which were obtained using an actual steam chest with the special injected nozzle and a risk assessment of online washing in general...|$|R
5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch. High pressure arches direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done [...] "V-jet" [...] nozzles, rotating [...] "turbo" [...] <b>nozzles,</b> spinning <b>manifolds,</b> and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.|$|R
40|$|To insure safe {{performance}} during the launch and {{flight of the}} W 79 Artillery Fired Atomic Projectile (AFAP), the assembly gaps in the high explosive assembly were filled with a continuous film of polyurethane elastomer adhesive called Halthane 73 - 18. To disassemble bonded weapons like the W 79, Lawrence Livermore and Mason & Hanger, Pantex Plant have developed a chemical dissolution process that safely removes the high explosive, thereby facilitating {{the recovery of the}} pit. The solvent of choice for the W 79 AFAP was dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In the W 79 dissolution process, a continuous spray of DMSO is emitted through <b>nozzles</b> mounted in <b>manifold</b> assembly that encircles the HE assembly. The operating pressure and temperature of the DMSO are less than 100 psig and less than 160 {degrees}F. Although warm DMSO readily dissolves the LX- 10 {sup 1 } explosive, it cannot dissolve the Halthane 73 - 18 adhesive due to its chemically crosslinked structure. DMSO does, however, swell the Halthane adhesive. The resulting swollen films are soft and unable to support their own weight, yet they are not necessarily so fragile that they will tear or shred readily under the force of the DMSO spray. Indeed, the swollen Halthane films encountered in several W 79 Type 6 B 2048 units tested in the Pantex Workstation proved to be quite tenacious. They remained intact under the action of DMSO spray and became an encapsulating barrier that shielded the remaining undissolved HE. This effectively stopped the dissolution process, forcing manual removal in order to complete the dissolution process. By comparison, the swollen Halthane film was readily shredded and eliminated under the action of the DMSO spray nozzles in tests at LLNL in workstation of a different design. This apparent difference in response {{is the subject of this}} report...|$|R
40|$|A {{subsurface}} {{jet injector}} was designed, constructed, and tested to incorporate herbicides into soil {{in a single}} pass, control established weeds, and retain plant residue on the surface to reduce soil erosion. The design overcame problems inherent in earlier subsurface injection machines such as difficulty in managing residues, placement of herbicides in a layer, and poor depth control. The jet injector incorporated herbicides by jetting them up through <b>nozzles</b> in a <b>manifold</b> attached to a sweep, into soil that was fractured while passing over the blade. Jets penetrated up into the soil, improving weed control. Diffusion or mechanical mixing moved herbicides into untreated soil between herbicide bands. ^ Nozzle spacing, orifice size, and operating specifications were determined. Nozzle spacing was found by measuring weed control from trifluralin ((alpha),(alpha),(alpha) -trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine) injected in parallel lines into greenhouse flats. Herbicide was applied through a 50. 8 cm jet injector sweep to test, in the field, the two best nozzle spacings determined in the greenhouse experiment. Nozzles spaced 2 cm apart produced the best weed control. A computer simulation of trifluralin diffusion between jet bands showed the herbicide required 4 to 8 days to diffuse between 2 cm bands. Soil compaction reduced the rate of diffusion. ^ Relationships among jet penetration distance, nozzle size and type, and sweep operating variables were studied by injecting a fluorescent tracer through the injector sweep or down into disturbed soil. Results confirmed theory predicting jet penetration distance in both soil conditions. Penetration distance depended on herbicide carrier volume, operating pressure, ground speed, soil moisture, and type of soil failure. ^ A field size subsurface herbicide jet injector was constructed on a sweep plow. A treader {{was attached to the}} rear of the plow to mechanically mix herbicides after injection. The machine was tested in corn and soybeans under two tillage systems. Results showed subsurface jet injection of herbicide produced crop yields and weed control comparable to tandem disk incorporation with both systems. Injection at 1400 kPa with the treader attached was the best subsurface jet injection treatment. ...|$|R
40|$|A gas {{containment}} vessel {{that is not}} in thermal equilibrium with the bulk gas can affect its temperature measurement. The physical nature of many gas dynamics experiments often makes the accurate measurement of temperature a challenge. The environment itself typically requires that the thermocouple be sheathed, both to protect the wires and hot junction of the instrument from their environment, and to provide a smooth, rigid surface for pressure sealing of the enclosure. However, that enclosure may also be much colder than the gas to be sensed, or vice-versa. Either way, the effect of such gradients is to potentially skew the temperature measurements themselves, since heat may then be conducted by the instrument. Thermocouple designers traditionally address this problem by insulating the sheath from the thermocouple leads and hot junction as much as possible. The thermocouple leads are typically packed in a ceramic powder inside the sheath, protecting them somewhat from temperature gradients along the sheath, but there is no effective mechanism to shield the sheath from the enclosure body itself. Standard practice dictates that thermocouples be used in installations that do not present large thermal gradients along the probe. If this conduction dominates heat transfer near the tip of the probe, then temperature measurements may be expected to be skewed. While the same problem may be experienced in the measurement of temperature at various points within a solid in a gradient, it tends to be aggravated in the measurements of gas temperature, since heat transfer dependent on convection is often less efficient than conduction along the thermocouple. The proposed solution is an inefficient fin thermocouple probe. Conventional wisdom suggests that in many experiments where gas flows through an enclosure (e. g., flow in pipe, <b>manifold,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> etc.), the thermocouple be introduced flush to the surface, so as not to interfere with the flow. In practice, however, many such experiments take place where the flow is already turbulent, so that a protruding thermocouple probe has a negligible effect on the flow characteristics. The key question then becomes just how far into the flow should a thermocouple protrude in order to properly sense the gas temperature at that point. Modeling the thermocouple as an "inefficient fin" directly addresses this question. The appropriate assumptions in this case are: one-dimensional conduction along the fin; steady-state, constant, and homogeneous thermal conductivity; negligible radiation; and a uniform, constant heat transfer coefficient over the probe surface. It is noted that the nature of the ceramic-filled probe makes the key assumption of homogeneous thermal conductivity that much more conservative...|$|R
