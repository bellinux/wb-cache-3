5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (<b>noble</b> <b>gas)</b> atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> is trapped in ice.|$|E

The results do not indicate any significant variation among the samples although spallogenic <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> were effectively removed by the treatment. The isotopic compositions of the heavy <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are close {{to those of the}} terrestrial atmosphere, suggesting that the samples were seriously contaminated by atmospheric <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> during the treatment. However, the Ne isotopic ratios fall between atmospheric Ne and planetary Ne, suggesting that the primordial component of the <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> in carbonaceous material in Canyon Diablo is planetary rather than solar...|$|R
25|$|For {{pressure}} {{experiments that}} exceed 10 GPa, <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are preferred. The extended hydrostaticity greatly reduces the pressure gradient in samples at high pressure. <b>Noble</b> <b>gases,</b> such as helium, neon, and argon are optically transparent, thermally insulating, have small X-ray scattering factors and have good hydrostaticity at high pressures. Even after solidification, <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> provide quasihydrostatic environments.|$|R
5|$|Xenon is a {{chemical}} element with symbolXe and atomic number54. It is a colorless, dense, odorless <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> {{found in the}} Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> compound to be synthesized.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be a <b>noble</b> <b>gas.</b> It was originally predicted to be a <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), oganesson may turn out to be a <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E
5|$|Argon is a {{chemical}} element with symbolAr and atomic number18. It is in group 18 of {{the periodic table}} and is a <b>noble</b> <b>gas.</b> Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It {{is more than twice}} as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.|$|E
5|$|The <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> {{have full}} valence {{electron}} shells. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer electrons from heavy <b>noble</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike <b>noble</b> <b>gases,</b> an {{inert gas}} is not {{necessarily}} elemental and is often a compound <b>gas.</b> Like the <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> the tendency for non-reactivity {{is due to the}} valence, the outermost electron shell, being complete in all the inert gases. This is a tendency, not a rule, as <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> and other [...] "inert" [...] gases can react to form compounds.|$|R
50|$|Previously called inert gases, {{their name}} was changed {{as there are}} a few other gases that are inert but not <b>noble</b> <b>gases,</b> such as nitrogen. The <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are located in the far right column of the {{periodic}} table, also known as Group Zero or Group Eighteen. <b>Noble</b> <b>gases</b> are also called as aerogens but this nomenclature of the group is not officially accepted by the IUPAC.|$|R

40|$|Meteorites contain unusual {{mixtures}} of <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> that reflect contributions from several extraterrestrial environments.

40|$|The trapped <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> in meteorites come in {{two main}} varieties, usually {{referred}} to as solar and planetary. The solar <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are implanted solar-wind or solar-flare materials, and thus their relative elemental abundances provide a good estimate of those of the sun. The planetary <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> have relative elemental abundances {{similar to those in}} the terrestrial atmosphere, but there are also important distinctions. At least one other elemental pattern (subsolar) and several isotopic patterns have also been identified...|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{vertical}} trends down groups, helium {{can be seen}} as a typical <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> at the head of Group 18, but as discussed below, hydrogen's chemistry is unique and it is not easily assigned to any group.|$|E
5|$|Krypton atoms {{chemically}} {{bound to}} other nonmetals (hydrogen, chlorine, carbon) {{as well as}} some late transition metals (copper, silver, gold) have also been observed, but only either at low temperatures in <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> matrices, or in supersonic <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> jets. Similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of argon in 2000, such as argon fluorohydride (HArF), and some bound to the late transition metals copper, silver, and gold.

5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E

40|$|Noble-gas {{geochemistry}} is {{an important}} tool for understanding planetary processes from accretion to mantle dynamics and atmospheric formation(1 - 4). Central {{to much of the}} modelling of such processes is the crystal-melt partitioning of <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> during mantle melting, magma ascent and near-surface degassing(5). Geochemists have traditionally considered the 'inert' <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> to be extremely incompatible elements, with almost 100 per cent extraction efficiency from the solid phase during melting processes. Previously published experimental data on partitioning between crystalline silicates and melts has, however, suggested that <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> approach compatible behaviour, and a significant proportion should therefore remain in the mantle during melt extraction(5 - 8). Here we present experimental data to show that <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are more incompatible than previously demonstrated, but not necessarily to the extent assumed or required by geochemical models. Independent atomistic computer simulations indicate that <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> can be considered as species of 'zero charge' incorporated at crystal lattice sites.
