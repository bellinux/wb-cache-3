The band released the song as a single in Italy to promote the album. Nick Rhodes has stated on the band's official website (answering an Ask Katy question in 2008 about the second single taken from Thank You) [...] "I seem to remember my concern at that time was, in fact, our record label's - Capitol in America and EMI {{for the rest of}} the world - deciding to split their decision on their choice for the first single, [...] "White Lines" [...] in the US and [...] "Perfect Day" [...] {{for the rest of the}} world. Hence, there was no worldwide focus and both territories forced to use the other track as their second single, so it didn't really work out to be an ideal situation for anyone.

B.o.B produced this one, and wrote the hook along with Sean Garrett. Mack of Sound-Savvy stated [...] "it opened with a solemn acoustic guitar intro and progresses into a soaring electric guitar backing. Lyrically, it has a tone that's both introspective and retrospective of his career thus far and his life before stardom. He informed us that this song {{is a favorite of}} both he and his team. I can definitely hear why." [...] In an interview with PopCrush B.o.B claimed his favorite track on the album to be [...] "So Hard to Breathe": [...] "My favorite track on the album is … it's called ‘Hard to Breathe.’ It may have a different name.

Certainly casting {{has a lot to}} do with his appeal; he looks the part and exudes a touching solemnity. But there is more. There's something about this kid, and the way he talks and listens and watches people, that is very convincing. Perhaps it helped that he was directed by a man who was once Valentin himself. The film is warm and intriguing, and he is the engine that pulls us through it. We care about what happens to him; high praise." ...|$|R

In November 2016, during an interview with Las Vegas Blog, Spears confirmed she had already begun work on her next album, stating: [...] "I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want the next album to sound like. ... I just know that I’m excited to get into the studio again and actually have already been back recording." [...] In January 2017, Spears received four wins out of four nominations at the 43rd People's Choice Awards, including Favorite Pop Artist, Female Artist, Social Media celebrity as well as Comedic Collaboration for a skit with Ellen DeGeneres for The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In March 2017, Spears announced that her residency show would be performed abroad as a world tour, Britney: Live in Concert. The tour is scheduled to visit Japan, Israel and the Philippines, with more dates expected to be announced in the future. This will be Spears's first time visiting Japan since her Dream Within a Dream Tour in 2002, and also her 1st time performing in the latter two countries. In April 2017, the Israeli Labor Party announced that it would reschedule its July primary election to avoid conflict with Spears' sold-out Tel Aviv concert, citing traffic and security concerns. She later announced her debut performances in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand. In addition to that, Britney has also announced her return to the tiny city-state of Singapore for her 1st ever concert performances, after having previously performed there at a closed-door event back in 1998.|$|E

5000|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{rated the}} film {{four out of}} five stars and said, [...] "Mike Leigh's trademarked cartoony dialogue, as ever lending a neo-Dickensian {{compression}} and intensity to the proceedings, is an acquired taste and I have gladly acquired it, though some haven't. <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think about the big, final confrontation between Poppy and Scott. It is well-acted and composed, and Marsan is ferociously convincing, yet the episode is closed off a little too neatly, and Poppy seems eerily unaffected by this or anything else. The effect is a kind of odd and steely invulnerability: not unattractive exactly, but disconcerting. Hawkins plays it superbly though: exactly right for the part and utterly at ease with a role that is uniquely demanding. In the factory-farmed blandness of the movies, Happy-Go-Lucky has a strong, real taste." ...|$|R
5000|$|The news of Baniszewski's parole hearing sent shockwaves {{through the}} Indiana community. Jenny Likens {{and her family}} {{appeared}} on television {{to speak out against}} Baniszewski; the members of two anti-crime groups, Protect the Innocent and Society's League Against Molestation, travelled to Indiana to oppose her parole and support the Likens family, beginning a sidewalk picket campaign. Over the course of two months, the groups collected over 40,000 signatures from the citizens of Indiana demanding that Baniszewski be kept behind bars. Despite the efforts, Baniszewski was granted parole. During the hearing, she stated: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> role <b>I</b> had in it ... because I was on drugs. I never really knew her ... I take full responsibility for whatever happened to Sylvia." [...] The parole board, taking her good behavior in prison into account, voted in favor of granting Baniszewski's freedom 3-2, and she was released.|$|R

40|$|First, I want {{to thank}} Professor Rajamani for making this work possible. From the onset I found myself {{inspired}} by his generosity, knowledge and faith. But ultimately, it was his patience, guidance and support that made this work possible. ‘Patience ’ should really be in bold, capital letters. I feel very fortunate {{to have been a}} member of Rajamani’s research lab. I could not choose someone I would rather work for. I was fortunate to find wonderful friends and colleagues in all of my lab-mates. In particular, I {{want to thank}} Shyam Sivaramakrishnan for his support during {{the early stages of the}} project. While our work overlapped only for a short time, his help and guidance got me started on the right foot. I am also very grateful for the invaluable support and ingenuity provided by Lee Alexander. His manufacturing, design and wireless programming skills were second to none and essential to our success. I have made so many wonderful friends since moving to the twin cities, but a few from back home deserve extra thanks. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would have done without Kent Thomson’s generosity and friendship. I also want to thank Andrew Sander and his wife Leslie for their amazing friendship and support. Besides being flawlessly practical and bighearted, Andrew has been on my side of post-secondary education since day one. Finally, I want to thank my family.

60|$|Is this a true {{picture of}} the actual Madrilenas? <b>What</b> <b>I</b> say is that seventy-two {{years have passed since}} it was painted and the originals have had time to change. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> say is that it was nearly always raining, and <b>I</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>sure.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> say, above all, is that I am not a Frenchman of the high Romantic moment and that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> chiefly noticed was how {{beautiful}} the mantilla was whether worn by old or young, how fit, how gentle, how winning. I suppose that the women we saw walking in it were never of the highest class; who would be driving except when we saw them going to church. But they were often of the latest fashion, with their feet hobbled by the narrow skirts, of which they lost the last poignant effect by not having wide or high or slouch or swashbuckler hats on; they were not top-heavy. What seems certain is that the Spanish women are short and slight or short and fat. I find it recorded that when a young English couple came into the Royal Armory the girl looked impossibly tall and fair.|$|R

Oyebanjo started the 2011-12 opener, a 3-1 home win against Barrow, before scoring his first goal of the season with an 87th-minute equaliser from a 25-yard free kick in a 1-1 draw at home with Eastbourne Borough, which was David Livermore's first match as manager. A hamstring injury kept him out of the team for over four weeks before making his return in a 1-1 draw away to Fleetwood Town on 2 October 2010. He assisted Murray's equalising goal in the 67th minute with a cross, and Livermore praised his performance by saying his return helped improve the team. A calf injury sustained in training kept him out of a match against Luton and his return came in a 2-1 home defeat to Bath City on 25 November 2010. After finishing the season with 40 appearances and two goals he was offered a new contract by the club in May 2011. Despite their relegation to the Conference South he considered staying with the club, being quoted as saying: [...] "I've just got to weigh up my options as I'm <b>not</b> too <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to do at the current time".|$|R
