5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} knowledge on 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood there to be five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E
25|$|The {{public library}} {{was one of}} the most {{important}} points of access for interviewees, along with the internet and bookstores. Interviewees often relied heavily on online library catalogs as safe, anonymous searches to explore lesbian fiction. Participants often did not find what they were looking for in online catalogs, but were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the lack of materials. Rothbauer suggests making materials more visible, and also improving the scope and currency of library holdings to reach these users.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the album, in a poll {{conducted}} by Billboard magazine, [...] "an overwhelming majority" [...] of people—79% of 5,195 voters—were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> Invincible entering the Billboard 200 at number one. Billboard also reported that 44% agreed with the statement, proclaiming that Jackson was [...] "still the King of Pop". Another 35% said they were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the album's ranking, but doubted Invincible would hold on for a second week {{at the top of the}} chart. Only 12% of people who responded to the poll said they were surprised by the album's charting debut because of Jackson's career over past six years and another 9% were taken aback by the album's success, in light of the negativity that preceded the album's release. Invincible received one Grammy Award nomination at the 2002 ceremony. The album's song [...] "You Rock My World" [...] was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male, but lost to James Taylor's [...] "Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight". Due to the album's release in October 2001, it was not eligible for any other nomination from the 2002 Grammy Awards. In December 2009, (just a few months after Jackson's death) readers of Billboard magazine voted Invincible as the best album of the decade, from their readers poll.|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} {{report from}} the VA Inspector General [...] "found that about 1,700 veterans in need of care were 'at risk of being lost or forgotten' after being kept off an official waiting list." [...] Schedulers for the Veterans Health Administration were instructed to change the dates for which veterans had requested an appointment in order to hide delays. At the Phoenix VA, [...] "official data showed (veterans) waited an average of 24 days for an appointment. In reality, the average wait was 115 days." [...] Shinseki called the situation [...] "reprehensible". Former VHA doctors were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the findings.|$|E

He mocked the coverage, [...] "I think {{for the most part}} everything was wonderful. Some maniac Cohos got wild, went down on the field. Which you shouldn't have done. Bad little Cohos." [...] Tigers manager Anderson stated of the events, [...] "Beer and baseball go together, they have for years. But I think those kids were doing things other than beer." [...] Columnist David Israel of the Chicago Tribune commented on July 12 that he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> what had occurred, [...] "It would have happened any place 50,000 teenagers got together on a sultry summer night with beer and reefer."

Therefore, the response from the Western Powers attempted to delay the start of negotiations for the Peace Treaty.|$|R
500|$|In {{water tank}} testing, {{engineers}} subjected G-ALYU to repeated re-pressurisation and over-pressurisation, and on 24 June 1954, after 3,057 flight cycles (1,221 actual and 1,836 simulated), G-ALYU burst open. Hall, Geoffrey de Havilland and Bishop were immediately {{called to the}} scene, where the water tank was drained to reveal that the fuselage had ripped open at {{a corner of the}} forward left escape hatch cutout. A further test reproduced the same results. [...] Based on these findings, Comet 1 structural failures could be expected at anywhere from 1,000 to 9,000 cycles. Before the Elba accident, G-ALYP had made 1,290 pressurised flights, while G-ALYY had made 900 pressurised flights before crashing. Dr P.B. Walker, Head of the Structures Department at the RAE, said he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this, noting that the difference was about three to one, and previous experience with metal fatigue suggested a total range of nine to one between experiment and outcome in the field could result in failure.|$|E
500|$|Writer Rob LaZebnik {{told the}} New York Post that the episode was {{inspired}} by his son Johnny, who came out as gay while at high school: [...] "I am a Midwestern guy, so I don’t tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve, but I thought, 'What better way to tell my son I love him than to write a cartoon about it?'". He added that he pitched the storyline three years earlier, and got approval for his script from his son. Smithers' coming out is low-key, as was Johnny's; he told the Post that as he was [...] "the gayest little kid", his parents were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> his sexual orientation. The episode aired five days before Johnny's 22nd birthday, {{and he said he}} would have a viewing party because the episode would be [...] "particularly meaningful" [...] to him. The elder LaZebnik stated his opinion that LGBT-related television can have a [...] "real impact on people's thinking".|$|E
500|$|The EBP {{revealed}} {{that it was}} <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the election of Barack Obama {{as president of the}} United States, expressing its belief that it came at a moment where the military industrial complex [...] "needed a charismatic figure to replace [...] Bush, whose poor public perception [...] of the economy had endangered the system". The organization expressed that this pattern where a staunch conservative was replaced by a conciliatory liberal had been seen in American politics throughout {{the second half of the}} 20th century, and that they did [...] "not expect a radical change in politics towards Latin America under Obama". The Macheteros cited that the president backtracked his initial condemnation of the 2009 Honduran coup d'état, the proliferation of American military bases in Colombia and constant confrontations between his administration and Hugo Chávez as supporting evidence for this statement. The EBP further emphasized that the absence of concrete movements to lift the United States embargo against Cuba as a sign that Obama was [...] "more of the same".|$|E
50|$|The High Court, having {{reserved}} judgment, {{held that}} {{it was clear from}} the address of the appellant's legal representative on sentence that she had been aware of the applicability of the minimum sentence provisions. She had submitted that substantial and compelling circumstances were present, and had <b>not</b> been <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the trial court's application of these provisions. Accordingly, the lack of reference thereto in the charge-sheet had not rendered the trial unfair.|$|R
30|$|One should <b>not</b> be <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact}} that MSE 3 DDCT and output MSE for some other vector filters can be smaller than the {{corresponding}} MSElb. This {{does not mean that}} MSElb values derived according to [43] are incorrect. This only demonstrates two things. First, the use of inter-component correlation being taken into account by a filter allows considerable improvement of filtering efficiency. Second, it is worth trying to derive lower bound MSE for multichannel filtering in the future.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} costs {{are easy to}} estimate. Exit fees include {{contractual}} obligations that must {{be paid to the}} current supplier and compensatory damages that may be awarded for breach of contract. Often, vendors combine sign-up incentives with penalties for early cancellation. Careful buyers who read the fine print should <b>not</b> be <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> exit fees. Search costs and learning costs, the effort and expense required to find an alternative supplier and learn how to use the new product, are also usually expected.|$|R
500|$|The Mortaras were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> {{the verdict}} in Feletti's trial. Momolo hoped {{that his son}} might be a major topic of {{discussion}} at an international conference {{on the future of}} Italy, but was disappointed when no such summit materialised. His cause and visit to Paris partly motivated the formation in May 1860 of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, a Paris-based organisation dedicated to the advancement of Jewish civil rights across the world. As the Italian nationalist armies advanced through the peninsula, the fall of Rome seemed imminent. In September 1860 the Alliance Israélite Universelle wrote to Momolo offering him financial and logistical support if he wished to reclaim his son by force, as [...] "getting your child back is the cause of all Israel". A separate plan was formulated by Carl Blumenthal, an English Jew serving in Giuseppe Garibaldi's nationalist volunteer corps: Blumenthal and three others would dress up as clergymen, seize Edgardo and spirit him away. Garibaldi approved this plan in 1860, but it was apparently called off after one of the conspirators died.|$|E
500|$|The {{company had}} {{believed}} that the PlayStation 3 version of Flow could be completed in four months, {{and that it would}} be ready for the November 2006 launch of the PlayStation Network. However, when it was released in February 2007, it did not include [...] "half of the original design". According to Santiago, the Sony producer assigned to the team had anticipated that they would underestimate the game's development length, and was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the delay. The game was well received; it became the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and was nominated for the Best Downloadable Game of the Year award at the 2008 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards, and for the Best Innovation award at the 2007 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards. After its release, an expansion pack and a PlayStation Portable version of the game were created by SuperVillain Studios. Thatgamecompany was not involved in the development of either project beyond ensuring that they retained the same design and art direction as the original, as they were busy creating their next title, Flower.|$|E
