5|$|In most fish, the {{esophagus}} is extremely short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have <b>no</b> <b>true</b> stomach, so that {{the esophagus}} effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E
5|$|It {{is claimed}} that the word orange has <b>no</b> <b>true</b> rhyme. There are, however, several half rhymes or near-rhymes, {{as well as some}} proper nouns and {{compound}} words or phrases that rhyme with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, but there are <b>no</b> <b>true</b> marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with}} the Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but <b>no</b> <b>true</b> intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has <b>no</b> <b>true</b> song, but its vocalisations include an excited series of tschip calls given by {{unpaired}} or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps {{are used in}} social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh teck. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from {{the small size of}} the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|Although the 1940 Olympic Games {{could not}} be held due to war, Brundage sought to {{organize}} Western Hemisphere games that {{might be able to}} proceed despite the troubled international climate. Brundage was one of the leaders in the founding of the Pan-American Games, participating in the initial discussions in August 1940 in Buenos Aires. On his return, he arranged for the American Olympic Association to be renamed the United States of America Sports Federation (USASF), which would organize the United States Olympic Committee (as the AOC would now be called) and another committee to see to American participation in the Pan-American Games. Brundage became an early member of the international Pan-American Games Commission, although the inaugural event in Buenos Aires was postponed because of the war and was eventually held in 1951, with Brundage present. Despite his role in founding them, Brundage viewed the Pan-American Games as imitative, with <b>no</b> <b>true</b> link with antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), and there are <b>no</b> <b>true</b> records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives {{a call from the}} County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have <b>no</b> <b>true</b> bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E
