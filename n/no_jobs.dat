25|$|The City Clerk in Bergen was {{merged with}} the Magistrate in Bergen from 1 April 1992. NIS was split out of the merged office from 1 May. The {{responsibility}} for the local registries {{was transferred to the}} new Norwegian Ship Registries from 1 July. At the time there were 12,000 ships registered in NOR and 880 in NIS. The staff at the NIS office was increased from six to eight. <b>No</b> <b>jobs</b> were lost at the magistrate offices and district courts, as these were able to use the workforce for other tasks. The Norwegian Ship Registries became part of the Ministry of Trade and Industry from 1996.|$|E
500|$|Phnom Penh, {{which had}} a pre-war {{population}} of around 600,000, was overwhelmed by refugees (who continued to flood in from the steadily collapsing defense perimeter), growing to a size of around two million. These helpless and desperate civilians had <b>no</b> <b>jobs</b> and {{little in the way}} of food, shelter, or medical care. Their condition (and the government's) only worsened when Khmer Rouge forces gradually gained control of the banks of the Mekong. From the riverbanks, their mines and gunfire steadily reduced the river convoys bringing relief supplies of food, fuel, and ammunition to the slowly starving city (90 percent of the Republic's supplies moved by means of the convoys) from South Vietnam. After the river was effectively blocked in early February, the U.S. began an airlift of supplies into Pochentong Airport. This became increasingly risky, however, due to communist rocket and artillery fire, which constantly rained down on the airfield and city. The Khmer Rouge cut off overland supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on 17 April 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling [...] "tortured the capital almost continuously," [...] inflicting [...] "random death and mutilation" [...] on millions of trapped civilians.|$|E

2500|$|The {{imperial}} treasury was bankrupted {{by rising}} state debt and falling revenues. Alexander {{was aware of}} the crisis but never tackled its root cause, the oversized peacetime army of 800,000 men. Alexander expected future wars in Southern Europe and the Middle East, and feared that mass dismissal of veteran soldiers would cause insurrection. He could not let them go: they were not needed in their native villages, and there were <b>no</b> <b>jobs</b> in the cities. Instead of reducing the army to an affordable peacetime size, Alexander tried to cut spending through the establishment of self-sustaining military settlements, which failed [...] "from start to finish". He replaced expensive field maneuvers with drill exercise and parades, alienating experienced commanders and contributing to dissatisfaction of the nobility.|$|E

All you hev to do is to watch him, how he hunts the sun. It never gets too hot fer Monty. Wal, I reckon he was a little more prepossessin' once. The story thet come to us about Monty is this: He got caught out in a prairie fire an' could hev saved himself easy, but there was a lone ranch right in the line of fire, an' Monty knowed the rancher was away, an' his wife an' baby was home. He knowed, too, the way the wind was, thet the ranch-house would burn. It was a long chance he was takin'. But he went over, put the woman up behind him, wrapped the baby an' his hoss's haid in a wet blanket, an' rode away. Thet was sure some ride, I've heerd. But the fire ketched Monty at the last.
