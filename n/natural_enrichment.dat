A substantial amount of genetic variation in vitamin B- 12 content was detected among raw milk samples of 544 first-lactation Dutch Holstein Friesian cows. The presence of genetic variation between animals in vitamin B- 12 content in milk indicates that the genotype of the cow affects the amount of vitamin B- 12 that ends up in her milk and, consequently, that the average milk vitamin B- 12 content of the cow population can be increased by genetic selection.

However, relatively {{little is known about the}} associated changes in species composition. In this study, the bacterioplankton community composition of one such lake was studied following <b>natural</b> nutrient <b>enrichment</b> to investigate the resistance of the system to environmental change. Heywood Lake is an enriched freshwater maritime Antarctic lake, with nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations significantly higher than its more oligotrophic neighbours (by at least an order of magnitude). This major change in lake chemistry has occurred following large increases in the fur seal population over the last 30  years. Using analysis of 16 S rRNA gene fragments, fatty acid methyl ester analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, significant changes are reported in lake microbiology which have resulted in a distinct bacterioplankton community. In comparison to its more oligotrophic neighbours, nutrient-enriched Heywood Lake has a high bacterioplankton population density, reduced species richness and an increasing evenness among key groups.

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the most}} {{effective}} targets for control of zoonotic foodborne pathogens in the farm to fork continuum is their elimination in food animals destined for market. Phage therapy for Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in ruminants, the main animal reservoir of this pathogen, is a popular research topic. Since phages active against this pathogen may be endemic in host animals and their environment, they may emerge during trials of phage therapy or other interventions, rendering interpretation of trials problematic. Methods During separate phage therapy trials, sheep and cattle inoculated with 10 9 to 10 10 [*]CFU of E. coli O 157 :H 7 soon began shedding phages dissimilar in plaque morphology to the administered therapeutic phages. None of the former was previously identified in the animals or in their environment. The dissimilar “rogue” phage was isolated and characterized by host range, ultrastructure, and genomic and proteomic analyses. Results The “rogue” phage (Phage vB_EcoS_Rogue 1) is distinctly different from the administered therapeutic Myoviridae phages, {{being a member of the}} Siphoviridae (head: 53 nm; striated tail: 152 x 8 nm). It has a 45. 8 kb genome which is most closely related to coliphage JK 06, a member of the “T 1 -like viruses” isolated in Israel. Detailed bioinformatic analysis reveals that the tail of these phages is related to the tail genes of coliphage lambda. The presence of “rogue” phages resulting from <b>natural</b> <b>enrichments</b> can pose problems in the interpretation of phage therapeutic studies. Similarly, evaluation of any interventions for foodborne or other bacterial pathogens in animals may be compromised unless tests for such phages are included to identify their presence and potential impact. </p...|$|R

To test this, E_N and the respiratory exchange ratio (R) which equals the respiratory quotient (RQ) in the steady state, were measured simultaneously in seven subjects. Rest and exercise protocols, performed under conditions of room air (sea level) and hypoxic (inspired O_ 2 fraction = 0. 15) breathing, were chosen to cause a variety of patterns of oxidative substrate utilization. Work rates were performed both below and above the subject's lactate threshold (LT). Work above the LT was expected to cause the greatest increase in E_N reflecting greater utilization of glucose. There was significant intersubject (P < 0. 05) but not intrasubject variability in resting E_N. By 40 min of exercise, E_N increased significantly (P < 0. 05) over resting values in all exercise protocols during both room air and hypoxia conditions. In the room air studies, we found no difference in E_N during the below-LT work, even though there were significant increases in O_ 2 uptake (VO_ 2). In contrast, above-LT work resulted in significantly greater increases in E_N by 20 and 40 min of exercise (P < 0. 05). Contrary to our expectations, we observed no separate effect by hypoxia on the E_N during exercise. Both E_N and R tended to increase from rest to exercise, but during exercise there was no overall correlation between R and the E_N. E_N reflects changes in endogenous substrate utilization over relatively long periods of time such as at rest, but delays in the appearance of ^(13) CO_ 2 at the mouth due to dilution in body CO_ 2 pools, and possibly isotopic fractionation, preclude the usefulness of E_N as an indicator of endogenous fuel mix during short-term exercise...|$|E

These are of fundamental interest to improve our understanding of correlated topological systems, and moreover practical applications in phase coherent devices and quantum applications have been proposed. Proximity-induced superconductivity promises to allow such experiments on non-superconducting Weyl semi-metals.

Simple ion irradiation may thus serve as a powerful tool to fabricating topological quantum devices from mono-arsenides, even on an industrial scale. Comment: accepted by Science Advance...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{manganese}} (Mn) fractionation in samples {{collected from}} the water column and sediments in an environmental protection area in the Alto do Paranapanema Basin (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). The three locations studied showed equivalent Mn levels, with moderate seasonal differences (p Mn bound to carbonates approximate to exchangeable Mn approximate to Mn bound to silicates > Mn bound to organic matter (p labile Mn approximate to non-labile Mn. The data suggest that Mn has a <b>natural</b> origin (<b>Enrichment</b> Factor EF < 2; Geoaccumulation Index I(geo) < 0) and moderate environmental risk (Risk Assessment Code RAC similar to 30 %). At the same time, under certain conditions some manganese species could be present {{in a state of}} equilibrium between the water column and sediment. These results could provide a basis for Mn management in the Alto do Paranapanema Basin.

2500|$|Tritium, {{the mass}} 3 isotope of {{hydrogen}} is deliberately created for thermonuclear weapons use, at government-owned reactors like Watts Bar, by irradiating lithium 6 with neutrons to fission i1. Light water reactors, the standard {{kind in the}} USA, generate small quantities of deuterium by neutron capture in the water. This consumes enough neutrons that the <b>natural</b> uranium needs <b>enrichment</b> to raise its fissile U-235 content from 0.72% to 3.6% for Pressurised Water Reactors. Canada's CANDU design uses [...] "heavy water", deuterium oxide, and can use un-enriched uranium because deuterium captures so {{very few of the}} neutrons. So the rate of production of tritium from the small amount of deuterium in US reactors must be quite low.|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} the energy value of fermentable starch, 10 groups of 14 pigs {{were assigned to}} one of two dietary treatments comprising diets containing 45 % of either pregelatinized (P) or retrograded (R) corn starch. In both diets, a contrast in <b>natural</b> 13 C <b>enrichment</b> between the starch and nonstarch components of the diet was created to partition between enzymatic digestion and fermentation of the corn starch. Energy and protein retention were measured using indirect calorimetry after adapting the pigs to the diets for 3 wk. Fecal 13 C enrichment was higher in the R-fed pigs (P < 0. 001) and 43 % of the R resisted enzymatic digestion. Energy retained as protein was unaffected and energy retained as fat was 29 % lower than in P-fed pigs (P < 0. 01). Prior to the morning meal, end products of fermentation substantially contributed to substrate oxidation in the R-fed pigs. During the 3 – 4 h following both meals, heat production was higher (P < 0. 05) in P-fed pigs, but this was not preferentially fueled by glucose from corn starch. Digestible energy intake, metabolizable energy intake, and energy retention were reduced (P < 0. 05) in R-fed pigs compared with P-fed pigs by 92, 54, and 33 kJ/(kg 0. 75 · d), respectively. Therefore, the energy values of fermented resistant starch were 53, 73, and 83 % of the digestible, metabolizable, and net energy values of enzymatically degradable starch, respectively. Creating a contrast in <b>natural</b> 13 C <b>enrichment</b> between starch and nonstarch dietary components provides a promising, noninvasive, in vivo method for estimating the proportion of dietary starch fermented in the gastrointestinal trac...|$|R
