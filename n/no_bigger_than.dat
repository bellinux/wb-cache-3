During the warmer summer months, an {{estimated}} 4–6 trillion brine shrimp inhabit the lake. Brine shrimp have no food value for humans, but are a staple for birds of the region.

The laser {{is powered by a}} single electron which passes through two quantum dots; a double quantum dot. The electron moves from a state of higher energy, to a state of lower energy whilst emitting photons in the microwave region. These photons bounce off mirrors to create a beam of light; the laser.|$|E

Joining the cast in 2002, she continued with the series until its cancellation later that same year. She later had significant guest appearances on NYPD Blue, Dharma & Greg, , House and NCIS. She also appeared as herself in Standing Tall at Auschwitz, which was a History Channel documentary on the Ovitz family, and in <b>No</b> <b>Bigger</b> <b>Than</b> a Minute, an independent documentary on dwarfism which aired on the PBS program P.O.V.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} {{was designed}} and constructed {{in less than a}} month. Sputnik 1 was a simple polished metal sphere <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> a beach ball, containing batteries powering a transmitter using 4 external communication antennae. Korolev personally managed the assembly at a hectic pace; and the satellite was placed in orbit using a rocket that had successfully launched only once before. International response to the accomplishment was electrifying, and political ramifications continued for decades. Nikita Khrushchev was pleased with this success, and encouraged launch of a more sophisticated satellite less than a month later in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 3 November.|$|E

The recruits are then {{handed over to the}} Ministry of Public Administration and Security for later administration, and are given a three-week police training before being deployed to various police units (that are each <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the size of a company) throughout the country. Depending on their assignment, the Auxiliary Policemen may assist the national police with a wide array of police works, such as riot policing, traffic control, crowd control, surveillance and patrol.

25|$|These stars, {{known as}} neutron stars, are {{extremely}} small—on {{the order of}} radius 10km, <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> {{the size of a}} large city—and are phenomenally dense. Their period of rotation shortens dramatically as the stars shrink (due to conservation of angular momentum); observed rotational periods of neutron stars range from about 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per second) to several seconds. When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation each revolution. Such neutron stars are called pulsars, and were the first neutron stars to be discovered. Though electromagnetic radiation detected from pulsars is most often in the form of radio waves, pulsars have also been detected at visible, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.|$|E

500|$|Marrakesh has {{the largest}} {{traditional}} Berber market in Morocco {{and the image of}} the city is closely associated with its souks. Paul Sullivan cites the souks as the principal shopping attraction in the city: [...] "A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that morph into glittering Aladdin's Caves once you're inside." [...] Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns. Haggling is still {{a very important part of}} trade in the souks.|$|E
500|$|Bauer had a time {{consuming}} technique when painting: {{he would start}} with a small sketch, <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> a stamp, with just the basic shapes.

Most of the originals for About Gnomes and Trolls are square pictures about [...] He doodled on anything at hand, from used stationery {{to the back of}} an envelope. Many of his sketches resemble cartoon strips where the pictures get bigger and more detailed. He would also do several versions of the same finished picture, such as one where the motif is depicted in a summer and winter scene. He did not observe the traditional hierarchy in the mediums or techniques at that time. He could make a complete work in pencil or charcoal just as well as a sketch in oil.|$|E
