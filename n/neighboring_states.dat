5|$|The {{geographic}} range of Timema {{is limited to}} mountainous regions of western North America between 30° and 42° N. They are found primarily in California, {{as well as in}} a few other <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> (Oregon, Nevada, Arizona) and in northern Mexico. All are herbivores, primarily feeding on host plants found in chaparral.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{also has}} a rich African American history. Many black towns thrived in the early 20th century because of black {{settlers}} moving from <b>neighboring</b> <b>states,</b> especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-black state.|$|E
5|$|When Gümüshtekin, {{governor}} of Aleppo, {{one of the}} last independent Muslim rulers in Syria after Saladin, had conquered almost all <b>neighboring</b> <b>states,</b> he released Raynald, along with Joscelin of Courtenay and all other Christians prisoners in 1176. Raynald's ransom, fixed at 120,000 gold dinars, reflected his prestige. It was most probably paid by ManuelI Komnenos, according to Barber and Bernard Hamilton.|$|E

Much like its <b>neighboring</b> <b>state</b> of Kansas (see Alcohol laws of Kansas), Oklahoma’s approach to alcohol is quite strict. Oklahoma's approach contrasts sharply with that of another <b>neighboring</b> <b>state,</b> Missouri (see Alcohol laws of Missouri), which {{has some of the}} nation’s least restrictive alcohol control laws.|$|R

5|$|Based on its {{fundraising}} {{efforts and}} crowd {{estimates for the}} Obama inauguration, the presidential committee set its budget at $160–$170million for the inauguration, including about $45million for the gala events. The federal government contributed about $49million, including $1.2million to cover the actual swearing-in ceremony. The District of Columbia and the <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75million alone for police, fire and medical services. To help fund the efforts, President George W. Bush declared a federal state of emergency as a precaution so that funds could be sought from Federal Emergency Management Agency.|$|E
5|$|Hisar is {{a railway}} {{junction}} station, and it falls under Bikaner division of North Western Railway Zone. The first railway {{line to the}} city was laid down in 1883 when Delhi Rewari Railway was extended to Bhatinda. Currently, four broad gauge railway lines are at the station. The railway station {{is a part of}} Western Dedicated Rail Freight Corridor according to which the city is to be developed as an export-oriented industrial unit.

5|$|<b>Neighboring</b> <b>states</b> were {{alarmed by}} this {{upsetting}} {{of the balance}} of power, especially the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, who rose against Michael in rebellion. With the help of Basta, they defeated Michael at the Battle of Mirăslău, forcing the prince to leave Transylvania together with his remaining loyal troops. A Polish army led by Jan Zamoyski drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and defeated Michael at Năieni, Ceptura, and Bucov (Battle of the Teleajăn River). The Polish army also entered eastern Wallachia and established Simion Movilă as ruler. Forces loyal to Michael remained only in Oltenia.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century saw the {{division}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in three steps, among the <b>neighboring</b> <b>states.</b> The Kingdom of Prussia acquired Białystok and the surrounding region during the third partition. The city became the capital of the New East Prussia province in 1795. Prussia lost the territory following Napoleon Bonaparte's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition as the resultant 1807 Treaties of Tilsit awarded the area to the Russian Empire, which organized the region into the Belostok Oblast, with the city as the regional center.|$|E
5|$|When the Detroit–Toledo Freeway {{opened in}} 1956, several local roads {{were given the}} M-85 {{designation}} between the new freeway in Woodhaven into downtown Detroit to end at US25/M-17. The northern end was truncated in 1968 to the interchange with I-75 in Detroit when that freeway was completed in the area. In the 1980s, the Great Lakes Circle Tours were created {{by the state of}} Michigan in consultation with <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> and the province of Ontario; after the tours were created in 1986, M-85 was added to the LECT.|$|E

5|$|Because none of Gediminas' {{siblings}} {{had strong}} heirs, Gediminas {{and his children}} were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, {{the area}} of modern-day Belgium was divided into two independently-governed polities, both part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Austrian Netherlands, which {{included}} most of the territory of modern-day Belgium, had been in existence {{since the end of}} the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the section called the Spanish Netherlands from the Spanish branch of the house. The traditional principalities, duchies and counties surviving from the Middle Ages retained great regional autonomy. The economy of the Austrian Netherlands developed little, as its <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> imposed high export tariffs and the port of Antwerp remained blocked by the Dutch. Although Enlightenment ideals developed among the urban bourgeoisie, most of the population remained suspicious of education and extremely politically conservative. The Catholic church was particularly influential, despite the attempts of Emperor Joseph II to reduce its power.|$|E
5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the blind in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf and blind West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf and blind in <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the blind. Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the blind. He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E

5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{note that}} Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in {{civil war and}} conducted their own foreign diplomacy with <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> such as Nepal. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus {{the importance of the}} horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r.1260–1294) and his spiritual superior Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Yongle Emperor (r.1402–1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384–1415), the Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school. However, the Yongle Emperor's attempts were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Unsuccessful wars {{with the}} Republic of Venice, the Byzantine Empire and other <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> {{characterized}} {{the reign of}} Coloman's son, Stephen II, who succeeded his father in 1116. The earliest mention of the Székelys is {{in connection with the}} young king's first war against the Duchy of Bohemia. The Hungarian-speaking Székelys lived in scattered communities along the borders, but their groups were moved to the easternmost regions of Transylvania in the 12th century. StephenII died childless in 1131. During the reign of the blind Béla II, the kingdom was administered by his wife, Helena of Rascia, who ordered the massacre of the lords who had opposed her husband's rule. Boris Kalamanos, an alleged son of King Coloman, who attempted to seize the throne from BélaII, received no internal support.|$|E

5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted {{cutthroat}} trout (or Snake River {{cutthroat trout}}) {{is the only}} native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able}} to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E
5|$|The dynasty {{was founded}} by the Lǐ family (李), who seized power during the decline and {{collapse}} of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was briefly interrupted when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne, proclaiming the Second Zhou dynasty (690–705) and becoming the only Chinese empress regnant. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people. Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census {{of the population in}} the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people. With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies {{of hundreds of thousands of}} troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade routes along the Silk Road. Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system. Besides political hegemony, the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over <b>neighboring</b> <b>states</b> such as those in Vietnam, Korea and Japan.|$|E
