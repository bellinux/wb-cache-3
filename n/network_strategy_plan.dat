40|$|A Bayesian system {{identification}} methodology is proposed for leakage detection in water pipe networks. The methodology properly handles the unavoidable uncertainties in measurement and modeling errors. Based on information from flow test data, it provides {{estimates of the}} most probable leakage events (magnitude and location of leakage) and the uncertainties in such estimates. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated by applying the leakage detection approach to a specific water pipe network. Several important issues are addressed, including the role of modeling error, measurement noise, leakage severity and sensor configuration (location and type of sensors) on {{the reliability of the}} leakage detection methodology. The present algorithm may be incorporated into an integrated maintenance <b>network</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>plan</b> based on computer-aided decision-making tools. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, new forms of Active Demand (AD) could be developed to help DSOs to alleviate network congestions and decrease peak capacity requirements, which could in turn reduce or postpone the need for network reinforcements. This paper explores the mechanisms that would allow DSOs to incorporate AD procedures into their <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> <b>strategies.</b> A Reference <b>Network</b> Model (RNM) is used to quantify the potential economic benefits that AD could bring to distribution grids.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> <b>strategy</b> to jointly {{allocate}} physical layer resources {{together with the}} routing and spectrum assignment in transparent nonlinear flexible-grid optical networks with static traffic demands. The physical layer resources, such as power spectral density, modulation format, and carrier frequency, are optimized for each connection. By linearizing the Gaussian noise model, both an optimal formulation and a low complexity decomposition heuristic are proposed. Our methods minimize the spectrum usage of networks, while satisfying requirements on the throughput and quality of transmission. Compared with existing schemes that allocate a uniform power spectral density to all connections, our proposed methods relax this constraint and, thus, utilize network resources more efficiently. Numerical results show that by optimizing the power spectral density per connection, the spectrum usage can be reduced by around 20 % over uniform power spectral density schemes...|$|R

40|$|Cellular <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> <b>strategies</b> {{have tended}} to focus on peak traffic {{scenarios}} rather than energy efficiency. By exploiting the dynamic nature of traffic load profiles, the prospect for greener communications in cellular access networks is evolving. For example, powering down base stations (BS) and applying cell zooming can significantly reduce energy consumption, with the overriding design priority still being to uphold a minimum quality of service (QoS). Switching off cells completely can lead to both coverage holes and performance degradation in terms of increased outage probability, greater transmit power dissipation in the up and downlinks, and complex interference management, even at low traffic loads. In this paper, a cellular network model is presented where certain BS rather than being turned off, are switched to low-powered relay stations (RS) during zero-to-medium traffic periods. Neighbouring BS still retain all the baseband signal processing and transmit signals to corresponding RS via backhaul connections, under the assumption that the RS covers the whole cell. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this new BS-RS Switching technique from both an energy saving and QoS perspective, in the up and downlinks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCall Detail Records (CDRs) are data {{recorded}} by telecommunications companies, consisting of basic informations related to several {{dimensions of the}} calls made through the network: the source, destination, date and time of calls. CDRs data analysis has received much attention {{in the recent years}} since it might reveal valuable information about human behavior. It has shown high added value in many application domains like e. g., communities analysis or network planning. In this paper, we suggest a generic methodology based on data grid models for summarizing information contained in CDRs data. The method is based on a parameter-free estimation of the joint distribution of the variables that describe the calls. We also suggest several well-founded criteria that allows one to browse the summary at various granularities and to explore the summary by means of insightful visualizations. The method handles network graph data, temporal sequence data as well as user mobility data stemming from original CDRs data. We show the relevance of our methodology on real-world CDRs data from Ivory Coast for various case studies, like <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> <b>strategy</b> and yield management pricing strategy...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I compare {{workforce}} {{development planning}} in Lawrence and Lowell, Massachusetts, {{two of the}} state's older industrial "Gateway" cities. I specifically examine local planning processes around job creation in the clean technology (clean tech) sector. Contradicting {{the notion of the}} cities as "urban twins," I find that Lawrence's original physical and social design led to a pattern of economic disinvestment and a deficit of municipal planning capacity compared to Lowell. Today, Lawrence experiences the resulting disadvantage when it competes with Lowell for clean tech economic development funds. I argue that state and federal policymakers should recognize critical differences that exist among even the seemingly most similar communities and implement strong, place-based programs so that investments in green workforce development do not perpetuate the historic inequities that cities such as Lawrence face. I conclude by proposing a <b>networked</b> <b>planning</b> <b>strategy</b> that, with stimulus from the state and federal governments, could help Lawrence and Lowell to leverage more effectively and collaboratively their respective assets in support of a regional green economy. by Marianna Leavy-Sperounis.
