5|$|In the 20th-century symphonic repertoire, both {{sacred and}} secular, {{continued}} to {{progress through the}} music of Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé, and Herbert Howells. Other composers, such as Olivier Messiaen, György Ligeti, Jehan Alain, Jean Langlais, Gerd Zacher, and Petr Eben, wrote post-tonal organ music. Messiaen's music in particular redefined many of the traditional <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> organ registration and technique.|$|E

It has been argued that St Edmund's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> sacred kingship. Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely-ordained rule, rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king, land and society, include: Conaire Mór, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King Dómaldi and Halfdan the Black.|$|E

5|$|The {{orientation}} and placement of many structures within Ambohimanga were copied from Ambohimanga's older twin city, the rova at Antananarivo, which likewise embodies both traditional <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> space. The {{placement of the}} city of Ambohimanga relative to Antananarivo also reflects these systems. Centrally located Antananarivo is the nation's political capital today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital.|$|E
5|$|The war had a {{profound}} effect on Australian society in other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war. 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

5|$|Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced {{account of}} Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of Skáldskaparmál) {{associates}} the {{well with the}} south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though {{there may be no}} other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E
40|$|InModality and Explanatory Reasoning, Boris Kment {{argues that}} a single <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> essence {{can be used to}} play two {{different}} theoretical roles. He thinks there is an important connec-tion between essence and metaphysical necessity, on the one hand, and between essence and metaphysical explanation, on the other. It {{seems to me that there}} is a price to be paid for using a single <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> essence to play both of these roles. For the project of giving metaphysical explanations requires a <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> essence that distinguishes between truths that are more or less “fundamental”, in a metaphysical sense. So the result of using that same <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> essence in an account of metaphysical necessity is that one ends up with a conception of metaphysical necessity that is tied up with distinctions of metaphysical fundamentality. The main objective of this paper is to develop a <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> essence which steers clear <b>of</b> the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> metaphysical fundamentality, and to suggest that it is well-suited to elucidate the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> metaphysical necessity. I will also argue that the relevant <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> essence can be used to resolve a tension implicit in a famous argument of Kit Fine’s for the conclusion that the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> essence cannot be adequately captured by the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> metaphysical necessity...|$|R

5|$|She {{is placed}} {{firmly in the}} imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E
