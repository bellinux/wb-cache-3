First, our analysis of crisis episodes between 1994 and 2002 establishes a clear relationship between the persistence of crises, their complexity, and the intensity of movement of key macroeconomic variables. Second, we provide a systematic examination of the determinants of crisis duration. Our econometric analysis suggests that initial conditions and the external environment {{plays a key role in}} determining crisis persistence. The policy response also matters, but cannot offset a record of poor past policies. Overall, the results underscore the critical importance of crisis prevention efforts.

The speed of disinflation and the level of public debt were major determinants of the size of interest-rate-sensitive portfolio inflows.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effectiveness of}} capital controls in response to inflow surges in Brazil, Colombia, Korea, and Thailand in the 2000 s. Controls are generally associated with a decrease in inflows and a lengthening of maturities, but the relationship is not statistically significant in all cases, and the effects are temporary. Controls are more successful in providing room for monetary policy than dampening currency appreciation pressures. We argue that the macroeconomic impact of capital controls depends on the extensiveness of the policy, the level of capital market development, the support provided by other policies, and the persistence of capital flows.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{most of the}} EU New Member States {{experienced}} a severe credit-boom bust cycle. This paper argues that the credit boom-bust cycle was {{to a large extent}} the result of factors external to the region (â€œbad luckâ€). Rapid credit growth followed from a high liquidity in global markets and the particular attractiveness of â€œnew Europeâ€ for capital flows, while the end of the credit cycle was brought about by a global crisis. However, the fact that some countries managed to avoid most of the excesses, including asset price bubbles and foreign exchange lending, suggests that policies and policy failures (â€œbad policiesâ€) â€”in particular overly expansionary macroeconomic settings and excessively optimistic views on prudential risksâ€”also have played a critical role.

40|$|In Human Action, Ludwig von Mises {{employed}} two {{radically different}} notions of capital. The first was equivalent to what accountants call net worth. In calculating her profit and loss, the individual conceives of her income {{in terms of}} a change in net worth. If we shift the focus to an income stream, <b>net</b> worth (<b>capital)</b> can be said to refer to the capitalized value of that stream. Thus, the concept of <b>capital</b> as <b>net</b> worth implies <b>capital</b> <b>accounting.</b> This notion was truly subjectivist and fully consistent with the subjective theory of value and cost that was initiated by the early Austrian economists. The second notion was produced material resources. Mises recognized that the basis for distinguishing produced material resources from other non-produced and non-material resources was not consistent with the Austrian theory of value and cost. With some caution, he nevertheless employed the second notion, especially in his discussion of the relationship between economic action and time. One possible explanation for this was his desire to deal with the capital controversies of the period.

A dynamic process of change in the economy and in economic policy then came about, with a co-evolution between the system of capital controls, macroeconomic policy, and the internationalisation of firms including the emergence of Indian multinationals. Through this process, de facto openness has risen sharply. De facto openness has implied a loss of monetary policy autonomy when exchange rate pegging was attempted.

40|$|This paper reviews {{recent trends}} in the {{imposition}} of capital flow management measures in emerging market economies (EMEs). We find that since the crisis, {{there has been a}} shift in the balance of new measures towards <b>net</b> <b>capital</b> inflow reducing measures. However, this is not driven primarily by an increase in inflow tightening measures (e. g. taxes on inflows), but rather by significantly slower inflow liberalization trends (i. e. existing capital controls remaining in place). In addition, there has been a compositional shift in <b>net</b> <b>capital</b> inflow reducing measures: outflow liberalizations were the predominant tools for reducing <b>net</b> <b>capital</b> inflows pre-crisis, but such measures have become less important post-crisis. Overall, the pre-crisis trend towards <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> openness has stalled. The use of capital flow management measures is motivated by macroeconomic as well as financial stability concerns. The IMF recently endorsed use of capital controls as “last resort ” measures in macroeconomic management. We also find that by IMF criteria, capital flow measures have not been introduced as a last resort since 2004 -alternative macroeconomic policies to deal with the surge in <b>net</b> <b>capital</b> inflows were available to the majority of countries. Moreover, most capital flow measures introduced by EMEs since 2004 are pure capital controls rather than currency based and/or prudential type measures, suggesting that they were no...|$|R

A positive <b>net</b> <b>capital</b> inflow implies a higher stock of financial claims {{by the rest}} of the world against the resident and hence larger profit remittances and dividend and/or interest payments in the future. Johansen Cointegration test applied in this analysis shows that there is a cointe¬gration between current <b>account</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> with one cointegration equation. The result is consistence with Granger causality test, which shows that there is a bilateral cau¬sality between them. Through Bivariate Vector Autoregressive (VAR), it also could be seen that positive <b>net</b> <b>capital</b> inflows will cause deficit pressure on current account at first, third, fifth, and seventh quarter in the future (one-quarter break).

Overall, empirical results support precautionary motives; in particular, a more liberal <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> regime increases international reserves. Theoretically, large precautionary demand for international reserves arises as a self-insurance to avoid costly liquidation of long-term projects {{when the economy is}} susceptible to sudden stops. The welfare gain from the optimal management of international reserves is of a first-order magnitude, reducing the welfare cost of liquidity shocks from a first-order to a second-order magnitude.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic implications of, and policy responses to surges in private capital inflows across {{a large group}} of emerging and advanced economies. In particular, we identify 109 episodes of large <b>net</b> private <b>capital</b> inflows to 52 countries over 1987 - 2007. Episodes of large capital inflows are often associated with real exchange rate appreciations and deteriorating current account balances. More importantly, such episodes tend to be accompanied by an acceleration of GDP growth, but afterwards growth has often dropped significantly. A comprehensive assessment of various policy responses to the large inflow episodes leads to three major conclusions. First, keeping public expenditure growth steady during episodes can help limit real currency appreciation and foster better growth outcomes in their aftermath. Second, resisting nominal exchange rate appreciation through sterilized intervention is likely to be ineffective when the influx of capital is persistent. Third, tightening capital controls has not in general been associated with better outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical framework for considering {{the role of}} IMF-supported programs in preventing crises, particularly <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> crises. The model builds upon the global games framework to establish a unique relationship between the crisis probability and {{the parameters of the}} program, which is assumed to be negotiated between the IMF and the member country, taking explicit account of each party''s interests. In the model, {{from the perspective of the}} borrowing country, IMF financing and policy adjustment are (perfect) substitutes inasmuch as they both contribute to the country''s liquidity and thus reduce the likelihood of a crisis. In equilibrium, however, IMF financing promotes stronger policies, implying that financing and adjustment are strong complements in crisis prevention. Conditionality plays a crucial role in sustaining the program, providing mutual assurances-to the member country that, if it undertakes the agreed policies, financing will indeed be forthcoming, and to the IMF that the country will implement the agreed policies as the IMF disburses its resources. The model helps explain how liquidity crises may come about, how IMF support can reduce the likelihood of a crisis by providing liquidity and sustaining stronger policies, and why the observed mix between financing and adjustment may vary across programs.

40|$|In this paper, we adopt a {{cross-country}} perspective {{to examine the}} evolution of capital flows into China, {{both in terms of}} volumes and composition. China''s inflows have generally been dominated by foreign direct investment (FDI), a pattern that appears to be favorable in light of the recent literature on the experiences of developing countries with financial globalization. We provide a detailed documentation of the evolution of China''s capital controls, a proximate determinant of the pattern of capital inflows. We also discuss a number of other intriguing hypotheses that attempt to capture the "deeper" causes underlying China''s approach to capital flows. In particular, we argue that some popular mercantilist-type arguments are inconsistent with the facts. We also analyze the recent rapid rise of China''s international reserves and discuss its implications. Contrary to some popular perceptions, the dramatic surge in foreign exchange reserves since 2001 is mainly attributable to non-FDI capital inflows, rather than current account surpluses or FDI.

Together with <b>net</b> <b>capital</b> transfers (receivables and payables), net savings by institutional sector is used to accrue the non-financial flows (United Nations 2008).

40|$|During the 1990 s, {{the concept}} of "catalytic {{official}} finance" (COF) gained prominence in policy debates. The concept revolves around {{the idea that the}} propensity of investors to lend to a country increases when the IMF provides its "seal of approval"-backed up by only limited official financing-on the country''s economic program. COF aims at avoiding, on the one hand, the massive use of public money to bail out private investors; on the other, the recourse to coercive bailing-in mechanisms. The paper concludes that COF, while possibly useful in other contexts, is less reliable when used to manage <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> crises.
