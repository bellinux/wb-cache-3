5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> <b>coins</b> for the old currencies, however, continued {{to be used as}} legal tender until new euro <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> <b>coins</b> were introduced on 1 January 2002.|$|E

40|$|The {{new course}} {{adopted by the}} Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, aimed at raising the {{effectiveness}} of social production, presupposes the further development and improvement of the circulation of money in a socialist economy. This circulation has two forms; there is cash circulation, in which transactions are carried out in <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> <b>coin,</b> <b>and</b> noncash circulation, in which transactions are effected through the transfer of funds in bank accounts, including accounts in savings banks. The circulation of money, {{which is one of}} the necessary conditions of the production, distribution, and circulation of goods, reflects the volume of production and sales of capital and consumer goods. Because in the USSR wholesale and retail prices are stable (and because of the reduction of prices on certain goods), the dynamics of monetary circulation also reflects the growth in the real volume of goods and services. ...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{liquidity}} in France finds {{expression in}} {{more or less}} the same way as in the other western countries. It is normal practice to distinguish between the “liquidity of the economy” on the one hand, and the “liquidity of the banking system” on the other. The former corresponds to the money supply, while the latter comprises the banks’ holdings of <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> <b>coin</b> <b>and</b> their balances on sight accounts with the Bank of France, together with the total amount of the items which they can put into the Bank of France. The methods of influencing liquidity are also similar to those employed in other countries. However, to make them easier to understand, the present article first recalls certain special features of France’s monetary institutions, namely the banks, the specialised institutions and the Treasury. The author then examines the duel problems of controlling the liquidity of the economy and bank liquidity. JEL: E 51, E 52, E 58, G 21 </div...|$|R
