Jenna takes this role seriously and takes on the job of firing people.

5|$|The area east of Michigan Avenue {{and north}} of the Chicago River had a split {{personality}} {{for much of the}} 20th century - the northern portion upscale residential, retail, and university uses and the area near the Chicago River and Navy Pier dedicated to shipping and factories.

It is discovered that left-handed shears were used to cut off Dupre's fingers, {{despite the fact that}} Willis is right-handed, leading Mulder to believe that Willis' body is inhabited by Dupre's consciousness. The agents visit a University of Maryland medical professor who theorizes that during near-death experiences, an energy release can occur that could radically change someone's personality.|$|E
