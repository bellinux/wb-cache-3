25|$|The <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principles,</b> 1950.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal defined three {{categories}} of crimes, including crimes against peace. This definition was first used by Finland to prosecute the political leadership in the war-responsibility trials in Finland. The principles were later known as the <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The International Law Commission, {{acting on}} {{the request of the}} United Nations General Assembly, {{produced}} in 1950 the report Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgement of the Tribunal (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, vol. II). See <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principles.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Thus, under <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV, [...] "defense of {{superior}} orders" [...] {{is not a}} defense for war crimes, although {{it might be a}} mitigating factor that could influence a sentencing authority to lessen the penalty. <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV states: ...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, this {{interpretation}} of ICC Article 33 {{is open to}} debate: For example, Article 33 (1)(c) protects the defendant only if [...] "the order was not manifestly unlawful." [...] The [...] "order" [...] could be considered [...] "unlawful" [...] if we consider <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV to be the applicable [...] "law" [...] in this case. If so, then the defendant is not protected. Discussion {{as to whether or}} not <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV is the applicable law in this case is found in a discussion of the Nuremberg Principles' power or lack of power.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> II {{responds}} to that dilemma by stating: [...] "The fact that internal {{law does not}} impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a {{crime under international law}} does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{definition}} {{of what constitutes a}} war crime is described by the <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>principles,</b> a set of guidelines document which was created {{as a result of the}} trial. The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so-called Doctors' Trial led to the creation of the Nuremberg Code to control future trials involving human subjects, a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{genocide}} and war crimes, {{which have been}} widely recognized and prohibited in international criminal law since {{the establishment of the}} <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>principles,</b> {{there has never been a}} comprehensive convention on crimes against humanity, even though such crimes are continuously perpetrated worldwide in numerous conflicts and crises. There are eleven international texts defining crimes against humanity, but they all differ slightly as to their definition of that crime and its legal elements.|$|E
25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} this justification {{is that it}} does not fulfill one of the requirements of a just war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>principles,</b> therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.|$|E
5000|$|The above {{scenario}} might present a legal dilemma, but <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV speaks of [...] "a moral choice" [...] as being {{just as important}} as [...] "legal" [...] decisions: It states: [...] "The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him".|$|R
50|$|Justice Mactavish {{has taken}} a role in hearing at least two well publicized cases: those of Jeremy Hinzman and Robin Long. They were both Iraq War Resisters who claimed that the {{international}} law <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV put them under legal obligation to avoid participating in the invasion of Iraq and the Iraq war. In {{order to avoid the}} punishment for desertion which they would face if they returned to the United States, they applied for refugee status in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV, and its {{reference}} to an individual’s responsibility, {{it could be}} argued that a version of the Superior Orders defense can be found as a defense to international crimes in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. (The Rome Statute was agreed upon in 1998 as the foundational document of the International Criminal Court, established to try those individuals accused of serious international crimes.) Article 33, titled [...] "Superior Orders and prescription of law,"states: ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{relevant}} {{provisions of the}} Charter of the United Nations mentioned in the RSICC article 5.2 were framed to include the <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principles.</b> The specific principle is Principle VI.a [...] "Crimes against peace", {{which was based on}} the provisions of the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal that was issued in 1945 and formed the basis for the post World War II war crime trials. The Charters provisions based on the Nuremberg Principle VI.a are: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s a Harvard-trained {{lawyer and}} historian, Alfred de Zayas, {{published}} Nemesis at Potsdam and A Terrible Revenge, {{both of which}} became bestsellers in Germany. De Zayas argues that the expulsions were war crimes and crimes against humanity even {{in the context of}} international law of the time, stating, [...] "the only applicable principles were the Hague Conventions, in particular, the Hague Regulations, ARTICLES 42–56, which limited the rights of occupying powers – and obviously occupying powers have no rights to expel the populations – so there was the clear violation of the Hague Regulations." [...] He argued that the expulsions violated the <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principles.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Priebke {{appealed the}} case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, where he claimed {{he had no choice but}} to obey Hitler's orders, a defense not {{accepted}} during the Nuremberg Trials (see Nuremberg Defense and <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV). Moreover, it has been underlined by many that in the massacre of the Fosse Ardeatine 335 died, five more than required by the order [...] "10 Italians executed for each German killed". These five extra victims were the responsibility of Priebke alone because he was given the duty of checking the list.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV {{is legally}} {{supported}} by the jurisprudence found in certain articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which deal indirectly with conscientious objection.

5000|$|Alex Neve, {{who taught}} {{international}} human rights and refugee law at Osgoode Hall Law School, expressed concern that Mactavish's decision sets a precedent whereby [...] "those at senior levels who have an objection to war may refugee status, and those who deploy who have an objection may not. This runs contrary to other international law rulings."

5000|$|The {{superior}} orders {{defense is}} still {{used with the}} following rationale in the following scenario: An [...] "order" [...] may come from one's superior {{at the level of}} national law. But according to <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV, such an order is sometimes [...] "unlawful" [...] according to international law. Such an [...] "unlawful order" [...] presents a legal dilemma from which there is no legal escape: On one hand, a person who refuses such an unlawful order faces the possibility of legal punishment at the national level for refusing orders. On the other hand, a person who accepts such an unlawful order faces the possibility of legal punishment at the international level (e.g. Nuremberg Trials) for committing unlawful acts.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV, and its {{reference}} to an individual’s responsibility, {{was also at}} issue in Canada {{in the case of}} Hinzman v. Canada. Jeremy Hinzman was a U.S. Army deserter who claimed refugee status in Canada as a conscientious objector, one of many Iraq War resisters. Hinzman's lawyer, Jeffry House, had previously raised the issue of the legality of the Iraq War as having a bearing on their case. The Federal Court ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim. In the decision, Justice Anne L. Mactavish addressed the issue of personal responsibility: “An individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace ... the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her own personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict. Similarly, such an individual cannot be held criminally responsible for fighting in support of an illegal war, assuming that his or her personal war-time conduct is otherwise proper.” ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principles,</b> {{crimes against}} {{humanity}} are part of international law. Principle VI of the <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principles</b> states that The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law:...(c) Crimes against humanity::Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts done against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds, when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the United States punished him [...] "for refusing to report to his unit during the Iraq war," [...] {{during the period of}} his [...] "unauthorized absence" [...] (Feb 9, 2003 to April 1, 2003), which occurred before the May 22, 2003 adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483. (That resolution affirmed that the United States and the United Kingdom had responsibility for Iraq as the [...] "occupying powers under unified command.") This sequence of events means that United States punished Stephen Funk for refusing to [...] "report to his unit during a war" [...] not sanctioned by the United Nations. This fact has major implications in international law: In an interview given on August 25, 2006, about the “2003 invasion of Iraq,...Benjamin B. Ferencz,,...said the United Nations charter, which was written after the carnage of World War II, contains a provision that no nation can use armed force without the permission of the UN Security Council.” [...] Ferencz is qualified to make comparisons to the Nuremberg Trials because he, himself, was an investigator of Nazi war crimes after World War II and the Chief Prosecutor for the United States Army at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the twelve military trials held by the U.S. authorities at Nuremberg, Germany. One of the legal principles used during those trials was <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> IV which deals with the responsibility of individuals. It states, [...] "The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him." [...] The precedents and principles of international law that were set during the Nuremberg Trials have legal relevance to all subsequent cases, including that of Stephen Funk.|$|R
40|$|Individual {{liability}} {{for war crimes}} is difficult to enforce and {{is unlikely to be}} accepted uniformly by states. Individual criminal responsibility is the cornerstone of any international war crimes tribunal. <b>Nuremberg</b> <b>Principle</b> I provides that “[a]ny person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefor and liable to punishment. ” Acts by heads of state or other government officials, even if committed in an official capacity, may not constitute an immunity defense to or mitigate criminality. These officials, therefore, could also be held responsible for offenses committed pursuant to their orders. Additionally, {{liability for}} criminal negligence may be imposed on a person in a position of authority who knew, or had reason to know, that his or her subordinates were about to commit a war crime, and who failed to take whatever action was necessary and reasonable to prevent, to deter, or to repress its commission. The same liability must hold for failure to prosecute those who commit such offenses. Will nations unilaterally agree to such liability? If not, are they liable pursuant to customary international law or general principles? Who or what institution will be able to impose this liability on them? A permanent tribunal challenges the sovereignty of the individual member-states of the United Nations. Crimes under international law and those under domestic law are not mutually exclusive. The jurisdiction of any international criminal tribunal would be co-extensive in some areas with domestic courts. Under certain circumstances, for example, murder may be a crime under both domestic and international law. While a permanent international tribunal would be unlikely to pursue ordinary killings falling within domestic jurisdiction, {{the extent to which it}} theoretically could do so—and therefore the amount of discretion left to it to determine its own jurisdiction—would depend on whether and to what extent the court 2 ̆ 7 s subject matter jurisdiction was specifically limited. For example, the statute creating the Ad Hoc Tribunal for Crimes Against Humanitarian Law in the Former Yugoslavia (hereafter, the “Ad Hoc Tribunal”) purports to limit that tribunal’s jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the statute appears to have expanded the scope of humanitarian law, which traditionally followed the Hague and Geneva rules, by adding some crimes not included in the Hague and Geneva Conventions. By expanding the definition of humanitarian law, the scope of the tribunal’s subject matter jurisdiction has also expanded...|$|R
