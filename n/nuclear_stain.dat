Results: In normal mucosa, there was strong positive <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> in {{a proportion of}} fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the lamina propria, with variable expression in nuclei of the epithelial layer.

Sera from 23 patients with drug-induced lupus erythematosus (procainamide 19, isoniazid 2, nitrofurantoin 2) and 20 patients with idiopathic (not drug-induced) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were studied.

The normal immunohistochemical localization of E-cadherin is the cell membrane, however, both cytoplasmic and nuclear immunostaining has been reported. Loss of membrane <b>staining</b> and/or <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> for E-cadherin is seen in 100 % of cases of solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs) of the pancreas. In the context of SPT, E-cadherin staining is of diagnostic use. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> has been seen in cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, Merkel cell carcinomas, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous carcinoma, colorectal and gastric cancer, and synovial sarcoma. The difference in the staining patterns seen (complete loss vs. <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining)</b> is due to the type of E-cadherin antibody used. Antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain show loss of E-cadherin staining in SPT, whereas the antibody to the cytoplasmic domain results in <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> in all cases of SPT.

50|$|This {{method is}} based on the use of iron nano-particles coated with a polymer layer {{carrying}} biotin analogues and conjugated with antibodies anti EpCAM for capturing CTCs, and on the use of an analyzer to take images of isolated cells upon their staining with specific fluorescent antibody conjugates.Blood is sampled in an EDTA tube with an added preservative. Upon arrival in the lab, 7.5mL of blood is centrifuged and placed in a preparation system. This system first enriches the tumor cells immunomagnetically by means of ferrofluid nano-particles and a magnet. Subsequently recovered cells are permeabilized and stained with a <b>nuclear</b> <b>stain,</b> a fluorescent antibody conjugate against CD45 (leukocyte marker), and cytokeratin 8, 18 and 19 (CKs). The sample is then scanned on an analyzer which takes images of the nuclear, cytokeratin, and CD45 stains. To be considered a CTC a cell must contain a nucleus, be positive for cytoplasmic expression of cytokeratin as well as negative for the expression of CD45 marker, and have a diameter larger than 5 µm. If the total number of tumor cells found to meet the criteria cited above is 5 or more, a blood sample is positive. In studies done on prostate, breast and colon cancer patients, median survival of metastatic patients with positive samples is about half the median survival of metastatic patients with negative samples.This system is characterized by a recovery capacity of 93% and a detection limit of one CTC per 7.5 mL of whole blood. Despite its sensitivity and reproducibility, the CellSearch method requires specific equipment to perform the analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 2 of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Type 2 (FGFR 2) gene, {{including}} rs 2981582, {{contribute to}} multifactorial breast cancer susceptibility. The high risk polymorphism haplotype in the FGFR 2 gene {{has been associated}} with increased mRNA transcription and altered transcription factor binding but the effect on FGFR 2 protein expression is unknown. 40 breast tumours were identified from individuals with known rs 2981582 genotype. Tumour sections were stained for FGFR 2 protein expression, and scored for <b>nuclear</b> and cytoplasmic <b>staining</b> in tumour and surrounding normal tissue. Findings FGFR 2 immunohistochemistry demonstrated variable <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> in normal tissue and tumour tissue, as well as consistent cytoplasmic staining. We did not find an association between <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> for FGFR 2 and genotype, and there was no association between FGFR 2 staining and estrogen or progestogen receptor status. There was an association between presence of <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> for FGFR 2 in normal tissue and presence of <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> in the adjacent tumour (Fishers exact test, p = 0. 002). Conclusions Variable <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> for FGFR 2 in breast cancer, but an absence of correlation with rs 2981582 genotype suggests that the mechanism of action of polymorphisms at the FGFR 2 locus may be more complex than a direct effect on mRNA expression levels in the final cancer. The effect may relate to FGFR 2 function or localisation during breast development or tumourigenesis. Nuclear localisation of FGFR 2 suggests an important additional role for this protein in breast development and breast cancer, in addition to its function as a classical cell surface receptor. </p...|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> {{patterns}} seen on HEp-2 cells: homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, nuclear membranous, centromeric, nuclear dot and pleomorphic. The homogeneous pattern is seen when the condensed chromosomes and interphase chromatin stain.

The fine speckled pattern has fine <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> with unstained metaphase chromatin, which is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. The coarse staining pattern has coarse granular <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining,</b> caused by anti-U1-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies.

40|$|Medulloblastoma is {{the most}} {{frequent}} malignant paediatric brain tumour. The activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway occurs in 10 - 15 % of medulloblastomas and has been recently described as a marker for favourable patient outcome. We report a series of 72 paediatric medulloblastomas evaluated for beta-catenin protein expression, CTNNB 1 mutations, and comparative genomic hybridization. Gene expression profiles were also available in a subset of 40 cases. Immunostaining of beta-catenin showed extensive <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> (> 50 % of the tumour cells) in six cases and focal <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> (< 10 % of cells) in three cases. The other cases either exhibited a signal strictly limited to the cytoplasm (58 cases) or were negative (five cases). CTNNB 1 mutations were detected in all beta-catenin extensively nucleopositive cases. The expression profiles of these cases documented strong activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Remarkably, five out of these six tumours showed a complete loss of chromosome 6. In contrast, cases with focal <b>nuclear</b> beta-catenin <b>staining,</b> as well as tumours with negative or cytoplasmic staining, never demonstrated CTNNB 1 mutation, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation or chromosome 6 loss. Patients with extensive <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> were significantly older at diagnosis and were in continuous complete remission after a mean follow-up of 75. 7 months (range 27. 5 - 121. 2 months) from diagnosis. All three patients with focal <b>nuclear</b> <b>staining</b> of beta-catenin died within 36 months from diagnosis. Altogether, these data confirm and extend previous observations that CTNNB 1 -mutated tumours represent a distinct molecular subgroup of medulloblastomas with favourable outcome, indicating that therapy de-escalation should be considered.

40|$|The fission yeast dsk 1 + gene, a {{multicopy}} suppressor for cold-sensitive dis 1 mutants, encodes a novel 61 -kd protein kinase. It is a phosphoprotein, and phosphoserine is {{the major}} phosphorylated amino acid. Hyperphosphorylation of dsk 1 causes a mobility shift, resulting in two dsk 1 -specific protein bands. The phosphorylation pattern is strikingly altered when cell cycle progression is delayed or arrested. The slowly migrating phosphorylated form is prominent in mitotically arrested cells, and the fast migrating form is enriched in interphase-arrested cells. dsk 1 is a protein kinase. It auto-phosphorylates as well as phosphorylates myelin basic protein (MBP). Phosphotyrosine as well as phosphoserine/threonine were found in autophosphorylation, but no tyrosine phosphorylation occurs when MBP {{was used as the}} substrate. The dsk 1 immunoprecipitates from mitotically arrested cells have a several-fold higher kinase activity than that from wild type. The haploid gene disruptant is viable, indicating that the dsk 1 + gene is non-essential for viability. High dosage of dsk 1 +, however, strongly delays the G 2 /M progression. Immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-dsk 1 antibody shows that localization pattern of dsk 1 protein strikingly alters depending on cell cycle stages. In G 2 -arrested cells, dsk 1 locates in the cytoplasm, whereas in mitotically arrested cells, <b>nuclear</b> <b>stain</b> is intense. In wild-type cells, <b>nuclear</b> <b>stain</b> is seen only in mitotic cells.
