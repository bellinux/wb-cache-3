25|$|Reinforcement is the {{key element}} in operant {{conditioning}} and in most behavior change programs. It is {{the process by which}} behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed <b>negative</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior.|$|E
25|$|In operant conditioning, {{the type}} and {{frequency}} of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, {{in the presence of}} a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (<b>negative</b> <b>reinforcement</b> or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (<b>negative</b> <b>reinforcement).</b>|$|E

Disturbances in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural processes are reflected in a perturbed physical state while disturbances in the balance between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>reinforcements</b> are reflected in a perturbed mood state. Our purpose is to link the different behavioral outcomes occurring during withdrawal with specific biological brain mechanisms from the animal to the human being.

30|$|The {{theory of}} token economy [19] {{maintains}} that {{both positive and}} <b>negative</b> <b>reinforcements</b> are essential to obtain a proper behavior and to avoid the extinction process, described by Skinner [20]. The lack of compliance {{may be explained by}} the pain associated with orthodontic procedures and by the absence of adequate encouragement. We believe that post-procedure interventions may facilitate health-related lifestyle changes, reducing the individual perception of pain (negative stimulus) and promote correct habits (positive stimulus). Significant correlation has been demonstrated between psychological factors and individual perception of pain, which can influence negatively the compliance, as patients worried about pain are less inclined to follow the correct rules. The positive stimulus is represented by the promotion of correct habits, encouraging appropriate dental hygiene and stressing the importance of a positive attitude towards orthodontic treatment.|$|R

Although Japan applied positive reinforcement and provided additional foreign aid {{to assist the}} political and economic reforms in three African countries, it would be an oversimplification to say that these “positive reinforcement” methods have effectively contributed to the improvement of the political situations in these countries. On the other hand, whether Japan’s and other aid donors’ measures of the “negative reinforcement” have effectively contributed to the improvement of the political situation in African countries remains as a contentious issue. ...|$|R
25|$|Both {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} strengthen behavior, or increase {{the probability of}} a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (<b>negative</b> <b>reinforcement).</b> Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences. Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.|$|E

25|$|Motivation lies at {{the core}} of many behaviorist {{approaches}} to psychological treatment. A person with autism-spectrum disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people. Depression is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to extinction of behavior in the depressed individual. A patient with specific phobia is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (<b>negative</b> <b>reinforcement).</b> In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as EIBI and CBT for major depression and specific phobia.|$|E
40|$|The {{exposure}} of young rats to atypical time indicators (Zeitgeber) between birth and weaning modifies the reactivity of adult rats.

When the rats are left for 30 min or more in the test room before the beginning of the daily trials, the difference between control and experimental groups decreases, though it does not completely disappear.

25|$|In the mid-20th century psychologists such as Hans Eysenck {{developed}} a personality profile {{for the typical}} smoker of that period; extraversion was associated with smoking, and smokers tended to be sociable, impulsive, risk taking, and excitement-seeking individuals. Although personality and social factors may make people likely to smoke, the actual habit {{is a function of}} operant conditioning. During the early stages, smoking provides pleasurable sensations (because of its action on the dopamine system) and thus serves as a source of positive reinforcement. After an individual has smoked for many years, the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms and <b>negative</b> <b>reinforcement</b> become the key motivations. Like all addictive substances, the amount of exposure required to become dependent on nicotine can vary from person to person.|$|E

Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.|$|E

40|$|Rural {{entrepreneurs}} {{and small businesses}} have limited access to financing from venture capitalists. Of this situation, there is widespread evidence and agreement. There is not, however, agreement as to the principal reasons why entrepreneurs in rural areas have difficulty in acquiring equity capital for new business start-ups and expansions. On the one hand, some suggest that few venture capital investments are made in rural areas because relatively few rural businesses are in the sectors favored by venture capitalists (e. g., software, telecommunications, and bio-technology).

25|$|A growing {{literature}} is demonstrating {{the importance of}} emotion regulation {{in the treatment of}} substance abuse. Considering that nicotine and other psychoactive substances such as cocaine activate similar psychopharmacological pathways, an emotion regulation approach may be applicable to a wide array of substance abuse. Proposed models of affect-driven tobacco use have focused on <b>negative</b> <b>reinforcement</b> as the primary driving force for addiction; according to such theories, tobacco is used because it helps one escape from the undesirable effects of nicotine withdrawal or other negative moods. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), is showing evidence that it is effective in treating substance abuse, including the treatment of poly-substance abuse and cigarette smoking. Mindfulness programs that encourage patients to be aware of their own experiences in the present moment and of emotions that arise from thoughts, appear to prevent impulsive/compulsive responses. Research also indicates that mindfulness programs can reduce the consumption of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes and opiates.|$|E

Furthermore, many that engage in NSSI are unlikely to be admitted because they do not express the intent to die. Because non-suicidal self-injury is mainly categorized as a tool for emotion regulation and is considered a behavior mainly maintained through positive and <b>negative</b> <b>reinforcements</b> (as well as self punishment), treatments using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) show the most effectiveness in reducing NSSI behaviors. Two types of treatments using cognitive behavioral therapy that focus specifically on NSSI are Problem-Solving Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy. These treatments share commonalities including being time-limited, and a focus on immediately targeting NSSI and improving skills. Other treatments for NSSI disorder include Emotion-Regulation Group Therapy, Voice Movement Therapy, and Transference Focused Psychotherapy. Although relatively limited information exists on Pharmacotherapy for NSSI, empirical evidence has been found for 5 different drug classes: SSRI's, atypical antipsychotics, SNRI's, opioids, and opioid antagonists.|$|R
5000|$|Psychological behaviorism {{is a form}} of behaviorism - a major theory within {{psychology}} {{which holds}} that behaviors are learned through positive and <b>negative</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> The theory recommends that psychological concepts (such as personality, learning and emotion) are to be explained in terms of observable behaviors that respond to stimulus. Behaviorism was first developed by John B. Watson (1912), who coined the term [...] "behaviorism," [...] and then B.F. Skinner who developed what is known as [...] "radical behaviorism." [...] Watson and Skinner rejected the idea that psychological data could be obtained through introspection or by an attempt to describe consciousness; all psychological data, in their view, was to be derived from the observation of outward behavior. Recently, Arthur W. Staats has proposed a psychological behaviorism - a [...] "paradigmatic behaviorist theory" [...] which argues that personality consists of a set of learned behavioral patterns, acquired through the interaction between an individual's biology, environment, cognition, and emotion. Holth also critically reviews psychological behaviorism as a [...] "path to the grand reunification of psychology and behavior analysis".|$|R

A deficit in prosocial emotions, namely the callous unemotional traits (CU), {{may be a}} mediator of emotional reactivity. Our aim is to investigate subjective emotional reactivity towards visual stimuli with different affective valence in youths with DBDs and healthy controls. The clinical sample included 62 youths with DBDs (51 males, 8 to 16 years, mean 11. 372. 1 years), the control group 53 subjects (36 males, 8 to 16 years, mean 10. 871. 5 years). The groups were compared using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU),and the International Affective Picture System (IAPS),which explores the affective(pleasant/unpleasant emotional reaction) and arousal (low/high intensity of emotion) dimen- sions. The DBD group presented higher scores in externalizing and internalizing CBCL scores, and in ICU callous and indifferent subscales. At the IAPS,DBD patients differed from controls in the affective valence of the images, rating less unpleasant neutral and negative images. The CU traits were the only predictor of emotional reactivity in the DBD sample.

Considerable progress is being made towards many components of this task, including on-board sensor technology, physical agility, and power management.
