40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} morphology, thermal, and {{electrical}} properties of LDPE (low-density polyethylene) -based <b>nanocomposites</b> after thermal aging. The FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra {{results show that}} thermo-oxidative reactions occur in neat LDPE and LDPE/SiO 2 <b>nanocomposites</b> when the aging time is 35 days and in LDPE/MgO <b>nanocomposites</b> when the aging time is 77 days. Specifically, LDPE/MgO <b>nanocomposites</b> delay the appearance of thermo-oxidative reactions, showing anti-thermal aging ability. Furthermore, <b>nanocomposites</b> present lower onset degradation temperature than neat LDPE, showing better thermal stabilization. With regard to the electrical properties, <b>nanocomposites</b> maintain the ability to suppress space charge accumulation after thermal aging. Additionally, in comparison with SiO 2 <b>nanocomposites</b> and neat LDPE, the permittivity of LDPE/MgO <b>nanocomposites</b> changes slightly after thermal aging.
