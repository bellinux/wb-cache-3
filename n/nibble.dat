25|$|The FAT12 {{file system}} uses 12 bits per FAT entry, thus two entries span 3 bytes. It is {{consistently}} little-endian: if those three bytes are {{considered as one}} little-endian 24-bit number, the 12 least significant bits represent the first entry (f.e. cluster 0) and the 12 most significant bits the second (f.e cluster 1). In other words, while the low eight bits of the first cluster in the row are stored in the first byte, the top four bits are stored in the low <b>nibble</b> of the second byte, whereas the low four bits of the subsequent cluster in the row are stored in the high <b>nibble</b> of the second byte and its higher eight bits in the third byte.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nibbles</b> {{arrives at}} Jerry's mousehole, {{and as he}} tries to snatch cheese from a trap, Jerry discovers he has been asked to have <b>Nibbles</b> as a guest for Thanksgiving, with a note {{attached}} saying [...] "he's always hungry." [...] Jerry's cupboards are empty, so he leads <b>Nibbles</b> to a bowl of cream where Tom is sleeping. After <b>Nibbles</b> sips the cream, Mammy Two Shoes places a turkey on the table. <b>Nibbles</b> proceeds to eat certain foods from the table, while Jerry dresses him and <b>Nibbles</b> as pilgrims, but after <b>Nibbles</b> swallows an orange and inflates, Jerry hits <b>Nibbles</b> with a knife and the orange flies into Tom's mouth, waking him up.|$|R
50|$|Jerry then {{wipes his}} hands {{together}} and heads over to <b>Nibbles</b> and his noisemakers while <b>Nibbles</b> lights one more firecracker. With nowhere else to hide it, he stashes it into Jerry's noisemaker. Jerry pats <b>Nibbles</b> {{on the head and}} proceeds to blow his noisemaker. Knowing the consequences, <b>Nibbles</b> attempts to stop Jerry from doing so, but Jerry just pats him on the head again, then blows his noisemaker and the firecracker inside it explodes, giving him a blackface appearance. Jerry looks at <b>Nibbles,</b> annoyed, and <b>Nibbles</b> smiles innocently and plays with his noisemakers.|$|R
50|$|Later, the Planet Express staff {{discusses}} {{an ominous}} trail of destroyed planets leading toward Earth. <b>Nibbler</b> begins gibbering excitedly and runs away. Tracking <b>Nibbler</b> to an alley, Leela is attacked by giant floating brains. Leela is rescued by <b>Nibbler,</b> who has donned a uniform and is piloting a tiny flying saucer. <b>Nibbler</b> and Leela fly away from Earth.|$|R

25|$|When bait-fishing in pacu-stocked ponds, anglers in Malaysia {{are advised}} to use circle hooks, size 2 or larger, and braided leather rather than nylon leaders which are easily broken by the pacu's teeth. Since pond pacu often <b>nibble</b> at the bait before taking it, anglers should let them swim away with the bait. If the angler simply allows the line to tighten, the circle hook will slide {{to the side of}} the fish's mouth and embed its point there.|$|E
25|$|Hexadecimal numerals {{are widely}} used by {{computer}} system designers and programmers. As each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents a <b>nibble</b> (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.|$|E
50|$|Tom, Jerry and <b>Nibbles</b> {{then say}} grace {{at the table}} and prepare to eat a turkey, but <b>Nibbles</b> devours the entire turkey before Tom and Jerry can pick up their cutlery. <b>Nibbles,</b> now with a full stomach, pats his stomach in delight.|$|R
50|$|After {{finding that}} he has no food, Jerry tiptoes out of his hole, {{spotting}} Tom asleep by his bowl of milk. <b>Nibbles</b> sees the milk and runs towards it, but Jerry pulls him back and goes out to get the milk for him. <b>Nibbles</b> runs out, but accidentally waking Tom. Jerry grabs <b>Nibbles</b> and both fall into the bowl of milk, splashing it into Tom's face and waking him. Tom, startled, looks around and sees no one, so he starts to drink his milk. Jerry and <b>Nibbles</b> are under the milk holding their breath until Tom unsuspectingly scoops up <b>Nibbles</b> with his tongue. Jerry jumps out of the milk and opens the cat's mouth to retrieve <b>Nibbles,</b> which begins the chase. The mice retreat into the mousehole before Tom crashes head first into the wall.|$|R
50|$|In the {{alternate}} dimension, the Brainspawn discover they can send Fry {{back in time}} to stop <b>Nibbler</b> from freezing him. Fry accepts their offer and is transported to the cryogenics lab. He appears behind <b>Nibbler</b> under the desk, just before his past self is frozen. He restrains <b>Nibbler,</b> who protests that Fry must be sent to the future to save the universe. <b>Nibbler</b> asks if there is anything he wants to save in the future, and Fry mentions Leela. After <b>Nibbler</b> advises Fry not to give up on her, and promises that he will help Fry win Leela's heart, Fry tips his past self into the cryogenic chamber.|$|R
25|$|One {{limitation}} of flash memory is that, {{although it can}} be read or programmed a byte or a word {{at a time in}} a random access fashion, it can be erased only a block at a time. This generally sets all bits in the block to 1. Starting with a freshly erased block, any location within that block can be programmed. However, once a bit has been set to 0, only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1. In other words, flash memory (specifically NORflash) offers random-access read and programming operations, but does not offer arbitrary random-access rewrite or erase operations. A location can, however, be rewritten as long as the new value's 0 bits are a superset of the over-written values. For example, a <b>nibble</b> value may be erased to 1111, then written as 1110. Successive writes to that <b>nibble</b> can change it to 1010, then 0010, and finally 0000. Essentially, erasure sets all bits to 1, and programming can only clear bits to 0. File systems designed for flash devices can make use of this capability, for example, to represent sector metadata.|$|E
25|$|A queen {{is capable}} of mating {{starting}} 48 hours after emerging from the pupal stage. To find a male, queens fly to trees and bushes where males form aggregations. Males frequently groom their legs, antennae, and gasters throughout courtship, mating, and after contact with a queen. The queens have also been seen to groom the face and antennae, but only briefly. At the end of copulation, a queen is able to produce an olfactory or contact pheromone to signal release to the male. The queen also begins to <b>nibble</b> the dorsal surface of the male’s gaster to further signal the end of copulation. Since both queens and males can mate multiple times, the queen’s signals are advantageous if her spermatheca is full, thereby preventing the waste of resources and time. Male having strong genitalic locks for mating is also advantageous, due to male-male competition, but can cause problems during disengagement. In the laboratory, both females and males have died during disengagement, sometimes leaving reproductive ends attached to the opposite sex.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, {{national}} cookery schools began {{to teach their}} pupils {{to create their own}} version of a [...] "Cornish pasty" [...] that was smaller, and was to be eaten as an [...] "economical savoury <b>nibble</b> for polite middle-class Victorians".|$|E
50|$|When <b>Nibbler</b> chips his fang, he {{is taken}} to a vet, and during the time, is found out to be five years old. <b>Nibbler</b> has a {{birthday}} party, and Bender becomes annoyed that <b>Nibbler</b> is getting more attention than him. Having reluctantly made a birthday cake for <b>Nibbler,</b> Bender is aghast to see <b>Nibbler</b> gobble it all up before everybody else can praise Bender for the cake. In extreme annoyance, Bender flushes the <b>Nibbler</b> down the toilet. Leela is distraught {{at the loss of}} her pet and wishes Bender could understand the emotions of others. Professor Farnsworth proposes a solution: installing an empathy chip in Bender's head that will cause him to feel other people's emotions. After forcibly installing the chip, the chip is tuned to pick up Leela's emotions, so that whatever feelings Leela experiences, Bender automatically experiences them as well.|$|R
5000|$|Jerry and <b>Nibbles</b> then {{go outside}} and enjoy their holiday with noisemakers with Jerry trying show his nephew that it can still the 4th of July without fireworks, before <b>Nibbles</b> (not one to follow the {{quotation}} from earlier) lights a firework from his diaper. Jerry grabs it and then fails to throw it off before the firecracker explodes on him. Jerry then {{holds out his hand}} as if to say, [...] "Give me the rest of them." [...] <b>Nibbles</b> hands him another tiny firework from his diaper and smiles before dashing away. Seeing through this, Jerry then picks up <b>Nibbles</b> and turns him upside down, and he finds that <b>Nibbles</b> had a sizable amount of fireworks hidden in his diaper. Having had enough of Nibbles' defiance, Jerry gets him to stand in a corner, but no sooner does <b>Nibbles</b> repeat his transgression with a firework under the bed before leaving, and Jerry is blown up again before he can toss it out of the door. <b>Nibbles</b> then hides under his quilt.|$|R
5000|$|Fry feels useless after Leela and Bender {{return from}} an {{extremely}} successful mission without him. Leela asks Fry to walk <b>Nibbler</b> while {{she goes on}} a date with Chaz, the mayor's aide. Fry is convinced the only good he serves is to clean up after <b>Nibbler,</b> but <b>Nibbler</b> tells him otherwise. Having never heard <b>Nibbler</b> talk, Fry is dumbfounded as <b>Nibbler</b> knocks him out and takes him to Eternium, Nibbler's home planet. The Nibblonians explain that because Fry lacks the delta brainwave on account of him being his own grandfather (seen in Roswell That Ends Well), he was immune to the attack of the Brainspawn a few months prior (seen in [...] "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid").|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "La Mordidita" [...] was filmed in Cartagena, Colombia in mid-March 2015 with Simón Brand serving as its director. The first {{scenes of the}} clip were filmed at the Casa Museo Rafael Núñez, where Martin was {{accompanied}} by Colombian actress and ballet dancer María Cecilia Sánchez. Other scenes were filmed on various local streets in the city. Speaking about the concept behind the video, Brand elaborated that it revolved around Martin spreading a [...] "virus" [...] through a bite, converting {{the people around him}} into [...] "sensual and amusing" [...] dancing zombies. He concluded that [...] "basically, we will be spreading the <b>nibble</b> across the city".|$|E
500|$|Once there, he sits {{cross-legged on}} his lily-pad and {{arranges}} his tackle. He has [...] "the dearest little red float". His rod is a stalk {{of grass and}} his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a <b>nibble.</b> He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe causing him to withdraw his legs, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line {{into the water and}} immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a stickleback. The fish escapes but not before Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy.|$|E
500|$|In general, [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] {{received}} a positive critical reaction. British magazine NME, reviewing the UK 7" [...] single in March 1989, said: [...] "All the smart bastards are mixing strings with grunge guitars nowadays and the Pixies are no exception. Snarled vocals, sci-fi lyrics, {{and the usual}} molten lava flow of guitars burn another crater where your ears used to be. 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' pukes acid and poetry into America's AOR heartland before being splattered by the faster and more direct sting of the second track 'Manta Ray'." [...] Upon the release of Doolittle in April 1989, NMEs Edwin Pouncey added: [...] "the wonderful 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' is laced with lush but unobtrusive strings which <b>nibble</b> round {{the edge of the}} song and push it into a new realm of arrangement for the band. The opportunity to give 'Monkey' the full Philharmonic treatment, complete with heavenly harp, must have been a temptation to them. Wisely such a folly has been resisted." ...|$|E
50|$|Tom, now {{wearing a}} feather duster as a headdress, catches <b>Nibbles,</b> but Jerry pops a {{champagne}} cork into Tom's face. Tom then grabs Jerry, but <b>Nibbles</b> launches off jelly and stabs Tom with a fork. Tom then hurls the fork to catch <b>Nibbles,</b> but Jerry, porched on candlestick, whacks Tom {{in the face}} with a spoon.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Sender founded <b>Nibbles</b> International, {{a seller}} of all-natural cheese spreads and snacks that Sender {{developed}} and that were produced and distributed by Beatrice Foods.

2500|$|Tirggel {{are also}} very durable. Swiss writer Emanuel Stickelberger {{reported}} in 1939 that [...] "the tirggel has the admirable quality of not becoming stale, and the harder it gets, the more enjoyable is it to <b>nibble</b> on."

5000|$|They {{find the}} [...] "bloomin' key" [...] and grab it off Tom, but Tom locks Jerry and <b>Nibbles</b> {{in the cellar}} and {{swallows}} the key. Jerry and <b>Nibbles</b> escape the cellar, and <b>Nibbles</b> is {{able to get the}} key for Robin Hood's cell by abseiling from a piece of string, into Tom's mouth, whilst Tom is asleep. However, the string breaks, and Tom swallows <b>Nibbles,</b> waking him up in the process. Hiccuping, Tom drinks down a great deal of red wine, and then he goes back to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nibbles</b> {{emerges from}} Tom's mouth, clearly inebriated and singing [...] "The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond".

Jerry squishes {{the end of the}} straw, saving <b>Nibbles</b> just in time, and blows the small mouse into the mousehole. Tom chases Jerry back to his hole but the cat moves the hole so that Jerry crashes into the wall and grabs him, but <b>Nibbles</b> comes out and hits Tom's tail with a hammer. The chase starts up again until <b>Nibbles</b> sips and spits some milk into Tom's face.|$|R

2500|$|The newborn {{caterpillar}} {{makes the}} eggshell its first meal and then {{rests on a}} silken bed that it spins for itself {{near the edge of}} a leaf. The little caterpillar mimics a bird dropping with its olive green body and white uric acid-like markings. The sheen enhances its resemblance to fresh bird dropping. While small in size, this camouflage permits the caterpillar to rest on the centre of a leaf and <b>nibble</b> around the edges. Later its growing size forces it to keep to twigs and the undersides of leaves except when it is feeding on leaves. It moves slowly and haltingly. It has a unique habit of securing its balance by weaving silk on the substratum.|$|E

50|$|Jerry and <b>Nibbles</b> hide in a closet, while Tom {{pounds on}} the door. Jerry uses a {{container}} of shoe polish to disguise himself and <b>Nibbles</b> {{as a pair of}} black people. Jerry (voiced by Lillian Randolph) emerges from the closet dressed in a headscarf and in blackface and greets Tom. Out comes <b>Nibbles</b> also in blackface and wearing a headscarf. However, the disguise is revealed when Nibbles' diaper falls down, exposing his tail and gray fur. The chase continues until Jerry hits Tom in the face with a frying pan, knocking him out before he pulls out Tom's tongue, and all with his strength knocks the cat in the head, causing Tom to chomp his tongue and he yells in pain before the chase once again. Jerry hands the frying pan to <b>Nibbles</b> and continues to lead the chase. But Instead of whacking the cat, <b>Nibbles</b> swings too soon and smashes his comrade. This repeats a second time, and on third time around, Jerry stops and points at the cat. <b>Nibbles</b> obliges and hits Tom square in the face, then crawls under the rug to escape with Jerry. Tom grabs a bottle to trap the mice but only catches Jerry. <b>Nibbles</b> taunts the cat and darts back under the rug, and Tom continues the chase.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nibbles</b> {{stops at}} the bowl again, signals for the cat to stop, and starts to drink the milk. Tom allows the mouse to drink briefly, then grabs <b>Nibbles,</b> but <b>Nibbles</b> crawls under Tom's fur. Tom grabs his tail and a {{revolver}} to shoot at <b>Nibbles</b> when he emerges from it, but just shoots his tail instead, screaming in agony. As <b>Nibbles</b> runs away, the cat chases him with a flyswatter and corners him. He gives the mouse with a great swat on the buttock. Jerry breaks through the glass to inspect his nephew. Jerry became very upset about a serious big red mark on <b>Nibble's</b> buttock by Tom's swat. Realizing {{what he did was}} unwise, the guilty Tom hides the flyswatter behind his back as if to say, [...] "It's not what it looks like Jerry". Not fooled, Jerry lets out a gentle roar and Tom turns yellow in fear. He tries to run away but Jerry grabs his tail, slams him against the floor, and then throws him into the trash can. He bashes Tom's face repeatedly with the can's lid.|$|R
