40|$|By {{the end of}} the British rule in Palestine on 14 May 1948, <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality</b> {{had become}} {{well-established}} in accordance with both domestic law and international law. Accordingly, the legal origin of <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality</b> lies in this nearly thirty-year period as the status of Palestinians has never been settled since that date. Hence, any legal consideration relating to the future status of the individuals who once held <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality</b> should commence from the point upon which the British rule over Palestine had been terminated. This thesis provides a legal basis for future settlement of the status of Palestinians of all categories that emerged in some sixty years that followed {{the end of the}} British mandate: Israel citizens, inhabitants of the occupied territory, and Palestinian refugees. In conclusion, nationality as regulated by Britain in Palestine represents an international status that cannot be legally altered except in accordance with international law...|$|R

5000|$|In some cases, {{national}} identity collides with a person's civil identity. For example, many Israeli Arabs associate {{themselves with the}} Arab or <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality,</b> {{while at the same}} time they are citizens of the state of Israel, which is in conflict with the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality.</b> Taiwanese also face a conflict of {{national identity}} with civil identity as there have been movements advocating formal [...] "Taiwan Independence" [...] and renaming [...] "Republic of China" [...] to [...] "Republic of Taiwan." [...] Residents in Taiwan are issued national identification cards and passports under the country name [...] "Republic of China", and a portion of them do not identify themselves with [...] "Republic of China," [...] but rather with [...] "Republic of Taiwan".|$|R

While enjoying the fruits of Jewish civil rights (such as access to courts of law and private property) and political rights (access to the ballot and to government) they are denied social rights and economic rights {{in the form of}} social security, education and welfare, or access to land and water resources of the State.|$|R

5000|$|The Druze became Israeli {{citizens}} and Druze males {{serve in the}} Israel Defense Forces, though some individuals identify as [...] "Palestinian Druze". According to Salih al-Shaykh, most Druze do not consider themselves to be Palestinian: [...] "their Arab identity emanates in the main from the common language and their socio-cultural background, but is detached from any national political conception. It is not directed at Arab countries or Arab <b>nationality</b> or the <b>Palestinian</b> people, and does not express sharing any fate with them. From this point of view, their identity is Israel, and this identity is stronger than their Arab identity".|$|R
50|$|Tsvi Misinai {{denies the}} {{existence}} of a separate Palestinian people as a historical identity and dismisses it as an utter fabrication. He views the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality</b> as a modern socio-political construct propped up by imperialist Arab Baathist regimes, as a means of claiming rights to the land of Israel and fight the Jews. He also blames them for accentuating hostilities between the Jews and Palestinians. In his book, Misinai asserts that the Palestinian people are a {{part and parcel of the}} people of Israel, and that no other party, including an Arab one, possesses the right to compete with the rights of the People of Israel over western Eretz Yisrael and their historical kinship with most Palestinians.|$|R
50|$|Palestinians {{regard the}} {{passport}} as a 'crucial symbol of nationhood.' The {{recognition of the}} passports by other countries has been cited as evidence of recognition by them of the State of Palestine and/or <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality</b> and citizenship. As of 1997, Palestinian authorities had not issued a passport {{in the name of}} the State of Palestine. While the United States Government recognizes Palestinian Authority passports as travel documents, it does not view them as conferring citizenship, since they are not issued by a government which the U.S. recognizes. Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have indicated only (in May 2002) that the passports, along with valid visas or other necessary papers, would allow their holders to travel to their countries.|$|R
50|$|Article 22 of The Covenant of the League of Nations conferred an {{international}} legal status upon the territories and people which {{had ceased to}} be under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire as part of a 'sacred trust of civilization'. Article 7 of the League of Nations Mandate required the establishment of a new, separate, <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality</b> for the inhabitants. This meant that Palestinians did not become British citizens, and that Palestine was not annexed into the British dominions. The Mandate document divided the population into Jewish and non-Jewish, and Britain, the Mandatory Power considered the Palestinian population to be composed of religious, not national, groups. Consequently, government censuses in 1922 and 1931 would categorize Palestinians confessionally as Muslims, Christians and Jews, with the category of Arab absent.|$|R

In 1959 it was officially merged into the United Arab Republic by the decree of Nasser, crippling any Palestinian hope for self governance. With the establishment in 1948 of the State of Israel, along with the migration of the Palestinian exodus, the common experience of the Palestinian refugee Arabs was mirrored in a fading of Palestinian identity. The institutions of a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality</b> emerged slowly in the Palestinian refugee diaspora. In 1950 Yasser Arafat founded Ittihad Talabat Filastin. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, most of the Husseini clan relocated to Jordan and the Gulf States. Many family heads that remained in the Old City and the northern neighborhoods of East Jerusalem fled due to hostility with the Jordanian government, which controlled {{that part of the}} city; King Abdullah's assassin was a member of an underground Palestinian organization led by Daoud al-Husayni.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} space in which Palestinian {{identity}} in the diaspora is formed and where moments of plurality emerge. By focusing on the Palestinian community in Canada, this study interrogates the processes of national identity formation and the achievement of belonging. The study utilizes empirical research {{in the form of}} interviews as well as the existing literature on the study of nationalism and identity to conduct a qualitative analysis of Palestinian national identity in the diaspora today. It thus demonstrates that the Palestinian identity is one that is intrinsically dual, with both essential and plural identities that are constructed and negotiated within a social matrix, and that incorporate national ideologies, collective memories, and cultural identities {{in the creation of a}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality.</b> In doing so, the study addresses a lack of scholarship on the identity formation in third generation Palestinian exiles, and illustrates the parameters of the ongoing Palestinian condition of statelessness...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of Palestinian women 2 ̆ 7 s roles and agency in creating and reinforcing Palestinian national identity. This is done by interviewing approximately 30 women, as well as observing and participating in daily life amongst Palestinian refugees. Women {{are an important part}} of the preservation and continuation of specific aspects of Palestinian culture, which are passed down from one generation to the next. Traditionally in research of refugees, women 2 ̆ 7 s voices have been marginalized, and by drawing on stand-point feminist theory this research focuses exclusively on women 2 ̆ 7 s roles and women 2 ̆ 7 s voices in order to lessen this academic bias. The national identity of diasporic populations if formulated in a unique way due to the lack of a sovereign nation-state. It has not been until recently in academia that women have been studied in depth for their contributions to the formation of national identity among diasporic populations. Generally, in the Middle East a person 2 ̆ 7 s ethnic heritage is passed on through the father 2 ̆ 7 s lineage, but the mothers, sisters, aunts, and grandmothers, who share their stories and cultural knowledge with children directly impact how individuals grow up to view themselves as having <b>Palestinian</b> <b>nationality.</b> This project focuses on the women 2 ̆ 7 s role in the production, conforming, and resistance to certain aspects of the Palestinian collective narrative, through women 2 ̆ 7 s roles in family life, every day practices, kinship, and social and religious rituals. This project examines how women construct their identities and express themselves through these activities, and it shows how these expressions influence the Palestinian collective narrative...|$|R
