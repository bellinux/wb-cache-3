There were several <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act, such as {{allowing}} the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.|$|E

She was originally appointed to work on X-ray diffraction of proteins and lipids in solution, but Randall redirected her work to DNA fibres because of <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field, and {{she was to be}} the only experienced experimental diffraction researcher at King's at the time.

500|$|<b>New</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{science of}} motion picture {{photography}} are not abundant at this advanced {{stage of the game}} but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed [...] "Pan-focus", as I have been active for two years in its development and used {{it for the first time}} in Citizen Kane. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.|$|E
500|$|From an {{academic}} perspective, Marx's work {{contributed to the}} birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the nineteenth century's three masters of the [...] "school of suspicion" [...] alongside Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud and as one of the three principal architects of modern social science along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber. In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method. Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> philosophies of history and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean sociological positivism in attempt to develop a science of society. Karl Löwith considered Marx and Søren Kierkegaard to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors. In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. Isaiah Berlin considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology [...] "in so far as anyone can claim the title". Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts and the humanities.William Roseberry (1997) Marx and Anthropology Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 26: pp. 25–46 (October 1997) ...|$|E

500|$|As Lord Admiral, Dudley was {{responsible}} for creating the Council for Marine Causes, which {{for the first time}} co-ordinated the various tasks of maintaining the navy functioning and thus made English naval administration the most efficient in Europe. At sea, Dudley's fighting orders were at the forefront of tactical thinking: Squadrons of ships, ordered by size and firepower, were to manoeuvre in formation, using co-ordinated gunfire. These were all <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English navy. In 1545 he directed the fleet's operations before, during, and after the Battle of the Solent and entertained King Henry on the flagship Henri Grace a Dieu. A tragic loss was the sinking of the Mary Rose with 500 men aboard. In 1546 John Dudley went to France for peace negotiations. When he suspected the Admiral of France, Claude d'Annebault, of manoeuvres which might have led to a renewal of hostilities, he suddenly put to sea in a show of English strength, before returning to the negotiating table. He then travelled to Fontainebleau, where the English delegates were entertained by the Dauphin Henri and King Francis. In the Peace of Camp, the French king acknowledged Henry VIII's title as [...] "Supreme Head of the Church of England and Ireland", a success for both England and her Lord Admiral.|$|E
