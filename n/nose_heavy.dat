25|$|While no orders {{followed}} {{from either}} the Admiralty, whose needs for a single-engined bomber had been met by the Airco DH.4 or the Royal Flying Corps, Sopwith obtained a license to build a prototype of the new bomber, designated Sopwith B.1 as a private venture, probably hoping for orders from the French Aéronautique Militaire. This prototype first flew in early April 1917, being tested officially later that month, where it demonstrated good performance, but was tail heavy when carrying a bomb load and <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> without, and was tiring to fly.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to trying {{different types of}} ordnance, the Allied Air Forces experimented with modifications to the aircraft themselves. Major Paul I. [...] "Pappy" [...] Gunn modified some USAAF Douglas A-20 Havoc light bombers by installing four [...] machine guns in their noses, and two [...] fuel tanks were added to give the aircraft more range. This was successful, and an attempt was then made to create a longer range attack aircraft by {{doing the same thing}} to a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber, to operate as a [...] "commerce destroyer". This proved to be somewhat more difficult. The resulting aircraft was obviously <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> despite adding lead ballast to the tail, and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft. The tail guns and belly turrets were removed, the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low.|$|E

2500|$|The Curtiss H-4 {{was found}} to have a number of problems, being both underpowered and having a hull too weak for {{sustained}} operations and having poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off. [...] One flying boat pilot, Major Theodore Douglas Hallam, wrote that they were [...] "comic machines, weighing well under two tons; with two comic engines giving, when they functioned, 180 horsepower; and comic control, being <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> with engines on and tail heavy in a glide." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Walter Scott's {{person and}} manner {{have been so}} often described, {{that you will not}} ask much of me in this way, {{especially}} as I saw so little of him. His frame is large and muscular, his walk difficult, in appearance, though be boasted himself a vigorous mountaineer, and his action, in general, measured and heavy. His features and countenance were very Scottish, with the short thick <b>nose,</b> <b>heavy</b> lips, and massive cheeks. The superior or intellectual part of his head was neither deep nor broad, but perhaps the reverse, though singularly high. Indeed, it is quite uncommon to see a scull so round and tower-like in the formation, though I have met with them in individuals not at all distinguished for talents. I do not think a casual observer would find anything unusual in the exterior of Sir Walter Scott, beyond his physical force, which is great, without being at all extraordinary. His eye, however, is certainly remarkable. Grey, small, and without lustre, in his graver moments it appears to look inward, instead of regarding external objects, in a way, though the expression, more or less, belongs to abstraction, that I have never seen equalled. His smile is good-natured and social; and when he is in the mood, as happened to be the fact so often in our brief intercourse as to lead me to think it characteristic of the man, his eye would lighten {{with a great deal of}} latent fun. He spoke more freely of his private affairs than I had reason to expect, though our business introduced the subject naturally; and, at such times, I thought the expression changed to a sort of melancholy resolution, that was not wanting in sublimity.|$|E
50|$|Fokker {{later told}} Bennett {{that he should}} have refused to conduct the test flight with Byrd, Bennett and Noville on board because there was no load {{in the rear of the}} plane. As a result, the plane was <b>nose</b> <b>heavy.</b>|$|E

60|$|The new prior was a tall, gaunt man, {{with a great}} hooked <b>nose</b> and <b>heavy</b> lips; his keen, {{dark eyes}} shone {{fiercely}} from beneath his shaggy brows. He was still young, full of passionate energy. And with large gesture and loud, metallic voice he loved to speak of hell-fire and the pains of the damned, hating the Jews and heretics with a bitter personal hatred.|$|R
5000|$|With {{placement}} of the engine and transmission assembly in a fore/aft position (longitudinally), the front axle is placed rearwards behind the engine, {{which leads to the}} criticism of some Audi vehicles as being <b>nose</b> <b>heavy,</b> though the system still leads to better weight distributions than transverse mounted engine packages as in Mitsubishis and similar cars. This allows for a better weight distribution of 55:45 (F:R).|$|E
50|$|Installing {{the much}} heavier Pak 42 {{meant that the}} Jagdpanzer IV was <b>nose</b> <b>heavy,</b> {{especially}} with the heavy frontal armor. This made them less mobile {{and more difficult to}} operate in rough terrain, leading their crews to nickname them Guderian-Ente ("Guderian's duck"). To prevent the rubber rims of the roadwheels being dislocated by the weight of the vehicle, some later versions had steel roadwheels installed on the front.|$|E

25|$|Without having {{tasted the}} wines, {{one does not}} know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the taster tries to {{determine}} {{the order in which}} the wines should be assessed by appearance and <b>nose</b> alone. <b>Heavy</b> wines will be deeper in color and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, viscous streaks (called legs or tears) down the inside of the glass when swirled.|$|R
50|$|Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} or prevent excessive blood loss from major trauma, post partum bleeding, surgery, tooth removal, <b>nose</b> bleeds, and <b>heavy</b> menstruation. It is also used for hereditary angioedema. It is taken either by mouth or injection into a vein.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{may differ}} greatly, as {{apparently}} modifiers control {{to some degree}} the amount of FVII that is produced. Some affected individuals have few or no symptoms while others may experience life-threatening bleeding. Typically this bleeding disorder manifests itself as a tendency to easy bruising, <b>nose</b> bleeding, <b>heavy</b> and prolonged menstruation, and excessive bleeding after dental or surgical interventions. Newborns may bleed in the head, from the umbilicus, or excessively after circumcision. Other bleeding can be encountered in the gut, in muscles or joints, or the brain. Hematuria may occur.|$|R
50|$|Testing showed {{several major}} {{problems}} with the Seamew. The aircraft was <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> in flight, and water spray during take-off damaged the 10 ft diameter propellers. The second prototype was fitted with reduced (8 ft) diameter, four-bladed propellers {{in an attempt to}} reduce the spray damage problem, but these gave a poor rate of climb. Another problem was corrosion of stainless steel fittings. These required replacing at considerable expense and as the type was unsatisfactory, the two prototypes were instead scrapped in 1930.|$|E

50|$|Ford Australia {{built its}} own version, {{known as the}} TE, with the 2.0-litre 4-cylinder Pinto unit and the Ford Falcon's 3.3-litre and 4.1-litre 6-cylinder unit. The six-cylinder {{versions}} were rather <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> and did not handle {{as well as the}} fours or the European V6 models. Interior door hardware and steering columns were shared with the Falcons and the Australian versions also had their own instrument clusters, optional air conditioning, and much larger bumpers. It also had side indicators. The Cortina wagon was assembled by Renault Australia at its plant in Heidelberg in Victoria.|$|E
6000|$|The {{man with}} the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham looking over his {{shoulder}} saw approaching a short, fat, and thickset beardless man, with aquiline <b>nose</b> and <b>heavy</b> neck and chin. Very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable expression. He scowled momentarily at Graham and then his regard returned to the {{man with the}} flaxen beard. [...] "These others," [...] he said in a voice of extreme irritation. [...] "You had better go." ...|$|R

The women adorn themselves with beads and necklaces, <b>heavy</b> <b>nose</b> rings and distinctive attire.|$|R
60|$|Dr Thorne was {{stretched}} fast {{asleep on the}} comfortless horse-hair sofa in the dingy sitting-room at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house when Frank found him. The funeral, and his journey to London, and the lawyers had together conquered his energies, and he lay and snored, with <b>nose</b> upright, while <b>heavy</b> London summer flies settled {{on his head and}} face, and robbed his slumbers of half their charms.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight at Brooklands in October 1917, with initial testing showing {{it to be}} <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> and subject to engine overheating. The second prototype, which differed in having the primitive pillar mounting for the observer's gun replaced by a more modern scarff ring, joined it for official testing at Martlesham Heath in February and March 1918. Performance was unimpressive, with the aircraft having a poor ceiling and low speed, and it was rejected as a service type. [...] The two Rhinos were then used as testbeds for development of propellers.|$|E
50|$|It {{was dark}} {{and there was a}} low {{overcast}} with a cloud base of around 400 feet when the Tupolev Tu-154 began its approach to Noril'sk Airport. The aircraft was about 5,000 pounds above its calculated weight and its center of gravity was beyond the forward limit for the type. The <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> condition caused Flight 3603 to descend through the glide path as it made its final approach. Flight 3603's captain initiated a go-around maneuver but the jetliner struck a mound approximately 1,500 feet short of the runway. Four crew members plus 95 passengers were killed in the accident.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{standard}} {{on the length}} of the chain whip. The typical length is also different between north and south China. The chain is shorter in the south which make it more suitable for close quarter fighting. In the north the length could be from the ground to the chin or the ground to the tip of the <b>nose.</b> Weight is <b>heavier</b> for practice and lighter for performance.|$|R
5000|$|Yak-3T: tank {{destroyer}} version {{armed with}} 1 × 37 mm Nudelman N-37 cannon with 25 rounds and 2 × 20 mm Berezin B-20S cannons with 100 rpg. Cockpit was moved 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in) back {{to compensate for}} the <b>heavier</b> <b>nose.</b> Engine modifications required to accept the weapons resulted in serious overheating problems which were never fixed and the aircraft did not advance beyond the prototype stage.|$|R
60|$|Carrying {{the lamp}} in one hand, the looking-glass in the other, and the brush (with the comb stuck in it) between her teeth, Ariel the Second, {{otherwise}} Dexter's cousin, presented herself plainly before {{me for the}} first time. I could now see the girl's round, fleshy, inexpressive face, her rayless and colorless eyes, her coarse <b>nose</b> and <b>heavy</b> chin. A creature half alive; an imperfectly developed animal in shapeless form clad in a man's pilot jacket, and treading in a man's heavy laced boots, with nothing but an old red-flannel petticoat, and a broken comb in her frowzy flaxen hair, to tell us that she was a woman--such was the inhospitable person who had received us in the darkness when we first entered the house.|$|R
5000|$|In 1953, Ford {{celebrated their}} 50th anniversary and the B-Series saw a {{redesign}} with new B-"00" [...] designations {{added to the}} name. The redesign implemented a set back front axle that made the front look <b>nose</b> <b>heavy,</b> but allowed for a tighter turning radius. The hood was also longer and flowed into the fenders. The grille was still horizontal, but was two bars {{as opposed to the}} one large one in the previous model. 1954 buses received a refreshed grille and a new OHV V8 engine option to replace the old 239 Flathead V8. The 1956 buses got a new wraparound windshield and restyled dashboards as well as a new grille that was similar to the 1953 model year.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{required to}} successfully achieve VTVL has several parts. First, thrust must {{be greater than}} weight, second the thrust is normally required to be vectored and requires some degree of throttling. Guidance must be capable of calculating the position and attitude of the vehicle, small deviations from the vertical can cause large deviations of the vehicles horizontal position. RCS systems are usually required to keep the vehicle at the correct angle. Landing legs and deployment mechanisms add to {{the weight of the}} vehicle compared to expendable vehicles, which can reduce performance. Aerodynamics and mass distribution are also crucial; vehicles generally have to be <b>nose</b> <b>heavy</b> during ascent, but need to be stable during landing, usually on their tail, and after touchdown, where they are susceptible to winds.|$|E
5000|$|Next {{the battery}} was repositioned {{to the trunk}} and a stiff 3/4" [...] sway bar was added to rear end to improve {{handling}} since the car was now <b>nose</b> <b>heavy.</b> This was the first Mustang ever fitted with a rear sway bar, and it notably handled much better than other big-block Mustangs of the time, making it a very capable track car. It came fitted with an 8,000rpm tachometer, and AM only radio. In addition, a hole was cut in the hood, and a manually controlled hood scoop was added to these cars. Other features included a front spoiler that was shallower than the Boss 302 spoiler, color keyed dual racing mirrors, and an engine oil cooler. It was also equipped with a 3.91 ratio rear axle with a [...] "Traction-Lock" [...] limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|Two prototypes were {{produced}} {{and sent to}} Aberdeen Proving Grounds. They were unsatisfactory because of their <b>heavy</b> <b>nose</b> weight. By the time the first pilot model was midway into being completed, the project was canceled since the army disliked the high superstructure, nose weight, and nearly vertical armor. The project was soon superseded by the T41 project. Later, the prototypes were kept {{on display in the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground until they were destroyed in 1947.|$|R
5000|$|For {{use against}} bunkers, buildings, enemy {{personnel}} in the open and light armour. The projectile can be set to detonate on impact or with a slightly delayed detonation. The <b>heavier</b> <b>nose</b> cap allows for the HEDP projectile to either penetrate light walls or windows and then explode, or be [...] "skipped" [...] off the ground for an airburst. For use against light armour, there is a smaller cone HEAT warhead with 150 mm (5.9 inches) of penetration against RHA.|$|R
60|$|Not {{without a}} shiver, {{though he was}} used to {{anatomical}} abortions, Dr. Simon lifted the head. It was slightly slashed about the neck and jaw, but the face was substantially unhurt. It was a ponderous, yellow face, at once sunken and swollen, with a hawk-like <b>nose</b> and <b>heavy</b> lids--a face of a wicked Roman emperor, with, perhaps, a distant touch of a Chinese emperor. All present seemed to look at it with the coldest eye of ignorance. Nothing else could be noted about the man except that, as they had lifted his body, they had seen underneath it the white gleam of a shirt-front defaced with a red gleam of blood. As Dr. Simon said, the man had never been of their party. But he might very well have been trying to join it, for he had come dressed for such an occasion.|$|R
