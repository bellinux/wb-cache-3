40|$|Abstract. Many {{combustion}} processes seriously {{pollute the}} environment because of producing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission, which abstracts wide attention from researchers. How to reduce <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission {{is important to}} protect the environment. At the present work, a reduction mechanism based on a detailed chemical reaction kinetics mechanism, Gri_Mech 3. 0 was adopted to analyze <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> formation in a CH 4 /air laminar premixed and turbulent diffusion flames, a two dimensional turbulent diffusion flame was simulated with the EDC model. Parameters were obtained, including flame temperature, burning velocity and mass fraction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides.</b> The results of laminar premixed flame show that <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission mainly comes from the thermal and prompt NO mechanisms. A large amount of free radicals O, H and OH produced by combustion processes provide reactants for the reactions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> formation. Mole fraction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> increases with the increasing of both flame temperature and chemical equivalence ratios. By contrast, there is a lower mass fraction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> formation for the fuel-lean flame...|$|R

5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the longest time. The stable, white, hygroscopic iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide,</b> ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E

This objective is achieved by measuring <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> concentration in exhaust emissions from diesel generator units and estimating <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission rates. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> concentrations are measured using a single gas exhaust gas analyzer (the Kane Auto 1 -NOx gas analyzer) and measurements are taken directly from the exhaust pipes of the diesel engines driving the generator. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission rates are calculated in g/kWh using United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.

25|$|Acid rain is a rain or {{any other}} form of {{precipitation}} that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide,</b> which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.|$|E
