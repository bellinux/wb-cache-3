25|$|Youhei is {{a second}} year student from class 2-A and Sunao's classmate. Amusingly, <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to get}} his name right.|$|E
25|$|The first {{application}} in Britain {{was on a}} Single Fairlie 0-4-4T, exhibited in Paris in 1878 and purchased by the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway in 1883. According to Ahrons, the locomotive saw very little service as <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have known how to set the valves and this led to enormous coal consumption.|$|E
25|$|A diabolical demon and Ruby's ex-husband {{who wants}} the Necronomicon {{for his own}} nefarious purposes. His {{abilities}} include using lust to manipulate others, possessing human bodies {{and the ability to}} slow down time near a target where he can converse with or injure said target. When Baal is using this power <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be able to see him besides the person he is interacting with. Ruby has also mentioned that he is impervious to physical attacks and can only be harmed through mystic or spiritual means.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have {{anything}} except silent sympathy at his command.|$|R
60|$|Several demurrers now arose, for <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{think that}} I would want such an ugly skin as that.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{listened in}} the hallway. As <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{be at the}} garret stairway, he ran outside, to learn how Tom was faring.|$|R
25|$|In August 1796 {{his uncle}} the regent {{arranged}} for the young king to visit Saint Petersburg to betroth him to Catherine the Great's granddaughter, Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna. However, the whole arrangement foundered on the obstinate refusal of Gustav to allow his destined bride liberty of worship according to the rites of the Russian Orthodox Church. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have suspected the possibility {{at the time that}} emotional problems might lie at the root of Gustav's abnormal piety. On the contrary, when he came of age that year, thereby ending the regency, there were many who prematurely congratulated themselves on the fact that Sweden had now no disturbing genius, but an economical, God-fearing, commonplace monarch to deal with.|$|E
25|$|Beth (Kate Winslet) is {{a single}} businesswoman who goes {{on a blind date}} with Davis (Hugh Jackman), the city's most {{eligible}} bachelor. When the two arrive together at a restaurant, Beth is shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of testicles dangling from his neck. Over dinner it confuses her that Davis fails to acknowledge his anatomical abnormality, and that <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be surprised by it. When two friends of Davis (Roy Jenkins and Katie Finneran) come by, one of them convinces him to give Beth a kiss. Davis agrees, but when he kisses her, his neck-testicles are dangling near Beth's mouth, causing her to scream and budge out of the kiss.|$|E
25|$|Pay {{was below}} {{industry}} standard, {{and there was}} no pension scheme. Working conditions could be bad; for example, the engine crews had to work half-cab locomotives tender-first half the time. There was no canteen or washing facilities, and conditions in the workshops at Shepherdswell were very primitive. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have noted any staff toilet there. However, narrative evidence suggests {{that there was a lot}} of spare time on the job, although tales of staff drinking beer in pubs while their trains waited (which would entail instant dismissal on the main line) are probably urban legends. It seems that the staff used the pubs near the railway at Shepherdswell, Eythorne, Woodnesborough and Port Richborough as places to wait over and to have their lunches in the absence of any company facilities (tragically, of these only one of the two station pubs at Shepherdswell survives).|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} it advisable to ask questions, {{and the men}} dispersed; but as they went down the stairway, Allonby turned to Torrance.|$|R
60|$|Then came a silence: <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have {{anything}} to say. It was broken by the entrance of Olfan, whose face showed the disturbance of his mind.|$|R
60|$|He {{took the}} tea, {{which he did}} not want in the least, and then there came an awkward silence. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> know how to begin the conversation.|$|R
25|$|The First Test between Australia and England {{is played}} {{nowadays}} a Brisbane. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know why, {{and all sorts}} of arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the Woolloongabba ground. I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a concentration camp! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down...at Brisbane only a Hutton could stay, let alone score runs.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{had just}} retired from touring {{after one of}} the most {{difficult}} periods of their career, including the [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] controversy and the band's unintentional snubbing of Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos. Lennon talked about the song in 1980: [...] "I was different all my life. The second verse goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.' Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be as hip as me is what I was saying. Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius – 'I mean it must be high or low'", and explaining that the song was [...] "psycho-analysis set to music".|$|E
2500|$|On tickets etc. and in {{publicity}} {{the railway}} referred to {{itself as the}} [...] "East Kent Railway". This was technically illicit, but <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have complained. The company logo was [...] "EKR" [...] (no heraldry).|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to the parlour full of dismay. Willis Starr {{remained}} gloomy and taciturn {{all the rest of the}} evening, but <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> notice it but myself.|$|R
60|$|Thus I {{should have}} answered, had the {{response}} lain with me, but <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be of my mind; <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> surprised, startled, or at a loss. The quietest commonplace answer met the strange, the dead-disturbing, the Witch-of-Endor query of the hunchback.|$|R
60|$|Kit looked round. The café was crowded, but {{the people}} were talking excitedly, and <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> notice him and the girl. The noise would prevent their talk being heard.|$|R
2500|$|This {{was usually}} {{sufficient}} for double track {{on the main}} line, including the bridge and tunnel, but earthworks were for single track. Hence the revenue from haymaking. The fencing was post and wire. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have noticed any gradient posts. Anti-trespasser notices were in enamel. This was the text: ...|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Lee of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "a visual dazzler and a {{dramatic}} non-starter." [...] Elizabeth Kerr of The Hollywood Reporter called the film [...] "a thrill ride {{in need of}} a few more thrills." [...] Norl Murray of the Los Angeles Times remarked that [...] "while Bigelow's version featured charismatic lead performances and ample pop, Core's cast mumbles slowly and sparingly at one another until it's time to jump off something." [...] The A.V. Clubs Ignatiy Vishnevetsky said: [...] "Boldly reimagining Kathryn Bigelow’s cult favorite as a movie where absolutely <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be having any fun, the new Point Break drops the original’s Zen-like balance of macho mysticism and camp in favor of dour humorlessness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hammer and Chalamet both signed {{contracts}} that prohibited full-frontal nudity. Ivory, whose original screenplay contained [...] "all sorts of nudity," [...] was {{dismayed by the}} decision, saying, [...] "Again, it's just this American attitude. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> care that much, or be shocked, about a totally naked woman. It’s the men." [...] Guadagnino, who remained involved in the casting for Call Me by Your Name, chose to cast actors based on their performances and chemistry, rather than choosing to [...] "investigate or label" [...] their sexuality. He said, [...] "The idea {{that you have to}} cast only someone who has a certain set of skills, and worse, a certain gender identity in any role: that’s oppressive to me." ...|$|E
60|$|The girls made an {{appropriate}} reply {{to this view}} of the subject, by showing that Mrs. A. and Mrs. B. had done the thing, and <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> make any talk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said John. [...] "Why aren't {{you on the}} News any more? <b>Nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{know where}} you were, till I met Faraday this morning, who {{told me you were}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So far as I {{know only}} a few of the fellows have left the Hall on account of the scarlet fever scare," [...] said Larry. [...] "And they were boys that <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> care much about." ...|$|R

Everywhere there is dust and dirt...Forgive me if I am bitter about the Woolloongabba ground...the city has many good points, and {{the people who live there}} are generous and hospitable to the highest degree, but once one goes to the cricket ground the advantages are overwhelmingly lost in the mass of rules and regulations... – John Kay, 1950–51 Ashes series ...|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. Perhaps he's {{trying to}} find out what a Socialist is. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know.|$|E
6000|$|Sewell nodded sympathetically. [...] "There is gold here--though it's {{remarkable}} that <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know how much," [...] he said. [...] "Tomlinson apparently was not communicative." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently Sam had {{a lecture}} to attend {{and went off}} to it. At half-past three he was free once more and hurried again to his room. Tom was still absent, and <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> know {{anything}} about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{trouble is}} that I didn't find anything. I spent several most {{unpleasant}} hours watching a railroad-trestle in blinding snow, until the cattle-train went by in safety. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have the slightest wish to meddle with it." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, {{a wave of}} {{spontaneous}} revolutions swept through Asia and Europe. Coordinated only via the internet, <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be in overall charge, and no overall aims except self-determination and freedom were apparent. This <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> justify the beliefs of the computer utopians.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom lives there. Old man {{lives with}} Ed. Tom ousted The old man some way, <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know how, {{and so he}} lives with Ed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, citoyen, <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know {{of it by}} that name. There are {{any amount}} of fisherman's huts all along the course [...] . but [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've come back--warned off by {{the police}} as usual," [...] he said. [...] "In the {{language}} of the country, <b>nobody</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have any use for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{you put in}} your oar, you old sleep-walker!" [...] growled Nat Poole, {{and then}} hurried off {{and out of sight}} behind the gymnasium. At the parting shot Shadow became pale, but <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> notice the remark.|$|R
60|$|He went ahead, up the {{somewhat}} dilapidated stairs, and Dave followed. In {{the pool and}} billiard parlors below some men were laughing and talking, and clicking the ivory balls together, but upstairs it was silent, and <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be around.|$|R
60|$|Here {{was a most}} unlooked-for {{state of}} affairs! What was to be done? The boys {{ran back to the}} sled, and the colored men ran out to the road, and {{everybody}} talked and <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> say anything of use.|$|R
