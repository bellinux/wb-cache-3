5|$|The <b>nunatak</b> {{areas have}} a {{scarcity}} of flora, limited to lichen, bryophyte and algae. Flowering plants are not found there. The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered the occurrence of any threatened or rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land, the known ones thus existing in healthy populations.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to allow it to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base <b>nunatak</b> for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E
25|$|In <b>nunatak</b> {{areas in}} the tropics, where daytime {{tropical}} sun or volcanic heat heated bare rock sheltered from cold wind and made small temporary melt pools, which would freeze at sunset.|$|E
5000|$|All-Blacks <b>Nunataks</b> (...) is a {{group of}} {{conspicuous}} <b>nunataks</b> lying midway between Wallabies <b>Nunataks</b> and Wilhoite <b>Nunataks</b> at the southeast margin of the Byrd Névé in Antarctica. Named by the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (1960-61) for the well known New Zealand national rugby union team.|$|R

They were so named by the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (1960-61) because of their isolation.|$|R
25|$|<b>Nunatak</b> is the BAS’s house band. The five person indie {{rock band}} {{is part of}} a science team {{investigating}} climate change and evolutionary biology on the Antarctic Peninsula. They are chiefly known for their participation in Live Earth in 2007, where they were the only band to play in the event's Antarctica concert.|$|E
25|$|The {{quartzite}} and dolerite {{areas in}} the higher mountains show evidence of glaciation, and much of Australia's glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. Cradle Mountain, another dolerite peak, for example, was a <b>nunatak.</b> The combination of these different rock types offers incredible scenery, much of it distinct from any other region of the world. In the far southwest corner of the state, the geology is almost completely quartzite, which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round.|$|E
25|$|Some notable {{geographic}} {{features in}} the general vicinity of Mount Elkins include Cape Batterbee (92km to the north), the Young Nunataks (7.4km to the south), Sørtoppen <b>Nunatak</b> (30km to the east), the Newman Nunataks (26km to the west), Mount McMaster (97km to the west), and Mount Kjerringa (57km to the northeast). The nearest permanently inhabited place is Mawson Station, an Australian research station to the southeast. Molodyozhnaya Station, a former Soviet research station which was mothballed in 1989, is located to the southwest of Mount Elkins.|$|E
5000|$|Whichaway <b>Nunataks</b> (...) is a {{group of}} rocky <b>nunataks</b> {{extending}} for 7 nautical miles (13 km) and marking {{the south side of the}} mouth of Recovery Glacier. First seen from the air and visited in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition and so named because it was uncertain which route from the <b>nunataks</b> would lead furthest inland. The Blackwall Ice Stream joins Recovery Glacier between the Argentina Range and the Whichaway <b>Nunataks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Brusilov <b>Nunataks</b> (...) are a {{group of}} <b>nunataks</b> lying 6 nmi km north of Mount Morrison in the Tula Mountains, Enderby Land. The geology of the <b>nunataks</b> was {{investigated}} by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, 1961-62, which named them after the Russian polar explorer G.L. Brusilov.|$|R
5000|$|The Kozlov <b>Nunataks</b> (...) are a {{group of}} <b>nunataks</b> lying 8 nmi km north of Mount Parviainen in the Tula Mountains of Enderby Land, Antarctica. The <b>nunataks</b> were visited by geologists of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, 1961-62, who named them for M.I. Kozlov, a Soviet polar pilot.|$|R
25|$|The harsh {{climate and}} ice-bound terrain limits {{vegetation}} to fungi (ascomycetes including lichens) and non-vascular plants (mosses and liverworts). The flora are {{representative for the}} maritime Antarctic and are phytogeographically similar to the South Sandwich Islands and South Shetland Islands. Vegetation is limited because of the ice cover, although snow algae are recorded. The remaining vegetation is located in snow-free areas such as <b>nunatak</b> ridges {{and other parts of}} the summit plateau, the coastal cliffs, capes and beaches. At Nyrøysa, five species of moss, six ascomycetes (including five lichens), and twenty algae have been recorded. Most snow-free areas are so steep and subject to frequent avalanches that only crustose lichens and algal formations are sustainable. There are six endemic ascomycetes, three of which are lichenized.|$|E
500|$|Troll {{is located}} {{in the eastern part of}} Princess Martha Coast in Queen Maud Land, which Norway claims as a {{dependent}} territory. The station is located on the <b>nunatak</b> bare ground area Jutulsessen, at [...] above mean sea level. It is completely surrounded by the Antarctic ice sheet. This is unlike most other Antarctic research stations, which are located on snow. Troll is [...] from the coast.|$|E
500|$|Troll Satellite Station (...) , {{commonly}} abbreviated TrollSat, is {{a satellite}} ground station located at Troll in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. The earth station {{is owned by}} Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), {{a joint venture between}} the Kongsberg Group and the Norwegian Space Center. The radomes are located on top of Jutulsessen, a <b>nunatak</b> area next to the research station at Troll. The research station is operated by the Norwegian Polar Institute, which also maintains the earth station. TrollSat started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened on 20 January 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Wallabies <b>Nunataks</b> (...) is a {{large group}} of <b>nunataks</b> near the polar plateau, lying 10 {{nautical}} miles (18 km) northeast of All-Blacks <b>Nunataks</b> at {{the east side of the}} Byrd Neve.

5000|$|Sneddon <b>Nunataks</b> (...) is a {{group of}} coastal <b>nunataks</b> {{on the north side of}} Edward VII Peninsula which overlooks the Swinburne Ice Shelf and Sulzberger Bay. They stand 11 mi ESE of Scott <b>Nunataks</b> in the {{northern}} part of the Alexandra Mountains. The <b>nunataks</b> appear on the map of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1928-30. Named by US-ACAN for Donald L. Sneddon, U.S. Navy, electronics technician with the Byrd Station winter party in 1967.|$|R
5000|$|The Destination <b>Nunataks</b> (...) are a {{group of}} peaks and <b>nunataks,</b> 9 nmi km long and 4 nmi km wide, rising to 2,565 m at Pyramid Peak and {{including}} Sphinx Peak, Andrews Peak, Mummy Ridge, and unnamed <b>nunataks</b> to the northwest, located in northeast Evans Neve, 7 nmi km northwest of the Barker Range, Victoria Land, Antarctica. This group was visited in 1970-71 by a Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition geological party led by M.G. Laird. The name [...] "Destination Rocks" [...] was originally used for the feature because these <b>nunataks</b> were near the northern limits of Laird's expedition. The name Destination <b>Nunataks,</b> as approved by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee and the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 1985, applies to the entire group described rather than to just two <b>nunataks</b> at the southeast end as indicated on some maps. These <b>nunataks</b> lie situated on the Pennell Coast, a portion of Antarctica lying between Cape Williams and Cape Adare.|$|R
500|$|On 8November 1911, Prestrud, Stubberud and Johansen had {{departed}} for King Edward VII Land. The {{search for the}} point at which the solid ice of the Barrier became ice-covered land proved difficult. On 1 December the party had their first sighting of what was indubitably dry land, a <b>nunatak</b> which had been recorded by Scott during the Discovery expedition in 1902. After reaching this point they collected geological specimens and samples of mosses, and briefly explored their surroundings before returning to Framheim on 16December. [...] They were the first men to set foot on King Edward VII Land.|$|E
500|$|Heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} Mertz Glacier, with Mertz skiing ahead and Mawson and Ninnis driving the dogs, the party covered [...] on 18 November. This was despite encountering sastrugi—ridges {{in the ice}} caused by wind—as high as , that caused the dogs to slip and the sledges to roll. During the day they passed two peaks, which Mawson named Madigan <b>Nunatak</b> and Aurora Peak, after {{the leader of the}} Eastern Coastal Party and the expedition's ship. The following day they began the steep descent to the Mertz Glacier. After the sledges several times overtook the dogs, the huskies were allowed to run free down the slope.|$|E
500|$|To save {{himself from}} future crevasses, Mawson {{constructed}} a rope ladder, which he carried {{over his shoulder}} and was attached to the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses. Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January Madigan <b>Nunatak</b> came into view. The following day, after travelling 5miles, a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about [...] to his right. In it he found food and a note from Archibald Lang McLean, who along with Frank Hurley and Alfred Hodgeman had been sent out by Auroras captain John King Davis to search for the Far Eastern Party.|$|E
50|$|The Seal <b>Nunataks</b> are a {{group of}} 16 islands called <b>nunataks</b> {{emerging}} from the Larsen Ice Shelf east of Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula. The Seal <b>Nunataks</b> {{have been described as}} separate volcanic vents of ages ranging from Miocene to Pleistocene. There are unconfirmed reports of Holocene volcanic activity.|$|R
5000|$|Exiles <b>Nunataks</b> (...) is {{a cluster}} of small <b>nunataks</b> 8 miles (13 km) {{south-southwest}} of DeRemer <b>Nunataks.</b> Mapped by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1960-63.

According to Otto Nordenskjöld in 1901-1903, Christensen <b>Nunatak</b> features a crater. Castor, Christensen and Hertha are the only vents which show evidence of subaerial activity in form of lava flows; elsewhere the nunataks are constructed by hyaloclastite and pillow lavas which form beneath ice. The volcanoes appear to align along northwest-striking lines.|$|E
5000|$|The Mizar <b>Nunataks</b> (...) {{are a small}} {{cluster of}} rock <b>nunataks</b> near the Antarctic polar plateau, 12 nmi km south of the Wilhoite <b>Nunataks.</b> They were named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names after the , a cargo vessel in the U.S. convoy to McMurdo Sound in U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze, 1962.|$|R
