5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour {{and shape of}} the leaves, as can Nematodes. Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the <b>Narcissus</b> common latent virus (NCLV, <b>Narcissus</b> mottling-associated virus), <b>Narcissus</b> latent virus (NLV, <b>Narcissus</b> mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, <b>Narcissus</b> degeneration virus (NDV), <b>Narcissus</b> late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, <b>Narcissus</b> mosaic virus, <b>Narcissus</b> yellow stripe virus (NYSV, <b>Narcissus</b> yellow streak virus), <b>Narcissus</b> tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and <b>Narcissus</b> white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{smallest}} species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species. Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism. N. cyclamineus has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected. The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (<b>Narcissus</b> alcaracensis, <b>Narcissus</b> bujei, <b>Narcissus</b> longispathus, <b>Narcissus</b> nevadensis, <b>Narcissus</b> radinganorum). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{narcissi}} are depicted {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (<b>Narcissus,</b> Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The <b>Narcissus</b> story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his <b>Narcissus,</b> the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|E
50|$|Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. <b>narcissi</b> causes rotting of {{the bulbs}} (basal rot) and {{yellowing}} {{of the leaves}} of daffodils (<b>Narcissi).</b>|$|R
500|$|Although prized as an {{ornamental}} flower, {{some people}} consider <b>narcissi</b> unlucky, because they hang their heads implying misfortune. White <b>narcissi,</b> such as N triandrus [...] "Thalia", are especially associated with death, {{and have been}} called grave flowers. In Ancient Greece <b>narcissi</b> were planted near tombs, and Robert Herrick describes them as portents of death, an association which also appears in the myth of Persephone and the underworld (see The Arts, below).|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{history the}} scent of <b>narcissi</b> has been an {{important}} ingredient of perfumes, a quality that comes from essential oils rather than alkaloids. <b>Narcissi</b> are also an important horticultural crop, and source of cut flowers (floriculture).|$|R
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (<b>narcissus</b> fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing <b>narcissus</b> white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the <b>Narcissus</b> leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|The name <b>Narcissus</b> (feminine Narcissa) was not {{uncommon}} in Roman times, such as Tiberius Claudius <b>Narcissus,</b> a Roman official in Claudius' time, an early New Testament Christian in Rome and later bishops and saints.|$|E
5|$|The <b>narcissus</b> {{appears in}} two Graeco-Roman myths, {{that of the}} youth <b>Narcissus</b> who was turned into the flower of that name, and of the Goddess Persephone {{snatched}} into the Underworld by the god Hades while picking the flowers. The <b>narcissus</b> is considered sacred to both Hades and Persephone, and to grow {{along the banks of}} the river Styx in the underworld.|$|E
25|$|In {{some areas}} where wild <b>narcissi</b> are {{particularly}} prevalent, their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals. The slopes around Montreux, Switzerland {{and its associated}} riviera come alive with blooms each May (May Snow), and {{are associated with the}} <b>Narcissi</b> Festival. However, the <b>narcissi</b> are now considered threatened. Festivals are held in many other countries and regions including Fribourg (Switzerland), Austria and in the United States, including Hawaii (Chinese New Year) and Washington State's Daffodil Festival.|$|R
25|$|Although prized as an {{ornamental}} flower, {{some people}} consider <b>narcissi</b> unlucky, because they hang their heads implying misfortune, and hence refuse {{to have them}} in the house. White <b>narcissi</b> are especially associated with death, especially the pure white N triandrus 'Thalia', and hence are considered grave flowers. Indeed, in Ancient Greece <b>narcissi</b> were planted near tombs. Robert Herrick, describes them as portents of death, an association which also appears in the myth of Persephone and the underworld (see The Arts, below).|$|R
5|$|In {{some areas}} where <b>narcissi</b> are prevalent, their {{blooming}} in spring is celebrated in festivals.

5|$|The plural form of {{the common}} name <b>narcissus</b> has caused some confusion. British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two {{alternate}} forms, narcissi and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, <b>narcissus,</b> used for both singular and plural. The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order. However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form, <b>narcissus</b> being excessively sibilant. For similar reasons, Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage. Neither support <b>narcissus</b> as a plural form. Common names such as <b>narcissus</b> do not capitalise the first letter {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E
5|$|Within the Narcisseae, <b>Narcissus</b> (western Mediterranean) diverged from Sternbergia (Eurasia) {{some time}} in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 29.3–18.1 Ma. Later the genus divided into the two subgenera (Hermione and <b>Narcissus)</b> between 27.4–16.1 Ma. The {{divisions}} between the sections of Hermione then took place during the Miocene period 19.9–7.8 Ma. <b>Narcissus</b> appears to have arisen {{in the area of the}} Iberian peninsula, southern France and north-western Italy. Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} <b>Narcissus</b> pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, <b>narcissus</b> bulb fly Merodon equestris, and {{two species of}} hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The {{hatching}} larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack <b>Narcissus</b> bulbs.|$|E
25|$|In western European culture <b>narcissi</b> and daffodils {{are among}} the most celebrated flowers in English literature, from Gower to Day-Lewis, while the best known poem is {{probably}} that of Wordsworth. In the visual arts, <b>narcissi</b> are depicted in three different contexts, mythological, floral art, or landscapes, from mediaeval altar pieces to Salvador Dalí.|$|R

5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest <b>narcissi</b> {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today <b>narcissi</b> are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, <b>narcissi</b> are classified into divisions, covering {{a wide range of}} shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, <b>narcissi</b> produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, <b>narcissi</b> are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|R
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, <b>Narcissus</b> {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, <b>Narcissus</b> species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. <b>Narcissus</b> also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E

5|$|<b>Narcissus</b> is a genus of {{perennial}} herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, dying {{back after}} flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow {{in the following}} year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80cm depending on the species. Dwarf species such as N. asturiensis have a maximum height of 5–8cm, while <b>Narcissus</b> tazetta may grow as tall as 80cm.|$|E

40|$|Red {{colouration}} {{of tissues}} occurs {{as a result}} of mechanical injuries to petals of Hippeastrum hybr. hort. cv. Winter Carnival or their infection by Phoma <b>narcissi.</b> Microscopic study recorded red pigment formation following mechanical injuries or pathogenic infection of white petals.

It {{was found that}} ruthenium red (RR), a Ca++ channel blocker, at concentrations 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 5 mM substantially inhibited the red pigment formation in wounded scales of Hippeastrum, proportionally to the concentration used. RR, at concentration of 0. 3 mM, totally inhibited the mycelium growth of Phoma <b>narcissi,</b> a pathogen of Hippeastrum, on PDA medium. However, RR did not inhibit development of the disease symptoms caused by P. <b>narcissi</b> on scales and basal plate of Hippeastrum bulbs.
