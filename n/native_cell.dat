40|$|Cell wall {{turnover}} {{was examined}} in parent and mutant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Peptidoglycan and teichoic acid were observed to undergo turnover in the wild-type strain during exponential growth; however, {{the rate of}} turnover did not decrease when the growth rate slowed, as the culture entered stationary phase. Isolated <b>native</b> <b>cell</b> walls and crude soluble autolytic enzyme were prepared from cells harvested during exponential and postexponential phases of growth. <b>Native</b> <b>cell</b> walls from both phases of growth autolyzed in buffer at identical rates; similarily, crude soluble enzyme from both preparations degraded radioactive cell walls at the same rate. Therefore, {{the activity of the}} autolysin in both exponential and postexponential cells was similar. The autolysis of whole cells of a mutant tar- 1 was enhanced by 1. 0 M NaCl. When 1. 0 M NaCl was present under growing conditions, the rate of cell wall turnover was greatly increased. The presence of chloramphenicol, which inhibits whole-cell autolysis, also inhibited turnover. Analysis of the cell wall material recovered from spent medium revealed products consistent with the known mode of action of the endogenous autolysin. It is concluded that cell wall turnover in S. aureus is independent of the stage of culture growth but is dependent instead on the activity of the autolysin...|$|E

SlpA was reassembled on unilamellar liposomes consisting of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine and 1, 2 -dioleoyl- 3 -trimethylammonium-propane, prepared by extrusion through membranes with pore sizes of 50 nm and 100 nm. Similarly extruded samples without SlpA {{were used as}} a reference. The SlpA-containing samples showed clear diffraction peaks in their SAXS intensities. The lattice constants were calculated from the diffraction pattern and compared to those determined for SlpA on <b>native</b> <b>cell</b> wall fragments. Lattice constants for SlpA reassembled on liposomes (a= 9. 29 nm, b= 8. 03 nm, and γ= 84. 9 °) showed a marked change in the lattice constants b and γ when compared to those determined for SlpA on <b>native</b> <b>cell</b> wall fragments (a= 9. 41 nm, b= 6. 48 nm, and γ= 77. 0 °). The latter are in good agreement with values previously determined by electron microscopy. This indicates that the structure formed by SlpA is stable on the bacterial cell wall, but SlpA reassembles into a different structure on cationic liposomes. From the (10) reflection, the lower limit of crystallite size of SlpA on liposomes {{was determined to be}} 92 nm, corresponding to approximately ten aligned lattice planes...|$|E

This research aims to study the effect of Zn and/or Cd on the growth of P. aeruginosa PDMZnCd 2003 and Zn and Cd tolerance mechanisms. The results showed that Zn and Cd treatments affected the growth of P. aeruginosa PDMZnCd 2003 in Nutrient Broth (NB). Zn and Cd also induced the bacterium to secret yellow-green chemicals. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) indicated that the bacterium produced large amounts of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) under the heavy metals treatments, especially Cd. The EPS were removed from <b>native</b> <b>cells</b> of P. aeruginosa PDMZnCd 2003 by α-glucoamylase to become EPS-free cells. Statistical analyses of FT-IR spectra separated the <b>native</b> <b>cells</b> into control group and group with <b>native</b> <b>cells</b> treated with Zn and/or Cd by the shifts in α-helix and amide II. EPS-free cells were separated into three subgroups of control, EPS-free cells treated with Cd and EPS-free cells treated with Zn and Zn plus Cd.

40|$|Neurotransmitter {{transporters}} generate larger currents {{than expected}} if one assumes fixed stoichiometry models. It remains controversial, however, whether these depolarizing currents arise from high density and rapid turnover rates of a classical transporter, or whether transporters exhibit bona fide channel behavior. Although heterologously expressed transporters show single-channel behavior and noise analysis in <b>native</b> <b>cells</b> strongly suggests channel behavior, no directly observed single-channel events associated with transporters {{have been reported}} thus far in <b>native</b> <b>cells.</b> We describe single-channel events arising directly from the Caenorhabditis elegans dopamine transporter (DAT- 1) as evidenced by DA-induced channel activity blocked by a high-affinity DAT- 1 inhibitor, increased channel activity in neurons that overexpress DAT- 1, and loss of channels in dat- 1 knockout neurons. Our data indicate that authentic transporter channels underlie depolarizing whole-cell currents. Thus, DA transporters not only transport DA but also exhibit a channel mode of conduction that directly modulates membrane potential and neuronal function...|$|R

40|$|RINm 5 F cells, a line {{derived from}} a rat insulinoma, are {{frequently}} used {{as a model for}} studying pancreatic B cell structure and function. These transformed cells are known, however, to be different from <b>native</b> B <b>cells</b> in a number of biochemical respects. We have now compared the surface features of RIN <b>cells</b> and <b>native</b> B <b>cells</b> in two different ways: 1) Dispersed cells from islet obtained from adult rats can reassociate spontaneously in culture to form aggregates (pseudoislets) with cellular organization similar to that of intact native islets (a central B cell core surrounded by a discontinuous mantle of non-B <b>cells).</b> <b>Native</b> islet <b>cells</b> and RIN cells were mixed together and allowed to reaggregate. Examination by immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy showed that the aggregates contained all cell types present in the original mixed <b>cell</b> suspension (<b>native</b> B- and non-B cells, and RIN <b>cells).</b> The <b>native</b> B <b>cells</b> were centrally located, surrounded by zones of non-B cells, as in islets. The RIN cells, however, were restricted to the periphery and as such not recognized as <b>native</b> B <b>cells.</b> 2) R 2 D 6, a monoclonal antibody, binds selectively to a ganglioside on the surface of islet B, but not non-B, cells. The role of this ganglioside is not known. RIN cells were incubated with R 2 D 6 followed by a fluorescently labeled second antibody. Analysis by flow cytofluorometry indicated that the monoclonal antibody had bound (stained) only 3 - 15 % of the RIN cells. These R 2 D 6 positive cells were sorted from R 2 D 6 negative cells and subsequently shown to have a lower DNA content. Expression of the R 2 D 6 target ganglioside on RIN cells thus appears to be cell cycle dependent. Based on two different criteria, RINm 5 F cells do not therefore share surface features in common with <b>native</b> B <b>cells.</b> The cell cycle dependent expression of a B cell surface antigen by the RIN cells might, however, be a useful model for studying the regulation of ganglioside turnover...|$|R

30|$|Here, we {{presented}} {{the advantage of}} correlational structure and function studies of membrane proteins in nano-size uni-lamellar lipodisq with SMA surrounding the lipid bilayer, even <b>native</b> <b>cell</b> membrane. Other alternative nano-size uni-lamellar membrane configurations, such as bicelles and nanodiscs, were reported to improve substrate accessibilities to two sides of an incorporated membrane protein in lipid bilayers (Raschle et al., 2010). However, specific lipid, detergents are required for bicelles formation, but resulting in a heterogeneous system (in size and composition) (Raschle et al., 2010). Apo-lipoprotein nanodiscs, composing of a lipid core surrounded by an amphipathic membrane scaffold protein (MSP) (Bayburt and Sligar, 2003, 2010), had the advantage {{that they could be}} made from a variety of lipid mixtures, and was relatively mono-dispersed in size upon protein incorporation. Nevertheless, nanodiscs still required detergents for protein incorporation, and could not be directly applied for native membrane system. Moreover, presence of the MSP might bring unpredictable interferences to incorporated proteins or specific interactions to lipids in core. Besides the well integrity maintenance of the native environment and the integral membrane proteins in uni-lamellar lipodisq, the improved accessibility of soluble partner to SMA based lipodisqs in homogenous size provided much convenience for further receptor ligand binding, enzymology analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis in <b>native</b> <b>cell</b> membrane environment using 19 F solid state NMR or other biophysical methods. Therefore, size homogenous SMA based lipodisqs can not only improve accessibility of soluble partner, but also maintain integrity of the native environment for the integral membrane proteins.|$|E

While significant {{progress has been made}} in understanding the proteins that reorganise mitochondria, the physiological significance of the various arrangements is poorly understood. The lack of understanding may occur partly because mitochondrial morphology is studied most often in cultured cells. The simple anatomy of cultured cells presents an attractive model for visualizing mitochondrial behaviour but contrasts with the complexity of <b>native</b> <b>cells</b> in which elaborate mitochondrial movements and morphologies may not occur. Mitochondrial changes may take place in <b>native</b> <b>cells</b> (in response to stress and proliferation), but over a slow time-course and the cellular function contributed is unclear.

In addition, we have identified endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) as the effector for this response. Here, we examined whether Cyp 3 a 13 gene transfer confers oxygen sensitivity to cultured muscle cells from mouse aorta.
