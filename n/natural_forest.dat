In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago.

Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E

The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid.

In comparison with <b>natural</b> <b>forests,</b> plantations decreased aboveground net primary production, litterfall, and rate of soil respiration by 11, 34, and 32 %, respectively.

40|$|Rapid {{transformation}} of <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> into other land-use {{systems in the}} lowlands of Sumatra, Indonesia, strongly reduces total aboveground biomass and affects nutrient cycling. However, {{the consequences of this}} conversion for C and N stocks of dead wood remains poorly understood particularly in <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> and jungle rubber. This study examined the differences in dead wood abundance, and C, N and lignin concentrations of three decay stages of dead wood as well as the stocks of these chemical components stored in dead wood. Standing and fallen dead wood was determined as coarse woody debris with diameter ≥ 10 cm and classified into three decay stages of wood. Mass of dead wood was estimated using allometric equation. Total C and N stocks in dead wood in the <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> (4. 5 t C ha - 1, 0. 05 t N ha - 1, respectively) were three times higher than those in the jungle rubber (1. 5 t C ha - 1, 0. 02 t N ha - 1, respectively). The stocks of C and N at early and advanced wood decay stages in the <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> were also higher than those in the jungle rubber. The decay stages showed pronounced differences in concentrations of chemical components. With advancing stage of wood decay, N concentration increased and C/N ratio decreased, while concentrations of C and lignin were variable. The distribution of dead wood mass and stocks of C, and lignin were found to be higher in the early decay than those in the advanced decay stage. Higher input of dead wood in <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> indicated a higher importance of dead wood decay in <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> than in jungle rubber systems.

40|$|This {{report has}} the {{following}} problem formulation: How can planted forests relieve pressure on <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> and under which circumstances can planted forest area be expanded? The report takes its departure {{in the issue}} of deforestation and how this constitutes {{a serious threat to}} the <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> of the world. The main reasons for deforestation are particularly agriculture and to a smaller extent need for wood. The first analytical part of the project investigates planted forests to see if these can relieve this pressure on <b>natural</b> <b>forests.</b> The corporate private sector is focused upon as it is found to be the most productive and the Danish forest investment company International Woodland Company is used as an example. We find that planted forest can relieve pressure on <b>natural</b> <b>forests,</b> as they can provide the wood resources the world needs. Planted forests also hold a potential to relieve <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> in the sense they can provide a better alternative than conversion of <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> to agriculture. They hold this potential as they are more productive than <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> and hence a financially viable alternative, and as they can provide more biological benefits than agriculture in relation to biodiversity. Certification of wood from planted forests is found to be a good method to ensure that biodiversity is preserved. The second part of the project investigates under which circumstances planted forest area can be expanded under the framework of the investment theory New Institutional Theory by Trevino et al. This theory describes that in order to attract investments {{there is a need for}} regulative, cognitive and normative aspects in a country to function, these we examine. We find that states through clear and enforced legislation and having a stable functional state apparatus, as well through providing tax benefits and subsidies (or removing subsidies from agriculture) can help to attract investments in planted forests, this is related to the regulative aspect. Additionally, states can develop the cognitive and normative aspects by engagement with businesses, other governments, international institutions, environmental organization and local communities, in multi-stakeholder involvement and certification. This can also help to attract investments in planted forests. We introduce the concept of eco-effectiveness described by McDonough and Braungart in the book “Cradle to Cradle” since we see it as a way to overcome the duality of a nature versus man debate by combining the interests of nature and man. We use the concept to discuss whether planted forests are eco-effective in order to put a broader perspective on the matter. We establish that since planted forests provide financial benefits to man – which IWC is a good example of – and to some extent relieve pressure on <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> planted forests are eco-effective, at least more than the alternative of agriculture. Certification is found to be problematic in the sense that on one hand it can, by forbidding conversion of <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> to planted <b>forests,</b> conserve <b>natural</b> <b>forests,</b> on the other hand this legislation can lead to that <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> are instead converted to agriculture which is considered less optimal in relation to biodiversity. The report concludes that planted forests can through supplying wood, by providing some of the biological benefits of forests as well as by being an interesting investment, relieve pressure on <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> and under the circumstances of stable states providing clear property rights, and encouraging tax and subsidy conditions, as well as through good involvement of stakeholders and certification, can planted forest area be expanded...|$|R

In this study, we conducted a long-term and large-scale analysis of the effectiveness of 20 of the earliest nature reserves established in Hainan Province, an island home to among the highest concentration of plants and animals in China. Remote sensing imagery from 1988, 1998, and 2008 were analyzed to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> in these nature reserves and surrounding areas.
