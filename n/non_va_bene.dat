5000|$|Italy {{has always}} had a {{distinctive}} dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as city-states. Those dialects now have considerable variety. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of Regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between Roman Italian and Milanese Italian are the gemination of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed [...] "e", and of [...] "s" [...] in some cases: e.g. <b>va</b> <b>bene</b> [...] "all right": is pronounced [...] by a Roman (and by any standard-speaker), [...] by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies {{to the north of the}} La Spezia-Rimini Line); a casa [...] "at home" [...] is [...] for Roman and standard, [...] for Milanese and generally northern.|$|R

5000|$|Following the Italian {{annexation}} of Albania in April, relations between Italy and Greece deteriorated rapidly. The Greeks began making defensive preparations for an Italian attack, while the Italians began improving infrastructure in Albania to facilitate troop movements. Tensions mounted {{as a result}} of a continued anti-Greek campaign in the Italian press, combined with provocative Italian actions. Thus during Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano's visit to Albania, posters supporting Albanian irredentism in Chameria were publicly displayed; the governor of the Italian Dodecanese, Cesare Maria De Vecchi, closed the remaining Greek communal schools in the province, and Italian troops were heard singing [...] "Andremo nell'Egeo, prenderemo pure il Pireo. E, se tutto <b>va</b> <b>bene,</b> prenderemo anche Aténe." [...] (We go to the Aegean, and will take even Piraeus. And if all goes well, we will take Athens too."). Four of the five Italian divisions in Albania moved towards the Greek border, and on 16 August the Italian Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Pietro Badoglio, received orders to begin planning for an attack on Greece. On 4 August, Metaxas had ordered Greek forces to a state of readiness and a partial mobilization.|$|R

6000|$|Antonino did {{his best}} to {{entertain}} us, and lectured us unceasingly upon his virtue and his wisdom, dwelling greatly on the propriety and good policy of always speaking the truth. This spectacle of veracity became intolerable after a while, and I was goaded to say: [...] "Oh then, if you never tell lies, you expect to go to Paradise." [...] "Not at all," [...] answered Antonino compassionately, [...] "for I have sinned much. But the lie doesn't go ahead" [...] (<b>non</b> <b>va</b> avanti), added this Machiavelli of boatmen; yet I think he was mistaken, for he deceived us with perfect ease and admirable success. All along, he had pretended that we could see Capri, visit the Blue Grotto, and return that day; but as we drew near the island, painful doubts began to trouble him, and he feared the sea would be too rough for the Grotto part of the affair. [...] "But there will be an old man," [...] he said, with a subtile air of prophecy, [...] "waiting for us on the beach. This old man is one of the Government guides to the Grotto, and he will say whether it is to be seen to-day." ...|$|R
