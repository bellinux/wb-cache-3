The shoot tips of the heat-treated plants were grafted onto seedling rootstocks and were re-tested for the four viruses by RT-PCR during {{the next three to five}} vegetation seasons. Several plants of apple cultivars ‘Dace’, ‘Zarja Alatau’, ‘Rubin’, and ‘Ausma’ remained infected either with Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, Apple stem growing virus or Apple stem pitting virus after the thermotherapy.

In Finland, cryopreservation has been studied since 1990 s, beginning with cryopreservation of forest tree breeding material and since 2004 on cryopreservation of genetic resources of horticultural plants and potato. Priority was given to cryopreservation of raspberry (Rubus ideaus L.), strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and the possibility to use cryotherapy in eradication of raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) from in vitro cultures were studied on raspberry. Modified droplet vitrification cryopreservation protocols were designed for raspberry and strawberry and cryotherapy combined with thermotherapy was {{proven to be a}} successful application to eliminate RBDV from infected raspberries. Cryotherapy method can be applied for a large scale elimination of viruses from plant germplasm and from candidate <b>nuclear</b> <b>stock</b> in a certified plant production scheme.

40|$|In {{tree fruit}} nursery besides the {{improvement}} of propagation technology, introduction of micro-propagation, large {{progress has been made}} by using healthy, virus free <b>nuclear</b> <b>stock,</b> as well as by improved tree quality. Modern intensive orchards require well branched trees, which are able turn to bearing early. Tree quality improvement can be achieved by new raising technologies, practices and application of bio-regulators. Considering the large number of new rootstocks and candidates a huge progress has been made, but the rootstock usage hardly changed. At apple, predominant rootstock is the M. 9 and in the dwarf vigour group the ideal rootstock (e. g. easily propagated, dwarf, precocious, resistant to fire blight, scab, collar rot and woolly aphid) is still missing, albeit some promising new rootstocks are in introduction. For pear several dwarf Pyrus series are in testing stage, but by now none of them resulted in a breakthrough in pear rootstockusage. Rootstock research for stone fruits over the last decade has been focused more on rootstock evaluation than on breeding of new rootstocks. There are only few new breeding projects and new rootstocks successfully introduced but a large number of rootstocks is in the evaluation stage. However, the knowledge on rootstock/scion interactions, mechanism of rootstock effect on growth and crop development is not enough and the progress in this field is also not satisfying. The rootstock breeding activity achieved a complete scale of growth vigour for cherry, and more or less for plum, apricot and peach, which was the dream of growers from 30 - 40 years ago. Though the usage of dwarfing rootstock is spreading, there is still little knowledge and only few research projects on growth control mechanism in cherry rootstock/scion composite trees. The interactions between rootstock vigour, precocity, fruiting wood development, renewal capacity and crop load are more specific, but essential for an appropriate rootstock selection. The vigour of site, orchard system, training and pruning also should be matched with the selected scion/rootstock combination performing sometimes very individually. The rootstock role related to these factors has also been investigated; the results may help now to understand the complex problem of rootstock selection for intensive orchards...|$|E

Although much {{attention has been}} paid {{in the past few years}} to the development of diagnostic tools for reliable virus identification, the need to define a common and standardized diagnostic protocol led to the implementation of a ring test among nine Italian diagnostic laboratories. A one-step RT-PCR protocol and different primer sets, targeting the most common olive viruses covered by phytosanitary rules, were tested in each laboratory, using the same batch of positive and healthy controls as well as the same amplification conditions and reaction components. The one-step RT-PCR, performed using several specific primer sets, was able efficiently to detect the target viruses in all laboratories. Furthermore, a one-step RT-PCR protocol was used successfully for the first time for detection of Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) and Olive mild mosaic virus (OMMV).

The following activities are in progress: (i) selection of individual trees in pre-selected groves; (ii) assessment of the sanitary status of field-selected accessions by laboratory tests; (iii) identification of AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) and SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats) markers suitable for the molecular characterization of selected genotypes; (iv) setting up efficient protocols for virus elimination; (v) obtention of "primary sources" (<b>nuclear</b> <b>stocks)</b> liable to enter certification programs. Due to the widespread occurrence of latent virus infections, visual inspections are unreliable, thus field observations need to be complemented by laboratory tests. Doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) analysis, RT-PCR, and molecular hybridisation were successfully used to test {{a large number of}} samples collected in commercial orchards. In order to characterize genotypes and establish their genetic relationships, olive accessions were screened with three AFLP primer combinations and twenty-seven SSR primer pairs. A comparison was done between AFLP and SSR marker variability, their efficiency and usefulness for establishing genetic relationships and cultivar identification. The data obtained were worked out with the Jaccard genetic similarity coefficient, applying the SAHN clustering method. The resulting dendrograms showed that all genotypes could be unequivocally distinguished. Because the sanitary status of very few of the selected plants conformed to legislative health requirements, most of the selected accessions underwent sanitation by in vitro meristem tip culture, in vivo and in vitro heat therapy, and rapid in vitro subculturing of shoots tips.

It is well {{established}} that unisexuality has a polyphyletic origin and that it may arise following dif- ferent mechanisms, whereby interspecific hybridization {{is the most common}} in animals. Calligrapha (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) includes six known tetraploid unisexual species hypothesized {{to be the result of}} independent interspecific hybridization events between two bisexual species, based on the observed incongruence between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies. However, as this type of incongruence can arise due to other evolutionary processes, this mechanism must be confirmed. If unisexuality in Calligrapha is related to hybrid origins, the expectation is that these species will exhibit high nuclear heterozygosity due to genomic coexistence of alleles from their respective divergent parental species. Moreover, these alleles will be phylogenetically divergent among them and closer to their respective original genetic stock. To assert this point, we have studied genetic diversity for two single-copy nuclear genes (HtS and Wg) via cloning in 15 individuals of four unisexual (C. apicalis, C. suturella, C. vicina and C. virginea) and 22 individuals of six bisexual species of Calligrapha. For each individual an average of 16 clones were sequenced. As expected, the highest nuclear heterozygosities were found in unisexual species and phylogenetic analyses showed these divergent alleles to be related to different bisexual spe- cies, unambiguously identified as the parental species. These results confirmed the original hypothesis about hybridization associated to the origins of unisexuality in Calligrapha, but they also contributed an unexpected twist to this hypothesis. In most cases, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>stocks</b> for these divergent alleles are dif- ferent from the one supplying with the mtDNA of every unisexual lineage, implying that at least three bisexual species were involved in the evolutionary path leading to C. suturella and C. virginea and possi- bly four in the case of C. apicalis (with three divergent sources of nuclear alleles, different from the donor of mtDNA). The origin of unisexuality in Calligrapha appears thus as a complex process where a series of successive hybridization events and involving different bisexual species may have taken place. N...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine whether investors perceive utilities with nuclear plants to be more risky than utilities with no nuclear facilities. Two basic analytical frameworks are used. One approach is to analyze investors' differential perception of the market-related systematic risk of <b>nuclear</b> utility <b>stocks</b> versus non-nuclear utility stocks. This is done by comparing the betas of nuclear versus non-nuclear utility stocks. The second approach is an econometric treatment of price to book value ratios, using cross-sectional data in the time period 1973 to 1987. For both approaches, the differences in the financial markets' perception of risk, related to the special events of TMI, Chernobyl and the WPPSS bond default; are analyzed. Based on the crosssectional analysis of P/BV ratios in recent years, we estimate the financial markets valued nuclear power utilities at approximately 20 % less than comparable non-nuclear utilities. We estimate that a 3 % increase in the allowed rate of return for nuclear utilities (from 13. 7 % to 16. 7 % in 1988) would have been necessary to fully offset the discount associated with nuclear power. ...|$|R

40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} {{discharged}} from nuclear power reactors has accumulated {{to a considerable}} amount in Japan and the other countries with <b>nuclear</b> power generation <b>stocks,</b> which will lead to risks of their overflow beyond the existing management capacities at those nuclear power plants. If such overflow happens, the power plant has {{to be shut down}} until appropriate measures have been taken. Meanwhile, uncertainties have accumulated surrounding final treatment facilities, either reprocessing or geological disposal, reflecting difficulties to find appropriate sites caused by oppositions of local and/or general public and other factors. As a result, spent nuclear fuel has to be stored for the time being in interim devices for a certain time period, e. g. 20 years to 40 - 50 years, until such time that they can be moved to their final destination. The objective of this dissertation is to review theoretical background and thoughts relevant to policy considerations on spent nuclear fuel management and storage ranging from their discharge to final treatment, to obtain quantitative images, and ultimately to present desirable policies and their implications in medium and long range in Japan. Essential key questions to be addressed here include the following, to which the dissertation presents first the theoretical framework to obtain answers and then answers at the moment while encompassing underlying uncertainties://・When and to what extent spent nuclear fuel storage will be required, and which type of technology options should be applied?//・How long should it be the appropriate storage duration? How does it connect to the overall nuclear fuel cycle program?//・Which should be chosen, AR (At Reactor) storage, AFR (Away From Reactor) storage or a combination of both?//・How will it cost?//・How will the price for storage services be determined?//After presenting these objectives and key questions in Chapter 1, the dissertation first discusses in Chapter 2 the present status of spent nuclear fuel management in Japan, which clarifies where the dissertation stands at this moment. As spent nuclear fuel accumulates at all the nuclear power plants in Japan, enhancement measures of the management capacity, such as re-racking, have already been implemented by now where available. Since opportunities for further enhancement are narrow and scarce, implementation of AFR storage is justifiably needed in an appropriate time range. In fact, relevant institutional developments, namely policy formulation, such as statements in the Long-term Program of Research, Development and Utilization of Nuclear Energy, as well as legislation, especially the amendment of the Law for Regulation of Nuclear Reactors, Nuclear Facilities and Nuclear Materials, have already been completed and implemented. This clearly justifies the needs for the policy analyses in this dissertation, such as strategic planning of storage projects and their economic assessments. Chapter 2 also deals with the historical evolutionary patterns of spent nuclear fuel storage technologies. Various types of storage technique have been developed and are now available. Recently, new dry storage techniques, which are characterized as a combination of metal canisters and concrete blocks including concrete cask storage and horizontal silo storage, are receiving higher shares in the market. The analysis of the historical patterns of worldwide market penetration of various techniques, however, has found no clear sign of retirement of any technology from the global market, while each technique has comfortably found its own "niche" with its own strength and special features to form cohabitation of all. This may reflects the very characteristics of spent nuclear fuel storage market with limited number of projects for long lifetimes. This observation at this moment, meanwhile, does not rule out possibilities of different patterns of market evolution to take place in the future, since the world market will expand whilst choices of techniques will be put more on invisible hands of market economy. Chapter 3 presents the energy and nuclear fuel cycle modeling frameworks, with which the author attempts to describe optimal patterns of nuclear fuel cycle management in harmony with nuclear energy utilization pathways. Chapter 3 starts with the development of Fuel Cycle Optimization Model (FCOM) and extends to its integration with the LDNE 21 global energy model, in order to analyze spent nuclear fuel management in an overall framework of nuclear fuel cycle and the global energy system. FCOM solves a long range (90 years) cost minimization problem of the LWR (light water reactor) - FBR (fast breeder reactor) symbiotic system based on linear programming. The optimal solution provides a desirable evolutionary pattern of plutonium (Pu) economy with Pu supply from reprocessing of spent LWR fuel as its key parameter. FCOM's superb feature is, despite a compact model, to obtain an optimal solution of management of spent LWR fuel integrated with reactor mix patterns. Through numerical experiments, it is concluded that spent LWR fuel storage is chosen to adjust future uncertainty as it gives flexibility to the whole nuclear fuel cycle to allow spent LWR fuel reprocessing according to Pu demand. The illustrative simulation runs showed that, while reprocessing of spent LWR fuel is undertaken in accordance with Pu demands, storage of spent LWR fuel provides the adjustment function between Pu supply and demand. This means that storage of spent nuclear fuel should be chosen actively as a measure to cope with uncertainty towards future as it gives flexibility to the management and operation of the whole nuclear fuel cycle. Chapter 3 further extends to the integration of FCOM with the long-range global energy model LDNE 21 (Linearlized Dynamic New Earth 21). In this application, FCOM serves as a nuclear energy sub-model within the LDNE 21 framework, which analyzes optimal global energy pathways in terms of minimum discounted total system costs up to the year 2100 under a certain set of global environmental and other constraints. The illustrative simulation runs showed that, under a constraint of atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) to be kept below 550 ppm in the year 2100, the optimal global energy strategy will be chosen under competition between nuclear power generation and combined cycle generation by coal. This underscores the importance of nuclear fuel cycle and spent nuclear fuel management modeled in FCOM against global energy pictures. Meanwhile, necessity of global shift towards Pu economy does not necessarily maintain. Chaster 4 presents a theoretical analysis of optimal choice of storage duration. In this analysis, the fundamental roles and benefits of storage are understood as twofold; 1) postponement of subsequent processes, which leads to a decrease of present value of those costs, and 2) gains through R&D by earning time with storage. As the result, there could appear an optimal storage duration, which equalizes the following two indices; a) the incremental storage cost for 1 more year, in other words the marginal cost, and b) the increase of the sum of above mentioned benefits, or the marginal utility, through 1 year extension of storage. In the case of uncertainty, this optimal storage duration is prolonged accordingly through a risk-averse attitude. These findings stand also in the case of direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel. This analysis, however, omits certain factors such as specific lifetimes of storage containers and/or facilities, or societal anxieties, which may lead to additional costs when storage duration is prolonged. Chapter 5 deals with the methodologies of material balance calculation ranging discharge, storage, transportation and final processing of spent nuclear fuel. They are categorized into the following two kinds; 1) a microscopic accounting for each power station site or each power utility company, and 2) a macroscopic analysis, either simulation or optimization, in a region-wide or nationwide scale. In Chapter 5, development of a Japan-wide simulation tool SFTRACE (Spent Fuel Storage, TRAnsportation and Cost Evaluation System) is discussed. SFTRACE is mainly based on the 2 nd methodology while taking the 1 st microscopic accounting aspect fully into account. The illustrative simulation runs revealed various trade-off relations, such as the one between storage capacity to be installed and transportation requirements, the other among geographic coverage of AFR storage facilities as to whether to construct one to serve all over Japan or several to serve segmented regions. These trade-offs clearly demonstrate the necessity and usefulness of integrated analytic tools such as SFTRACE. Chapter 6 discusses the framework of economic analyses of spent nuclear fuel storage. Based on the methodological review of the following three categories, numerical applications are presented for each of them; 1) an engineering-economic cost calculation to assess levelized unit costs, 2) a total cost assessment with strategic planning, and 3) a project financing appraisal and storage price induction. Based on latest sets of data and information, the levelized unit storage costs lay in a reasonable range of 30 - 70 kJPY/kgU, which corresponds to 0. 07 - 0. 17 JPY/kWh at burnup of 49, 000 MWd/tU with no discounting applied between power generation and storage. With the strategic planning application, several key parameters are identified such as the geographic coverage of AFR centralized storage devices, economy of scale and others. Finally, the project financing appraisal method is applied to explore viable storage pricing schemes which maintain the project of 5, 000 MTU metal cask storage facility as healthy enough against financial criteria. Because of the highly investment intensive nature of the project, a combinatory pricing scheme of storage service is highly recommended with an initial payment upon receipt of spent nuclear fuel at the storage facility and annual fee payments per unit of spent nuclear fuel stored for each year of storage duration. As the conclusion of the analyses described in these Chapters, policy recommendations are presented in Chapter 7 for planning and implementation of spent nuclear fuel management in Japan. The demand of spent nuclear fuel storage will increase steadily and rapidly, to reach 7, 000 - 10, 000 MTU by the year 2020 to 2030. In 2050, uncertainties surrounding spent nuclear fuel management will also accumulate. In a most likely scenario, the storage demand will level off at around 10, 000 MTU after 2020 - 30 to 2050, which suggests storage capacity of 10, 000 MTU must be installed by the year 2020. As concerns to the storage duration as well as the long-term planning of spent nuclear fuel management, unless utility values of Pu uses will improve significantly, processes after storage should be planned with reference of lifetime expiration of the storage facility. 報告番号: 乙 15624; 学位授与年月日: 2003 - 03 - 12; 学位の種別: 論文博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 第 15624 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科システム量子工学専...|$|R
