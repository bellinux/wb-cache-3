40|$|Abstract Kathleen Lohff Unwinding the Watchmaker's Clock Conflict of Epistemologies in Geology (1786 - 1840). Master's Thesis [...] UMBC Spring 2009. Geology {{developed}} as a science around the central theme of creating an earth-history. Regarding the natural world as having a history apart from human observation was a new concept. Reconstruction of the earth's past produced divergence of opinion and theory. Disagreement about geological ideas arose from competing geological styles and methodologies. Theology intersected with these discussions; it did not {{form the basis of}} the conflict. This thesis challenges the traditional view that late eighteenth and early nineteenth century geological controversies were rooted in theological conflict. By giving greater emphasis to the cognitive dimension of the debates, the aim of this thesis is to reposition the conflicts as epistemological. By eliminating the evolutionary presupposition that history of science has imposed on the history of geology, the desire of geologists to establish principles for geology becomes more focused. The principles of knowledge and reason that the geologists were attempting to establish, largely by connecting them to Newtonian scientific methods, spurred <b>new</b> <b>epistemologies</b> for geological science. The result of these <b>new</b> <b>epistemologies</b> was the division of geological aims into historical and causal. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate how these two divergent approaches to the study of geology led to new ways of thinking about the earth and eventually erupted into conflict during the early nineteenth-century...|$|R

5000|$|Romanticism was {{inspired}} by Kant's critical approach {{to the problem of}} knowledge, but rejected his limits to that knowledge, seeing it as confining the science of vital nature to the materialist approach, making life an epiphenomenon of [...] "the chance whirlings of unproductive particles" [...] as Coleridge put it succinctly. There was a profound feeling that a <b>new</b> <b>epistemology,</b> or 'science of knowledge' was needed to deal with the question of vital nature and the nature of life itself. Art, and in particular poetry, provided a vehicle to explore vital nature and to get to its essence, but for it to be scientific required an epistemological foundation. The central figure in the development of this epistemology was Samuel Taylor Coleridge (along with J.W. von Goethe in Germany); this was recognized in his time, after his time and even most recently.|$|E
50|$|In {{his article}} “Decolonizing the University: New Directions”, Achille Mbembe {{discusses}} the limits {{placed on the}} decolonization efforts {{by the forces of}} neoliberalism and its connection to decolonization. He states that the role of the university is to “encourage students to develop their own intellectual and moral lives” as well as “redistribute equally the capacity to make disciplined inquiries into things we need to know”. By creating a representative and affirming environment also gives way to the fostering of creativity and ingenuity on college campuses. This force of creativity can be sparked through dismantling market tied learning to allow for, what Mbembe refers to as, this “free pursuit of knowledge”. By dissociating knowledge with capitalistic pressures, there can be a greater focus of energy on developing <b>new</b> <b>epistemology</b> and ontology in a South African context. It also can allow for the understanding the value of knowledge in other ways. However, he notes that higher education has been severely marketized and commercialized. Here, he claims {{there is a need to}} decolonize the spaces of management and access so that students can actually pursue knowledge freely. Furthermore, Mbembe argues that this approach can counter student interest in material versus epistemological payoff. Mbembe discusses the term decolonization, and questions whether we need to dismantle historical systems and institutions or instead focus on systems that have mutated and changed over time.|$|E
