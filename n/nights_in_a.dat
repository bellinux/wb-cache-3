5|$|Ten <b>Nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bar Room is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from the novel Ten <b>Nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bar-Room and What I Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur, the production focuses on Joe Morgan after {{he has become a}} hopeless drunkard. Often Morgan's young daughter, Mary, comes to beg her father to return home. One day, she appears during a fight between the two men and is fatally struck by a bottle thrown by the saloon-keeper. Before Mary dies she asks her father to promise to swear off alcohol and he accepts. He is reformed and becomes successful, while the saloon-keeper is killed in a fight in an irony of fate. The film was released on November 4, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which {{decisions}} were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{development}} team spent five days and four <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place called the Capcom Manor {{to work on the}} game; this was inspired by the filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who would gather scriptwriters in a hotel room to create the scripts for his films. During their stay in the manor, they discussed the game's plot and the new gameplay system, finalized the direction, and created rough sketches for most characters in the game. For the new character Hakari Mikagami, Iwamoto used a female saint as the main image for her design, and imagined her as being an older woman he could look up to. Another new character, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi, was Eshiro's favorite minor character in the series because of his character arc and how he grows throughout the game. The game was developed for the Ace Attorney series' tenth anniversary; because of this, several characters from previous games in the series made cameo appearances, including Frank Sahwit and Will Powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{was based on}} Ten <b>Nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bar-Room and What I Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur. The plot focused {{on the dangers of}} alcoholism and the downfall of those taken in by its effects. In the 1850s, sales of the novel were second only to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. The {{production was}} adapted for the stage in 1858 and while it did not perform well on Broadway, it proved to be a lasting success. Dozens of productions would cross the United States for the next sixty years and the play proved to be a major influence on the Temperance movement, resulting in the passage of temperance laws. It is likely that the writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Only the roles of Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline are known. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1940, while the Battle of Britain raged over the skies of Southern England by day, there were also night raids on {{industrial}} cities.

The last concert part of the Into the Fire tour was played in Locarno, Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|The {{weather was}} not in itself a {{hardship}} for those accustomed to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in good years, the cooler climate did not quite support agriculture. In May 1816, frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as upstate New York. On June 6, snow fell in Albany, New York, and Dennysville, Maine. In Cape May, New Jersey, frost was reported five <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row in late June, causing extensive crop damage.|$|E

He also appeared in guest-starring roles on several television sitcoms including Gimme a Break! and Punky Brewster. Following an extensive tour of East Asia, he regularly performed shows in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe. In 1984, he was the headline performer at the Vi√±a del Mar Festival in Chile, performing two <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row. He also held a two-week engagement at San Francisco's historic Fairmont Hotel in March 1986.|$|E

Victoria held its 5‚Äì3 lead {{for the rest of}} the game through the pitching of Russell Spear and finals MVP Matthew Blackmore. In game two, South Australia led for much of the game, but a costly error by Ben Wigmore in the sixth inning, hits from Andrew Russell, Paul Weichard, James Beresford and Matthew Lawman in the ninth, and a run-free pitching performance from Ross Hipke and Russell Spear in the final three innings allowed Victoria to come from behind two <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row to win 7‚Äì4, and claim the states' 22nd Claxton Shield title.|$|E

25|$|Kawabata {{apparently}} {{committed suicide}} in 1972 by gassing himself, {{but a number of}} close associates, including his widow, consider his death to have been accidental. One thesis, as advanced by Donald Richie, was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath. Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself, among them poor health (the discovery that he had Parkinson's disease), a possible illicit love affair, or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970. Unlike Mishima, Kawabata left no note, and since (again unlike Mishima) he had not discussed significantly in his writings the topic of taking his own life, his motives remain unclear. However, his Japanese biographer, Takeo Okuno, has related how he had nightmares about Mishima for two or three hundred <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row, and was incessantly haunted by the specter of Mishima. In a persistently depressed state of mind, he would tell friends during his last years that sometimes, when on a journey, he hoped his plane would crash.|$|E

500|$|The New York Dramatic Mirror review {{contained}} {{specific details}} about the costumes {{and the production of}} the film, allowing for a view into the lost film. Apparently, Frank H.

The French gentleman sported a [...] "Prince Albert", referring to the double-breasted Frock coat, and a silk hat. This contrast in gown was unusual, and the other characters wore colonial clothing. The scene containing the tempest which shipwrecks Virginia was described as being ineffective, but reviews in the Mirror were known to be strongly slanted towards Edison Trust companies. This included acting as a spoiler for Ten <b>Nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bar Room to bolster another Licensed company.|$|E
