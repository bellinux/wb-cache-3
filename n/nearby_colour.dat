The problem of colour quantization is one of long standing with, for example, a GIF file consisting of single-byte grey values (appropriately compressed using entropy coding) plus a 256 × 3 colour lookup table in the file header. That lookup table can be generated in various ways (e. g., the standard median-cut algorithm). Here we take the viewpoint that we can generate greyscale values from an input, coder-side, colour image by traversing colour values in a particular order. In forming a grey value, we seek to replace an entire colour plane, orthogonal to the L ∗ in CIELAB colour space, by its grey value, and then reconstitute colour by visiting the byte-value L ∗ greylevels using a path in 3 dimensions such that the order of colour forms a parametric curve from grey plane to grey plane that traverses a rich sampling of colour space while optimally encompassing the gamut of the input image. In that way, we merely have to transmit the parameters for the curve itself along with the grey values in order to recover an approximation of colour. In particular, here we use a curve such {{that we need to}} transmit an additional 13 values only. Moreover we can use n-bit grey values with n < 8 for colour-reduced transmission to mobile devices. We find that we do better than the standard GIF file method in terms of CIELAB error for grey and comparably in recovered colour error, and with much less information transmitted. The method rests on an optimization is which grey is selected from <b>nearby</b> <b>colour</b> planes such that the overall grey error is minimized whilst also minimizing the colour error. 1...|$|E
30|$|Changes on land use/cover, {{vegetation}} {{covers and}} soil loss rate {{were used as}} main parameters to assess the effectiveness of land resource management measures practiced in the study area. In addition, the income {{of the population was}} considered. Landsat satellite image ([URL] [URL] was chosen for mapping the land use/cover of the study area. An input data for soil loss rate estimation was collected from the field (e.g., soil <b>colour),</b> <b>nearby</b> meteorological station, and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) because it has the same resolution with the Landsat image and freely available ([URL] Socio-economic data were collected through face-to-face interview and key informants using a carefully designed questionnaire. All 121 household heads were physically surveyed in the study area.|$|R

Using the theoretical frame of environmental justice, this paper discusses findings of {{a recent survey of}} visitors to Los Angeles' Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area - the United States' largest urban national park. Findings show park visitors were predominantly white, affluent, and lived <b>nearby.</b> People of <b>colour</b> travelled further, were significantly less likely to be return visitors, and were less inclined to use the park for active recreation. Seemingly, this park fails {{to meet the needs of}} the disadvantaged urban communities for whom it was created, a problem that may also affect other parks in the United States and potentially parks in other countries. Park planners and managers can take practical steps to increase accessibility to this park for people of colour and low-income earners, and should monitor other parks for patterns of ethno-racially differentiated access and utilisation.

25|$|Cattle Island {{exists in}} one of the extreme points of Hirakud Reservoir, a natural wonder. It is near Kumarbandh village of Belpahar-Banharpali range which is about 90km from Sambalpur. The island is a {{submerged}} hill, and before the construction of Hirakud Dam it was a developed village. During the resettlement period, villagers left some of their cattle behind; when the dam construction was over, the cattle settled on the hilltop. With the passage of time the nearby area filled up with the reservoir water, turning the hilltop into an island. Being away from mankind, the cattle are now wild, very swift and not easily caught. Living on a hilltop with dense forest, they are larger than tame cattle, almost all of which are white in <b>colour.</b> <b>Nearby</b> residents attempt to capture these animals from time to time, but these hunts are rarely successful. Though descended from tame cattle, these animals provide a contrasting picture of this breed of animal returning to life in the wild. If the visit to this island is taken by a boat in the Hirakud reservoir it's an adventurous trip with breathtaking views.|$|R
