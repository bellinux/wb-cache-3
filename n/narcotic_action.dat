30|$|One {{approach}} {{to solve the}} problems was suggested by an industry working group in the course of project work for the new EU chemical legislation REACH. The so-called 'poorly solubles approach' [2] {{is based on the assumption}} that highly lipophilic and poorly soluble substances have a low concentration in the aqueous phase of waterbodies resulting in a low exposure to aquatic organisms. Subsequent to an extensive analysis of ecotoxicological data, De Wolf et al. [3] proposed a concentration threshold in the aqueous phase, the aquatic exposure threshold of no ecotoxicological concern (ETNCaqu), for inert substances with a <b>narcotic</b> mode of <b>action.</b> For the examined substances with a <b>narcotic</b> mode of <b>action</b> [4, 5] it is suggested with a high probability (95 percentile), that neither acute nor long-term adverse effects to aquatic organisms might be expected below this threshold concentration. For inert substances with a <b>narcotic</b> mode of <b>action</b> (baseline toxicity) this threshold was estimated as ETNCaqu = 1.9 μg/l. Inert chemicals are not reactive when considering overall acute effects and do not interact with specific receptors in an organism and have therefore a <b>narcotic</b> mode of <b>action</b> [5].|$|R

40|$|Studies of the growth-modifying {{actions for}} Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Tetrahymena thermophila of helium, nitrogen, argon, krypton, xenon, and nitrous oxide {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that there are two definable classes of gases. Class 1 gases, including He, N 2, and Ar, are not growth inhibitors; in fact, they can reverse the growth inhibitory action of hydrostatic pressures. Class 2 gases, including Kr, Xe, and N 2 O, are potent growth inhibitors at low pressures. For example, at 24 °C, 50 % growth-inhibitory pressures of N 2 O were found to be ca. 1. 7 MPa for E. coli, 1. 0 MPa for S. cerevisiae, and 0. 5 MPa for T. thermophila. Class 1 gases could act as potentiators for growth inhibition by N 2 O, O 2, Kr, or Xe. Hydrostatic pressure alone is known to reverse N 2 O inhibition of growth, but we found that it did not greatly alter oxygen toxicity. Therefore, potentiation by class 1 gases appeared to be a gas effect rather than a pressure effect. The temperature profile for growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae by N 2 O revealed an optimal temperature for cell resistance of ca. 24 °C, with lower resistance at higher and lower temperatures. Overall, it appeared that microbial growth modification by hyperbaric gases could not be related to their <b>narcotic</b> <b>actions</b> but reflected definably different physiological actions...|$|R

At the same time promethazine may prove to be a useful drug in certain other situations where too rapid inactivation of the principal drug presents a therapeutic problem.

In two of the systems investigated alcohols beyond octanol failed to show any activity (cut-off phenomenon).

3000|$|... 'Personal Care Products' {{contain a}} {{multitude}} of substances which introduce certain functions to the product and show a great variability in physicochemical properties. 'Poorly soluble substances', characterised by a low water solubility (< 1 mg/l), may constitute a substantial proportion of these products. Their production volume causes the need for aquatic risk assessment, as requested e.g. by the European Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. As {{it is difficult to}} conduct toxicity tests at the threshold of the substance's water solubility a high lipophilicity complicates the performance of standardised ecotoxicological tests. For these substances, standard tests mostly provide insufficient results and are often not suitable to assess the risk appropriately. One promising approach to address this problem is the 'poorly solubles approach'. It assumes that highly lipophilic and poorly soluble substances have a low water concentration and consequently might cause low exposure to aquatic organisms. However, as these substances may bioaccumulate high internal exposure might be reached leading to long-term effects. The poorly solubles approach defines an 'ecotoxicological threshold of no concern'. According to the theory, below this concentration, neither acute nor long-term adverse effects on aquatic organisms are expected to occur. This threshold is derived from a comprehensive compilation of experimental data for inert substances with a <b>narcotic</b> mode of <b>action</b> and therefore currently restricted to such substances. Hence, considering this threshold concentration combined with the water solubility of a substance, derived by, e.g. quantitative structure-activity relationships methods, may allow a risk assessment without the need of further experiments. The 'poorly solubles approach' may also become relevant regarding the verification of potential persistent + bioaccumulative + toxic properties. The aim of the project ECOtoxicity investigations of COSMetic ingredients is to develop the 'poorly solubles approach' into a pragmatic tool for risk assessment of the important and environmentally relevant group of highly lipophilic substances with a <b>narcotic</b> mode of <b>action.</b> This project will adapt existing aquatic ecotoxicological test methods using lipophilic compounds to check whether the 'poorly solubles approach' may be useful for risk assessment of such substances.|$|R

Microbiological investigations comprised of functional (enzymatic activities) and structural (genetic diversity) investigations of effects on microbial communities of ground- and surface water samples. Concerning the metazoan community, the sensitivities of groundwater organisms to three pesticides were investigated and {{compared with those of}} taxonomic relatives from surface waters in long-term toxicity tests. The organisms were selected reflecting taxonomic representativity and taken from groundwater bodies in the Ruhr and Main valleys. They were held and tested at about 10 deg C in the dark. The following pesticides were selected: the fungicide Cyprodinil inhibiting anabolism, the neurotoxic insecticide, lambda-Cyhalothrin, and the herbicide Bromoxynil-Octanoat which is mainly cytotoxic due to the unpolar <b>narcotic</b> <b>action</b> of the Octanoat. The actiye ingredients were tested using commercially available single a. i. formulations, the concentrations were analytically controlled. The effects of the active ingredients were not measured to be more pronounced in microbial groundwater commünities compared to the surface water coffimunities. Additionally, the effects were retarded due to lower temperatures. Potential structural changes could not (yet) be observed by the methods used. Anabolic inhibition effects in groundwater organisms seem to be retarded by Cyprodinil 5 - 10 times compared to surface water species. The mainly acute effect of lambda-Cyhalothdn ist due to the nerve structure and activity, affecting lower crustaceans of ground- and surface waters in a similar way. Higher crustaceans in general exhibit more sensitive nerve structure and - in surface water - higher activity. Thus, groundwater higher crustaceans seem to be less sensitive. Syncarida, however, are highly adapted to the constant groundwater conditions and less flexible towards additional stress compared to Niphergus fontanus, resulting in retarded, but similar sensitivity as surface water higher crustaceans. The narcotic effects of Bromoxynil-Octanoat seem to be similar in ground- and surface water organisms after comparable exposure durations, irrespectively of the way of living. The sensitivity distribution of lethal toxicity to groundwater species can be represented by taxonomically and physiologically comparable species of surface waters. No hints to a physiologically higher sensitivity of groundwater organisms could be observed. Risk assessment based on standard organisms at the actual state of knowledge seerns to be sufficiently protective also for groundwater communities. lf there are concems about potential effects to higher crustaceans, a representative species (e,. g.

Even if it were doable to analyse most chemicals, {{it would be impossible to}} interpret such information in terms of toxic stress because toxicity data are available for only a limited number of environmental pollutants. In environmental policy a need was expressed to develop an instrument to monitor toxic stress in ecosystems. There is a need to keep track of the efficacy of environmental measures as well as for weighting toxic stress in association with respect to other environmental stressors, such as acidification and eutrophication ("how serious is the problem of toxic substances for the environment?"). A method was developed to 1.) extract and concentrate the unknown cocktail of toxic substances from a sample of surface water, 2.) to determine the acute toxicity of concentrated water samples using a test battery of miniaturised in vivo-bioassays ("toxkits") and 3.) to compute, from the observed interspecies variation of acute toxicity in the toxkits, impacts at a higher ecological level, i. e. toxic stress in terms of the potentially affected fraction of species (PAF) that occur in the field. The concentration technique was optimised by means of different test mixtures, consisting of chemicals with a non-specific (<b>narcotic)</b> mode of <b>action,</b> pesticides and surfactants. Toxkits were employed to test these mixtures. The test battery consisted of Daphnia IQ, PAM (an algae test), Microtox and Thamnotox F. The test mixtures were made of more than 30 chemicals with varying physico-chemical and toxic properties. The recovery of the finally adopted concentration technique was higher than 60 % and should be considered as the maximum achievable, because the solid phase extraction on which it relies is specific with respect to physico-chemical properties of chemicals. For metals an alternative technique was developed, based on multi-element analyses of a water sample in combination with ecotoxicity data of 16 metals.

40|$|A lectina da alga marinha vermelha Amansia multifida, foi investigada com respeito Ã sua especificidade e afinidade por estruturas de carboidratos complexos. A cinÃtica da interaÃÃo em tempo real da lectina solÃvel com vÃrias glicoproteÃnas imobilizadas, e a inibiÃÃo destas interaÃÃes por oligomanosÃdeos, foram analisadas atravÃs da tecnologia de ressonÃncia plasmÃnica de superfÃcie. A lectina exibiu uma certa preferÃncia pelo monossacarÃdeo manose e a sua interaÃÃo por di-tri e pentamanosÃdeos foi mais expressiva. A lectina de A. multifida interagiu com glicopeptÃdeos Man 5 a Man 8 â asparagina, e a alta afinidade da lectina pelas referidas estruturas, foi evidenciada quando da anÃlise da interaÃÃo com glicoproteÃnas tais como: lactotransferrina bovina e {{ribonuclease}} b. De acordo com os resultados obtidos com a coluna de Sepharose 6 B com lectina de A. multifida imobilizada, o baixo reconhecimento sobre a aglutinina de soja, confirma o nÃo reconhecimento sobre a estrutura Man 9, e descarta a capacidade de associaÃÃo da lectina com uma estrutura que exiba trÃs resÃduos de manose ligados em &# 61537;- 1, 2 na extremidade do glicano. Estudos farmacolÃgicos envolvendo a lectina de A. multifida complementaram este trabalho, quando foram testadas as atividades analgÃsica e antiinflamatÃria em camundongos. Os resultados indicaram que essa proteÃna produziu um efeito analgÃsico nos trÃs tipos de modelo de dor utilizados. Nos testes das contorÃÃes abdominais e de formalina, um efeito dose dependente foi evidenciado. A administraÃÃo por via intraperitoneal e por via oral, apresentou resultados que mostraram ser a primeira via de tratamento a mais efetiva. Com o objetivo de comparar a aÃÃo analgÃsica da lectina de A. multifida com um narcÃtico analgÃsico de aÃÃo central, morfina, foi realizado o teste da placa quente utilizando um tratamento prÃvio com naloxona, um antagonista opiÃide. A lectina de A. multifida, mostrou reduÃÃo no seu efeito antinociceptivo na presenÃa de naloxona, sugerindo portanto, que sua atividade envolve a ativaÃÃo de receptores opiÃides Ã semelhanÃa da morfina. Um efeito antinociceptivo a nÃvel central, tambÃm foi observado quando a lectina aumentou a duraÃÃo do tempo de sono induzido por barbitÃrico. A aÃÃo antiinflamatÃria da lectina de A. multifida foi comprovada no teste de edema de pata utilizando carragenina e dextrano. A participaÃÃo de lectina nos efeitos analgÃsicos observados, foi avaliada com utilizaÃÃo prÃvia de D-manose e avidina, das quais D-manose suprimiu a nocicepÃÃo satisfatoriamente. A lectina de A. multifida mostrou possuir propriedades analgÃsicas de origem perifÃrica e central, sendo esses efeitos mais evidenciados na dor de origem inflamatÃria. This study {{aimed to}} investigate the specificity for simple sugars or glycoproteins of the lectin from the red seaweed Amansia multifida. The interaction kinetics in real time of the soluble lectin with several immobilized glycoproteins and the inhibition of these interactions by oligomanosides were analyzed through surface plasmon resonance technology. The lectin showed somehow preference to the monosaccharide mannose and its interaction with di-tri and pentamanosides was more expressive. The lectin of A. multifida interacted with glycopeptides Man 5 to Man 8 â asparagine, and the high affinity of the lectin for these structures was shown by analyzing the interaction with glycoproteins such as ribonuclease b and bovine lactotransferrin. The results obtained with Sepharose 6 B column containing immobilized A. multifida and the low recognition of soybean agglutinin corroborate the non-recognition of Man 9, and discard the capacity of association with a structure showing three residues of mannose linked in a- 1, 2 at the glycan extremity. The results of the pharmacological studies with three models of pain showed that A. multifida lectin caused analgesia. In the abdominal contorsion and formalin tests a dose-dependent effect was observed. The IP route was {{more effective than the}} oral route. In order to compare the analgesic action of A. multifida lectin with that of morfine, a <b>narcotic</b> with central <b>action,</b> the hot plate test was conducted after pre-treatment with the opioid antagonist naloxane. The antinociceptive effect of the lectin was reduced at the presence of naloxane, which suggests that its action involves activation of opioid receptors as occurs with morfine. An antinociceptive effect at central level was also observed when the lectin increased the duration of barbituric-induced sleep. The lectin showed anti-inflammatory action by the paw edema test with carrageenan and dextran. The involvement of the lectin in the observed antinociceptive effects was assessed by pre-treatment with D-mannose and avidin. The antinociceptive effect was suppressed by D-mannose. A. multifida lectin was shown to have antinociceptive properties of both central and peripheral origin, being these effects more evident for pain of inflammatory origi...|$|R

Dit rapport vormt de afronding van het project pT. pT verwijst naar de toxische potentie van oppervlaktewater door de aanwezigheid van lage concentraties van toxische stoffen, maar waarvan de aard en concentraties onbekend zijn. De veelheid van stoffen beperkt de informatie die conventionele chemische monitoring kan leveren. Ook al zou het mogelijk zijn om de meeste stoffen te meten, dan is het onmogelijk om deze informatie te vertalen naar zoiets als toxische stress, omdat van slechts een klein aantal stoffen de toxische eigenschappen bekend zijn. Het milieubeleid heeft behoefte aan een instrument waarmee monitoring van toxische stress in het ecosysteem mogelijk is, zowel om de effectiviteit van het stoffenbeleid te kunnen volgen als om een afweging te kunnen maken met andere stressfactoren, zoals verzuring en vermesting. De methode pT werd ontwikkeld waarmee 1.) de onbekende cocktail van organische toxische stoffen uit een monster van oppervlaktewater wordt geextraheerd, 2) de acute toxiciteit wordt bepaald van het aldus geconcentreerde watermonster m. b. v. een testbatterij van geminiaturiseerde in vivo-bioassays ("toxkits") en 3.) uit de waargenomen variatie in gevoeligheid van de toxkits de toxische stress in het lokale ecosysteem wordt afgeleid die indicatief is voor aantasting van de soortenrijkdom, PAF (potentieel aangetaste fractie). Aan de hand van verschillende testmengsels, bestaande uit stoffen met een a-specifieke (narcotiserende) werking, pesticiden en surfactanten, werd de concentratietechniek geoptimaliseerd. Deze mengsels met meer dan 30 verschillende verbindingen met uiteenlopende fysisch-chemische en toxische eigenschappen, werden gebruikt bij het uittesten van de in vivo-bioassays. De efficientie van de concentratietechniek van ca 60 % moet als het maximaal haalbare worden gezien vanwege het feit dat deze gebaseerd is op vaste fase extractie met onvermijdelijk specificiteit voor fysisch-chemische eigenschappen van stoffen. De testbatterij bestond uit Daphnia IQ, PAM (een algentest), Microtox en Thamnotox F. Omdat voor metalen deze methode ongeschikt is, werd daarvoor een andere procedure ontwikkeld. Deze is gebaseerd op multi-elementanalyse van watermonsters in combinatie met ecotoxiccteits data van 16 metalen. Gezamelijk onderzoek met het RIZA heeft aangetoond dat de totale toxische stress afneemt in volgorde van Schelde, Maas en Rijn. Met behulp van de pT methode, ook wel "msPAF(gemeten) " (multi substance PAF) genoemd, werd door toepassing op de verschillende testmengsels een eerste aanzet gegeven tot de validatie van het PAF concept voor mengsels van stoffen...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{hydrophobic}} chemicals with {{an extremely}} low aqueous solubility {{in the range}} of a few μg L- 1 are used in a broad range of applications ranging from industrial applications (lubricants, flame retardants, preservatives, etc.) to consumer products like cosmetics (also referred to as personal care products). Their use in “rinse off” products such as shower gels, shampoos, skin creams, hair conditioners, etc., lead to a release of substantial amounts into the aquatic environment via the wastewater pathway. Thus, studies on their environmental effects on aquatic organisms are strongly required, also in regards to the registration under REACH. However, data on potential aquatic toxicity of these highly hydrophobic substances are scarce and the application of ecotoxicological standard tests is by no means straightforward. Due to strong sorption to surfaces like test vessels and test organisms, but also potential degradation and volatilization, the establishment of constant exposure concentrations is difficult and most standard tests are not suitable. Moreover, the analytical quantification of these compounds in range of their low water solubility is technically challenging. One approach addressing this problem is the so-called "poorly solubles approach" proposed by Tolls et al. in 2009. It is intended to be an assessment tool for the environmental impact of poorly soluble substances. It is based upon a grand scale analysis of ecotoxicity data and identified a general threshold value for inert substances with a <b>narcotic</b> mode of <b>action</b> which defines the lower limit of potentially occurrence of any acute or chronic effect on aquatic organisms. Beside this specific approach, the so-called hydrophobicity cut-off in toxicity is often discussed. By this theory, the well-established correlation between increasing log Kow and increasing bioaccumulation (and toxicity) is limited to substances with log Kow values below 6. Above this log Kow, i. e., for highly hydrophobic substances, a cut-off in toxicity is reported, leading to a decreasing aquatic toxicity with increasing hydrophobicity. Multiple explanations for this phenomenon have been published but also strongly questioned by a range of recent studies. The aim of this thesis was (1) to develop and apply a suitable methodology for a reliable adaption of existing ecotoxicological standard tests to highly hydrophobic substances, (2) to develop suitable analytics for the detection of these substances in aqueous media at their solubility range in the lower μg L- 1 area, and (3) to evaluate the results in regards to the “poorly solubles approach” and hydrophobicity cut-off phenomena. Two hydrophobic model substances were selected: bromochlorophene (BCP), a preservative partially used in cosmetics with a log Kow of 6. 12, and dodecylbenzene (DDB), a surfactant precursor substance with a log Kow of 8. 65. A conventional silicone O-ring based passive dosing setup was adapted to test the toxicity of BCP at different concentrations for aquatic organisms of various trophic levels, i. e., algal growth inhibition, Daphnia magna immobilization, and Danio rerio fish-embryo toxicity. Effect concentrations derived by passive dosing were additionally compared with corresponding effect concentrations derived by standard co-solvent setups. At the same time, exposure concentrations (i. e., in the presence of exposed organisms) and freely dissolved concentrations (i. e., without organisms present) of BCP were measured and compared in all test media. The passive dosing format led to EC 50 -values in the lower μg L- 1 range for algae, daphnids, and fish embryos, whereas increased effect concentrations were measured in the co-solvent setups for algae and daphnids. An optimized passive dosing methodology was developed for ecotoxicity testing and solubility determination of highly hydrophobic liquids like DDB in various test systems exactly at its saturation limit, i. e., at maximum solubility. Silicone O-rings were saturated by direct immersion in pure liquid DDB, which resulted in considerable swelling of > 14 % (loading by swelling). In repeated tests, fast equilibration, improved exposure control and good precision of toxicity tests could be demonstrated. First, the solubility of DDB in different media was measured in two test setups based on silicone swelling and long-term direct addition, and was sufficiently determined in all media in the lower μg L- 1 range. Afterwards, the new passive dosing format was further developed to determine algae growth rate inhibition at DDB solubility. Here, a moderate toxicity level of 13 ± 5 % (95 % CI) in a first and 8 ± 3 % (95 % CI) in a repeated test was measured. Subsequent, more aquatic test systems with organisms of different trophic levels were adapted to the new method of passive dosing exactly at saturation. Both, prolonged acute Daphnia magna immobilization as well as Danio rerio fish embryo toxicity tests were conducted and further optimized. For daphnids testing, where the animals freely migrate through the undisturbed water phase, the development of a silicone O-ring enclosure cage was necessary to prevent direct contact of the organism to the dosing polymer. Whereas fish embryos did not show any toxic response within 96 h, Daphnia immobilization was repeatedly found comparatively high at 19. 3 % (mean) within 72 h in the optimized test system. Overall, the results demonstrate that passive dosing in general offers advantages over conventional aqueous toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances like BCP, but also that optimization work led to precise exposure control even at extremely low concentrations of highly hydrophobic liquids like DDB. The new passive dosing approach showed good precision and repeatability and the results offer a good basis for discussions on the reliability of reported hydrophobicity cut-offs in toxicity and the “poorly solubles approach”. A final evaluation of these phenomena based upon the results of just a few substances is still difficult. However, the occurrence of toxic responses at extremely low solubilities could be clearly shown and strongly argue against the universal applicability of toxicity thresholds...|$|R
40|$|Ectoparasites play a {{fundamental}} role in health problems among animals and humans. Sarcoptes scabiei mites (cause of itching and irritation in all individuals) among the ectoparasites {{are playing a}} major role in causing heavy economic losses in term of milk and meat in animals and Dermatophagoides mites are the sole parasitic cause of human asthma. The following five studies were conducted to investigate S. scabiei prevalence, zoonotic potential, effect on haematological parameters, in vitro study and in vivo uses in animals and humans and deterrence effect of Nepeta cataria volatiles. Study I- Prevalence of S. scabiei: In the present study 150 buffalo calves, 100 camels, 150 dogs, 150 goats, and 150 humans were examined clinically and microscopically at districts Dera Ismail khan, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Tank, Karak, Kohat and to their adjacent tribal belt. The prevalence of scabies infestation exhibited epidemic nature in winter season (November to February). During the epidemiological survey the average prevalence across the year recorded was 8. 72 % in humans, 18. 3 % in dogs, 14. 06 % in camels, 7. 3 % in buffalo calves and 5. 3 % in goats. Scabies caused by S. scabiei mite can affect any area of the skin, but the lesion found were often most severe on the abdomen, chest, legs, and ears and especially on the pubic regions of studied animals and peoples. Study II- Zoonotic potential: The transmittability nature of Sarcoptes scabiei mites affecting the animals were assessed in humans having contact with S. scabiei infested animals. Though the S. scabiei mites spend their entire life on their respective host, some mites do fall off into the environment due to animal scratching and survive for up to 3 weeks, becomes source of spreading. Taking in consideration the above study 300 families keeping scabies infested dogs, 150 camels drivers, 150 Dairy man and woman dealing with scabietic buffalo calves and 150 nomadic men keeping scabies infested goats were visited. After conducting the study the main zoonotic transmitters found were dogs and camels. The transmittability percentage recorded in dogs (23 %), camels (15 %), buffalo calves (2 %) and goats (2 %). For experimental transmittability syringing of 500 live S. scabiei var canis {{on the back of the}} healthy buffalo calves, 250 live S. scabiei var bubalis over the back of healthy goats, 400 live S. scabiei var cameli over the back of healthy dogs, 150 live S. scabiei var caprae over the back of healthy camels were carried out. S. scabiei var canis showed 10 % transmittability to buffalo calves, S. scabiei var bubalis showed 20 % transmittability to goats, S. scabiei var cameli showed 25 % transmittability to dogs and S. scabiei var caprae showed 15 % transmittability to camels. Study III- Haematological effects: During the present study different blood and biochemical parameters of ten healthy and ten scabies (three groups) suffering individuals from each animal group and human were investigated and their mean averages were assessed. In mites infested animals and humans, total erythrocyte counts (TEC), packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), were found significantly with lower averages (P < 0. 05), while total leucocytes count (TLC), lymphocytes, eosinophil and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were found with significantly higher averages in comparison to healthy individuals (P < 0. 05). Study IV- In Vitro and In Vivo study: Side wise presence of synthetic drug residues in plants and animals food products causing economic losses considered potentially hazardous to animal, human being and environment needs to assess the control methods whether biological or chemical in nature for its perfect use. Studies on the efficacy of some acaricides particularly derived from medicinal plants against S. scabiei mites in vivo and in vitro were carried out on experimental animals and were assessed in laboratory bioassays. For in vitro study 96 wells microtitration plates were used and tested the effects of different medicinal plants on adult scabies mite. In each assay 30 Ã¬L of 10, 20 and 30 % methanolic extract concentrations of Azadirachta indica, Caparis decidua, Melia azedarach, Nicotiana tobacum, Tecomella undulata, Vitex negundo and 30 Ã¬L of Methanol (control wells) were added into 96 wells microtitration plates and then were released 20 mites into each well in three replicates. All the wells were observed upto 72 hrs during incubation. The results were evaluated on the bases of activeness, lethargic movements or stagnant nature. The data showed that 30 % concentration of V. negundo was effective treatment for 95 % mites mortalities followed by A. indica and N. tobacum with 90 %, then C. decidua and T. undulata with 80 % and subsequently followed by M. azedarach with 75 % mites mortalities. LC 50 calculated values through probit analysis for T. undulata with LC 50 = 6. 363 mg/ 100 Ã¬L was highly effective followed in descending order by V. negundo with LC 50 = 7. 160 mg/ 100 Ã¬L., N. tobacum with LC 50 = 7. 820 mg/ 100 Ã¬L. A. indica with LC 50 = 8. 312 mg/ 100 Ã¬L., M. azedarach with LC 50 = 10. 697 mg/ 100 Ã¬L and C. decidua with LC 50 = 11. 869 mg/ 100 Ã¬L. In vivo study 10 and 20 % methanolic extract concentrations of A. indica, C. decidua, M. azedarach, N. tobacum, T. undulata, V. negundo and ivermectin at the dose rate of 0. 2 mg/kgb. wt s/c injection in comparison to control (Methyl alcohol) were used on 40 numbers each of buffalo calves, camels, dogs, goats and human on 1 st, 7 th, 14 th and 28 th day. Scabicidal affect on individuals was estimated through reduction in the lesion size, regrowth of hairs and reduced mites load. All the scabietic animals and humans were divided into eight groups each containing five individuals for therapeutic purpose. The groups were nominated as B 1, C 1, D 1, G 1, H 1 for N. tobacum., B 2, C 2, D 2, G 2, H 2 for V. negundo., B 3, C 3, D 3, G 3, H 3 for M. azedarach., B 4, C 4, D 4, G 4, H 4 for A. indica., B 5, C 5, D 5, G 5, H 5 for T. undulata., B 6, C 6, D 6, G 6, H 6 for C. decidua., B 7, C 7, D 7, G 7, H 7 for ivermectin and B 8, C 8, D 8, G 8, H 8 for control.

Study V- Deterrence effect of Nepeta cataria volatile oils The house dust mite, the major cause of human Asthma whose control is easy through plant origin essential oils as compared to Asthma treatment. Instead of the current acaricidal bioassays, an alternate pathway of Y-tube olfactometer technique was used. Both the mites species (Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) showed significantly higher rebounded back rates from the arm having different concentrations of T 2 and T 5 chemotypes (10 Ã¬g, 1 Ã¬g, 0. 1 Ã¬g and 0. 01 Ã¬g) used in adding together to fish flakes (10 Ã¬g) each. T 2 -chemotype verses hexane gave 40 % versus 16 %, 45 % versus 30 %, 47. 5 % versus 17. 5 % and 30 % versus 28. 5 %; while T 5 -chemotype versus hexane gave 47. 5 % versus 17. 5 %, 50 % versus 17. 5 %, 42. 5 % versus 25 % and 35 % versus 20 % repellence at the concentration of 10 Ã¬g, 1 Ã¬g, 0. 1 Ã¬g and 0. 01 Ã¬g of both chemotypes respectively. They were compared to the distilled hexane in alternate arm and their significance probability noted was, (P < 0. 001) except 0. 01 Ã¬g concentration in T 2 -chemotype. In T 5 - chemotype the lowest dose of 0. 01 Ã¬g/ml of hexane were also found statistically significant regarding the repellence response. Before checking the repellent response of Nepeta cataria volatiles chemotypes, the house dust mites were bio assayed for the attractant response towards fish flakes verses distilled hexane, where fish flakes were found more significantly attractive than distilled hexanes (P< 0. 001). Our study shows that the Nepetalactones and Caryophyllene both present in the chemotypes T 2 and T 5 exhibits both <b>narcotic</b> and repellent <b>actions</b> for D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus, and can be used potentially as repellent for house dust mite control...|$|R
