50|$|To avoid hauling a long {{length of}} loose twine through each knot, the twine is wound up on a netting shuttle or <b>netting</b> <b>needle.</b> This {{must be done}} {{correctly}} to prevent twisting as it is used, but makes net production much faster. A gauge (a smooth stick) is used to keep the loops {{the same size and}} the mesh even. The first and last rows are generally done with a half-size gauge, so that the edges of the net will be smooth.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} pine needles (pinus roxburgii) {{potentially}} {{available for use}} as energy feedstock in the Central Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in India has been estimated. It involves estimating the gross annual amount of pine needle yield followed by a comprehensive identification and quantification {{of the factors that}} affect the <b>net</b> annual pine <b>needle</b> yield available as energy feedstock. These factors include considerations such as accessibility, alternative uses, forest fires, other losses, etc., that are influenced by aspects ranging from physical constraints to traditional societal traits. Tree canopy cover method has been used for estimating the gross annual pine needle yield. The information on canopy density is obtained from remote sensing data, that forms the basis for forest classification. The annual gross pine needle yield has been estimated at 1. 9 million tonnes while the annual <b>net</b> pine <b>needle</b> yield at 1. 33 million tonnes. The annual primary energy potential of pine needles available as energy feedstock has also been estimated. For annual net energy potential estimation, thermal and electrical routes are considered. Electrical energy generation from pine needles using thermochemical conversion has been examined and the corresponding potential for electricity generation been estimated. An installed capacity of 789 MW can be supported with pine needles feedstock for supplying electricity in rural areas for five hours a day. For round the clock generation, an installed capacity of 165 MW can be supported by the pine needle energy feedstock...|$|R
50|$|Assessment {{of stock}} quality {{just prior to}} {{planting}} showed that: emblings had greater water use efficiency with decreasing predawn shoot water potential compared with seedlings; seedlings and emblings had similar water movement capability at both high and low root temperatures; <b>net</b> photosynthesis and <b>needle</b> conductance at low root temperatures were greater in seedlings than in emblings; and seedlings had greater root growth than emblings at 22°C root, but root growth among all plants was low at 7.5°C root temperature.|$|R
50|$|Grossnickle and Major (1992) {{found that}} year-old and current-year needles of both {{seedlings}} and emblings {{had a similar}} decline in needle conductance with increasing vapour pressure deficit. Response surface models of current-year <b>needles</b> <b>net</b> photosynthesis (Pn) response to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) showed that emblings had 15% greater Pn at VPD of less than 3.0 kPa and PAR greater than 1000 μmol m−2s−1. Year-old and current-year needles of seedlings and emblings showed similar patterns of water use efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Macrobotanical remains show us {{that the}} non-urban farmers {{cultivated}} domestic plants such as beans, maize, squash, sweet potatoes, peanuts, chili pepper, gourd, algorrobo and cotton. Storage facilities “revealed pollen spores from the fern and monocot families. These types of plants were likely used for medicinal purposes and/or as animal fodder”. The paleobotanical collection also has several wild species {{that could have been}} used for “fuel, building materials, animal fodder, medicine, and herbs”.Several types of lithic artifacts were discovered in and around Pampa Grande. The stone adzes, which were bifacially flaked with appendages in order to be hafted to wooden handles, were used for tilling and harvesting. Batáns, large grinding stones, and manos, which were smaller hand-held grinding stones, were found in most every household. (Johnson, 2010: 119-120) In addition, scarce amounts of copper were found.

50|$|The industrious Norwegian family {{cleared the}} trees and built a home on the {{interior}} of Sand Island. There the Noreng family farmed and fished Lake Superior year round for whitefish, chubs, and lake trout. Fish nets were repaired with handmade <b>net</b> shuttles (<b>needles)</b> made of wood. Bonfires were built on shore to notify others to send a small row boat {{to pick them up}} from the mainland. Crossing Lake Superior waters could be dangerous with large waves and strong winds, and bitter cold in late fall. In the winter, people could walk or take the horse drawn sled to the mainland over the ice. When other pioneer families on Sand Island came to visit, a feast was held, followed by music on the front porch: harmonica, guitar, violin, and accordion accompanied those who sang both Norwegian and American songs.|$|R
40|$|Foliar and {{cortical}} terpene profile, and needle {{gas exchange}} and water potential of P. halepensis, P. brutia and P. eldarica were compared over three consecutive seasons (1996 - 1998) in an experimental plantation nearby Firenze (Italy). Terpene percentages in mature tissue (cortex and needle) {{did not change}} in response to water stress during summer period and remained stable through seasons and years. Terpene profiles were not affected by seasonal drought, and are thus valuable to characterize Mediterranean pine species of the group "halepensis". There was a threshold-type response of maximum daily gas exchange to decreasing predawn water potential in all pines. <b>Net</b> photosynthesis and <b>needle</b> conductance were linearly related, regardless of the species...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobility}} of soft tissue can cause inaccurate needle insertions. Particularly in steering applications that employ thin and flexible needles, large deviations can occur between pre-operative {{images of the}} patient, from which a procedure is planned, and the intra-operative scene, where a procedure is executed. Although many approaches for reducing tissue motion focus on external constraining or manipulation, {{little attention has been}} paid to the way the needle is inserted and actuated within soft tissue. Using our biologically inspired steerable needle, we present a method of reducing the disruptiveness of insertions by mimicking the burrowing mechanism of ovipositing wasps. Internal displacements and strains in three dimensions within a soft tissue phantom are measured at the needle interface, using a scanning laser-based image correlation technique. Compared to a conventional insertion method with an equally sized needle, overall displacements and strains in the needle vicinity are reduced by 30 % and 41 %, respectively. The results show that, for a given <b>net</b> speed, <b>needle</b> insertion can be made significantly less disruptive with respect to its surroundings by employing our biologically inspired solution. This will have significant impact on both the safety and targeting accuracy of percutaneous interventions along both straight and curved trajectories...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} starts by showing Farmer {{featured}} {{on a giant}} screen laid out on a building in a city in the rain. At the same time, {{a man in his}} apartment looks at the screen and touches it through the wet window pane. Then Farmer, smiling, is in his apartment, wearing <b>net</b> stockings and <b>needle</b> heels, and sits on a leather armchair. She looks at the man who is reading a book next to her. With her heels, she starts to take off the man's shirt and strips him to the waist. Behind a blue pane, they begin a choreography of which only the shades are shown. Then, sitting on a bed in the library, Farmer clasps the man and has sex with him. She passes her hands along the man's back and buries them under his skin. The images of the choreography intersect with the video clip until the end. At the end of the song, the screen goes off. In the end credits, Farmer thanks Benoît di Sabato, her companion.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) {{may be a}} better technique for identifying genotypic variation in water use efficiency than most instantaneous physiological assays. The objectives of this research were to: determine whether genotype x environment (G x E) interaction in Δ and gas exchange exists in four ponderosa pine sources; determine if there is a correlation between Δ and intrinsic water use efficiency (A/gwv) in ponderosa pine; and compare gas exchange and Δ in seedlings and mature trees. ^ Gas exchange, water relations, specific leaf area (SLA), stomatal density, and Δ were analyzed in 26 -year-old trees grown at Nebraska and Oklahoma; and in 2 -year-old seedlings greenhouse-grown under two water treatments. Source differences in A/gwv, Δ, and needle morphology were observed in seedlings and mature trees. Seedlings also exhibited source differences in <b>net</b> photosynthesis (A), <b>needle</b> conductance to water vapor (gwv), and transpiration (E). Water stress reduced A, gwv, E, growth, and Δ of seedlings. Source x water treatment interaction was not detected for any of the traits. In seedlings, families within seed source varied significantly in every trait except SLA. ^ Carbon isotope discrimination was negatively correlated with A/gwv and positively correlated with gwv in seedlings and mature trees. Thus, Δ variation in ponderosa pine is more related to gwv than to A. Needle morphology did not explain Δ variation. ^ Trees exhibited source x location interaction in Δ indicating G x E interaction in this trait, but the year x source interaction was not significant. It is concluded that G x E interaction of mature trees may be more related to latitude, photoperiod, temperature, or edaphic characteristics than to precipitation. Seed source rankings in A/gwv and Δ in seedlings and mature trees grown at Oklahoma were the same, suggesting a strong juvenile-mature tree correlation in these traits. ...|$|R
40|$|The hybrid larch F 1 (Larix gmelinii var. japonica x Larix kaempferi) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important tree species not only for timber production but also as an afforestation material for severe conditions such as infertile soil. To predict the ability of hybrid larch F 1 as an afforestation material under potential climates in the future, it is important to understand the response of hybrid larch F 1 to elevated CO 2 concentration ([CO 2]) under low nutrient availability. Three-year-old seedlings of hybrid larch F 1 were grown under two different levels of [CO 2], 360 (ambient) and 720 μmol mol^[- 1] (elevated), in combination with two different levels of nitrogen (N) supply (0 and 30 kg ha^[- 1]) for one growing season. Elevated [CO 2] reduced the maximum rates of carboxylation and electron transport in the <b>needles.</b> <b>Net</b> photosynthetic rates at growth [CO 2] (i. e., 360 and 720 μmol mol^[- 1] for ambient and elevated treatment, respectively) did not differ between the two CO 2 treatments. Reductions in the N content and the N use efficiency to perform photosynthetic functions owing to the deficiency of nutrients other than N, such as P and K, and/or increase of cell wall mass were considered as the factors of photosynthetic down-regulation under elevated [CO 2], whereas stomatal closure little affected the photosynthetic down-regulation. Although we observed strong down-regulation of photosynthesis, the dry matter increase of hybrid larch F 1 seedlings was enhanced under elevated [CO 2]. This is mainly attributable to the increase in the amount of needles with increasing the number of sylleptic branches. These results suggest that elevated CO 2 may increase growth of hybrid larch F 1 even under low nutrient availability, and that this increase may be regulated by both changes in crown architecture and in needle photosynthesis, which is mainly affected by not stomatal limitation but by biochemical limitation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Seizures {{are poorly}} {{controlled}} in {{many people with}} epilepsy despite adequate current antiepileptic treatments. There is increasing interest in alternative therapies such as acupuncture; however, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to {{support the use of}} acupuncture. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (March 2008) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases from inception to March 2008. Reference lists from relevant trials were reviewed. No language restrictions were imposed. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham treatment, antiepileptic drugs or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments. involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality. Main results: Eleven small trials with 914 participants, of generally poor methodological quality and with short follow up met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials were carried out in China and one in Norway. Two trials found that more children treated with needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs achieved 75 % or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1. 52, 95 % CI 1. 12 to 2. 05) and 50 % or greater reduction in seizure duration (pooled RR 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 62) compared with Chinese herbs alone. However, after combining the results of four trials that compared the treatment group with a control group that could yield the <b>net</b> effect of <b>needle</b> acupuncture, we found that {{there was no significant difference}} between the treatment and the control groups in any reduction of seizure frequency (pooled RR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 1. 17). Compared to phenytoin, the pooled results from two trials showed that patients who received needle acupuncture appeared more likely to achieve 75 % or greater reduction in seizure frequency (pooled RR 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 47 to 3. 1). Compared to valproate, the pooled results from three trials showed catgut implantation at acupoints appeared more likely to result in 75 % or greater reduction in seizure frequency (pooled RR 2. 33, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 5. 36).

40|$|A {{program was}} {{developed}} to simulate the individual tree photosynthesis of ten Pinus radiata D. Don clones at age 5, and a comparison was made between the clones at a given condition to estimate photosynthesis from leaf level to tree level. The model linked the sub-models of leaf level photosynthesis, crown shape, foliage area, foliage area density distribution, and light penetration probability within tree crowns together to estimate total net photosynthesis on individual tree level. This study was carried out at a radiata pine clonal experiment at the same site with the same treatment located at Dalethorpe, Canterbury, New Zealand. At leaf level, seasonal photosynthetic responses to light and temperature curves of 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year-old needles were measured under controlled environmental conditions in the field. <b>Needle</b> <b>net</b> photosynthetic rates did not show {{statistically significant differences between}} clones. Net photosynthesis decreased with leaf age but increased with temperature (5 °C - 20 °C). Comparing the maximum photosynthetic rates under the same measurement conditions, there were no statistically significant differences among the ten clones or according to crown position (crown level and aspect i. e. north-, south-, east-, and west-facing). In describing crown shape, a simple crown shape was developed. The model can be used to calculate crown radii, the maximum crown radius, the crown base radius, crown volume and vertical volume distribution of different needle age classes. Above-ground biomass and needle surface area were estimated. The total above-ground biomass and its allocation showed significantly difference among growth difference clones. Tree height was poorly correlated with total biomass production, but DBH was strong correlated with needle, branch and total biomass. The vertical distributions of needle biomass, needle surface area, and needle surface area density were studied according to age class. In estimating light penetration within tree crowns, a simple light penetration program was developed. The program was based on data from crown architecture analysis, geometrical analysis of the light penetration distance within crowns and models of crown shapes. The program can be used to estimate the probability of direct light penetration at any given sun zenith angle and diffuse light penetration at any given direction with azimuth angle ∠θ and elevation angle ∠β. With the developed individual tree net photosynthesis process model, the influence of foliage mass, crown shape, light penetration probability, incoming sun zenith angle, crown light extinction coefficient k-value and needle photosynthetic capacity on total tree net photosynthesis was studied. Simulation results indicated that foliage mass was an important factor influencing total tree photosynthetic rate. However, other factors, such as crown shape and needle photosynthetic capacity, all influenced the variation of total tree photosynthetic rates in various environment conditions...|$|R
