40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{serves as}} one of the main species of yeast for the {{production}} of beer, bread and wine, but is also used as a model organism {{for the study of the}} eukaryotic cell. In <b>nature,</b> <b>yeast</b> cells are exposed to rapid and extreme changes in the environment, ranging from temperature stress to nutrient deprivation and osmotic stress. Therefore, the ability of yeast to cope with these adverse conditions is crucial for its survival. In particular, regulation of cell growth in response to nutrients is not only crucial for yeast, but for all organisms. Besides their role as building blocks and energy providers, nutrients function as signaling molecules that transmit environmental information to cells. These nutrients induce signaling cascades that control growth, several of which are highly conserved from yeast to human. Importantly, during the process of brewing, wine or bioethanol production, yeast cells are exposed to similar stresses which adversely affect growth, fermentative capacity and cell viability. Therefore, the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms that underlie nutrient-dependent control of growth in yeast will not only reveal equivalent mechanisms in higher eukaryotes but is also of great value for optimizing the use of yeast in the fermentation industry. When starved for an essential nutrient, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphate or sulfate, yeast cells arrest growth and enter stationary phase. During this quiescent state, the cells adopt a number of properties characteristic for low protein kinase A (PKA) activity such as decreased expression of ribosomal protein genes, accumulation of reserve carbohydrates, increased stress resistance andgrowth arrest. Re-addition of the missing nutrient triggers rapid activation of PKA, reversing these effects and allowing a fast start-up of growth. In case of nitrogen starvation, regulation of PKA activity by amino acids is mediated by the general amino acid permease Gap 1. This transporter protein has an additional function as a receptor for activation of PKA in response to amino acids via the so-called fermentable growth medium-induced (FGM) pathway. Exactly how Gap 1 activates PKA is not known, but evidence has been provided that the yeast S 6 K/PKB ortholog Sch 9 and the yeast PDK 1 orthologs Pkh 1 - 3 are implicated. One approach to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind FGM signaling is the identificationof proteins physically interacting with the transceptor Gap 1. Previous work in our lab has identified the alfa-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF 2 as a potential direct interaction partner of Gap 1. Translation initiation is the first step in the process of protein synthesis, and its proper regulation in response to nutrient availability is crucial for eukaryotic cell growth. Throughout this research the possible direct connection between amino acid-induced FGM signaling and components of the translation initiation machinery in yeast has been investigated. We show that Gap 1 physically interacts with different subunits of eIF 2 but also the guaninenucleotide exchange factor eIF 2 B, using several protein-protein interaction assays. Importantly, in the absence of the eIF 2 alfa kinase Gcn 2, the activity of the downstream PKA target trehalase is increased and also mutations in eIF 2 and eIF 2 B affect amino acid-induced activation of the FGM pathway. These results suggest that eIF 2, eIF 2 B but also the regulatory eIF 2 alfa kinase Gcn 2 play a role in amino acid-induced activation of the FGM pathway. Moreover, several direct interactions were observed of Tpk 1, Sch 9 and Pkh 1 with eIF 2, eIF 2 B and Gcn 2, both in vitro and in vivo. We also show for the first time that Pkh 1 is able to phosphorylate Gcn 2 in vitro, suggesting a possible role for PDK 1 signaling in the regulation of GCN 2 activity and translation initiation in mammalian cells. In addition, we observed that Gcn 2, but also Gcn 4, a transcription factor and key regulator of amino acid biosynthesis, are required for start-up of growth after addition of certain, but not all, amino acids to nitrogen-starved yeast cells. This indicates that under conditions of nitrogen starvation, Gcn 4 has an important role in supporting the utilization of certain amino acids as sole nitrogen source, rather than a general role for start-up of amino acid biosynthesis. We also provide evidence for a rapid, Gap 1 -dependent, increase of eIF 2 alfa phosphorylation in response to addition of amino acids to nitrogen starved yeast cells. This suggests a possible role for Gap 1 in regulation of translation initiation. Last but not least, we provide evidence that the use of auxotrophic yeast strainsunder conditions of nitrogen starvation can give rise to results that may not be comparable with their prototrophic counterparts. These results also suggest a possible role for intracellular amino acid levels in the regulation of FGM signaling. Although this study has improved our insight in the possible direct connection between translation initiation and Gap 1 -dependent activation of the FGM pathway in yeast, many questions remain and several new questions have been raised. Additional research is required to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie activation of PKA by amino acids and the role of Gap 1 amino acid signaling in the regulation of translation initiation. status: publishe...|$|E

Conidia of Coniothyrium, albeit in a localized fashion, also manifest surface mannose exposure but as shown by Bmax values, in decreasing amounts with increasing maturity.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae old type anamensis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Candida mil[eri and Candida humilis were found to be the predominant species in Sicilian sourdough...|$|R
40|$|The killer {{phenomenon}} {{is defined as}} the ability of some yeast to secrete toxins that are lethal to other sensitive yeasts and filamentous fungi. Since the discovery of strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae capable of secreting killer toxins, much information has been gained regarding killer toxins and this fact has substantially contributed knowledge on fundamental aspects of cell biology and yeast genetics. The killer phenomenon has been studied in Pichia membranifaciens for several years, during which two toxins have been described. PMKT and PMKT 2 are proteins of low molecular mass that bind to primary receptors located in the cell wall structure of sensitive yeast cells, linear (1 → 6) -β-D-glucans and mannoproteins for PMKT and PMKT 2, respectively. Cwp 2 p also acts as a secondary receptor for PMKT. Killing of sensitive cells by PMKT is characterized by ionic movements across plasma membrane and an acidification of the intracellular pH triggering an activation of the High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway. On the contrary, our investigations showed a mechanism of killing in which cells are arrested at an early S-phase by high concentrations of PMKT 2. However, we concluded that induced mortality at low PMKT 2 doses and also PMKT is indeed of an apoptotic <b>nature.</b> Killer <b>yeasts</b> and their toxins have found potential applications in several fields: in food and beverage production, as biocontrol agents, in yeast bio-typing, and as novel antimycotic agents. Accordingly, several applications have been found for P. membranifaciens killer toxins, ranging from pre- and post-harvest biocontrol of plant pathogens to applications during wine fermentation and ageing (inhibition of Botrytis cinerea, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|Replicators {{that control}} the {{initiation}} of DNA replication in the chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae retain their function when cloned into plasmids, where they are {{commonly referred to as}} autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). Previous studies of the structure of ARS 1 in both plasmid and chromosome contexts have shown that it contains one essential DNA element, A, that includes a match to the ARS consensus sequence (ACS), and three additional elements, B 1, B 2, and B 3, that are also important for ARS function. Elements A and B 3 are bound by a candidate initiator protein called the origin recognition complex and ARS-binding factor 1, respectively. Although the A and B 3 elements have been found in other ARSs, sequence comparisons among ARSs have failed to identify B 1 - and B 2 -like elements. To assess the generality of the modular <b>nature</b> of <b>yeast</b> replicators, linker substitution mutagenesis of another yeast chromosomal replicator, ARS 307, was performed. Three DNA sequence elements were identified in ARS 307, and they were demonstrated to be functionally equivalent to the A, B 1, and B 2 elements present in ARS 1. Despite the lack of DNA sequence similarity, the B 1 and B 2 elements at each ARS were functionally conserved. Single-base substitutions in the core of the ARS 1 B 1 and B 2 elements identified critical nucleotides required for the function of the B 1 element. In contrast, no single-point mutations were found to affect B 2 function. The results suggest that multiple DNA sequence elements might be a general and conserved feature of replicator sequences in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
