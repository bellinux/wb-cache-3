5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E
25|$|They would dine {{early on}} first Thursdays at a hotel, {{planning}} what to do; {{high on the}} agenda was {{to change the way}} the Royal Society Council did business. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Council met later that same evening. First item for the Xs was to get the Copley Medal for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest and}} most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version {{composed}} c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and the Lay of el Cid in Spain). It is perhaps <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot {{may be seen as}} a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, Shulamit Aloni, {{writing in}} Haaretz, said of Hess' article, [...] "It's <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> {{settlements}} the Palestinians are called 'Amalek', and the intention is obvious to everyone".|$|R
50|$|It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legio II Parthica came to {{be known}} as legio Albana and its legionaries as Albani, even though the whole legion did not remain at the Castra Albana, but had other encampments in Mesopotamia.|$|R
25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the practice of}} quarantine drove Hamilton's work in public health. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hygienic Laboratory began in an attic at Staten Island's Marine Hospital, near Ellis Island, the single busiest port of entry for immigrants during this period. Earlier on, Hamilton had established a Marine Hospital on Bedloe's Island, future site of the Statue of Liberty. Although MHS would not receive formal authority to issue domestic quarantines until 1893, Hamilton and his staff worked with the Congress to advance incremental changes toward a national policy. Maritime quarantine legislation (Act of August 1, 1888) strengthened the Act of 1878, adding new Federal quarantine stations along the East and West coasts; March 1891 legislation made medical inspection of immigrants part of MHS's duties; and interstate quarantine legislation (Act of March 27, 1890) gave MHS authority to establish quarantines against epidemic cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, and plague. On the request of his successor, Surgeon General Walter Wyman, Hamilton also returned to New York during the 1892 cholera pandemic, {{to set up a}} quarantine camp at Sandy Hook (Camp Low).|$|E
2500|$|The {{disastrous}} {{results of}} the flood established an international {{awareness of the need}} for preservation and conservation education and facilities.

2500|$|For {{this new}} countercultural movement, {{information}} was a precious commodity. In the ’60s, {{there was no}} Internet; no 500 cable channels. [...] was {{a great example of}} user-generated content, without advertising, before the Internet. Basically, Brand invented the blogosphere long before there was any such thing as a blog. [...] No topic was too esoteric, no degree of enthusiasm too ardent, no amateur expertise too uncertified to be included. [...] This I am sure about: it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Whole Earth Catalogs disappeared as soon as the web and blogs arrived. Everything the Whole Earth Catalogs did, the web does better.|$|E
5000|$|It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> 83 class E6s locomotives, {{it was the}} [...] "Lindbergh Engine", #460, {{that was}} {{selected}} for historic preservation. #460 {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as Passenger Locomotive No. 460. It was retired from service in 1955.|$|R
60|$|Examples are {{not wanting}} to {{substantiate}} theory. It is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two most impersonal nations of Europe and Asia respectively, the French and the Japanese, are {{at the same time}} the most artistic. Even politeness, which, as we have seen, distinguishes both, is itself but a form of art,--the social art of living agreeably with one's fellows.|$|R
5000|$|Digby {{addressed}} the packed chamber: [...] "It is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only country {{fighting for the}} cause of peace, Soviet Russia, is <b>the</b> country <b>that</b> has rid itself of the war-mongering clique. The justification urged for the last war was that it was a war to end war. If that were untrue it was a dastardly lie; if it were true, what justification is there for opposition to this motion tonight?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-10th century, {{the average}} size of most units fell. In {{the case of}} the tourma, it dropped from 2,000–3,000 men to 1,000 men and less, in essence {{to the level of the}} earlier droungos, {{although}} larger tourmai are still recorded. It is probably <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "droungos" [...] disappears from use at around that time. Consequently, the tourma was divided directly into five to seven banda, each of 50–100 cavalry or 200–400 infantry. The term tourma itself fell gradually into disuse in the 11th century, but survived at least until the end of the 12th century as an administrative term. Tourmarchai are still attested in the first half of the 11th century, but the title seems to have fallen out of use thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Zoological Society of Dublin was {{established}} {{at a meeting}} held at the Rotunda Hospital on 10 May 1830 [...] and the zoo, then called the Zoological Gardens Dublin, was {{opened to the public}} on 1 September 1831. The animals, 46 mammals and 72 birds, were donated by London Zoo. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> founders of Dublin Zoo were members of the medical profession. Their interest was in studying the animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead. In the 1830s the laws concerning cadavers for medical use changed. Up until then, anyone not associated with one of the big medical institutions had to resort to grave-robbing in order to obtain a cadaver for study, so getting hold of the corpse of a primate without having to rob a grave was considered quite a coup.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was stated}} again by Clinton in the culminating chapter of Hard Choices, her 2014 memoir {{of her time}} as secretary:... It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> places where women's lives were most undervalued largely lined up with {{the parts of the}} world most plagued by instability, conflict, extremism, and poverty. This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but over the years I came to view it {{as one of the most}} compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. [...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity. I became convinced that, in fact, this was a cause that cut to the heart of our national security.|$|E
5000|$|Absent {{reorganization}} authority, {{what was}} a president to do? The president cannot personally coordinate all disparate functions and agencies in the massive federal government. Yet, if a policy fails because of poor coordination, the president is held to account. So it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> as <b>the</b> complexity of government machinery has grown, presidents have responded by {{increasing the number of}} assistants or [...] "czars" [...] to help with the management and coordination of the executive branch.http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1019/p09s04-coop.html ...|$|R
50|$|In a BRMS, a {{representation}} of business rules maps to a software system for execution. A BRMS therefore relates to model-driven engineering, such as the model-driven architecture (MDA) of the Object Management Group (OMG). It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> many of <b>the</b> related standards come under the OMG banner.|$|R
5000|$|In the fourth-season finale, [...] "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger", Volkoff's {{personality}} is restored {{to that of}} Hartley Winterbottom.

2500|$|Ronnie {{is in her}} thirties, and {{the elder}} of the two sisters. Prior to her début, Womack {{described}} Ronnie as the more sensible and intelligent sister, stating {{that she has a}} [...] "caustic tongue" [...] and trust issues. She commented that the sisters are loyal to each other to the point that Ronnie would kill for Roxy, and attributed her [...] "darker side" [...] to her troubled childhood. A BBC source described Ronnie as the ice to Roxy's fire, and Simons deemed her [...] "armoured", as well as the [...] "less flamboyant, darker" [...] sister, with a more controlling nature. Womack feels that Ronnie is [...] "deeply damaged", describing her as unable to be honest with herself or others {{as a result of her}} guarded personality. She explained that she has been taught to hide her feelings and to be a survivor, which she accomplishes by controlling others, concluding that Ronnie is defined by her childhood trauma. The sisters have been compared to the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie. Womack has noted that it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> siblings are named Ronnie and Roxy. She describes them as [...] "co-dependent and dysfunctional", as well as [...] "chilling, dark and absolutely in touch with what the other is doing". Treadwell-Collins initially intended for Ronnie to appear enigmatic, cool and guarded, hoping to intrigue viewers before introducing elements of her backstory to garner audience sympathy.|$|E
50|$|Baldwin criticises Carmen Jones, a film {{adaptation}} of Carmen using an all black cast. Baldwin is unhappy that the characters display {{no connection to}} the condition of blacks and sees it as <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main characters have lighter complexions.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{titles of}} his {{publications}} usually {{begin with the}} word experiments. Crawford let {{the details of his}} experiments and their plain results do the talking, and generally refrained from theorising and over-interpretation. He did maintain the later-discredited phlogiston hypothesis, but wasn't doctrinaire about it.|$|E
2500|$|But the {{translation}} offered {{an opportunity to}} attack the monarchy indirectly, without explicitly naming the King or the Queen. [...] In some cases party politics were involved. [...] "It is <b>no</b> great <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> individual who expressed in the severest tones his disapproval of {{the translation}} was Nikolaos D. Levidis, {{one of the most}} vociferous leaders of the Opposition. [...] Therefore, political demagogy and its probable electoral gains should be considered instrumental in motivating individuals in their opposition to Olga's translation."

5000|$|... 1937 - Even as Odisha {{acquired}} statehood {{under the}} British Empire on 1 April 1936, {{there was no}} legislative assembly for people’s representatives to represent their will and legislate on their behalf. It is <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> grounds of Ravenshaw College were chosen {{for the very first}} meeting of the Legislative Assembly of Odisha on 28 July 1937.The new Legislative Assembly of Odisha started functioning from the Examination Hall of Ravenshaw College and upper balcony and verandah acted as balcony for visitors.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Margot is <b>the</b> one {{who kills}} him. There is an {{unresolved}} debate {{as to whether}} she murdered Macomber or accidentally killed him. If she purposefully shoots him, she has preserved her dominance in the relationship and ensures that she will keep his wealth (presumably {{the only reason they}} married in the first place).|$|R
50|$|The {{confined}} {{nature of}} the valley and the mountainous terraine enforce a compact layout for the village itself. The mountain topography also enforces a collaborative approach to agriculture: it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mayor since 2001 {{has been a member}} of the (by Anglo-American criteria) pragmatic French Communist Party.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{buoyancy}} {{of water}} negates {{to some extent}} the effects of gravity. Therefore, sea creatures can grow to very large sizes without the same musculoskeletal structures {{that would be required}} of similarly sized land creatures, and it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> largest animals to ever exist on earth are aquatic animals.|$|E
50|$|It {{is perhaps}} <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first charter (signed between 1153 and 1170) after the hospital's {{foundation}} is one from David Olifard {{and that he}} also granted the hospital one thrave of corn in Autumn from every carucate in his domain. Olifard's seal was appended to this charter, showing three crescents. This is the earliest example of the Oliphant arms recorded.|$|E
50|$|The town is very {{attractive}} to investors, both foreign and native. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Blagoevgrad is <b>the</b> third largest city by number of building permits. Blagoevgrad is growing {{and the small}} bordering villages of Elenovo and Strumsko are now considered part of it. Recently {{there was a major}} overhaul of the city park and a new bridge was built.|$|R
50|$|Though Charles V {{fought the}} Reformation, it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> either <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reign of his nationalistic {{predecessor}} Maximilian I saw {{the beginning of}} the movement. While the centralized states of western Europe had reached accords with the Vatican permitting them to draw on the rich property of the church for government expenditures, enabling them to form state churches that were greatly autonomous of Rome, similar moves on behalf of the Empire were unsuccessful so long as princes and prince bishops fought reforms to drop the pretension of the secular universal empire.|$|R
2500|$|At Óc Eo, Roman coins {{were among}} the items of long-distance trade {{discovered}} by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s. These include mid-2nd-century Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius, and his adopted son and heir Marcus Aurelius. It is perhaps <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first Roman embassy from [...] "Daqin" [...] recorded in Chinese history is dated 166 AD, allegedly sent by a Roman ruler named [...] "Andun" [...] (Chinese: 安敦, corresponding with the names Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) and arriving through the Eastern Han Empire's southernmost frontier province of Jianzhi in northern Vietnam.|$|R

5000|$|Open Book is a {{technical}} rock climbing route at Tahquitz Peak, CA. [...] Since the Yosemite Decimal System was developed at Tahquitz it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first climb to be rated 5.9, Open Book, is also located at Tahquitz.

50|$|Sweden {{is one of}} the top 10 {{heaviest}} coffee drinking {{countries in}} the world. Milk consumption in Sweden is also very high, second only to Finland. Milk is bought in milk cartons, and it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Tetra Pak, <b>the</b> world's largest maker of milk cartons, was founded in Sweden. Milk is considered the standard drink to have with meals during weekdays in many families, for both children and adults.|$|R
50|$|The Cannons estate {{benefited from}} Desaguliers' {{scientific}} expertise which {{was applied to}} the elaborate water garden there. He was also technical adviser to an enterprise in which Chandos had invested, the York Buildings Company, which used steam-power to extract water from the Thames. In 1718 Desaguliers dedicated to the Duke his translation of Edme Mariotte's treatise on the motion of water. It is perhaps <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> summer of 1718 Handel composed his opera Acis and Galatea for performance at Cannons. In this work the hero Acis is turned into a fountain, and since, by tradition, the work was first performed outside on the terraces overlooking the garden, a connection with Desaguliers' new water works seems probable.|$|R
