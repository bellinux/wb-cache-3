40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> {{of information and}} communication technologies in education. Health and social behavior related <b>negative</b> <b>impacts,</b> characterized by frequency of occurence or severity, are presented. Emphasized are, however, cognitive functions, especially attention and memory. <b>Negative</b> <b>impacts,</b> which can lead towards deterioration of pupils' ability to learn, are explored in detail. Possible situations of use and aspects of ICT, which can have said effect, are identified. The subject is expanded by possible countermeasures {{that can be used to}} prevent, mitigate or eliminate some of the <b>negative</b> <b>impacts.</b> The empiric part of the thesis verifies some of the presented <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> of {{information and communication technologies}} related in particular to school effectiveness of pupils and additional countermeasures are introduced to reduce these impacts...|$|R
50|$|These <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> are {{observable}} but the platforms to identify, measure, analyze, {{and address}} them are insufficient. This {{is exacerbated by}} the idea that ICT only provides benefits to society. As new ICT practices are introduced, new challenges tag after them. However, conceiving policies to minimize the <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> requires time and resources. Conceptualization of effective and definite measures to counter these <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> is in the development stage as part of future priorities.|$|R

50|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>Impacts</b> are the effects, {{that are}} caused in most cases, at the tourist {{destination}} site with detrimental impacts to the Social and cultural area, {{as well as}} the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, resources become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted. Typically, when <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> are occurring, it is too late to place restrictions and regulations. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> are found in the development stage of the Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC).|$|R

Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, falling by 16 per cent.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may have a <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring {{their impact on the}} environment.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
