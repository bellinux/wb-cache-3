A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to provide discriminative {{validation}} for a <b>Normal</b> Dissociation Scale-short form. Two hundred and seventy four undergraduates (mean age 19. 56 years) rated the <b>Normal</b> Dissociation Scale, <b>Normal</b> Splitting-projection Scale, <b>Normal</b> depersonalisation/derealisation Scale, and Dissociative Experiences Scale, which consisted of <b>Normal</b> Dissociative Index(NDl) and DES-T. In survey 1, a factor analysis of the <b>Normal</b> depersonalisation/derealisation Scale revealed one factor structure that had 10 items. Internal consistency of the <b>Normal</b> Depersonalisation/Derealisation Scale was sufficiently high(α=. 82). In survey 1, <b>Normal</b> Dissociation Scale showed significant middle correlation with <b>Normal</b> Splitting-projection Scale, <b>Normal</b> depersonalisation/derealisation Scale, NDI, and low correlation with DES-T. In survey 2, a one-way ANOVA of each scale 2 ̆ 7 s <b>normal</b> image score revealed significant higher <b>Normal</b> Dissociation Scale 2 ̆ 7 s score than others. The results indicated that the item context of the <b>Normal</b> Dissociation Scale was intended for <b>normal</b> people. On the other hand, <b>Normal</b> Dissociation Scale showed significant middle correlation with <b>Normal</b> Splitting-projection Scale, <b>Normal</b> depersonalisation/derealisation Scale, and NDI. Therefore, the scale did not show good discriminative validity. Further research is necessary to improve <b>Normal</b> Dissociation Scale-long form...|$|R

25|$|In {{patients}} with Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{there is a}} smaller McGurk effect exhibited than in <b>normals.</b> Often a reduced size of the corpus callosum produces a hemisphere disconnection process.

25|$|Bivectors and axial vectors {{are related}} by Hodge dual. In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a {{subspace}} to its orthogonal complement, so if a bivector {{is represented by}} a plane then the axial vector associated with it is simply the plane's surface normal. The plane has two <b>normals,</b> one on each side, giving the two possible orientations for the plane and bivector.|$|E
25|$|We then plot {{two points}} A(50,40) and B(-10,-40), {{representing}} {{the state of}} stress at plane A and B as show in both Figure 8 and Figure 9. These points follow the engineering mechanics sign convention for the Mohr-circle space (Figure 5), which assumes positive <b>normals</b> stresses outward from the material element, and positive shear stresses on each plane rotating the material element clockwise. This way, the shear stress acting on plane B is negative and the shear stress acting on plane A is positive.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conducting}} medium, permittivity {{and index}} of refraction are complex-valued. Consequently, so are the angle of refraction and the wave-vector. This implies that, while the surfaces of constant real phase are planes whose <b>normals</b> make an angle equal to the angle of refraction with the interface normal, the surfaces of constant amplitude, in contrast, are planes parallel to the interface itself. Since these two planes do not in general coincide with each other, the wave {{is said to be}} inhomogeneous. The refracted wave is exponentially attenuated, with exponent proportional to the imaginary component of the {{index of refraction}}.|$|E

A significant number of patients are diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus or undifferentiated connective tissue disease largely based on a positive ANA. In case no defined autoantibody can be detected (e.g. anti-ENA antibodies), the testing of anti-DFS70 antibodies is recommended to verify the diagnosis. Anti-DFS70 antibody tests are available as CE-marked tests. Until now, no FDA cleared assay is available.|$|E

The article mentioned queercore band Nick Name and the <b>Normals,</b> and Etheredge-Ouzts contacted Name to see if he would be interested in writing music for the film. Working with Name helped Etheredge-Ouzts to further define the motion picture's aesthetics, characters, and themes. At some point, Name, who had been an Abercrombie & Fitch model, was asked to play the serial killer in the film, and he agreed. Through Name, Etheredge-Ouzts came to know Texas Terri, whom he cast as the tattoo artist. Only later did Etheredge-Ouzts discover that Texas Terri was a punk rock musician and singer, after which he asked her to contribute to the soundtrack as well.|$|E
25|$|Sparky the Sun Devil is the mascot of Arizona State University and {{was named}} by vote {{of the student body}} on November 8, 1946. Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every {{football}} bowl game in which the university has participated. The university's mascot is {{not to be confused with}} the athletics department's logo, the Pitchfork or hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo is used on various sport facilities, uniforms and athletics documents. Arizona State Teacher’s College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs. When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School’s teams were simply known as the <b>Normals.</b> Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in Sun Devil Stadium or other ASU athletic facilities. His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky's Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the USA at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category. Currently, ASU's varsity intercollegiate cheerleading team is not allowed to participate at athletic events (e.g. football and basketball games) due to dismissal regarding prior misconduct. ASU Cheerleading has since become a club sport, through the Student Recreation Center, competing locally and nationally as a Collegiate Co-Ed Division IA-Level VI team. They have reestablished their commitment to excellence, winning various championships. The team has a strict code of conduct and is seeking reinstatement from the university to participate at athletic events.|$|E

One higher <b>normal</b> school was founded in Tokyo (another was established in Hiroshima in 1902) and directly placed under {{the administration of the}} Ministry of Education. Further, <b>normal</b> schools were opened in every prefecture. <b>Normal</b> schools educated the principals and teachers of public elementary schools in each prefecture, whereas Tokyo Higher <b>Normal</b> School educated the head teachers and teachers of ordinary <b>normal</b> schools with secondary school status. According to the <b>Normal</b> Education Order of 1897, Tokyo Higher <b>Normal</b> School was responsible for educating teachers in all secondary schools (Ministry of Education, 1980). The <b>normal</b> and higher <b>normal</b> schools had two important roles. First, <b>normal</b> schools were prefectural educational centers for research and practice, whereas higher <b>normal</b> schools were hubs for national educational research. Second, <b>normal</b> schools offered in-service teacher education programs for unqualified teachers (Sato, 1999) and some activities for teachers, such as open-house lesson study (Isozaki & Isozaki, 2011; Isozaki, 2015), editing secondary school textbooks, and publishing educational periodicals.|$|R

500|$|The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) {{describes}} climate [...] "normals" [...] as [...] "reference points used by climatologists {{to compare}} current climatological trends {{to that of}} the past or what is considered 'normal'.

[...] The WMO originated from the International Meteorological Organization which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929.
