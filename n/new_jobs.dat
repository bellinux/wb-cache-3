5|$|When Daniels was elected, {{he stated}} his number one {{priority}} was job creation. To achieve that goal, he created the public-private Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), became chairman of its board, and ordered it to “act {{at the speed of}} business, not the speed of government,” to attract <b>new</b> <b>jobs.</b> During its first year, the IEDC closed more transactions than similar efforts had during the previous two years combined. Between 2005 and 2008, 485 businesses committed to creating more than 60,000 <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> and invest $14.5 billion into the Indiana economy. By the end of the administration, IEDC claimed to have closed on almost 1,500 deals to create a projected 169,000 <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> since 2005.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify stress-factors from job {{displacement}} and adapting to <b>new</b> <b>job</b> unit. A literature search of "nurse" and "job displacement" as keywords was performed through "Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ver. 4) " from 1983 to 2010. Thirty -six literatures were extracted from the literature search. The stress of nurse by job displacement was divided into four categories including "differences in environment of <b>new</b> <b>job</b> unit", "shortage of nursing skills and practical knowledge", "pressure by experience", and "negative self-evaluation". And five categories of adapting to <b>new</b> <b>job</b> unit were extracted from literatures including "acquisition of nursing skills and practical knowledge required for <b>new</b> <b>job</b> unit", "interest in <b>new</b> <b>job</b> unit", "positive self-evaluation", "make concessions", and "dis-covery of future view". Although nurses were under stress by job displacement, nurses had achived career by adopting...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment.

The military base and the University of North Dakota became integral to the city's economy. With construction of federal highways, during the postwar years residential and business development became suburbanized, spreading to new areas as land was available. Interstate 29 was built on the western side of the city, and two enclosed shopping malls – South Forks Plaza and Columbia Mall – were built on the south side.|$|E

However, the formation of the coalition government in 2010 saw regional planning targets scrapped, along with growth area status. Ashford has continued to develop, with new homes planned for urban areas such as Repton Park, Park Farm, Singleton and Chilmington, and planning permission granted for a new £25m college campus. The extension of Victoria Road has created new development space in Ashford, though plans to build a Morrisons supermarket here were scrapped in May 2014.|$|E

Long-term health problems/disability is associated with significantly worse outcomes on all three measures.

The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to <b>new</b> <b>jobs.</b> The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
