50|$|Currently, no {{therapeutic}} {{drugs are}} prescribed for the disease. Therefore, prevention {{is the sole}} mode of treatment. This disease can only be prevented by quarantining sick birds and preventing migration of birds around the house, causing them to spread the disease.

40|$|Abstract: Histomoniasis (infectious enterohepatitis) is {{a disease}} of broiler chickens, turkeys and game fowl which are reared on litter or exposed to range. It {{is caused by the}} {{protozoan}} organism Histomonas meleagridis. Histomonads are spread in chicken feces, Heterakis gallinarum (cecal worm) eggs or earthworms. Symptoms may include: poor feed conversion ratio and body weight, diarrhea with sulfur-colored droppings, cecal and liver lesions, darkening of the facial regions and sometimes death. Morbidity, mortality and culling may reach 20 % in chickens. In the U. S. A., <b>nitarsone</b> (4 -nitrophenyl-arsonic acid; Histostat, Alpharma, Inc., Fort Lee, NJ) is used as an aid in prevention of histomoniasis. In this trial,® Natustat ™ (Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY), a proprietary plant derived product, was used at 1. 925 kg/Tonne and compared with <b>nitarsone</b> in the diets of unsexed Hubbard HiY broiler chicks to 42 d of age on histomonad infected litter from broiler breeders.

There were 4 pens each containing 150 chicks (unreplicated live performance) and 25 birds per pen were randomly sampled at 28, 35 and 42 d of age for cecal (0 - 4) and liver lesion (0 - 3) scoring. The histomonad infected litter group had significantly elevated cecal and liver lesion scores compared to the uninfected control group, indicating the challenge model was effective.

40|$|Although {{bacterial}} mechanisms {{involved in}} the resistance to inorganic arsenic are well understood, the molecular basis for organic arsenic resistance has not been described. Campylobacter jejuni, a major food-borne pathogen causing gastroenteritis in humans, is highly prevalent in poultry and is reportedly resistant to the arsenic compound roxarsone (4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrobenzenearsonic acid), which {{has been used as}} a feed additive in the poultry industry for growth promotion. In this study, we report the identification of a novel membrane transporter (named ArsP) that contributes to organic arsenic resistance in Campylobacter. ArsP is predicted to be a membrane permease containing eight transmembrane helices, distinct from other known arsenic transporters. Analysis of multiple C. jejuni isolates from various animal species revealed that the presence of an intact arsP gene is associated with elevated resistance to roxarsone. In addition, inactivation of arsP in C. jejuni resulted in 4 - and 8 -fold reductions in the MICs of roxarsone and <b>nitarsone,</b> respectively, compared to that for the wild-type strain. Furthermore, cloning of arsP into a C. jejuni strain lacking a functional arsP gene led to 16 - and 64 -fold increases in the MICs of roxarsone and <b>nitarsone,</b> respectively. Neither mutation nor overexpression of arsP affected the MICs of inorganic arsenic, including arsenite and arsenate, in Campylobacter. Moreover, acquisition of arsP in NCTC 11168 led to accumulation of less roxarsone than the wild-type strain lacking arsP. Together, these results indicate that ArsP functions as an efflux transporter specific for extrusion of organic arsenic and contributes to the resistance to these compounds in C. jejuni...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{detecting}} trace concentrations of analytes often is hindered by occurring {{noise in the}} signal curves of analytical methods.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method with UV detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of arsanilic acid, roxarsone, <b>nitarsone,</b> and carbarsone in the feeds of swine and chicken. Feed samples were extracted with methanol/ 1 % acetic acid (90 : 10, v/v) in an ultrasonic bath and the protein was precipitated with 2 % Cu(2) SO(4). The samples were further purified by solid phase extraction (SPE) on SAX cartridges. Separation was performed on a Zorbax SB-Aq C 18 HPLC column using an isocratic procedure with methanol and 1 % acetic acid (3 : 97, v/v) at a flow-rate of 0. 7 mL min(- 1), and the UV detector was set at a wavelength of 260 nm. The recoveries of organoarsenic compounds spiked at levels of 2. 20 and 200 mu g g(- 1) ranged from 81. 2 % to 91. 3 %; the inter-day relative standard deviation values were less than 7. 0 %.

30|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} (mAb) has higher specificity {{and better}} repeatability than polyclonal antibody. Therefore, {{it is more}} suitable for the detection of the substance of a particular structure. By virtue of benefits drawn from their specific, sensitive, rapid, simple, and high-throughput characters, mAbs can be widely used in practical testing. Despite being useful, it also has some disadvantages. The approaches for preparing antibodies are mostly empirical and guided by nonstandardized protocols and individual experience [46]. During the experiment, great care has to be exercised to dilution factors and cultivation conditions {{such as the use of}} feeder cells [47]. Moreover, screening for single hybridoma cell clones that produce high-quality antibody is mainly done by ELISA. When using this method to isolate target cells, a large number of cells would be lost. This makes the whole process extremely time consuming and labor intensive [48]. Furthermore, the characteristic of antibody is vulnerable to be impacted by the feature of antigen. For example, the extent and yield of the antigen against protein’s chemical conjugation may be very important to mAb. Acevedo et al. [49] proved that combining double-chemically modified carrier proteins with hetero-functional crosslinkers allows preparing tailor-made hapten protein carrier conjugates. Wang et al. [50] prepared a generic mAb and developed a sensitive ic-ELISA for detecting phenothiazines in animal feed. The limit of detections of the method ranged from 1.1 to 15.3  μg/kg. Han et al. [51] produced an mAb with broad specificity to nitroimidazoles, dimetridazole, ipronidazole, ronidazole hydroxydimetridazole, and hydroxyipronidazole, with the IC 50 values of 4.79, 0.47, 5.97, 23.48, and 15.03  μg/L, respectively. Peng et al. [52] used arsanilic acid as a hapten, and produced the suitable mAb for simultaneously determining organoarsenic compounds including <b>nitarsone,</b> carbarsone, and arsanilic acid in animal tissue and feed.|$|E
40|$|Histomonosis (blackhead) is {{a disease}} of galliform birds caused by the flagellated {{protozoan}} Histomonas meleagridis. Its primary target organs are the ceca and the liver. Especially in turkeys, mortality can be very high (up to 100 %). In the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s several effective antihistomonal compounds like <b>nitarsone</b> and dimetridazole were developed and the disease was brought under control. After these antihistomonals were banned from use in production animals due to possible toxic and carcinogenic properties, the disease re-emerged. The aim of the studies in this thesis was to optimize and develop methods for the detection and typing of H. meleagridis and to examine new possibilities to control the disease. Histomonas culture was optimized by adding more (100 mg instead of 12 mg) rice powder to the culture medium (Dwyer medium). This resulted in a 10 -fold higher yield of parasites and the possibility to prolong cultures by addition of rice powder. Also {{it was found that}} a complex constituent, chicken embryo extract, was redundant. Another constituent, horse serum, proved essential. Several new possible antihistomonal products were examined by using in vitro (based on the imrpoved culture) and, if effective, in vivo models. Aromabioic™ and tiamulin were not effective in vitro and were not examined further. Enteroguard™ and Protophyt™ had no antihistomonal effect in vivo. Paromomycin, however, protected turkeys against an otherwise lethal challenge with H. meleagridis (full protection at 400 ppm, and partly protection at 200 ppm). A blocking ELISA was developed for the detection of antibodies in chicken and turkeys. The monoclonal antibody needed for this assay was raised against proteins extracted from H. meleagridis using a detergent (Triton X- 114). While both chicken and turkeys seroconverted after a challenge with H. meleagridis, the ELISA showed no crossreactivity with Tetratrichomonas gallinarum. The ELISA is e. g. useful for seroepidemiological studies towards the distribution of H. meleagridis in chickens, which are considered a reservoir for the parasite. Finally, a novel subtyping technique (C-profiling) was developed. It is based on molecular techniques (PCR and sequening). The internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) region of the rRNA gene proved sufficiently variable for subtyping. Three subtypes of H. meleagridis was found. Type III possibly is Parahistomonas meleagridis, a nonpathogenic protozoan described some decades ago. Subtyping is useful if different genotypes are associated with different pathotypes. C-profiling was applied to a closely related pathogen of humans: Dientamoeba fragilis and was found to be a promising molecular epidemiological tool for studying the transmission, geographical distribution and relationships between strains and pathogenicity of this parasite...|$|E
