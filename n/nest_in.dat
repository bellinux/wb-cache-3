5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally <b>nest</b> <b>in</b> the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to <b>nest</b> <b>in</b> areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} {{a portion of their}} time feeding on the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and <b>nest</b> <b>in</b> holes in the ground.

40|$|Multilevel {{modeling}} {{has become}} a common analytic technique {{across a variety of}} disciplines including education and other social and behavioral sciences. Such models are often used when researchers examine relationships between school and/or neighborhood characteristics and some individual-level outcome (e. g., academic achievement, high school completion). Although many samples are theoretically cross-classified between multiple level- 2 units, the application of cross-classified random effects models is rare in such research. This paper compares model fit and parameter estimates from five different PROC MIXED multilevel modeling approaches—(a) a two-level model with students <b>nested</b> <b>in</b> schools and neighborhood variables included as contextual variables at Level 1, (b) a two-level model with students <b>nested</b> <b>in</b> neighborhoods and school variables included as contextual variables at Level 1, (c) a three-level model with students <b>nested</b> <b>in</b> schools <b>nested</b> <b>in</b> neighborhoods, (d) a three-level model with students <b>nested</b> <b>in</b> neighborhoods <b>nested</b> <b>in</b> schools, and (e) a cross-classified random effects model with students cross-nested in schools and neighborhoods.

40|$|Mistletoes are {{preferred}} nesting {{sites for}} many bird species {{in a range}} of habitats. However, no studies have examined the use of mistletoes by <b>nesting</b> birds <b>in</b> the semi-arid savannah. We studied <b>nesting</b> <b>in</b> mistletoe and its role <b>in</b> determining <b>nesting</b> success <b>in</b> the Grey Go-away-bird in south-west Zimbabwe. We modelled the effects of mistletoe, mistletoe abundance, nest microclimate, concealment and nest height on daily survival rates (DSR) using program MARK. A constant survival model was best fitted for the Grey Go-away-bird suggesting a constant nest survival rate across the nesting period. Mistletoe nests had lower DSR than <b>nests</b> placed elsewhere <b>in</b> the canopy. Mistletoe abundance and nest height had a positive association with DSR whereas visibility distance, microclimate and concealment were negatively associated with DSR.

40|$|I studied coots nesting at semipermanent and {{seasonal}} wetlands near Flagstaff, Arizona. Coot <b>nests</b> <b>in</b> bulrush (at the semipermanent wetland) were spaced closer together than <b>nests</b> <b>in</b> spikerush (at seasonal and semipermanent wetlands). Nests {{were much more}} successful in bulrush at the semipermanent wetland than in spikerush at seasonal wetlands. Coots <b>nesting</b> <b>in</b> bulrush laid larger eggs than coots <b>nesting</b> <b>in</b> spikerush. However, coots <b>nesting</b> <b>in</b> spikerush at seasonal wetlands laid larger clutches than coots <b>nesting</b> <b>in</b> bulrush at the semipermanent wetland. Better nesting success was related to better vegetative concealment of the nest from crows and ravens. Smaller territories and larger eggs among <b>nests</b> <b>in</b> bulrush were related to better food resources {{in the vicinity of}} the nest as indicated by a greater abundance and diversity of emerging aquatic insects. Clutches with more eggs, however, did not correspond to nest sites associated with more abundant aquatic insects. I suggest that clutch size might have been influenced by some aspect of nutrients stored prior to egg-laying which were not necessarily gained from resources on the territory. In general, <b>in</b> areas where <b>nests</b> were more closely spaced (e. g., bulrush) clutches contained fewer eggs than <b>in</b> areas where <b>nests</b> were spaced further apart (e. g., spikerush at seasonal wetlands) indicating the amount of energy expended by the female on the defense of territories might also affect clutch size...|$|R
5|$|These dainty birds {{resemble}} Old World warblers {{in their}} build and habits, moving restlessly through the foliage seeking insects.

5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the <b>nest.</b> <b>In</b> most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that <b>nest</b> <b>in</b> the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E

5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations.

They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally <b>nest</b> <b>in</b> tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid <b>nest</b> <b>in</b> Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
