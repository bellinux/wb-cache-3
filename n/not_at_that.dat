5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} {{to drive out}} the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and {{to prevent him from}} defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E
5|$|From 1967, a {{place in}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was awarded to the Football League Cup winners, but that season's winners, Queens Park Rangers, could not take up their place because UEFA did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time allow third-tier teams to compete in the Fairs Cup. When the same {{situation}} arose two years later with Swindon Town, a two-legged match against that year's Coppa Italia winners, A.S. Roma, was organised by way of compensation. Following the popularity of that event, dubbed the Anglo-Italian League Cup, and as a way to generate income to pay players' wages during the extended close season caused by the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the first Anglo-Italian Cup was inaugurated in 1970.|$|E
5|$|With the ephors vanquished, Cleomenes {{initiated}} his reforms. First, {{he handed}} over his {{land to the}} state; he was soon followed by his stepfather and his friends, {{and then by the}} rest of the citizens. He divided up all of the Spartan land, awarding an equal lot to each citizen. He increased the citizen population by granting citizenship to some perioeci, who constituted the Spartan middle class, but did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time have Spartan citizenship. Expanding the citizen population meant that Cleomenes could build a larger army; he trained 4,000 hoplites and restored the old Spartan social and military discipline. He also strengthened his army by introducing the Macedonian sarissa (pike). Cleomenes completed his reforms by placing his brother, Eucleidas, in charge, making him the first Agiad king on the Eurypontid throne.|$|E

5|$|Alister Murdoch {{was born}} on 9 December 1912 in Elsternwick, Victoria, the son of {{engineer}} Thomas Murdoch and his wife Kathleen. A lieutenant in the Commonwealth Military Forces {{at the time of}} Alister's birth, Thomas was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in World WarI, and rose to the rank of brigardier as Director General of Engineer Services in World WarII. Educated at Caulfield Grammar School, Alister entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1929, following his elder brother Ian (later a major general). Alister was one of four cadets sponsored that year by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> stage have its own officer training college. Budgetary constraints imposed during the Great Depression necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four-year course. Although offered positions in the Australian Public Service or nominations for short-term commissions with the Royal Air Force, all were determined to serve with the RAAF and were more than pleased with the prospect of entering their chosen service early.|$|E
5|$|In 1093 a Benedictine abbey was {{established}} {{on the site}} by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, {{with the assistance of}} StAnselm and other monks from Bec in Normandy. The earliest surviving parts of the structure date from that time. The abbey church was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time the cathedral of Chester; from 1075 to 1082 the cathedral of the diocese was the nearby church of StJohn the Baptist, after which the see was transferred to Coventry. In 1538, during the dissolution of the monasteries, the monastery was disbanded and the shrine of SaintWerburgh was desecrated. In 1541 StWerburgh's abbey became a cathedral of the Church of England, by order of HenryVIII. At the same time, the dedication was changed to Christ and the Blessed Virgin. The last abbot of StWerburgh’s Abbey, Thomas Clarke, became the first dean of the new cathedral, {{at the head of a}} secular chapter.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a benefactor {{during the}} period of reconstruction. He became {{frustrated}} that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him {{under the terms of the}} Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{resuming}} his naval duties, Scott {{revealed to}} the Royal Geographical Society his intention to return to Antarctica, but the information was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> stage made public. Scott was forestalled by Shackleton, who early in 1907 announced his plans to lead an expedition with the twin objectives of reaching the geographic and magnetic South Poles. Under duress, Shackleton agreed not to work from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, {{unable to find a}} safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. His expedition was highly successful, its southern march ending at 88°23′, less than 100 geographical miles from the South Pole, while its northern party reached the location of the South Magnetic Pole. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as a liar and a rogue.|$|E
5|$|While Parke's {{conviction}} cleared Euston, another {{trial began}} on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, {{was charged with}} obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty {{to one of the}} six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges. On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison, which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.|$|E
