After his arrest, X-rays {{revealed}} that Fish had at least 29 needles lodged in his pelvic region. He also hit himself repeatedly with a nail-studded paddle and inserted wool doused with lighter fluid into his anus and set it alight. While he was <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have physically attacked or abused his children, he did encourage them and their friends to paddle his buttocks with the same nail-studded paddle he used to abuse himself.

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Captain of the Guard {{declared}} his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, saying to the duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there {{that this was the}} reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off the order of St. George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they saw all the King's archers under Mr. Cheyney {{at the door of the}} prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods.|$|E

2500|$|In 1806, {{they took}} a first step by hiring Ferdinand Hassler. Hassler, a Swiss {{mathematician}} and geodetic surveyor who was noted {{for his work on}} a topograpic survey of Switzerland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1805, two years after the French invaded his country and made his work there impossible. Through the auspices of a merchant friend with friends in New York, in the spring of 1806, the Common Council commissioned Hassler to make an accurate map of Manhattan Island, which {{could be used as a}} basis for planning future development; it would be Hassler's first substantial contract in the U.S. He accepted the job, and the terms: $5 per day for Hassler (...) , $4 dollars a day for his assistant (...) , and $1 per day for expenses (...) , plus a budget sufficient to hire a surveying crew. He was scheduled to depart from Philadelphia in July, in time for at least part of the 1806 surveying season, but never appeared. Finally, in October, he sent his regrets: both he and his wife had taken ill on the day they intended to leave. Why they didn't send word earlier, why Hassler didn't press on at some point before October, and why the Common Council <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> inquire of the whereabouts of their missing surveyor is not known. In any case, by October, the surveying season for 1806 was over, or close to it.

2500|$|In this situation, {{several groups}} {{belonging}} to four different circles (the royal court, the antifascist parties, the fascism {{and the general}} Staff) started {{to look for a}} way out. Aristocrats such as Crown Princess Maria José, members of the upper classes and politicians belonging to the pre-Fascist elites, independently started plots aiming at establishing contacts with the Allies. Unfortunately, none of them understood that the war had become ideological with the declaration of Casablanca stating that the Allies would only accept unconditional surrender. [...] Moreover, despite the Crown Princess' involvement, the Anglo-Americans expected a move from higher-placed personalities, like the King, and disregarded contacts with these groups. The antifascist parties, weakened by 20 years of dictatorship, were still in an embryonic state. Moreover, all except the communists and the republicans of the Partito d’Azione waited for a signal from Victor Emmanuel, but in vain: the King's character, realist and skeptical at the same time, his fears, his constitutional scruples, {{and the fact that the}} monarchy was almost certainly finished regardless of how the war turned out contributed to his inaction. The King had considerable contempt towards the old pre-Fascist politicians, whom he ironically called [...] "revenants" [...] ("ghosts" [...] in French) and didn't entirely trust those who claimed that the Anglo-Americans would not seek to exact revenge upon Italy. Last but not least, Victor Emmanuel retained his trust in Mussolini, and he hoped that the Duce could save the situation once again. Consequently, the King kept his own counsel and isolated himself from all those who tried to learn his intentions. Among them was the new Chief of the General Staff, General Vittorio Ambrosio, a Piemontese, [...] "not of high intelligence", but devoted to the King and hostile to the Germans. Ambrosio was persuaded that the war was lost for Italy, but he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> take a personal initiative to change the situation without first consulting with Victor Emmanuel. On the other side Ambrosio, helped by his right-hand man, Giuseppe Castellano, and by Giacomo Carboni (both of whom would play key roles in the happenings which would lead to the armistice of 8 September 1943), slowly proceeded to occupy several key positions in the armed forces with officials devoted to the king. Moreover, he tried to bring back to Italy as many forces as possible among those which were abroad, but it was difficult to do that without raising the suspicions of the Germans.|$|E

2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who we are as a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors." [...] "we also feel a measure of distance between us and most churches in the denomination".|$|E
