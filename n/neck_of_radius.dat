40|$|Background: Variations in the {{vascular}} {{pattern of}} the upper limb are common in Indian population. Brachial artery {{is a continuation of}} axillary artery, it divides into its terminal branches namely radial and ulnar arteries at the level of <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> in the cubital fossa. In the present case, brachial artery bifurcated at its commencement below the lower border of teres major. Both the terminal branches, ulnar and radial artery had superficial course along the medial aspect of biceps brachii. In the cubital fossa, radial artery gave off common interosseous artery. In the forearm, radial artery had more superficial course than ulnar artery. Knowledge of these variations is important during vascular and re-constructive surgery and also in evaluation of angiographic images. Superficial position of ulnar and radial artery makes it more vulnerable to trauma and more accessible to cannulation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{brachial artery}} begins as the {{continuation}} of 3 rd part of axillary artery at the distal border of teres major muscle.

Context & purpose of study: The present study was done on 30 cadavers in department of anatomy to find out any variations in division pattern of the brachial artery.

There was a high origin of the radial artery from axillary artery found in right upper limb of one cadaver.

Results: An unusually short segment of brachial artery in the right arm which bifurcated 21. 5 cm above the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> at the level of insertion of coracobrachialis which bifurcated into radial and ulnar arteries of same calibre with high origin of radial artery. no other variation was found in relation to the cords of brachial plexus and their branches. dissection of left upper limb revealed no unusual observation. Conclusion: This could pose a challenging problem to vascular surgeons while performing reconstructive procedures. Itcan be evaluated by vascular mapping prior to an arteriovenous access creation.

40|$|The {{brachial artery}} {{is the main}} artery of the arm. It begins as the {{continuation}} of 3 rd part of axillary artery, {{at the level of}} inferior border of teres major muscle.

In the present study we found higher division of brachial artery at mid arm level into its terminal branches with superficial course of radial artery.

In the present study, a total number of 51 cadaver’s, 102 upper limbs were studied. In one male cadaver we found bilateral higher division of brachial artery, trifurcation on left side and bifurcation on right side brachial artery, with superficial course of radial artery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Radial neck {{fractures}} are {{a common}} injury in children {{as a result of}} a fall on an extended and supinated outstretched hand. METHODS: We present 2 cases of osteotomy <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radius</b> performed in 2 children with neglected radial neck fractures. RESULTS: Preoperatively, both patients complained of pain and severely reduced mobility of the elbow.

Osteotomies healed within the usual time and no avascular necrosis of the radial head, proximal radioulnar synostosis, or myositis ossificans were observed.

For non-ferrous metals, fatigue results in the deterioration of a material after a prolonged stress {{has been applied to}} it and the number of cycles to failure depends on the stresses applied.

An estimated endurance limit of 85 MPa was extrapolated from a curve fit, based on a number of cycles to failure of 5 x 108. Finally, a comparison was made to the known endurance limit and comparisons were made to number of cycles to failure (N) based on errors in the measured <b>neck</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the test specimen.

40|$|Background: Metal {{prostheses}} {{are useful}} for restoring elbow and forearm stability when the radial head cannot be fixed after a fracture. Because the anatomy of the radial head is difficult to reproduce with a prosthesis, two different options have been proposed: a bipolar prosthesis with a fixed stem and a mobile head, and a monoblock prosthesis with a smooth stem that is intentionally fixed loosely in the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radius.</b> One concern with a fixed-stem implant with a mobile head has been the risk of osteolysis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate radiographic changes reflecting or suggesting progressive osteolysis in patients with a bipolar radial head prosthesis. Methods: The functional and radiographic outcomes following treatment of fifty-one comminuted fractures of the ra-dial head with a bipolar radial head prosthesis in fifty-one consecutive patients were evaluated at a mean of 8. 4 years postoperatively. There were eleven isolated comminuted fractures involving the entire radial head. Thirty-four fractures were associated with a posterior elbow dislocation, and six patients had a posterior Monteggia lesion. Results: According to the Mayo Elbow Performance Index, fourteen elbows were graded as excellent; twenty-five, as good; nine, as fair; and three, as poor.

40|$|We create {{air bubbles}} {{at the tip}} of a “bathtub vortex” which reaches to a finite depth. The bathtub vortex is formed by letting water drain through a small hole {{at the bottom of a}} {{rotating}} cylindrical container.

Using high-speed imaging we find that the minimal <b>neck</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the unstable tip decreases in time as a power law with an exponent close to 1 / 3. This exponent was found by Gordillo et al. [Phys. Rev.

We argue that the Bernoulli pressure reduction caused by this air flow can become sufficient to overcome the centrifugal forces and cause the final pinch-off...|$|R
40|$|Typically, the {{radial artery}} arises as a branch from the brachial artery {{at the level}} <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radius</b> in the distal antecubital fossa. Anatomical {{variations}} in the radial artery are relatively common. Published literature demonstrates a wide variability in the prevalence of high originating radial artery (0. 5 - 14. 27 %). The literature also shows inconsistent and vague nomenclature when describing the arterial system in cases of high originating radial artery. This study aims to investigate the incidence of a high originating radial artery in vivo {{through the use of}} ultrasound. It goes on to propose a classification system utilising precise nomenclature to help in discriminating between the various patterns. METHODS. Fifty-four upper limbs from 27 individuals were investigated using GE LOGIQ e and SonoSite MicroMaxx ultrasound machines with 12 L-RS & A L 38 e 10 - 5 MHz transducer respectively. The radial artery was initially identified and followed proximally to its origin and then distally to the wrist noting its course and relationships to other anatomical structures. SUMMARY. High originating radial arteries were found unilaterally in 4 individuals (4 / 54, 7. 4 %). CONCLUSION. Variations in the anatomical course and relationships of the radial artery are pertinent to surgeons, radiologists and anatomists. The presence of a high originating radial artery has both clinical and surgically significance in procedures, such as arterial grafting and cardiac catheterization. Due to its superficial course, it is more vulnerable to injury due to trauma or during cannulation and drug administration. Bedside ultrasound techniques can not only be of benefit in identifying variations prior to such procedures but also for future anatomical studies...|$|R
