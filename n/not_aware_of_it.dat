5|$|Areobindus {{was murdered}} by Guntharic, but Artabanes secured {{guarantees}} of his safety and pledged himself to Guntharic's service. In secret, however, he began planning to overthrow him. Soon after, Artabanes was entrusted, alongside John and Ulitheus, with an expedition against Antalas's Moors. He marched south, along with an allied Moorish contingent under Cutzinas. Antalas's men fled before him, but Artabanes did not pursue them and turned back. According to Procopius, he considered leading his men to join the loyalist imperial garrison that held out at Hadrumetum under Marcentius, but {{decided to return to}} Carthage and go on with his plan to assassinate Guntharic. Artabanes kept his plan in absolute secrecy for a long time, confiding only with his two closest Armenian friends: even his Armenian unit of hand-picked and completely loyal veteran soldiers was <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> until the very last moment. Such a perfect concealment was achieved, not least thanks to the fact that during both planning and implementation stages of this assassination the communication between the exclusively Armenian conspirators was in their mother tongue, an incomprehensible language for other ethnic elements of the imperial army in Africa.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt's {{physicians}} {{never mentioned}} Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, {{indicating that they}} were <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as a diagnostic possibility. All reports before 1921 {{of what is now}} called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio. In 1921, an American physician would assume that if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic flaccid paralysis, it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.|$|E

He further stated that the past can bring people [...] "down a road" [...] because they are <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> According to him, [...] "The time spent with a father will teach you a certain understanding of live and how to cope and deal with things. The lack of a father being there can also {{teach you how to}} deal with life – and that’s what 'Sins Of The Father' is about... That statement was made because that’s something that I felt." [...] Usher added that the song itself is a [...] "kind of testament" [...] for the father he is.|$|E

Company commanders Veniamin Solovyov, Anastasy Kuzmin and Mikhail Schepilo were active members of the United Slavs. The regiment was literally infested with rebel officers at all levels. Rebel officers also infiltrated nearby Aktyrka, Alexopol, Kremenchug and Poltava regiments although to a lesser extent. Muravyov-Apostol counted on [...] "allied" [...] units stationed in Zhitomir and Brusyliv in the west and in Bila Tserkva to the south, although in real life these units remained on the government's side.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression.

2500|$|Multiracial Americans make up 2.1% of New York City's population. According to the survey, {{there were}} 177,643 multiracial Americans {{residing}} in New York City. People {{of black and}} white ancestry numbered at 37,124, making up 0.4% of the population. People of white and Asian ancestry numbered at 22,242, making up 0.3% of the population. People of white/Native American ancestry (10,762) and black/Native American ancestry (10,221) each made up 0.1% of the city's population. [...] The term [...] "Multiracial American", however, can be very misleading. [...] For example, many people of Latin American background may have various racial ancestries. [...] Furthermore, there are many Americans who have multiple racial ancestries who are <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Therefore, the actual numbers are likely much higher.|$|E
2500|$|The System Lords are not {{a unified}} body and {{frequently}} war against each other for dominance, though they will ally {{in the face of}} mutual threats. One of the main strategies of both the Tok'ra and the Asgard is to play the System Lords against one another, so that no single one of them becomes too powerful to topple. The System Lords employ elite, highly dangerous Goa'uld assassins known as Ash'raks, who have been known to use stealth devices to become invisible, and wield a device called a hara'kesh that serves as a weapon, an interrogation device, and an instrument of torture. The System Lords can also turn captured enemies into assassins called za'tarcs, using mind control to implant dormant commands hidden by false memories. People who are turned into za'tarcs are <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> until their programming activates. A System Lord's most trusted servant and confidant is called a lo'taur, a human slave who {{can be used as a}} host in an emergency. Some of these loyal humans serve willingly for the chance of one day experiencing the [...] "pleasures" [...] of being a Goa'uld host.|$|E

2500|$|Dvořák {{displayed}} {{his musical}} gifts {{at an early}} age, being an apt violin student from age six. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was aged 31. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he first submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, {{but he did not}} win, and the manuscript, not returned, was lost until rediscovered many decades later. Then in 1874 he first made a submission for the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works. Although Dvořák was <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvořák for 1874 and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, {{also a member of the}} jury, made themselves known to him. [...] Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances, Op. 46. These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvořák's international reputation at last was launched.|$|E
2500|$|On The O'Reilly Factor and on {{his former}} talk-radio program, O'Reilly focused on news and {{commentary}} related to politics and culture. O'Reilly has long said {{that he does not}} identify with any political ideology, writing in his book The O'Reilly Factor that the reader [...] "might be wondering whether I'm conservative, liberal, libertarian, or exactly what... See, I don't want to fit any of those labels, because I believe that the truth doesn't have labels. When I see corruption, I try to expose it. When I see exploitation, I try to fight it. That's my political position." [...] On December 6, 2000, the Daily News in New York reported, however, that he had been registered with the Republican Party in the state of New York since 1994. When questioned about this, {{he said that he was}} <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and says he registered as an independent after the interview. During a broadcast of The Radio Factor, O'Reilly said that there was no option to register as an independent voter; however, there was in fact a box marked [...] "I do not wish to enroll in party." [...] Despite his being registered as an Independence Party member, many view him as a conservative figure. A February 2009 Pew Research poll found that 66% of his television viewers identify themselves as conservative, 24% moderate, and 3% liberal. A November 2008 poll by Zogby International found that O'Reilly was the second most trusted news personality, after Rush Limbaugh.|$|E
