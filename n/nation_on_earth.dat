The political geography of the time is dramatically different from our own world, and innovations such as the airplane and combustion engine are only beginning to reach prominence. The Angrezi Raj (formerly the British Empire), centered in its former colonies in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, is the most powerful <b>nation</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> It stands alongside other surviving world powers, including France-outre-mer (a European-settled North Africa), the Caliphate of Damascus (a united Middle East), the Empire of Dai-Nippon (a Japanese-ruled China and Far East), and the Russian Empire (a remnant of the original, now located in central Asia).|$|E

2500|$|Following the [...] Allies' {{victory over}} Germany and Japan in 1945, the Soviet Union became the sole superpower rival to the United States.

By the early 1980s the Soviet armed forces had more troops, tanks, artillery guns and nuclear weapons than any other <b>nation</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth.</b> The Soviet Union fell in 1991, not because of military defeat but because of economic and political factors - see History of the Soviet Union (1982–91).|$|E
2500|$|The {{nations in}} the Darkness series do not have {{randomly}} invented names for their people and locations.

[...] For example, Unkerlant has Germanic (German, Low German, and Frankish) place and personal names. Forthweg has a Germanic language, Old English. Similarly, the Algarvic nations all speak Latin-derived languages: Algarve speaks Italian, Lagoas has Portuguese, and Sibiu Romanian. Kaunian languages are based on modern Baltic languages - Lithuanian is Classical Kaunian and Latvian for Valmerian and Jelgavian.|$|E

The gathering, which was hosted by Anthony Eisley, a star of ABC's Hawaiian Eye series, sought to flood the United States Congress with letters in support of school prayer, following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the United States Supreme Court, which struck down the practice as {{in conflict with the}} Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

2500|$|The {{second stage}} {{began with the}} conquest of Algeria in 1830, then with the {{establishment}} of French Indochina (covering modern Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) and a string of military victories in the Scramble for Africa, where it established control over regions covering much of West Africa, Central Africa and Maghreb. In 1914 France had an empire stretching over 13,000,000km² (6,000,000 mile²) of land and about 110 million people. Following victory in World War I, Togo and most of Cameroon were also added to the French possessions, and Syria and Lebanon became French mandates. For most of the period from 1870 to 1945, France was territorially the third largest <b>nation</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> after Britain and Russia (later the Soviet Union), and had the most overseas possessions following Britain. Following the Second World War, France struggled to preserve French territories but wound up losing [...] the First Indochina War (the precursor to the Vietnam War) and granting independence to Algeria after a long war. Today, France still maintains a number of overseas territories, but their collective size is barely a shadow of the old French colonial empire.|$|E
