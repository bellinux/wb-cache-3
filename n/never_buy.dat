5|$|Customers' {{reactions}} to the merger varied. Most of the public understood {{the need for the}} merger of two small companies, which were both operating in a very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers. Some loyal Vanaja customers were astounded at the decision to discontinue the make. Some customers were upset because the last long-nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from Jyry-Sisu; they said they would <b>never</b> <b>buy</b> Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus. The drop in the truck market was short-lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus.|$|E
2500|$|Fund {{governance}} providers {{range from}} limited-resourced, proprietorships of part-time directors (or so-called ‘boutique’ firms) to fully resourced professional services firms of full-time directors, “organized similarly to large law or accounting firms”. In {{many parts of}} the world, serving as a fund director remains a cottage industry [...] where proponents argue that fund governance is different from the other services provided to the fund and not adaptable to the professional firm approach. [...] This mindset appears to be supported by the law in several jurisdictions that mandate that only “natural persons” provide director services. Opponents [...] of the proprietor approach argue that boards should not be “dominated by part-timers {{at a time when they}} need to be vigilant about avoiding future crises” and that professional funds “would <b>never</b> <b>buy</b> legal services or management advice from people only willing to spare a few hours a month”.|$|E
2500|$|Animal welfare {{charities}} and campaigners, and vegan and vegetarian groups also joined {{to support the}} case against the dairy. [...] A Facebook group set up by Viva! calling for a halt to construction attracted over 7,500 members. WSPA (now called WAP) launched a campaign in September 2010 in anticipation of the resubmission of Nocton Dairies' proposal, featuring celebrities including Twiggy, Andrew Sachs, Chrissie Hynde, Jenny Seagrove and a large number of soap stars, and attracted over 25,000 pledges from people around the world that 'factory milk from battery cows' would not be used in their cuppas. The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released at the launch showed that 61% of those questioned said they would <b>never</b> <b>buy</b> milk produced in large-scale indoor dairy sheds. Compassion in World Farming's [...] campaign was launched late 2010, and the CPRE also campaigned on the issue. [...] As well as this, a campaign was set up through site 38 Degrees who submitted a petition of over 50,000 signatures to the district council in January 2011 on the basis that the farm was cruel and would put other farmers out of business. [...] 38 Degrees also singled out neighbouring farmers who had been keen to use the 'digestate' (left from the cow manure after anaerobic digestion had taken place) on their arable land as a more sustainable and natural source of fertilisers and to replace essential organic matter. [...] These farmers pulled out of their agreements due to fear of reprisals after being named in adverts which urged the public to target them directly.|$|E

Among this group of respondents, the top reasons for purchasing are freshness, good taste and favourable prices. Only a small share of Lithuanian consumers rarely or <b>never</b> <b>buys</b> domestic livestock products. Among this group of respondents, the top reasons for not purchasing are unfavourable prices, short shelf-life and insufficient range of products. Domestic livestock products buyers tend to be older, higher educated and have higher level of income than non-buyers...|$|R
