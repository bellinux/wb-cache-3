Systematic, historical, comparative methods and futurological approach were used for preparation of this material. Information and empirical base has been developed on the basis of scientific generalizations present in the research of domestic and foreign scientists. The study and comprehension of these materials allow to make the conclusion that significant changes will affect the political and social organizations of the society, principles of organization of power and governance of the society, and will be associated with the formation of new rules of mutual relations within the society.   The article analyzes the information-networking structure of the forming society, discusses the forms of interaction between the new elite – the <b>netocracy</b> – and ordinary citizens.

40|$|Paper’s main {{objective}} is to present main trends concerning re-evaluation of moral responsibility in contemporary netocratic (informative) societies, in which modern solutions in tele-informative technologies, introduced to everyday social practice by netocrats, result in creating new ethics: ethics of <b>netocracy.</b> Those leading trends, concerning moral responsibility, consist of complex processes of institutionalisation on the one hand, and of processes of instrumentalistion on the other. From general reflection on the dimensions and descriptions of responsibility the writer steps {{to the analysis of}} two main fields of social activity, where moral responsibility has significant meaning, e. g. the analysis of responsibility in economic and political activity. Moral responsibility and expected high ethical competences of individuals, acting in the fields of business or politics, are still tested, especially in the crucial relation between liberty and responsibility. The paper also mentions the problem of asymmetry between expectations towards responsible behaviour performed by the others and the lack of responsibility for speech and actions performed. Moreover, multiplicative character of contemporary teleinforamative means, supported by exercise of advanced techniques of influence onto the others makes the diagnosis stated by the writer significant...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} sociocultural peculiarities of conceptions of {{innovation}} and modernization. Different models of modernization – westernization, overtaking modernization, organic­innovative modernization, non­organic­mobilization modernization, combining modernization – are showed.

Signed that diversification of innovation and modernization are observing during transferring from Modern to Postmodern with its postutopism, postmetaphysics, posthumanism, critics of onto­theo­teleo­fallus­logos­centrism, and in social sphere – postcapitalism, <b>netocracy,</b> crisis of traditional institutes. Postmodern tendencies in education – appearance of phenomenon such net anti­pedagogics of I. Illich etc. Complexity of innovative processes in contemporary world is due to global transferring processes. Among of them: transferring from capitalism to postcapitalism or neofeudalism – power of transnational corporations or corporacracy.
