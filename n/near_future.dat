5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the <b>near</b> <b>future.</b> At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the <b>near</b> <b>future.</b> A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E

Several FLT3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials, with mixed results.

40|$|We posit that {{compared}} to the cognitive system, the affective system of judgment and decision making is relatively more engaged in the present. Specifically, we hypothesize that even if their accessibility is held constant, affective feelings are weighted more heavily in consumer judgments and decisions set in the present than in equivalent judgments and decisions set in the future or in the past. Consistent with this proposition, results from six experiments show that (a) compared to a more distant <b>future,</b> a <b>nearer</b> <b>future</b> increases consumers’ relative preferences for options that are superior in terms of integral affect over options that are cognitively superior; (b) compared to a more distant <b>future,</b> a <b>nearer</b> <b>future</b> also increases the influence of incidental moods on consumers’ evaluation; (c) consumers find the reliance on feelings more “natural” in decisions set in a <b>nearer</b> <b>future</b> than in decisions set in a more distant future; and (d) compared to a more distant past, a more recent past also increases the influence of incidental moods on consumers’ evaluations...|$|R
