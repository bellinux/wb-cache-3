40|$|Abstract. This chapter {{describes}} how the adaptive web technologies discussed in this book have been applied to <b>news</b> <b>access.</b> First, we {{provide an overview of}} different types of adaptivity in the context of <b>news</b> <b>access</b> and identify corresponding algorithms. For each adaptivity type, we briefly discuss representative systems that use the described techniques. Next, we discuss an in-depth case study of a personalized news system. As part of this study, we outline a user modeling approach specifically designed for news personalization, and present results from an evaluation that attempts to quantify the effect of adaptive <b>news</b> <b>access</b> from a user perspective. We conclude by discussing recent trends and novel systems in the adaptive news space. The World Wide Web has {{had a profound impact on}} our everyday lives: we routinely rely on it as a ubiquitous source for timely information. In particular, the web’s realtime and on-demand characteristics make it an ideal medium for <b>news</b> <b>access</b> anywhere and anytime. As a result, virtually every news organization now has a presenc...|$|E

This case study approach not only helps to map a hitherto unexplored form of television journalism but also throws into sharp relief professional news practices that inform the production of television news more generally. As such, it addresses an important silence in the conventional theorisation of <b>news</b> <b>access</b> and invites a more complex and culturally differentiated understanding of, and future approach to, news production and processes of professional mediation. Key words: News forms, imagined audiences, professional mediation, <b>news</b> <b>access...</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, cable {{television}} has expanded Americans ’ choices for televised news substantially. This paper examines whether {{access to a}} more conservative news source— the Fox News cable channel—influences vote intentions. According to prior media effects research, the most likely impact of Fox <b>News</b> <b>access</b> is to reinforce voters ’ predispositions and thus to polarize public opinion. To test that possibility with individual-level data, we identify local Fox News availability for 22, 592 respondents to the 2000 National Annenberg Election Survey. Using aggregate-level voting data, DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) finds a pro-Republican effect of Fox <b>News</b> <b>access</b> that is largest in Democratic communities. In contrast, we find an average treatment effect indistinguishable from zero. Yet we also find a sizable effect on the vote intentions of Republicans and pure independents. Consistent with {{a long tradition of}} media effects studies, access to Fox News reinforces Republican loyalties without persuading Democrats to vote against their party...|$|E
40|$|News {{media are}} {{considered}} to be facilitators of the democratic process that disseminate reliable and high quality information. Yet, traditional media brands increasingly embody economic considerations. The British investigative journalist Nick Davies takes a black view of the journalistic profession in the 21 st century. In his famous book Flat Earth News (2008) he describes how journalists increasingly produce more content with less resources. Ample studies have empirically demonstrated the tendency of ‘churnalism’ or the mounting use of pre-packaged content – and especially press releases - to reduce the costs of news production. Most studies have moreover shown that public relations mainly benefit mainstream actors in terms of <b>news</b> <b>access</b> (Curtin, 1999; Lewis et al., 2006, 2008 a; McManus, 1994). Yet, this approach of journalist-source relations is increasingly criticised in the context of (digital) network communication, globalisation and glocalisation, and the rise of a global civil society (Castells, 2008). Moreover, journalists seem to be less reluctant towards pre-packaged news of ‘advocates of the public interest’ such as non-governmental organisations (NGO) or citizens (Curtin, 1999; Machill, Beiler and Schmutz, 2006; Reich, 2011). Few studies however examined whether public relations activities result in more <b>news</b> <b>access</b> for these non-mainstream actors. Therefore, we set up a content analysis to study how and how far press releases of the Flemish department of the international NGO Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) are adopted in the foreign coverage of four Flemish newspapers (1995 - 2010) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the impact of {{cost-cutting}} and digitalization on the expansion or contraction of the mediated public sphere, we developed a quantitative and longitudinal content analysis focused on sourcing practices for foreign news reporting in four Belgian newspapers (1995 - 2010). The results show little to no shift in the <b>news</b> <b>access</b> of different types of sources. Political sources dominate foreign news output, but ordinary citizens also play a significant role. Although it becomes clear that Belgian journalists often do not explicitly mention their use of news agency copy, recycled news articles or PR material, our findings indicate that concerns about cost-cutting in newsrooms or sanguinity about the democratic potential of Web 2. 0 seem fairly exaggerated, at least in the Belgian context...|$|E

30|$|The {{popularity}} of mobile devices is undeniable. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), more smartphones {{were sold in}} 2012 than desktop and laptop computers combined [1]. Their popularity may be attributed in part to their increasing functionality – technological advances in computing have allowed smartphones to become increasingly powerful, which in turn supports greater functionality. Smartphones offer {{a wide range of}} capabilities, such as email account <b>access,</b> <b>news</b> updates, <b>access</b> to the Internet and device location via GPS. As a result of their increased (and increasing) functionality, smartphones are able to access and store personally identifying information. Potentially private data such as medical details, sensitive business information, personal pictures and voicemails have been recovered from mobile devices, despite being deleted [2]. This confirms that users do indeed store these kinds of data on their devices.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the impact of cost-cutting, {{digitalization}} and globalisation on journalistic sourcing practices, we report the results of a large-scale and longitudinal survey among Flemish journalists. The findings show that pre-packaged content from a journalistic (news agencies and media brands) and non-journalistic origin (press releases), and elite actors (politicians, government institutions, experts, journalists and corporations) are important information sources. In contrast with often heard complaints about unequal <b>news</b> <b>access,</b> the findings nonetheless show that Flemish journalists acknowledge the importance of ordinary citizens and NGOs as news sources. The responses to the questionnaire moreover point to the development of new sourcing practices: Flemish journalists are increasingly turning towards social media in the news gathering process but overall the importance of Facebook, Twitter and the like as a news source remains fairly limited...|$|E
40|$|The average news {{consumer}} in the United States {{has never}} had as many choices for news consumption as now. Technological advances have allowed them to access the news on multiple devices such as computers, smartphones, e-readers, and/or tablets. This study empirically examined whether multiplatform news consumption is a reality {{and the extent to}} which people own, use, and enjoy multiple electronic devices. Data was collected via a web-based survey from a random sample of the American adult population in August 2010. The results suggested that, despite the excitement about newer, more portable devices, the computer still is the dominant day-to-day electronic platform for <b>news</b> <b>access,</b> and most people use only one electronic device for news purposes on a weekly basis. We identified the predictors of device ownership and multiplatform news consumption. Managerial implications are discussed. ...|$|E

In accordance with the distinction, already drawn in 1997, between push and pull technologies as two different forms of how content is delivered to the end users, cellphones are characterized as push devices (passive reception), in opposition to computers, classified as pull devices (active reception). The news items that fit cellphones are pushed news. And they will be pushed as SMS, e-mails, tweets and through news aggregators. <br /...|$|E
