5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear <b>night</b> <b>you</b> would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

He commented that: All my time here was spent in heaving dead bodies into the mass graves kindly dug for us by 'outside workers' for we no longer had the strength for that type of work which, fortunately, must have been observed by the camp authorities. Jungle law reigned among the prisoners; at <b>night</b> <b>you</b> killed or were killed; by day cannibalism was rampant.|$|E

If {{you start to}} break it then people aren't going to go. I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance.

[...] He attributed his ability to keep playing during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.|$|E

[...] Not all reviews were positive. Some critics considered the photography style of jump cuts and hand-held camera movement too jarring; some said it made them feel seasick. James Endrst, television columnist for The Hartford Courant, felt the episode was over-hyped and said [...] "seen it, done it, been there before" [...] of the filming techniques otherwise being praised as cutting edge. Endrst, however, praised the performances of Braugher, Belzer, Polito and Secor in particular. Time reviewer Richard Zoglin said the episode had a strong cast and that he appreciated the lack of two-dimensional violence, but said, [...] "the characters are too pat, their conflicts too predictable", particularly the rookie character Bayliss.|$|E

500|$|Mulholland Drive {{has been}} {{compared}} with Billy Wilder's film noir classic Sunset Boulevard (1950), another tale about broken dreams in Hollywood, and early in the film Rita is shown crossing Sunset Boulevard at night. Apart from both titles being named after iconic Los Angeles streets, Mulholland Drive is [...] "Lynch's unique account of what held Wilder's attention too: human putrefaction (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) {{in a city of}} lethal illusions". The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, [...] "At <b>night,</b> <b>you</b> ride {{on the top of the}} world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road."

[...] He also tells her to change into a different outfit that he has in the trunk of the car she is driving. [...] Scully reluctantly changes her clothing. [...] The Shadow Man then comes face-to-face with Scully and destroys the vehicle Scully had been driving with a remotely detonated bomb. Scully questions him about how he knows her clothing size.

You could not help but stand up. Even Prince Charles stood up." [...] It was Roger Moore's favourite Bond film, and many reviewers consider it the best installment to star the actor. Christopher Null praised the gadgets, particularly the Lotus Esprit car. James Berardinelli of Reelviews said that the film is [...] "suave and sophisticated", and Barbara Bach proves to be an ideal Bond girl – [...] "attractive, smart, sexy, and dangerous". Brian Webster stated the special effects were [...] "good for a 1979 [...] film", and Marvin Hamlisch's music, [...] "memorable". Danny Peary described The Spy Who Loved Me as [...] "exceptional... For once, the big budget was not wasted. Interestingly, while the sets and gimmicks were the most spectacular to date, Bond and the other characters are toned down (there's a minimum of slapstick humour) so that they are more realistic than in other Roger Moore films. Moore gives his best performance in the series... are an appealing couple, equal in every way. Film is a real treat – a well acted, smartly cast, sexy, visually impressive, lavishly produced, powerfully directed mix of a spy romance and a war-mission film." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times considered the film formulaic and [...] "half an hour too long, thanks to the obligatory shoot-'em-up conclusion,... nevertheless the dullest sequence here" [...] but praised Moore's performance and the film's [...] "share of self-mockery", which she found refreshing.|$|E
