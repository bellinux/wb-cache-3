50|$|Security Level 4 {{cryptographic}} modules {{are useful}} for operation in physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental conditions or fluctuations outside of the module's <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a cryptographic module's defenses. A cryptographic module is required to either include special environmental protection features designed to detect fluctuations and delete CSPs, or to undergo rigorous environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> range {{in a manner that}} can compromise the security of the module.|$|R
