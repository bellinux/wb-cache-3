After they passed on the pilot, it was made available online through iTunes in the United States and became the number-one most downloaded television show on iTunes. It received generally favorable reviews, was later released on other online markets, and aired on Canadian television network YTV.|$|E

Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E

5|$|In a {{flashback}} to 1990, Bart {{goes to his}} first day of school, but things do not go so well for him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge {{that they need to}} nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Murdoch {{announced}} that he was moving News Corporation headquarters from Adelaide, Australia to the United States.

25|$|Political {{pressure}} Russia to Ukraine {{during the}} gas conflict {{led to the}} emergence of a public campaign to boycott Russian goods in Ukraine.

Then various social and political movements in Ukraine picked up the idea, which got wide publicity and support.|$|E
25|$|Around 1933, some 160,000 Jews {{were living}} in Berlin: one third of all German Jews, 4% of the Berlin population.

25|$|To {{capitalise}} on publicity surrounding the band's comeback, the re-release record label Music Club issued a hastily compiled double album Tattva : The Very Best Of Kula Shaker on 16 July 2007, which included all the tracks from the band's first two albums {{and a handful}} of previously released non-album tracks. The band had no input into any aspect of the release and their consent was not obtained for its release. They have been asking their fans <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it.|$|E
25|$|As {{the process}} of {{harvesting}} the silk from the cocoon kills the larvae by boiling them, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. Mohandas Gandhi was critical of silk production based on the Ahimsa philosophy which led to promotion of cotton and Ahimsa silk, a type of wild silk made from the cocoons of wild and semi-wild silk moths. Since silk cultivation kills silkworms, possibly painfully, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) urges people <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> silk items.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the Kyoto Protocol {{due to the}} surplus of allowances that some countries possess. For example, Russia had a surplus of allowances due to its economic collapse {{following the end of}} the Soviet Union. Other countries could have bought these allowances from Russia, but this would not have reduced emissions. Rather, it would have been simply be a redistribution of emissions allowances. In practice, Kyoto Parties have as yet chosen <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> these surplus allowances.|$|E

25|$|Since {{releasing}} Those Once Loyal, Earache {{has released}} a remastered {{edition of the}} 1989 album Realm of Chaos featuring alternate artwork of John Sibbick, the artist responsible for the original artwork of both the Warhammer 40,000 Rogue Trader cover and Realm of Chaos - Slaves to Darkness. The band encouraged people <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it as, like Who Dares Wins, it was released without their consultation let alone consent. Furthermore, it has been alleged that the band has not received royalties from Earache {{for a number of}} years.|$|E
25|$|In November 1998, Earache Records {{released}} Who Dares Wins, {{a compilation}} featuring various older recordings, including the Spearhead and Cenotaph EPs. The band members themselves do {{not approve of}} the compilation's release and warn <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it, considering it a cheap cash-in from Earache. Originally, it was titled No Guts - No Glory but the title was changed because one song on Mercenary has the same title and Metal Blade objected. Following the release of Mercenary, the band embarked {{on a tour of}} Europe, called Into the Killing Zone, with Dave Ingram on vocals. Alex Thomas departed since he lacked interest in the musical direction of Bolt Thrower.|$|E
25|$|On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. {{announced}} that after {{an internal investigation}} into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to {{the first quarter of}} 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share. The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted. It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{problems}} typically arise with requirements contracts. The {{first is}} consideration. There would technically be no {{breach of the}} contract if the buyer bought nothing because the buyer is agreeing <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> {{only as much as}} the buyer needs. In the above example, the grocery store might void its obligation <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> from the farmer by deciding <b>not</b> <b>to</b> carry oranges. Courts generally sidestep the concern that the buyer is <b>not</b> actually required <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> anything by noting that the contract is nonetheless the surrender of the right <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> from another party. Put simply, [...] "the buyer under a requirements contract does <b>not</b> promise <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> as much as she desires <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> but, rather, <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> as much as she needs". However, such a contract would likely be deemed illusory if the buyer reserved the right <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> from other parties.|$|R
