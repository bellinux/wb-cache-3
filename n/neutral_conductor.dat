25|$|As {{commonly}} used, 10-30 and 10-50 plugs {{required the}} frame of the appliance to be indirectly grounded via a strap connecting to the neutral blade. Safe operation relied on the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> in turn being connected to system ground at the circuit breaker or fuse box. If the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> were to break, disconnect, or develop high resistance, the appliance frame could become energized to dangerous voltages. Modern practice is to require a separate safety grounding conductor whose only purpose is to divert unsafe voltages, and which does not carry significant current during normal operation.|$|E

25|$|The sense coil (6) is a {{differential}} {{current transformer}} which surrounds (but is not electrically connected to) the live and neutral conductors.

25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor)</b> has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
25|$|Any fault {{to earth}} (for example {{caused by a}} person {{touching}} a live component in the attached appliance) causes some of the current {{to take a different}} return path, which means that there is an imbalance (difference) in the current in the two conductors (single-phase case), or, more generally, a nonzero sum of currents from among various conductors (for example, three phase conductors and one <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor).</b>|$|E
25|$|Polarization is {{maintained}} by the shape, size, or position of plug pins and socket holes and socket recesses {{to ensure that a}} plug fits only one way into a socket. Lamps with screw bases will connect the shell of the lamp socket to the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor.</b> Similarly, the single-pole switch of the appliance is connected in series with the energized wire. However, due to the uncertainty, in practice, of which conductor is the neutral, some appliances contain dual-pole switches which interrupt both conductors.|$|E

25|$|While a MOV is {{designed}} to conduct significant power for very short durations (about 8 to 20 microseconds), such as caused by lightning strikes, it typically {{does not have the}} capacity to conduct sustained energy. Under normal utility voltage conditions, this is not a problem. However, certain types of faults on the utility power grid can result in sustained over-voltage conditions. Examples include a loss of a <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> or shorted lines on the high voltage system. Application of sustained over-voltage to a MOV can cause high dissipation, potentially resulting in the MOV device catching fire. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has documented many cases of catastrophic fires that have been caused by MOV devices in surge suppressors, and has issued bulletins on the issue.|$|E

5000|$|Ring {{circuits}} can occasionally generate unwanted magnetic fields.

2500|$|Relying on the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> was a legal {{grounding}} {{method for}} electric ranges and clothes dryers, under the National Electrical Code from the 1947 to the 1996 editions. Since North American dryers and ranges have certain components (timers, lights, fans, etc.) {{that run on}} 120V, {{this means that the}} neutral wire indirectly used for grounding would also carry current, even under non-fault conditions. Although this is contrary to modern grounding practice, such [...] "grandfathered" [...] installations remain common in older homes in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120Â° (one-third of a complete 360Â° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120Â° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60Â° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10Â° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.|$|E
2500|$|To protect {{telecommunication}} lines, transient suppression {{devices such}} as 3 mil carbon blocks (IEEE C62.32), ultra-low capacitance varistors, and avalanche diodes are used. [...] For higher frequencies, such as radio communication equipment, a gas discharge tube (GDT) may be utilized. A typical surge protector power strip is built using MOVs. Low-cost versions may use only one varistor, from the hot (live, active) to the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor.</b> A better protector contains at least three varistors; one across {{each of the three}} pairs of conductors. In the United States, a power strip protector should have an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1449 3rd edition approval so that catastrophic MOV failure does not create a fire hazard.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand and Israel the TN-C-S {{system is}} in use; however, the wiring rules {{currently}} state that, in addition, each customer must provide a separate connection to earth via both a water pipe bond (if metallic water pipes enter the consumer's premises) and a dedicated earth electrode. In Australia and New Zealand {{this is called the}} Multiple Earthed Neutral Link or MEN Link. This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (locknuts for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount. In Australia, new installations must also bond the foundation concrete re-enforcing under wet areas to the earth conductor (AS3000), typically increasing the size of the earthing, and provides an equipotential plane in areas such as bathrooms. In older installations, {{it is not uncommon to}} find only the water pipe bond, and it is allowed to remain as such, but the additional earth electrode must be installed if any upgrade work is done. The protective earth and <b>neutral</b> <b>conductors</b> are combined until the consumer's neutral link (located on the customer's side of the electricity meter's neutral connection) - beyond this point, the protective earth and <b>neutral</b> <b>conductors</b> are separate.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have incorporated a third pin for a safety ground connection and are {{commonly referred to}} as two pin and ground (2P&G) to distinguish them from their ungrounded two-pin predecessors. The ground pin is situated between the line and neutral pins and closer to the latter. This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>conductors</b> are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The ground pin is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the safety ground connection is made first when making a connection.|$|R
50|$|The pins are {{specified}} {{to be in}} {{the order}} earth, phase, and neutral, clockwise when looking at the socket. Not all installations distinguish the live (phase) and <b>neutral</b> <b>conductors,</b> and reverse wired sockets are quite common, so double pole breaking RCDs and main switches are recommended. When sockets are mounted looking downwards then the connector system is rated for outdoor use in all weather. This is also the standard connector for lighting equipment (up to 16 A) used in the British film and television industry (often as outlets from a power splitter with a higher rated 3 phase input).|$|R
2500|$|RCDs operate by {{measuring}} the current balance between two conductors using a differential current transformer. [...] This measures the difference between current flowing through the live conductor and that returning through the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor.</b> [...] If these do not sum to zero, there is a leakage of current to somewhere else (to earth/ground or to another circuit), and the device will open its contacts. Operation {{does not require a}} fault current to return through the earth wire in the installation; the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing, contact with the ground or any other current path. Automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the earth wiring of the installation is damaged or incomplete.|$|E
2500|$|These {{versions}} of the 5-15R or 5-20R receptacle are residual-current devices and have Test and Reset buttons (and sometimes an indicator light). In the US and Canada they are required in many potentially wet locations, including outside outlets, bathrooms, some places in kitchens, basements, and crawl spaces. They work by comparing the current going out on the hot conductor to the current returning on the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor,</b> and disconnect the circuit if the difference exceeds 4-6 milliamperes. They are cheaper than GFCI circuit breakers and can be wired to feed additional [...] "downstream" [...] receptacles so that putting one GFCI receptacle in a circuit protects all the plugs, lights, and switches downstream from it. They are also recommended for power tool outlets and locations where children might insert conductive objects into the receptacles.|$|E
2500|$|Stray voltage is {{any case}} of {{undesirable}} elevated electrical potential, but more precise terminology gives {{an indication of}} the source of the [...] voltage. Neutral to earth voltage (NEV) specifically refers to a difference in potential between a locally grounded object and the grounded return conductor, or neutral, of an electrical system. The neutral is theoretically at 0V potential, as any grounded object, but current flows on the neutral back to the source, somewhat elevating the neutral voltage. [...] NEV is the product of current flowing on the neutral and the finite, non-zero impedance of the <b>neutral</b> <b>conductor</b> between a given point and its source, often a distant substation. [...] NEV differs from accidentally energized objects because it is an unavoidable result of normal system operation, not an accident or a fault in materials or design.|$|E
