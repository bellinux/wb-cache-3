Certain young gentlemen with the unmistakable air of being European or South American attaches found their way about on their little feet, which the stalwart boots of the republican masses must have imperilled; and smiled with a faint diplomatic superiority, not visibly admitted, but all the same indisputable. Several of these seemed to know Miss Anderson, and took her presentation of Mavering with exaggerated effusion.|$|E
60|$|Then indeed I {{knew that}} what I saw was Jerusalem of the Crusaders; {{or at least}} Jerusalem of the Crusades. It was a medieval town, with walls and gates and a citadel, and built upon a hill to be defended by bowmen. The greater part of the actual walls now {{standing}} were built by Moslems late in the Middle Ages; but they are almost exactly like the walls that were being built by the Christians at or before that time. The Crusader Edward, afterwards Edward the First, reared such battlements far away among the rainy hills of Wales. I {{do not know what}} elements were originally Gothic or what originally Saracenic. The Crusaders and the Saracens constantly copied each other while they combated each other; indeed it is a fact always to be found in such combats. It is one of the arguments against war that are really human, and therefore are never used by humanitarians. The curse of war is that it does lead to more international imitation; while in peace and freedom men can afford to have <b>national</b> <b>variety.</b> But some things in this country were certainly copied from the Christian invaders, and even if they are not Christian they are in many ways strangely European. The wall and gates which now stand, whatever stood before them and whatever comes after them, carry a memory of those men from the West who came here upon that wild adventure, who climbed this rock and clung to it so perilously from the victory of Godfrey to the victory of Saladin; and that is why this momentary Eastern exile reminded me so strangely of the hill of Rye and of home.|$|E

40|$|Since {{at least}} 1986, from the International German Teachers conference in Bern, the German {{language}} {{has been recognized}} among linguists as a pluricentric language. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} speak about more language centres, and also about <b>national</b> and equal <b>varieties</b> of one language. In connection with the decentralization of power and regionalization in the world, as well as the accession of Austria to the European Union, which brought above all the "Protocol Nr. 10 " with 23 specific Austrian words, the nineties experienced a boom in the production of pluricentric oriented literature. Many papers were also being focused on the research of the Austrian German. However, despite the declared equality of <b>national</b> <b>varieties,</b> their speakers are often not sure about the existence of more standard varieties, their characteristics or equality. These views, attitudes and evaluations as well as potential problems associated with the <b>national</b> <b>varieties,</b> will be described and analyzed by using the tools of the Language Management Theory. The starting points are authentic interviews of Austrian and German native speakers.

40|$|The {{identification}} and characterization of consumers’ preferences {{for agricultural products}} may constitute a valuable tool for producers in identifying market niches for their current production and to plan activity choice for the future. Traditional varieties {{of fruits and vegetables}} have been subject to some scrutiny in this respect. However, but for a few studies, consumers’ preferences for tomatoes have rarely been studied. Using the contingent valuation methodology applied to a panel of six different varieties of tomatoes (three <b>national</b> <b>varieties,</b> and three foreign varieties), the present paper provides evidence concerning the most relevant determinants of consumers’ willingness to pay, controlling for place and mode of production of the tomatoes’ varieties. In addition, the study elicits consumers’ rating of these varieties with respect to appearance, taste, smell and texture.

A style guideline states, [...] "the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major <b>national</b> <b>variety</b> of the language" [...] and [...] "an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation". An article should use spelling and grammar variants consistently; for example, color and colour {{are not to be}} used in the same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the linguistic attitudes in people from Bogota towards the dialects of Spanish in Colombia and the <b>national</b> <b>varieties</b> of it in other countries of Latin America. This project follows the research parameters of the project Linguistic identity and Attitudes in Spanish-speaking Latin America (LIAS) —funded by the Research Council of Norway— and applies LIAS methodology in Colombia. 400 Speakers from Bogotá were interviewed using a questionnaire with 41 questions. Informants were selected taking into account variables such as socioeconomic status, age and sex, and in proportion to the demographic composition of Bogotá reported in 2005 - 2006. The surveys were conducted with direct method, since this inquires directly into the informants’ attitudes and manners. As the survey comprises open and close questions, and there are also questions with an option to explain or justify the answer, quantitative and qualitative analyses were applied. In the case of the questions about Colombian <b>national</b> <b>varieties,</b> it was necessary to organize the regions according to the geographic distribution of dialects and superdialects posited in the Atlas Lingüístico-Etnográfico de Colombia [Linguistic and Etnographic Atlas of Colombia]. The descriptions about Spanish <b>national</b> <b>varieties</b> belong to the countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Spain, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Dominican republic, Uruguay and Venezuela and Belize. In some questions, there were emerging categories of description and analysis such as: phonetics, lexical-semantics, morphosyntactics, spelling, comprehension, communication, standard language, contextualization, politeness, media, truth, affection, reasoning, ethics, identity, linguistic identity, culture. The chapter of conceptual framework has five subjects: (1) Linguistic attitudes, (2) linguistic identity, (3) standard variety, (4) language policy and planning, and (5) Characterization of Colombian Spanish. The interest of exposing these issues is related to language attitudes in the way that speakers focus their use or interact with others and with their linguistic varieties; this supports the descriptions and analyses of the linguistic attitudes found in the answers given by the respondents. The chapter of analysis has seven subjects: (1) The positive and negative attitudes towards Spanish dialects in Colombia; (2) the names given by the respondents to the language they speak; (3) the attitudes about linguistic correctness in the Latin American countries; (4) the perceptions of linguistic similarities and differences in the varieties of Spanish spoken in Latin American countries; (5) the dialectal preferences of the media in Latin American countries; (6) the forms of address and the degrees of liking, disliking, ignorance levels and indifference that respondents display towards <b>national</b> <b>varieties</b> of Spanish in Latin American countries; and (7) the associations that informants make between Latin American countries and features like anger, technology, elegance, high economic resources, respect, affection, authority, vulgarity and sense of humor. </p...|$|R

Address practices are analysed in two comparable corpora of video recordings from Sweden and Finland using both a quantitative and a qualitative CA-inspired method. There are several differences between the data sets: the Sweden-Swedish data are characterised by exclusive use of the informal T pronoun (du ‘you’) and an overall higher frequency of direct address compared to the Finland-Swedish data. In some medical consultations in the Finland-Swedish data the formal V pronoun (ni) is used. The qualitative analysis confirms these differences and the tendency is that the Sweden-Swedish medical consultations are more informal than the Finland-Swedish ones, which are characterised by more formality and maintenance of social distance between the interlocutors. The different pragmatic orientations at the micro level of communication can also be related to socio-cultural preferences at the macro level in society – the development towards greater informality and intimate language is more pronounced in Sweden than in Finland...|$|R
