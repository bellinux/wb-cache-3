5|$|Bacteria do {{not have}} a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic {{material}} is typically a single circular bacterial chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the <b>nucleoid.</b> The <b>nucleoid</b> contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes the cytosol {{contains}} the cell's genome, within a structure {{known as a}} <b>nucleoid.</b> This is an irregular mass of DNA and associated proteins that control the transcription and replication of the bacterial chromosome and plasmids. In eukaryotes the genome is held within the cell nucleus, which is separated from the cytosol by nuclear pores that block the free diffusion of any molecule larger than about 10nanometres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a <b>nucleoid.</b> The <b>nucleoid</b> {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
40|$|Chloroplasts and {{mitochondria}} contain DNA {{which appears}} to be combined with proteins to form <b>nucleoids</b> in the organelles (Kuroiwa, 1982; Nemoto et al., 1989). In gen-eral, the DNA content of these organelles is far lower than that of nuclei. Thus, it was previously difficult to detect the DNA in situ and to visualize the shapes and distribution patterns of the <b>nucleoids</b> in the organelles. Use of the dye DAPI for detection of <b>nucleoids</b> by flu-orescence microscopy has increased the information that is available about the shape and the distribution pattern of <b>nucleoids.</b> Coleman (1978) was the first to succeed in visu-alizing the <b>nucleoids</b> in chloroplasts, and later she classi-fi ed the chloroplast <b>nucleoids</b> in various eucaryotic algae into 6 groups (Coleman, 1985).

Many <b>nucleoids</b> {{can be found in}} each chloroplast.In primitive red algae, the chloroplast DNA <b>nucleoids</b> are clustered {{in the center of the}} chloroplast, while in green plants and green algae, the <b>nucleoids</b> are dispersed throughout the stroma.|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial <b>nucleoids</b> {{isolated}} from mung bean seedlings exhibited a chromatin-like structure {{associated with a}} membrane component. A similar structure, which underwent discrete changes during cotyledon development, was identified in situ. Iso-lated <b>nucleoids</b> consisted of essentially the same phospholipids, including cardiolipin, as whole mito-chondria and proteins of inner- and outer-mito-chondrial-membrane origin. Actin was consistently found with mitochondrial <b>nucleoids</b> prepared with different detergent concentrations. Formaldehyde cross-linking of cytochalasin B- and proteinase K-treated mitochondria further revealed that actin was associated with DNA in <b>nucleoids.</b> Mitochondrial <b>nucleoids</b> were self-sufficient in directing DNA syn-thesis in vitro in a pattern mimicking mtDNA synthesis in isolated mitochondria. In pulse-field gel electro-phoresis, newly synthesized mtDNA separated into two major components, well-bound and fast-moving forms. <b>Nucleoids</b> DNA synthesis was resistant to aphidicolin but sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, which indicates that a g-type DNA polymerase was responsible for this activity. Mitochondrial <b>nucleoids</b> were capable of self-directed RNA transcription in a non-random fashion in vitro. Consistent with and complementary to results from fungi and human cells done mostly in situ, our present work helps to establish the important paradigm that mitochondrial <b>nucleoids</b> in eukaryotes are more than mere mtDNA compaction and segregation entities but are centers of mtDNA maintenance and expression...|$|R
5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the <b>nucleoid.</b> The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
5|$|Genomic DNA is {{tightly and}} orderly packed {{in the process}} called DNA condensation, to fit the small {{available}} volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA {{is located in the}} cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the <b>nucleoid.</b> The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locationsâ€” inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the <b>nucleoid.</b> Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{organization}} of multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules in discrete protein-DNA complexes called <b>nucleoids</b> is well studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Similar structures {{have recently been}} observed in human cells by the colocalization of a Twinkle-GFP fusion protein with mtDNA. However, <b>nucleoids</b> in mammalian cells are poorly characterized and are often thought of as relatively simple structures, despite the yeast paradigm. In this article we have used immunocytochemistry and biochemical isolation procedures to characterize the composition of human mitochondrial <b>nucleoids.</b> The results show that both the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM and mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein colocalize with Twinkle in intramitochondrial foci defined as <b>nucleoids</b> by the specific incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Furthermore, mtDNA polymerase POLG and various other as yet unidentified proteins copurify with mtDNA <b>nucleoids</b> using a biochemical isolation procedure, as does TFAM. The results demonstrated that mtDNA in mammalian cells is organized in discrete protein-rich structures within the mitochondrial network. In vivo time-lapse imaging of <b>nucleoids</b> show they are dynamic structures able to divide and redistribute in the mitochondrial network and suggest that <b>nucleoids</b> are the mitochondrial units of inheritance. <b>Nucleoids</b> did not colocalize with dynaminrelated protein 1, Drp 1, a protein of the mitochondrial fission machinery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEukaryotic cells contain {{numerous}} {{copies of}} the mitochondrial genome (from 50 to 100 copies in the budding yeast to some thousands in humans) that localize to numerous intramitochondrial nucleoprotein complexes called <b>nucleoids.</b> The transmission of mitochondrial DNA differs significantly from that of nuclear genomes and depends on the number, molecular composition and dynamic properties of <b>nucleoids</b> and on the organization and dynamics of the mitochondrial compartment. While the localization, dynamics and protein composition of mitochondrial DNA <b>nucleoids</b> begin to be described, we are far from knowing all mechanisms and molecules mediating and/or regulating these processes. Here, we review our current knowledge on vertebrate <b>nucleoids</b> and discuss similarities and differences to <b>nucleoids</b> of other eukaryots...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} DNA superstructure {{in a wide}} range of nuclei of higher cells by gently lysing cells to release structures that resemble nuclei but are depleted of nuclear proteins. The sedimentation properties of these structures, which we call <b>nucleoids,</b> have been examined in sucrose gradients containing the intercalating agent, ethidium. The sedimentation rate of <b>nucleoids</b> derived from the growing cells of mammals, birds, amphibians and insects varies in the manner characteristic of circular and superhelical molecules of DNA. These characteristic changes in sedimentation rate are abolished by irradiating the <b>nucleoids</b> with low doses of gamma-rays, a procedure known to introduce single-strand scissions into DNA. We have also investigated by similar means DNA superstructure in <b>nucleoids</b> derived from a variety of different chick cells. <b>Nucleoids</b> derived from adult hen erythrocytes differ from the other <b>nucleoids</b> studied in that their sedimentation rate does not vary in the manner characteristic of supercoiled DNA...|$|R
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the <b>nucleoid.</b> In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
25|$|Plastid DNA {{exists as}} large protein-DNA {{complexes}} {{associated with the}} inner envelope membrane and called 'plastid nucleoids'. Each <b>nucleoid</b> particle may contain more than 10 copies of the plastid DNA. The proplastid contains a single <b>nucleoid</b> located in {{the centre of the}} plastid. The developing plastid has many nucleoids, localized at the periphery of the plastid, bound to the inner envelope membrane. During the development of proplastids to chloroplasts, and when plastids convert from one type to another, nucleoids change in morphology, size and location within the organelle. The remodelling of nucleoids is believed to occur by modifications to the composition and abundance of <b>nucleoid</b> proteins.|$|E
25|$|Prokaryotes do {{not possess}} nuclei. Instead, their DNA is {{organized}} into a structure called the <b>nucleoid.</b> The <b>nucleoid</b> is a distinct structure and occupies a defined region of the bacterial cell.

In archaea, the DNA in chromosomes is even more organized, with the DNA packaged within structures similar to eukaryotic nucleosomes.|$|E

40|$|Plastid DNA, like {{bacterial}} and mitochondrial DNA, {{is organized}} into proteinâ€“DNA complexes called <b>nucleoids.</b> Plastid <b>nucleoids</b> {{are believed to}} be associated with the inner envelope in developing plastids and the thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts, but the mechanism for this re-localization is unknown. Here, we present the further characterization of the coiled-coil DNA-binding protein MFP 1 as a protein associated with <b>nucleoids</b> and with the thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts. MFP 1 is located in plastids in both suspension culture cells and leaves and is attached to the thylakoid membranes with its C-terminal DNA-binding domain oriented towards the stroma. It has a major DNA-binding activity in mature Arabidopsis chloroplasts and binds to all tested chloroplast DNA fragments without detectable sequence specificity. Its expression is tightly correlated with the accumulation of thylakoid membranes. Importantly, it is associated in vivo with <b>nucleoids,</b> suggesting a function for MFP 1 at the interface between chloroplast <b>nucleoids</b> and the developing thylakoid membrane system...|$|R

40|$|Visualization of topoisomerases in live Bacillus subtilis cells {{showed that}} Topo I, Topo IV, and DNA gyrase {{differentially}} localize on the <b>nucleoids</b> but are absent at cytosolic spaces surrounding the <b>nucleoids,</b> suggesting that these topoisomerases interact with many {{regions of the}} chromosome. While both subunits of Topo IV were uniformly distributed throughout the <b>nucleoids,</b> Topo I and gyrase formed discrete accumulations, or foci, on the <b>nucleoids</b> in a large fraction of the cells, which showed highly dynamic movements.

The addition of ribonucleotide triphosphates to nuclei isolated from infected cells stimulated additional DNA synthesis, suggesting that these nuclei were competent to initiate new rounds of DNA replication. Permeabilization of infected cells did not restore the ability of these cells to synthesize DNA. <b>Nucleoids</b> isolated from intact or permeabilized cells, infected for 9 or 16 h displayed an increased rate of sedimentation when compared with <b>nucleoids</b> isolated from uninfected cells. <b>Nucleoids</b> isolated from the nuclei of infected cells demonstrated a rate of sedimentation {{similar to that of}} <b>nucleoids</b> isolated from the nuclei of uninfected cells.

40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanisms}} {{regulating the}} number of active copies of mtDNA are still unclear. A mammalian cell typically contains 1, 000 â€“ 10, 000 copies of mtDNA, which are packaged into nucleoprotein complexes termed <b>nucleoids.</b> The main protein component of these structures is mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Here, we reconstitute nucleoid-like particles in vitro and demonstrate that small changes in TFAM levels dramatically impact the fraction of DNA molecules available for transcription and DNA replication. Compaction by TFAM is highly cooperative, andÂ at physiological ratios of TFAM to DNA, there are large variations in compaction, from fully compacted <b>nucleoids</b> to naked DNA. In compacted <b>nucleoids,</b> TFAM forms stable protein filaments on DNA that block melting and prevent progression of the replication and transcription machineries. Based on our observations, we suggest that small variations in the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio {{may be used to}} regulate mitochondrial gene transcription and DNA replication...|$|R
