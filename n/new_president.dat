40|$|While most <b>new</b> <b>presidents</b> {{of colleges}} and {{universities}} advance to the presidency through a traditional academic pathway, an increasing number of <b>new</b> <b>presidents</b> are now coming from positions outside of higher education. Yet, regardless of how they come to the position, many <b>new</b> <b>presidents</b> are unprepared for the complex challenges they will encounter when they take on their new assignments. A large number assume that participation in professional development seminars, often promoted as institutes for <b>new</b> <b>presidents,</b> will provide the essential algorithm for a successful presidency. Operating on such an assumption may well {{turn out to be a}} fatal mistake. This article identifies areas of potential vulnerability in the presidency that cannot be addressed in professional development seminars. The article then suggests constructive ways to supplement insights gained in the professional development seminars to enable more successful college presidencies...|$|R

5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the <b>new</b> <b>president</b> {{on the first night}} of the invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E
5|$|After eight years, Fetter {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught Fetter at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University at the <b>new</b> <b>President</b> White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at that institution. Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced Fetter to study, as Jenks himself had, under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where {{he wrote his}} doctoral dissertation, a critique of Malthusian population theory.|$|E

The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament.

5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The <b>new</b> <b>president</b> thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J.

The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days before the <b>new</b> <b>president</b> was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E

Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and missed his wife and newborn son. On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the Articles of Confederation; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.|$|E

However, soon after his election, Mutharika experienced tensions with Muluzi after implementing an anti-corruption program, which distracted the government from addressing the nation's food and HIV/AIDS-related crises. Despite these obstacles, Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV/AIDS during his presidency.|$|E

Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a <b>new</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E

Although the elections that brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.|$|E
