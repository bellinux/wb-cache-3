Jon Wiederhorn of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "the {{heaviest}} and most danceable disc in [...] 12-year career" [...] while giving it an A-. Heidi MacDonald of CMJ New Music Monthly compared Xtort to getting {{hit with a}} wrecking ball, saying, [...] "When KMFDM does what it does best, {{it is the best}} at what it does, namely jack-hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power." [...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "the product of a first-rate lineup," [...] and praised the album's diversity, saying, [...] "The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist." [...] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an [...] "essential" [...] rating, and said, [...] "KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, [...] "it would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, [...] "KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best." [...] Liz Armstrong of the Daily Herald thought the guest contributors added significant differences to their individual songs.|$|E

My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story.

500|$|In 2013, Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen covered [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for The Little Mermaids Diamond Edition re-release, {{accompanied}} by a music video. Buyers of the DVD were provided with a download code to download the cover from the Internet for free. The track was also included on the album The Little Mermaid Greatest Hits (2013). The singer credits [...] "Part of the World" [...] with reintroducing her pop music career to her musical theatre background, which she incorporated into her cover. A fan of Benson's version, which she studied for inspiration, Jepsen was initially intimidated {{by the idea of}} covering [...] "Part of Your World" [...] before deciding to simply [...] "have fun" [...] and [...] "do it in my own way." [...] Jepsen borrows Ariel's opening monologue from the original recording for her introduction. The singer portrays a [...] "real life" [...] version of Ariel in the music video, and volunteered to dye her hair red for the role. Jepsen also wears a mechanically operated mermaid tail in the music video, which she found difficult to both put on and take off. Jepsen's version has been met with mixed reviews from music critics. Praising both the singer's interpretation and music video, Benson preferred Jepson's rendition over previous covers because she felt that it [...] "focused more on telling the story", which she believes Ashman would have also appreciated. Jezebel contributor Kate Dries hailed the cover as a [...] "perfect alignment of recording artist and song". Canada.com's Jon Dekel described Jepsen's cover as [...] "fittingly saccharine". Mike Wass of Idolator wrote, [...] "it’s <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] try something different" [...] despite believing that she sounds better singing up-tempo songs. Heather Phares of AllMusic reviewed Jepsen's interpretation was less [...] "inspired" [...] than Benson's original, while The Morton Report's Chaz Lipp dismissed the cover as [...] "bland". Japanese singer May J. covered the song for her album May J. Sings Disney (2015). In 2015, actors Josh Gad, Jussie Smollet and Craig T. Nelson briefly performed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} praised by critics who {{agreed that it}} was Rowland's best chance of {{reaching}} the US Billboard Hot 100 again. They praised both production and vocal delivery of the song. Robbie Daw of Idolator said that, although he [...] "liked the dancability of the Kelly's upbeat tunes," [...] it was [...] "as <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her take on a ballad again." [...] He called the single her best chance of [...] "finally crack {{the upper reaches of the}} Hot 100 once again." [...] Following the video's premier, Daw said that, alongside [...] "Kelly looking stunning in the video," [...] the song had [...] "hit" [...] potential. [...] "Surely the timing is right—especially with all the other singles Dr. Luke has had a hand in dominating the charts—for Rowland to be allowed into the spotlight once more." [...] Lizzie Goodwin of Gather.com agreed that the song, though different from her previous singles, stands on its own as a catchy tune. [...] "Though it’s no 'When Love Takes Over', Kelly Rowland’s latest single and music video 'Rose Colored Glasses' isn’t half-bad. It might not be a dance hit, but her new single is pretty catchy and is a great addition to include in a breakup/girl empowerment playlist." [...] Mack from Sound-Savvy said, [...] "Kelly always makes those love songs that make you re-examine things...While I don’t think Rose Colored Glasses will impact as hard as Commander, it's a formidable single in its own right and I kinda like it." [...] Despite accepting that Rowland has had her moments with the club songs, Melinda Newman of HitFix praised Dr. Luke's production work, stating that [...] "the song is a show stopper (a nice production by him- we often find him too slick)." [...] Jeremy Helligar of True/Slant said that Rowland had done a smart thing by not releasing [...] "Commander" [...] in the United States. He said, [...] " [...] edgier preference of dance music is very different to the dance-pop that Lady Gaga often tops the charts with." [...] He later added that the song was [...] "still to the left of what normally passes for modern R."

500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E

For the film's opening sequence, Bakshi paid two construction workers US$50 each, and drank Scotch with them, recording the conversation. In the Washington Square Park sequence, only Skip Hinnant was a professional actor; Fritz's friends were voiced by young males Bakshi found in the park. One of the sequences that was not based upon Crumb's comics involved a comic chase through a synagogue full of praying rabbis. For the voices of the rabbis, Bakshi used a documentary recording of his father and uncles. This scene continued to have a personal significance on Bakshi after his father and uncle died. Bakshi states, [...] "Thank God I have their voices. I have my dad and family praying. It's so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> now."

We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, {{and it turned out to}} be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well.

That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts.... But it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him sounding so healthy."

2500|$|In 2012, Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal called Radwańska [...] "the most tactically sound, subtle {{tennis player}} in the world." [...] Over the years she has been given the nicknames [...] "The Magician", [...] "Ninja" [...] and [...] "The Professor", {{due to the fact}} that she can pull off the most {{difficult}} shots in the game with ease. Radwańska's game is founded on variety, mobility, and a tendency to anticipate her opponent's actions. She often uses this style to construct rallies—either opening the court up for a winner, or prompting a surprised opponent to hit a misplaced return. Her primary weapons include a mixture of slices and lobs, along with her ability to hit the ball at a variety of angles. She also makes use of a disguised drop shot, often swung with the same motion as a normal stroke during a rally. She is also noted for her crouching shots, during which she quickly drops in place to return or redirect a low ball, along with her use of an overhead backhand while on defense. In fact, she is known for having invented her distinctive squat position shot, where she sits so low on her haunches that she can play half-volleys with a horizontal racket. “I’m not sure if I invented it,” says Radwanska, “but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators say that was my shot, even if someone else is playing, so it’s <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> I can put something new into tennis”.|$|E
2500|$|Critics' {{reviews of}} This Addiction have {{generally}} complimented the album's production and Dan Andriano's contributions, while criticizing Matt Skiba's vocals and lyrical themes.

[...] Both praised Andriano's writing and singing, with Beringer noting that he [...] "only leads on three tracks, but sounds fantastic in each, especially in album closer, 'Fine'." [...] Heisel stated that [...] "His three cuts (including the spectacular [...] "Off the Map") are sufficiently poppy without being dumbed down." [...] Skiba's vocals received more criticism: Beringer stated that [...] "some of [...] weakest material shows up here" [...] and that he [...] "sounds awesome on the title track and 'The American Scream', [...] falls flat on blunders like 'Draculina' and 'Piss and Vinegar. Heisel criticised Skiba for [...] " [...] back too frequently on his well-worn lyrical themes of drugs (the title track) and death ('The American Scream'). It's moments like these where it feels like he's trying too hard to keep up appearances with his band's more fairweather fans." [...] Corey Apar of Allmusic felt similarly, saying that [...] "it would have been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] more, especially since Skiba's lyrics leave much to be desired." [...] Michael French of Punknews.org shared this sentiment, saying that Skiba's lyrics [...] "aren't necessarily bad, but they've been significantly dumbed down; Matt once turned cliché into clever and cunning commentary--now they just lack personality and the clichés are just, well...cliché." ...|$|E
