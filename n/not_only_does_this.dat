5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the general purpose computer software design environment, a primary characteristic of embedded environments is {{the sheer number of}} different platforms available to the developers (CPU architectures, vendors, operating systems and their variants). Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed in different platforms.|$|E
25|$|Often, the tectonic {{action of}} crustal {{extension}} {{has created an}} alternating series of parallel grabens and horsts that form elongate basins alternating with mountain ranges. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> promote the creation of lakes by the disruption of preexisting drainage networks, it also creates within arid regions endorheic basins that containing salt lakes (also called saline lakes).

25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E
25|$|Blue Marble Production is a Seattle-based {{company that}} is {{dedicated}} to removing algae from algae-infested water. This in turn cleans up the environment and allows this company to produce biofuel. Rather than just focusing on the mass production of algae, this company focuses {{on what to do}} with the byproducts. This company recycles almost 100% of its water via reverse osmosis, saving about 26,000 gallons of water every month. This water is then pumped back into their system. The gas produced as a byproduct of algae will also be recycled by being placed into a photobioreactor system that holds multiple strains of algae. Whatever gas remains is then made into pyrolysis oil by thermochemical processes. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> company seek to produce biofuel, but it also wishes to use algae for a variety of other purposes such as fertilizer, food flavoring, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer drugs.|$|E

500|$|Once the Mangekyou Sharingan {{has been}} gained, the Uchiha user suffers from ever-deteriorating eyesight, {{a process that}} is aggravated by {{repeated}} use and culminates in blindness. One's eyesight can be permanently restored by taking and transplanting the eyes of another Uchiha clan member, a process that results in the creation of an [...] "Eternal" [...] Mangekyō Sharingan (永遠の万華鏡写輪眼, Eien no Mangekyō Sharingan). The tighter the blood ties are between the [...] "donor" [...] and the receiver (e.g.: siblings), the better it is for compatibility. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> process permanently restore one's eyesight, with the exception of using Izanagi or Izanami, but it also gives the person even greater power. The Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan also seems to change form from the original, with {{what appears to be a}} fusion of the current owner's Mangekyo with the previous owner's. Madara was the first Uchiha to awaken the Eternal Mangekyō by taking the eyes of his younger brother, Izuna, to regain his sight, giving him great power. After suffering from onset near-total blindness from overuse of his ocular powers, Sasuke underwent the process himself with Itachi's eyes, granting him all of Itachi's ocular powers in addition to his own. However, the side effects of using the Mangekyō might not be applicable to all users, as Obito has been shown to use his Kamui ability nearly all the time and does not become exhausted or suffer from deteriorating eyesight. Mangekyō Sharingan can also evolve further to become Rinnegan, as in the case of Madara. However, he only managed to achieve that because he was the current reincarnation of one of the Sage of the Six Paths' son, Indra, and had injected himself with the DNA of Hashirama (the reincarnation of the sage's other son, Asura), which would grant the person with the sage's own power. The process also happens only near the end of the user's natural lifespan. However, Sasuke awakened a Rinnegan unique to him in his left eye after receiving the Sage of the Six Paths' Yin Chakra. His Rinnegan is a six-tomoe variant, with six tomoe on the first two rings of the Rinnegan. Although he awakened the Rinnegan, Sasuke can still access the powers of his Mangekyō Sharingan (e.g. Amaterasu and Susanoo). He also awakened a Perfect Susanoo (Complete Body Susanoo) that rivals Madara's. His Susanoo has wings that enable him to fly.|$|E
