5|$|Utmost <b>necessity</b> may {{be invoked}} where an {{interest}} {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of <b>necessity</b> would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The <b>necessity</b> may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the <b>necessity</b> must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} questions on attitudes to <b>necessities</b> for the child items and activities in the 2012 PSE Attitudes to <b>Necessities</b> survey. For {{the purposes of this}} research, adults were asked whether children’s items were <b>necessities</b> or otherwise – the findings therefore represent what adults think children need. The paper, first, presents the overall proportions of the population viewing items as <b>necessities,</b> and where possible compares this to the proportion of the population viewing these items and activities as <b>necessities</b> in previous surveys. Following this, variations between different sub-groups of the population are explored. Another working paper (forthcoming) will provide evidence of the number and characteristics of children lacking these <b>necessities...</b>|$|R

5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent. He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from <b>necessity</b> of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by <b>necessity</b> of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' <b>necessity</b> of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its <b>necessity</b> of existence.|$|E

I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the <b>necessity</b> of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the <b>necessity</b> of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, <b>necessity</b> and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. <b>Necessity</b> is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of <b>necessity</b> was accepted.|$|E
5|$|While {{equality}} jurisprudence primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of <b>necessity.</b> Needless to say, {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. Therein lies the paradox of equality jurisprudence. The <b>necessity</b> of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E
