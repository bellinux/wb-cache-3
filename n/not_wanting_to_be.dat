5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E
5|$|The Guides were disbanded in January 1862 {{after the}} Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky fled Bowling Green, as Hines {{did not want}} to fight anywhere except in Kentucky. He traveled to Richmond, Virginia, and missed the Battle of Shiloh as a result. In April, he decided to join Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan, and he re-enlisted in the army as a private in the 9th Kentucky Cavalry in May 1862. Morgan recognized Hines' talents and commissioned him as a captain on June 10, 1862. Afterward, Hines {{spent most of his time}} engaged in secret missions in his beloved Kentucky. Dressed in civilian clothes, he usually operated alone to avoid drawing attention to himself, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed as a spy.|$|E

Hungry and <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scene}} of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the storm finished, the Allied fleet {{returned}} to Artemisium to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae. The following day, (the fifth since the Persians had arrived at Thermopylae) the Persian army began their attacks on the Allied army at Thermopylae. The same day, the Persian fleet finally appeared through the Gap of Sciathos, and began mooring on the coast opposite Artemisium, at Aphetae. According to Herodotus, 15 Persian ships blundered into the Allied lines, and were captured. Although clearly storm damaged, the Persian fleet still probably outnumbered the Allies by nearly 3:1. As a result, the Allies contemplated withdrawing completely. The Euboeans, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoned to the Persians, bribed Themistocles to try {{to ensure that the}} Allied fleet remained. Since the joint operation at Thermopylae and Artemisium was his strategy in the first place, it is likely this is exactly what Themistocles wanted, and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and Corinthian admirals, Eurybiades and Adeimantus to remain at Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{left without}} any means of propaganda, Rocker founded the Germinal in March 1900. Compared to Arbeter Fraint, {{it was more}} theoretical, {{applying}} anarchist thought {{to the analysis of}} literature and philosophy. It represented a maturation of Rocker's thinking towards Kropotkin-ite anarchism and would survive until March 1903. 1902 saw the London Jews being targeted by a wave of anti-alien sentiment, while Rocker was away for a year in Leeds. Upon return in September, he was happy to see the Jewish anarchists had kept the Arbeter Fraint organization alive. A conference of all Jewish anarchists of the city on December 26 decided for a re-launch of the Arbeter Fraint newspaper as the organ of all Jewish anarchists in Great Britain and Paris and made Rocker the editor. The first issue appeared on March 20, 1903. Following the Kishinev pogrom in the Russian Empire, Rocker led a demonstration in solidarity with the victims, the largest ever gathering of Jews in London. Afterwards he traveled to Leeds, Glasgow, and Edinburgh to lecture on the topic.|$|E

Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E
