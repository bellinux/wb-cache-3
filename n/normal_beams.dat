The results from ACI 318 - 95 and CSA- 94 codes show the discrepancies in values of modulus of rupture for HSSCC deep and <b>normal</b> <b>beams.</b> These differences are due to non-consideration of load transfer mechanism in deep beams and high strength of concrete.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of deep beams is {{significantly different from}} that of <b>normal</b> <b>beams.</b> Because of their proportions, deep beams are likely to have strength controlled by shear. This paper discusses the results of eight simply supported high strength self compacting concrete (HSSCC) deep beams having variation in ratio of web reinforcement and tensile reinforcement. The deflection at two points along the beam length, web strains, tensile bars strains and the strain at concrete surface are recorded. The results show that the strain distribution at the section height of mid span is nonlinear. Ductility decreased with increase in tensile reinforcement ratio. The effect of width of load point and the support point {{is more important than the}} effect of tensile reinforcement ratio in preventing premature failure. Load-deflection graphs confirm linear relationship up to 85 of the ultimate load for HSSCC over-reinforcement web sections. The absorbed energy index increases with the increase in tensile reinforcement ratios...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{shows how}} to {{determine}} dimensions of stationary horizontal (canopies) and vertical (ribs) shading devices {{in order to}} prevent penetration of <b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> solar radiation into the buildings during warm season of the year. While analyzing formulae for insolation rate equations for determination of dimensions of canopies and ribs which are perpendicular and inclined to the plane of intensively irradiated fenestrations orientated to the South, South-East, South-West, East and West have been obtained in the paper. Sloping canopies have the smallest dimensions. What is more, an angle of slope with regard to opening plane must correspond to elevation of sun station at an hour when there is a maximum specific heat flow rate of <b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> solar radiation. The paper considers an influence of canopies and ribs on transmission of diffuse solar radiation which along with <b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> solar radiation serves for creation of natural illumination. As follows from the analysis of formulae it is possible to make a conclusion about an inefficiency of vertical shading elements due to large rib dimensions and decrease in transmission of diffuse solar radiation. Minimum distances from fenestration reveal to the canopy have been determined for various orientations proceeding from the position that the opening must be maximally illuminated by <b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> solar radiation during the cold season of a year in order to reduce heat inputs for building heating. On the basis of dependence analysis we have come to a conclusion that it is appropriate to design stationary shading devices for fenestrations orientated only to the South and they must be sloping canopies. It is necessary to select glazing with a small index of solar factor for openings orientated to other corners of the Earth and reduction of solar radiation heat inputs. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{flexural}} behaviour of strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams {{is more complicated}} compared to the <b>normal</b> <b>beams</b> due to the different bond conditions and properties of the externally bonded material. A significant number of research studies have been reported {{on the use of}} different types of material for flexural strengthening of RC beams using the external bonding (EB) technique. Although most research has focused on the conventional strengthening materials, namely, steel plates, FRP and ferrocement; unconventional materials, such as sprayed FRP and cement-based composites, have shown that they also {{have a significant effect on}} the behaviour of bonded beams. This paper presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the different materials used for strengthening RC beams using the EB technique and their evaluation criteria. The behaviour of the strengthened beams is discussed in terms of load carrying capacity, stiffness under service loads, and ductility and failure modes. In addition, the effect of elevated temperatures on the externally bonded materials is also discussed. The critical review of the existing data can help for a better utilization and usage of the different materials for strengthening projects, which contributes significantly to the current efforts of developing optimum and feasible strengthening systems...|$|E
40|$|A well-performing {{concept is}} the {{reinforced}} glass beam, developed in analogy to reinforced concrete. This concept proved its feasibility both in statically determinate and indeterminate systems, {{for a variety}} of parameters. However, the advantages of indeterminacy over determinacy in terms of structural performance and safety are not evaluated for this concept. This paper presents experimental results of similar statically determinate and indeterminate bending tests (i. e. with the same free span length and load point positions) on stainless steel reinforced laminated glass beams, made of annealed float glass (ANG). The interlayer is used to bond the reinforcement. With these results, a comparison is made to quantify the structural efficiency of the latter system, at two test temperatures and for two reinforcement percentages. In addition, statically indeterminate bending test results on ‘discontinuous’ glass beams are presented and compared to those of <b>normal</b> <b>beams</b> to evaluate the effect of local reduced beam stiffness on the system’s load-carrying behaviour. The first investigation led to the conclusion that a 25 % increase in ultimate capacity can be reached when applying a statically indeterminate system, provided that the reinforcement-to-glass bond is thoroughly designed for the specific conditions (enabling the beam to form all necessary plastic hinges). Furthermore, when the latter condition is fulfilled, a locally reduced beam stiffness has a limited effect on the overall load-carrying behaviour of the statically indeterminate beam system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost {{of highway}} bridge {{structure}} elements {{are constructed using}} concrete structures such as deck, girders and piers. Especially on girder beams, concrete structural elements that work optimally resist bending {{is a part of}} the outermost fibers on the compression side while the concrete on the tensile side is negligible. Therefore it is understandable that the concrete on compression section of a concrete beam should be optimized while the concrete on tension section should be minimized. This may cause the reducing of the self-weight of the concrete structures as well as the using of the concrete materials can be reduced. As an experimental effort to achieve the above consideration, a series of study is being done in reducing the volume of concrete on tension parts. In order to clarify the flexural capacity of beam without concrete on the tension part (External reinforced concrete beam, ERCB), an experimental flexural test was carried out. The specimens are beams with a length of 2700 mm, width of 150 mm and 200 mm high. The beams were supported by a simple supports with span of 2500 mm and it was subjected to monotonic two loading points.

Feature mapping is a powerful technique that covers a wide area of data acquisition and analysis techniques applying both physically and statistically based principles. This procedure, beyond standard <b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> applications, employs many seldom used but interesting data collection procedures such as critical angles, surface waves, plate waves and backscattering techniques. It forms these into an extremely versatile data acquisition protocol, followed by detailed analysis through a state of the technology signal processing, pattern recognition and expert system and /or artificial intelligence implementation practice. This Paper explains the various existing possibilities for clever physically based data collection, and the types of feature domains and features available for anomaly representation in materials. Typical results are discussed to illustrate the capabilities and utilities of the feature mapping techniques, including a <b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> longitudinal wave high frequency area ratio feature mapping (F-map) system, oblique incidence shear wave amplitude F-maps, and plate leaky wave amplitude F-map results for interfacial weakness in an adhesive bond structure.

On the other side, the truss {{system is a}} structure composed by triangle. Truss system develops its flexural capacity based on the inter-action of the bar elements. Therefore, introducing of the truss system to the reinforced concrete beams by modifying of the tensile and shear reinforcement may increase the beam flexural capacity.

The torque source was modulated either by modulating tangential neutral beam power or by modulating in antiphase tangential and <b>normal</b> <b>beams</b> to produce a torque perturbation {{in the absence of a}} power perturbation. The resulting periodic perturbation in the toroidal rotation velocity was modeled using time-dependent transport simulations in order to extract empirical profiles of momentum diffusivity and pinch. Details of the experimental technique, data analysis, and modeling are provided. The momentum diffusivity in the core region (0. 2 <p< 0. 8) was found to be close to the ion heat diffusivity (chi(phi) /chi(i) similar to 0. 7 - 1. 7) and a significant inward momentum convection term, up to 20 m/s, was found, leading to an effective momentum diffusivity significantly lower than the ion heat diffusivity (chi(eff) (phi) /chi(eff) (i) similar to 0. 4). These results have significant implications on the prediction of toroidal rotation velocities in future tokamaks and are qualitatively consistent with recent developments in momentum transport theory.

40|$|International audienceA Petawatt {{facility}} called PETAL (PETawatt Aquitaine Laser) {{is under}} development near the LMJ (Laser MegaJoule) at CEA Cesta, France. PETAL facility uses chirped pulse amplification (CPA) technique. This system needs large pulse compression gratings exhibiting damage threshold {{of more than}} 4 J/cm 2 in <b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> at 1. 053 μm and for 500 fs pulses. In this paper, we present our recent progress and developments of such pulse compression gratings. We have shown in previous works that the enhancement of the near electric field inside the pillars of the grating drives the damage threshold. This was evidenced from a macroscopic point of view by laser damage testing. We herein demonstrate that damage morphology during damage initiation at {{the scale of the}} grating groove is also consistent with this electric field dependence. Some recent grating designs will also be detailed...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a time-of-flight spectrometer for heavy ion RBS. Start and stop signals {{for the flight}} time measurement are obtained by detecting the secondary electrons emitted from two thin foils traversed by the ions. MicroChannel plates are used to provide very fast timing signals. The achieved energy resolution {{of the system is}} 30 keV (FWHM) at 2 MeV and 75 keV at 10 MeV for ^(35) Cl, which permits a depth resolution of approximately 100 Å for indium profiles in GaAs (<b>normal</b> <b>beam</b> incidence). For ^(16) O the energy resolution is 45 keV at 6 MeV and 110 keV at 12 MeV. We present RBS spectra of thin-layer multielement targets. As possible applications we show indium profiles in In_xGa_(1 −x) As heterostructures, As and Ga profiles in a thin layer GaAs sample and a measurement of the silver isotopic ratio in a sputtering experiment...|$|R
