5|$|Operation Epsom, {{also known}} as the First Battle of the Odon, was a British Second World War {{offensive}} that took place between 26 and 30 June 1944, during the Battle of Normandy. The offensive was intended to outflank and seize the German-occupied city of Caen, an important Allied objective, {{in the early stages of}} Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
5|$|By December 1943 the {{division}} {{had returned to}} England and begun training for operations in <b>North-West</b> <b>Europe</b> {{under the supervision of}} I Airborne Corps. Although the 1st Airborne Division was not scheduled {{to take part in the}} Normandy landings, a contingency plan, Operation Wasteage, was drawn up whereby {{the division}} would be parachuted in to support any of the five invasion beaches if serious delays were experienced. This plan turned out not to be required.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{invasion}} of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8thcentury introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on tapial, pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply. Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11thcentury onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, {{while at the same}} time timber was still the dominant building material in <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E

5|$|Horrocks {{received}} two further mentions in despatches for his service in <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe</b> on 22 March and 9 August 1945, and was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 5 July. In {{addition to his}} native country's recognition, he was honoured by the governments of Belgium (the Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm and Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown with Palm), France (Croix de Guerre and Commandeur of the Légion d'honneur), the Netherlands (Knight Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau), Greece (Commander of the Order of King GeorgeI), and the United States (Legion of Merit).|$|E
5|$|In England {{the brigade}} trained for {{operations}} in <b>North-West</b> <b>Europe</b> {{under the supervision}} of the I Airborne Corps. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, under Operation Tuxedo the brigade would be parachuted in to support operations if any of the five invasion beaches experienced difficulties. Tuxedo was the only operation planned where the brigade would act as an independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed the entire 1st Airborne Division. However, the speed of the Allied advance towards the River Seine and then onwards from Paris northwards, was accomplished without airborne assistance and the plans were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{vehicles}} in the collection include three command vehicles used by Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group during the <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe</b> campaign. Also on display are extracts from Montgomery's personal papers, which are held by the Imperial War Museum's Department of Documents. Other tableaux depict scenes from post-1945 conflicts such as the Korean War, the Northern Ireland Troubles, the Falklands War, British peacekeeping contributions in Bosnia and the Gulf War. As many of the {{vehicles in}} the Land Warfare Hall are maintained in running condition, the site features garages and a running area behind the building.|$|E

5|$|Elf-like beings {{appear to}} have been a common {{characteristic}} within Indo-European mythologies. In the Celtic-speaking regions of <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe,</b> the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the Gaelic term Aos Sí. The equivalent term in modern Welsh is Tylwyth Teg. In the Romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from Latin fata ('fate'), which came into English as fairy. This word became partly synonymous with elf by the early modern period. Other names also abound, however, such as the Sicilian Donas de fuera ('ladies from outside'), or French bonnes dames ('good ladies'). In the Finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to elf is haltija (in Finnish) or haldaja (Estonian). Meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the Slavic-speaking world is the vila (plural vile) of Serbo-Croatian (and, partly, Slovene) folklore. Elves bear some resemblances to the satyrs of Greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{assigned}} to the 1st Airborne Division, just prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily, but played no part in the invasion. Instead the brigade first saw action in September 1943, during Operation Slapstick, an amphibious landing at the port of Taranto, as part of {{the early stages of the}} Allied invasion of Italy. Largely unopposed, the brigade captured the ports of Brindisi and Bari before being withdrawn. By the end of the year, the 4th Parachute Brigade was in England, preparing for the Allied invasion of <b>North-West</b> <b>Europe.</b> The brigade did not see action in France, being instead placed on standby for an emergency during the Normandy landings. Between June and August 1944 the speed of the subsequent Allied advance obviated the need to deploy airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{period the}} Reformation {{produced}} a gradual shift to Protestantism, {{and much of}} London passed from church to private ownership. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable. But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe.</b> The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England {{were likely to be}} Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>north-west</b> of <b>Europe,</b> {{in spite}} of its {{underlying}} differences of linguistic heritage - Goidelic, Brittonic, Gallic; its varieties of Germanic; and the powerful intrusion of spoken Latin - is as it were a single philological province, a region so interconnected in race, culture, history, and linguistic fusions that its departmental philologies cannot flourish in isolation.|$|R
5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the <b>north-west</b> of <b>Europe,</b> although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.|$|R
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is a partial migrant: birds {{from the north}} and east of the range {{wintering}} in the milder areas of Europe and North Africa. Scandinavian and Russian birds start moving south from mid-September onwards, most birds wintering in Europe, western Turkey and the Middle East. Between mid-October and November, large numbers cross the Strait of Gibraltar and others pass through Cyprus, but there is hardly any migration across the North Sea. Breeding birds in the British Isles and <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe</b> are resident or move only short distances. In the Himalayas, the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter. Return migration starts mainly from late March, although it can be a month earlier in the Middle East, and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late April or early May. Migration may be by day or night, and typically involves individuals or small groups. Vagrant birds have occurred in the Azores, China, Crete, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sikkim and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{house for}} which there is {{evidence}} in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the oldest}} surviving houses in <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe,</b> making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.|$|E
5|$|Either {{of the two}} 'Rankin' {{scenarios}} {{would be}} difficult for Thorne to accomplish however, as the troops allocated to Force 134 were meagre; from late 1943 onwards the majority of military resources were dedicated to the campaign in <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe.</b> In September 1944 Thorne was even deprived of 52nd Lowland Division, which was attached to the 1st Allied Airborne Army by the War Office and earmarked for Operation Market Garden. Instead Thorne was later given the 1st Airborne Division, under the command of Major General Roy Urquhart. However, owing to the heavy casualties the division had suffered during Market Garden it would not be combat ready until 1 May 1945 after being heavily reinforced. In order to bolster his forces, Thorne would therefore have to rely on Milorg, the Norwegian Resistance. The Allied civil affairs planners maintained very close contact with the Norwegian Government in exile which was based in London as well as Milorg. As a result, {{by the end of the}} war Milorg had been preparing for the arrival of an Allied force for some time; its 40,000 members were well-armed and trained, and led by more than 100 Special Operations Executive agents parachuted into Norway, and it was prepared to prevent any sabotage of key communication centres and other important facilities by German troops if they resisted the Allied forces.|$|E
50|$|The cloaked minor (Mesoligia furuncula) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuoidea. It {{is found in the}} Palearctic ecozone (<b>Europe,</b> <b>north-west</b> Africa, Russia, Siberia, Japan, north Iran, Afghanistan and China (Qinghai, Shaanxi).|$|R
50|$|It breeds in {{southern}} <b>Europe,</b> <b>north-west</b> Africa, and across temperate Asia from Turkey and southern Russia to Mongolia. During migration they form large flocks that fly in synchrony {{and at other}} times they form loose flocks.|$|R

5|$|Groups of {{settlers}} {{began building}} {{the first known}} permanent houses on what is now Scottish soil around 9500 years ago, and the first villages around 6000 years ago. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the}} oldest surviving houses in <b>north-west</b> <b>Europe,</b> making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this period and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age we have evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial island, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters. The peoples of early Iron Age Scotland, particularly in the north and west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 BC to AD 300 with the most imposing structures having been created circa 200–100 BC. In the south and east larger earthwork hill forts survive. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure. Most are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure.|$|E
