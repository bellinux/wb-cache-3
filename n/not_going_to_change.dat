Jackson explained the album shows several sides of her personality, {{as well as a}} [...] "more private side"; saying [...] "The album is about love," [...] "Damita Jo is one of the characters that lives inside of me."

[...] King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, [...] "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. [...] Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their minds." [...] King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a [...] "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life.

30|$|Our {{approach}} {{follows the}} centralized SON (CSON) architecture, {{according to which}} there is a centralized node that oversees operation of all small cells and controls their behavior. In CSON architecture, the centralized node receives inputs from small cells and determines their configuration. Thus, the LTE KPI Prediction Engine and the DFBA Optimization Engine are placed at the centralized node. Since the configuration parameters are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>changed</b> frequently, the proposed solution should not be affected by the latency due to the communication exchange between small cells and the centralized node. Also, the network overhead is low, since the measurement information from the small cells to the central node can be scheduled per best-effort basis. Note that this architecture is compliant with the control plane solution for MDT which is discussed in 3 GPP TR 32.827 [28]. Thus, the main message exchanges in our approach are between user equipments (UEs) and small cells and between small cells and the centralized management node, and all the interfaces needed for implementing our solution are already present in the standard.|$|R

An upgrade was necessary for this system because the cost to maintain the aging technology was becoming too great. There were, however, no available schematics or technical papers describing this system. In order to upgrade the system, it first needed to be reverse engineered. The system to be upgraded was a device that would pass data back and forth from a personal computer to a proprietary storage device. The device to be upgraded communicated with the personal computer over a standard Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) interface and with the proprietary storage device through a non-standard 92 -pin interface.
