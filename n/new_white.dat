5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having {{to make do with}} ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1942 <b>new</b> <b>white</b> two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{the work}} to {{establish}} a financing package for new investments in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started. Oslo Package 2 was passed in 2001 and allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier in 2003 from Siemens was for 33 units (99 cars), plus options for further orders. In 2005, the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the quantity by another 30 units. Two test units were delivered in October 2005, with the first serial deliveries in April 2007. With the delivery of the <b>new</b> <b>white</b> and gray trains, Oslo Sporveier received criticism {{that they had been}} disloyal to the old red color of the metro, and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 1980s. Following the 2006 decision to convert the Kolsås Line to metro standard, Akershus County Municipality announced they would order five units.|$|E
5|$|When Cunard died in 1865, {{the equally}} {{conservative}} Charles MacIver assumed Cunard's role. The firm retained its reluctance about change and was overtaken by competitors that more quickly adopted new technology. In 1866 Inman started to build screw propelled express liners that matched Cunard's premier unit, the Scotia. Cunard responded with its first high speed screw propellered steamer, Russia which {{was followed by}} two larger editions. In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned the Oceanic and her five sisters. The <b>new</b> <b>White</b> Star record-breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines. White Star also set new standards for comfort by placing the dining saloon midships and doubling the size of cabins. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals. Throughout the 1870s Cunard passage times were longer than either White Star or Inman.|$|E

25|$|As of 2015, {{residential}} segregation {{had taken}} new {{forms in the}} United States with black majority minority suburbs such as Ferguson, Missouri supplanting the historic model of black inner city, white suburbs. Meanwhile, in locations such as Washington, D.C., gentrification had resulted in development of <b>new</b> <b>white</b> neighborhoods in historically black inner cities. Segregation occurs through premium pricing by white people of housing in white neighborhoods and exclusion of low-income housing rather than through rules which enforce segregation. Black segregation is most pronounced; Hispanic segregation less so, and Asian segregation the least.|$|E

40|$|Pre-weaning data on 466 kits from 109 litters, 280 kits from 78 litters and 261 kits from 74 litters at birth, 21 and 28 days of age {{respectively}} {{were collected}} over 3 years (1998 - 2001). The litters representing 8 genotypes namely <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> x <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> (NZW x NZW) and Chinchilla x Chinchilla (CHA x CHA) purebreds; and <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> x Chinchilla (NZW x CHA), <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> Dutch belted x <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> Dutch belted (NZWDBD x NZWDBD), <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> x <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> Dutch belted (NZW x NZWDBD), <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> Croel x <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> Croel (NZW CRL x NZW CRL), Chinchilla x <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> Dutch Belted (CHA x NZWDBD) and Chinchilla x <b>New</b> Zealand <b>white</b> Croel (CHA x NZW CRL) crossbreds were assessed for effect of genotype, parity of dam, litter size, sex and season of birth on Individual Kit weight (IKT), Litter Weight (LWT) average Litter Weight (LWT) and Litter Size (LTZ) at birth, 21 and 28 days. The analytical {{results showed that}} genotype, litter size, parity, sex and season were important sources of variation for performance characteristics studied. Crossbred NZW x CHA and NZWDBD x NZWDBD individual kit weights at birth and 28 day were comparable (p> 0. 05). NZW- CHA kits were significantly heavier in ALT at birth and 21 days (p< 0. 05). NZWDBD x NZWDBD kit weighed more in LWT (P< 0. 05) and recorded larger litter size (p< 0. 05) at all ages than other genotypes IKT and ALT consistently in creased with litter size at all ages. All traits considered in this study at various ages were inconsistent with parity. The litters born in wet season maintained superior body weights over dry season litters. The sex mean for IKT at 21 day was significantly different (p< 0. 05) with females weighing more than males. The {{results of this study}} indicate that choice of breeds for commercial production should be based on pre-weaning performance. In addition genotype, litter size, parity, sex and season as important sources of variation should be considered in improvement programme to increase meat yield from rabbit breeds and crosses. Furthermore, this study provides corroborative evidence in support of the adoption of cross breeding in the commercial rabbit industry in the humid tropics...|$|R
