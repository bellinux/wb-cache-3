40|$|Plasticizers {{are used}} to {{increase}} the workability of cement in its fresh state. When adding plasticizers to a paste, the molecules chemically adsorb {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This interaction between the plasticizer and binders is complex and depends on several parameters, including cement type, addition of mineral admixtures and method of addition. In this study the adsorption of lignosulfonate, a well-known superplasticizer, on binders is investigated. Different binders are thought to affect adsorption differently, so adsorption is tested on cements with and without fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag. The goal is to better understand the effects of different binders on the adsorption of lignosulfonate through evaluation of adsorption isotherms obtained experimentally. Paste samples with a w/b-ratio of 0. 4 by volume with different binders are tested for lignosulfonate adsorption using UV-spectroscopy analysis. Two cements (ANL and CX) with and without the addition of fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag in replacement levels 30 % and 60 % were used. The lignosulfonate consumption is tested both for immediate addition with water and 10 minutes delayed addition to a fresh paste; the concentrations ranged from 0. 05 to 1. 5 g lignosulfonate / 100 g binders. Adsorption isotherms are then determined and compared to evaluate the contribution from the mineral admixtures. To investigate the correlation between the pH and consumption, pH measurements were performed on the pastes. The consumption on blended cements with fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag in this study are shown to have the same consumption behavior as <b>neat</b> <b>cements.</b> There are some differences between the different binders, but the standard deviations obtained is larger than the impact of these mineral admixtures, making it hard to conclude any significance from them. The cements also have small, though significant differences in lignosulfonate adsorption. ANL seems to adsorb more than CX, especially for higher concentrations of lignosulfonate. The most apparent difference is a result of addition method: the immediate addition of lignosulfonate together with water more than doubles the amount adsorbed compared to 10 minutes delayed addition after wetting for many samples. Immediate addition shows a linear form in the adsorption isotherms, while delayed addition for most part can be described with the Langmuir model. There is also no apparent correlation between pH and adsorption of lignosulfonate. It is therefore clear from the experimental results that the addition of fly ash or ground granulated blast furnace slag neither increases or decreases the consumption significantly compared to <b>neat</b> <b>cements.</b> Although the materials are different, they seem to behave similarly in lignosulfonate consumption. Other parameters, such as addition time, have a far more significant effect...|$|R

30|$|To address present {{concerns}} about thickening time and high early-strength in deepwater cementing at low temperatures when using conventional accelerators, {{a new type}} of set-accelerating admixture comprising of lithium chloride, aluminium hydroxide and alkaline metal chlorides, named as LS-A, was studied in this paper. Mechanism analysis and performance tests show that the accelerator LS-A accelerated the hydration of tri- and dicalcium silicates (C 3 S and C 2 S) at low-temperatures by speeding up the breakdown of the protective hydration film and shortening the hydration induction period. Therefore, LS-A could shorten the low-temperature thickening time and the transition time of critical gel strength from 48 to 240 Pa of the Class-G cement slurry, and improve the early compressive strength of set cement at low-temperatures. It exhibited better performance than calcium chloride and had no effect on the type of hydration products, which remain the same as those of <b>neat</b> Class-G <b>cement,</b> i.e. the calcium silicate gel, Ca(OH) 2 crystals and a small amount of ettringite AFt crystals.

50|$|The thick bed mortar {{method has}} been around for hundreds, if not {{thousands}} of years. Historically, a sand/cement mixture was mixed with water to a fairly dry consistency and was spread on either a portland cement water paste (<b>neat</b> <b>cement),</b> or over cement powder spread on the surface which is then sprayed with water to create a slurry coat and spread over the surface. The thick bed mortar would then be compacted and screeded (made flat and/or level) prior to installation of tile or stone.

Mortar beds were used underneath almost every tile or stone installation until the late 1950s when a chemical engineer, Henry M.

Detailed characterization of cement samples was performed using SEM&EDS and EPMA. Density, porosity and air permeability were also determined in cement samples. Complete carbonation was achieved within 28 days in poz mix and 7 days in lightweight samples, while carbonation in <b>neat</b> <b>cement</b> is limited to about 200 microns after 84 days of reaction. A carbonation zone and a porous transition zone were observed in partially carbonated samples. These reaction zones can be delineated by the elemental profiles, which show Na enrichment and Cl depletion in carbonated cement. The carbonation zone is dominated by calcium aluminosilicates. Micro-analytical techniques show {{that some of these}} phases are compositionally similar to zeolites.

An increase in the porosity was measured in fully carbonated poz mix cement; however, the permeability remained essentially unchanged. For the lightweight cement, the permeability increased from 0. 16 to 1. 1 mD after 84 days of reaction, suggesting that carbonation results in the degradation of lightweight cement under the experimental conditions.

30|$|Experimental studies {{carried out}} to {{evaluate}} cement degradation are often conducted by an HPHT chamber (vessel) to simulate reservoir conditions. These studies are categorized into two classes: (1) cements are exposed to scCO 2 saturated brine and (2) cement samples are solely tested against scCO 2, which {{is also known as}} wet scCO 2 (Kutchko et al. 2007, 2008; Barlet-Gouedard et al. 2009; Arina and Irawan 2010; Duguid and Scherer 2010; Laudet et al. 2011). Having done such tests, Barlet-Gouédard et al. (Barlet-Gouedard et al. 2009) suggested that brine should be used for the carbonation test rather than fresh water. They used a 0.4 M NaCl brine solution and observed a dramatic fall in the propagation rate of the cement samples after 2 days of exposure to CO 2 -saturated brine. To investigate the effect of temperature and pressure on the cement degradation, Arina and Irawan (2010) conducted an experiment by preparing the <b>neat</b> Class G <b>cement</b> according to the API recommended practice. They cured the cement slurry for 8  h at different temperatures (40 and 120  °C) and pressures (10.5 and 14.0  MPa) where {{it was found that the}} HPHT condition reduces the compressive strength, causing densification of C–S–H, which would increase the rate of CO 2 penetration. Barlet-Gouedard et al. (2009) found out that the degradation of the cement is faster under high-temperature (90  °C) and high-pressure (20.68  MPa) conditions. They indicated that the cement morphology is modified by temperature under these circumstances. Laudet et al.

An evaluation of the asphalt-rubber interactions indicated {{that there should be a}} reasonable level of interaction between the crumb rubber and the asphalt cement selected for the project. A suggested criterion for defining an acceptable level of interaction would be to establish a minimum viscosity of 15 Poise (Brookfield viscosity) for a <b>neat</b> asphalt <b>cement</b> modified with 20 percent crumb rubber. When designing a crumb rubber modified mixture, the aggregate gradation should be substantially gapped. The target gradation used in the construction of the Babbit, Minnesota test sections should be considered as a guideline for an acceptable gapped gradation. Stockpile gradations should be adjusted for crumb rubber gradations volumetrically; generally, 1 gram of crumb rubber occupies the same volume as 3 grams of aggregate for a given sieve size.

This was done via {{the investigation of the}} hydration characteristic of EAF slag – Portland cement blended mixtures. Various ratios of EAF slag were used namely; 5, 10 and 20 wt% of solid mix. The hydration properties investigated for the various mixtures were; compressive strength, chemically combined water and free lime contents as a function of hydration times. The hydration ages were; 1, 3, 7, 28 and 90 days.

The results showed that as the ratio of EAF slag increases the values of compressive strength decrease at all the hydration ages. Hydration kinetics of the investigated mixes was followed by determining the variation of free lime and chemically combined water contents with time of hydration. It was observed that hydration proceeds in four different stages. The values of chemically combined water of the cement pastes blended with EAF slag were less than those of the <b>neat</b> Portland <b>cement</b> paste at all hydration ages.

40|$|Recycled {{concrete}} aggregates (RCA) {{are mainly}} composed of an intimate mix between natural aggregates and cement paste and the complete separation {{between these two}} phases is difficult. Cement paste generally presents a much larger porosity than natural aggregates, the content and the physicochemical properties of cement paste therefore have a large influence on the properties of RCA. Any method seems to be adapted to the characterization of cement paste content (CPC) in fine recycled concrete aggregates (FRCA) especially for RCA containing calcareous aggregates. A simple method based on the dissolution of the cement paste in a solution of salicylic acid in methanol was specifically developed to estimate the cement paste content of RCA. Results showed that salicylic acid dissolution method can dissolve most phases of hardened Portland cement paste such as Portlandite, ettringite and C-S-H without dissolving siliceous and calcareous aggregates. The experimental results for two <b>neat</b> Portland <b>cement</b> pastes (white cement paste and grey cement paste) showed that the soluble fraction in salicylic acid (SFSA) was equal to the cement paste content for white cement and slightly lower for the grey cement.

They observed that the cement resistance depends mainly on the curing environment. In fact, the cement cured under HPHT conditions for 28  days had the least amount of CO 2 penetration due to the formation of calcite. This study was further investigated by Kutchko et al. (2008) in which the period of carbonation test was extended from 9  days to 1  year. The results obtained indicated that the carbonation reaction is a diffusion controlled phenomenon for samples exposed to the scCO 2 environment. Duguid and Scherer (2010) did a series of experiments to study the relationship between the cement degradation and pH variation. There was no degradation in the samples exposed to scCO 2 having a leaching solution of pH 5. Hence, they concluded that if CaCO 3 can be dissolved into the formation water, the degradation would stop. This could be the reason why sandstone reservoirs have a greater carbonation front compared to carbonates. However, this experiment was conducted under dynamic conditions and {{it may not be a}} true representative of reservoir conditions.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In {{the past}} ten years, renewed {{research}} interest has shown the benefits of internal curing by incorporating saturated lightweight fine aggregate (LWFA) in high performance concrete (HPC). As a result, the technology of internal curing has steadily progressed from laboratory studies to field applications. To determine the optimum LWFA content, information about the propensity for shrinkage in the cement paste, specifically the chemical shrinkage value, is needed. However, {{there is a lack}} of information on how to determine the ultimate chemical shrinkage value for HPC with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and/or shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA). The purpose of this thesis was to identify a simple procedure to determine ultimate chemical shrinkage values for given concrete systems with SCMs and/or SRA. Modifications to the ASTM C 1608 (Standard Test Method for Chemical Shrinkage of Hydraulic Cement Paste) were investigated up to a 14 day age. <b>Neat</b> paste (<b>cement</b> only), as well as binary and ternary systems, were measured to investigate the influence of SCMs and SRA on chemical shrinkage. Based on the observed data, an experimental prediction model was adopted and verified to estimate ultimate chemical shrinkage values for portland cement systems containing SCMs and/or SRA. The model agreed well with the obtained data and simplified the existing method of determining the ultimate chemical shrinkage value. Another purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of SCMs and SRA on autogenous deformation of HPC for which a buoyancy method was used. The findings provided insight into the mechanisms behind autogenous shrinkage and effective strategies to reduce autogenous shrinkage. Calcium aluminate cements (CACs) were also investigated as part of this research project as a rapid repair material for applications, such as high performance concrete bridge decks. Chemical shrinkage and autogenous deformation of CAC binders were tested in a similar manner to the OPC systems in this study. It was observed that GCX paste cured isothermally at 38 °C exhibited expansion with a particular shape of chemical shrinkage development curve.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here {{focuses on the}} impact of slag composition on the resistance of slag composite cements exposed to sulfates. Such composite systems can be an effective way to provide better sulfate resistance of the binder. However, the differing composition and hydration kinetics between slag and cement results in a change in the phases present and their quantities, the effect of which is often overlooked when assessing their sulfate resistance. Rather, the composition of the slag is typically considered. Compared to cement, slags are richer in Si, Al and Mg, but poorer in Ca. Blended with cement, they hydrate much more slowly to produce comparable hydrates including a C-S-H phase deficient in calcium plus a hydrotalcite-like phase. Furthermore, aluminium from slag can promote the formation of other aluminate hydrates. The changes in microstructure and ultimately performance is then dependent on the composition of the slag. The aim of the work was to determine how slag composition affected the performance of slag cements in sulfate rich environments by means of the developed microstructure. A first hydration study was carried out to follow how slag composition affected microstructural developments by comparing a <b>neat</b> (control) <b>cement</b> with several slag blends curing in idealised lab conditions. Subsequently, the same samples were exposed to a 3 g. L- 1 Na 2 SO 4 solution. By comparing hydration in controlled conditions and in aggressive media in parallel, analysing only the degraded zone in the latter case, the role of slag composition on phase assemblage and composition and, ultimately, on sulfate resistance was highlighted All the slag blended systems showed great resistance to sulfate attack during the testing period. This can be attributed to several changes in the microstructure in slag blended systems including (i) a lowering of the calcium content of the C-S-H phase which led to (ii) an increase in the amount of alumina bound to a possibly water rich silicate hydrate, (iii) a greater amount of a hydrotalcite phase varying in alumina content and (iv) a diluted calcium hydroxide content. Furthermore, monosulfate had formed in the slag blended systems during attack whereas ettringite had only formed in a neat system. This implies an availability of alumina from the slag keeping the /Al of the pore solution low favouring monosulfate formation. Lastly, the role of calcium and ettringite stability was tentatively probed at. ...|$|R

This thesis has explored the effects of using nano-silica as an additive to see how it affects the cement properties. The method to investigate this has been experimental. The focus of the experiments has been on parameters affecting the possibility of gas migration in the annulus. Gas migration was in 2005 responsible for 25 percent of the failures in primary cementing jobs. More specifically, elasticity and shrinkage were the parameters that were investigated. The elasticity tests have been performed for two, seven and fourteen days cure time at various mixtures. The shrinkage experiments measured shrinkage for 24 hours of cure time. The testing should optimally have been performed under in-situ well conditions, but as this was not possible it was emphasized that all the tests were conducted under the same conditions to get comparable results. In total, 72 samples has been made and tested for the elasticity tests. These were divided between 11 different cement mixtures. For the shrinkage experiment time limitations made it not possible to get test results for all cement mixtures. In total, six of the mixtures were tested for shrinkage. The results have indicated that the addition of nano-silica affects the cement properties. Most noticeable has been alteration of the viscosity of the cement slurry and early strength development. However, after fourteen days cure time the testing showed that the <b>neat</b> <b>cement</b> had improved significantly in quality, and was now giving among the best test results. For the shrinkage experiment the results suggested that nano-silica addition did not give favorable cement properties. Summarized, no nano-silica cement mixture proved favorable compared to the <b>neat</b> <b>cement</b> based on results from all the experiments. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ammonia sulfite pulping liquor {{of wheat}} straw was treated by ultrafiltration. Experimental results {{indicated}} that the membrane with a cut-off of 10 kDa was suitable for concentrating wheat straw liquor and had good anti-fouling property against pulping liquor. Permeability of ash turn higher with the increasing of volume reduction at the operating condition of 200 kPa and 25 ℃, and retentate was concentrated when volume reduced. Influences of ultrafiltration on physical properties of ammonia sulfite pulping liquor and its retentate after ultrafiltration were studied. Results showed that retentate had better performances as surfactant, concrete additive and dispersant. Surface tension of 1 % lignin solution of retentate was 54. 7 mN/m, which was lower than that of the untreated original lignosulfonate by 2. 2 mN/m. Dispersing effect of retentate on cement was also investigated, it was found that flowability of <b>neat</b> <b>cement</b> paste improved from 70 mm to 102 mm...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{the shelf}} life of wood from {{mountain}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus pondersoa [Hopkins]) killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) {{in terms of}} its compatibility for Portland cement was examined. Two methods of assessment were used, based on the behavior of the exothermic chemical reaction of cement hydration, accounting for the difference between <b>neat</b> <b>cement</b> paste and wood-cement mixtures. A new wood-cement compatibility index meant to integrate current approaches was defined. No evidence was found of limitations in terms of beetle-killed heartwood wood compatibility with cement except for the white rot infested samples. An outstanding physicochemical behavior characterized the mixtures of blue-stained sapwood and cement. Three compositions of ingredients were proposed for fabricating wood-cement boards that would meet the technical specifications given by the gypsum board standards with respect to strength and stiffness. In absence of pressing, the water was the factor used to regulate workability during the molding process. [...] P. ii. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects on}} {{composite}} cements of the aluminium content of slag plus that of additional sulphate, has been investigated. Samples containing cement or composites with 40 % replacement {{by one of}} 2 different slags, differing in aluminium contents, were prepared. A further blended sample was prepared with additional anhydrite replacing 3 %w/w of binder. Slag blended mortars showed comparable strengths to the <b>neat</b> <b>cement</b> system at later ages. Adding slag changed the hydration kinetics of the clinker phases. The addition of sulphate {{had no effect on}} slag reactivity but increased that of alite. Slags richer in aluminium resulted in greater incorporation of aluminium into C-S-H and encouraged the presence of hemicarbonate over monocarbonate. The Ca/Si ratios of the C-S-H formed were comparable between the two blends, being marginally lower than that of the neat system. The addition of anhydrite resulted in the adsorption of sulphate onto the C-S-H, plus stabilisation o...|$|E
