50|$|The <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Bank</b> Crash of 1894, {{known as}} Black Monday, {{was one of}} the turning points in Newfoundland's early history.|$|R
50|$|In 1895 the Bank of Montreal {{moved into}} the {{building}} and two years later, the only <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>bank</b> to survive the 1894 Crash, the <b>Newfoundland</b> Savings <b>Bank,</b> {{moved into the}} building. Then again in 1962 the Bank of Montreal purchased the Savings Bank and reacquired the building. In 1985 the Bank of Montreal donated the building to the City of St. John's.|$|R
25|$|Newfoundland {{eventually}} became fully {{integrated into the}} Canadian monetary system in 1894 following the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>bank</b> crash. The Canadian banks moved in following the crash, and the Canadian dollar was introduced.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was also the}} site of <b>Newfoundland's</b> first <b>bank</b> robbery, in 1850. Located {{in the basement of}} the Colonial Building was the <b>Newfoundland</b> Savings <b>Bank</b> and it was robbed of £413.|$|R
50|$|Lloyd's List {{reported}} on 19 September 1794 that Boyd, Young master, which had sailed from St Kitts {{had joined the}} Jamaica convoy after having separated from the Leeward Islands convoy in a violent gale on the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks.</b>|$|R

Thereafter General Gates captured the schooner Polly.|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{received}} {{command of}} the new 20 gun frigate Protector {{in the spring of}} 1780 and took her to sea in June. In accordance with instructions from the Board of War, the new warship cruised {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks,</b> on the lookout for British merchantmen. Her vigilance was rewarded early in June.|$|R
60|$|That {{summer they}} went north {{as far as}} the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks,</b> and harried the New York traders and the whale ships from New England. It was Copley Banks who {{captured}} the Liverpool ship, House of Hanover, but it was Sharkey who fastened her master to the windlass and pelted him to death with empty claret-bottles.|$|R

50|$|The Newfoundland 2 dollar coin {{was issued}} in {{intermittent}} years between 1865 and 1888. It {{was the only}} circulation gold coin issued by a British colony. Although few coins were issued, it was broadly used in Newfoundland and Eastern Canada. The coin became scarce in 1894 because of hoarding following the collapse of <b>Newfoundland's</b> <b>banks</b> and monetary system.|$|R

5000|$|Newfoundland's two dollar coin was broadly used {{not only}} in Newfoundland, but also in Eastern Canada in general. The supply of the coins [...] "virtually disappeared" [...] in 1894, when <b>Newfoundland's</b> <b>banks</b> and {{monetary}} system collapsed. With paper banknotes being distrusted, the gold coins were hoarded, {{as well as two}} next-highest Newfoundland denominations, the silver 50-cent and 20-cent pieces.|$|R

50|$|Compared to <b>bank</b> fishing, <b>boat</b> fishing {{provides}} {{access to}} prime areas with greater ease and speed. Also bank fishing doesn’t allow access to fishing areas that are {{too far away from}} the <b>bank.</b> <b>Boat</b> fishing allows fishing for deep water fish, such as lake trout, that may be impossible for bank fishermen to catch. A boat also allows fishing methods not available to bank fishermen such as trolling, deep water jigging, or down rigger fishing.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} {{two days}} {{looking for her}} lost charge, Alliance continued on toward America alone. On 2 May, she took two sugar-laden Jamaicamen. Off <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks</b> later that day, the frigate sighted, but escaped {{the attention of a}} large convoy from Jamaica and its Royal Navy escorts. Ironically, a few days before, the missing Marquis De Lafayette and her treacherous master had fallen prey to this same British force.|$|R
50|$|Father Vimont {{first arrived}} in North America {{as part of a}} {{flotilla}} of four ships and a bark commanded by Charles Daniel in August 1629. Caught in a storm off the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks,</b> the ships were scattered with one ship carrying Vimont and the Captain making it to Cape Breton Island. Fort Sainte Anne was established and Vimont began his missionary work but was recalled to France the following year.|$|R

After a week of searching south of the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks,</b> the barrier force was split on 2 May to provide greater depth.

60|$|Searching {{the records}} of history, it is only {{here and there in}} an old-world trial that the veil that shrouds them seems for an instant to be lifted, and we catch a glimpse of some amazing and {{grotesque}} brutality behind. Such was the breed of Ned Low, of Gow the Scotchman, and of the infamous Sharkey, whose coal-black barque, the Happy Delivery, was known from the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks</b> to the mouths of the Orinoco as the dark forerunner of misery and of death.|$|R
50|$|In September 1782, the Centaur {{was one of}} {{the ships}} escorting prizes back to Britain from Jamaica, when she foundered during the 1782 Central Atlantic {{hurricane}} near the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks.</b> Captain John Nicholson Inglefield, along with eleven of his crew, survived the wreck in one of the ship's pinnaces, arriving at the Azores after sailing in an open boat for 16 days without compass quadrant or sail, and only two quart bottles of water; some 400 of her crew perished.|$|R

50|$|After parting {{ways with}} Whitman, Jim Charlton resumed {{publication}} of the catalogue for the 1971 (the 19th edition). By the early 1970s, the condition of coins became an important factor of consideration for collectors. Grades for coins allowed collectors to more accurately estimate {{the value of their}} coins. Thus, with input from dealers who precipitated the change, the coin catalogue was not only modified to incorporate the value association with a coin’s condition, but also incorporated more Canadian and <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>bank</b> paper issues. The total page number of the catalogue was increased to 200.|$|R
40|$|Aim Glacial refugia {{during the}} Pleistocene had major {{impacts on the}} levels and spatial {{apportionment}} of genetic diversity of species in northern latitude ecosystems. We characterized patterns of population subdivision, and tested hypotheses associated with locations of potential Pleistocene refugia and the relative contribution of these refugia to the post-glacial colonization of North America and Scandinavia by common eiders (Somateria mollissima). Specifically, we evaluated localities hypothesized as ice-free areas or glacial refugia for other Arctic vertebrates, including Beringia, the High Arctic Canadian Archipelago, <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Bank,</b> Spitsbergen Bank and north-west Norway...|$|R
50|$|Upon his return, Whipple {{received}} {{command of}} a small squadron—Providence, Ranger, and Queen of France. On one occasion in mid-July 1779, this group of ships encountered a large British convoy in dense fog off the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks.</b> Whipple concealed his guns and ran up the British flag. Thus disguised, Whipple cut 11 prizes out of the convoy, eight of which contained spoils of war valued together at over one million dollars (roughly 16.7 million in 2015 dollars), making the venture easily {{one of the richest}} captures of the entire war.|$|R

Fly was moving at about nine knots but a swift turn of the helm enabled her to clear the south end of the iceberg by half a cable's length.|$|R

2500|$|In his History of Brittany (1582), the French jurist and {{historian}} Bertrand d'Argentré (1519–1590) {{was the first}} (as far as we currently know) to make {{the claim that the}} Basques, Bretons, and Normans were the first to reach the New World [...] "before any other people". The Bordeaux jurist Etienne de Cleirac (1647) made a similar claim, stating that the French Basques, in pursuing whales across the North Atlantic, discovered North America a century before Columbus. The Belgian cetologist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden (1878, 1892) repeated such assertions by saying that the Basques, in the year 1372, found the number of whales to increase on approach of the <b>Newfoundland</b> <b>Banks.</b>|$|R
