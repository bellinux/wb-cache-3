Varying the energy and width of the resonant level on the dot, we first investigate a cross-over from a quantum dot regime to a quantum point contact regime when there is zero coupling to the <b>normal</b> <b>probe.</b> We then study the effect on the supercurrent of the <b>normal</b> <b>probe</b> which is attached to the dot.

The importance of feature selection lays on removing noisy, irrelevant and redundant data which can cause overload to the system. IDS faces very large amount of data which consists of many different features. Hence feature selection is used in order to select significant features which reduce unnecessary/noisy data. In feature selection two search algorithms; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) is s used to select significant features for the respective five categories of network traffics which are; <b>Normal,</b> <b>Probe,</b> Denial-of-Service (DoS), User-to-Root (U 2 R) and Remote-to-Local (R 2 L).

40|$|Abstract — We {{present the}} results of two {{controlled}} studies comparing layered surface visualizations under various texture conditions. The task was to estimate surface normals, measured by accuracy of a hand-set surface <b>normal</b> <b>probe.</b> A single surface visualization was compared with the two-surfaces case under conditions of no texture and with projected grid textures. Variations in relative texture spacing on {{top and bottom surfaces}} were compared, as well as opacity of the top surface. Significant improvements are found for the textured cases over non-textured surfaces. Either larger or thinner top-surface textures, and lower top surface opacities are shown to give less bottom surface error. Top surface error appears to be highly resilient to changes in texture. Given the results we also present an example of how appropriate textures might be useful in volume visualization. Index Terms—Perception, optimal visualization, texturing, layered surfaces. ...|$|E
40|$|Initial {{screening}} {{for the common}} β-thalassaemia mutations with allele-specific oligonucleotide probe in an at-risk family suggested non-paternity. Subsequent DNA fingerprinting of the members proved otherwise. The mother had a codon 41 / 42 frameshift mutation and the father's defect, determined by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified β gene, was a codon 43 nonosense mutation. In the affected children, the close proximity of these two defects resulted {{in the absence of}} a hybridization signal to the <b>normal</b> <b>probe</b> in that region and a wrong assumption of homozygosity for the codon 41 / 42 mutation. The non-reactivity of the father's amplified DNA to the codon 41 / 42 thalassaemic probe accounted for the initial wrong conclusion of non-paternity. Since prior {{screening for}} β-thalassaemia mutations is done in all prenatal diagnosis programmes and concomitant inheritance of these two defects is relatively common in the Chinese, this 'artefact' of false non-paternity is worth noting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

We compared the settling of M. persicae on young and old leaves and analyzed the impact of aphids settling on the plant in terms of gene expression. Settling, as measured by aphid numbers staying on young or old leaves, showed that after 21 h significantly fewer aphids {{were found on the}} young leaves. At earlier time points there were no difference between young and old leaves, suggesting that the young leaf resistance factors are not located at the surface level but deeper in the tissue. Gene expression was measured in plants at 96 h postinfestation, which is at a late stage in the interaction and in compatible interactions this is long enough for host plant acceptance to occur. In old leaves of cv. Kardal (compatible interaction), M. persicae infestation elicited a higher number of differentially regulated genes than in young leaves. The plant response to aphid infestation included a larger number of genes induced than repressed, and the proportion of induced versus repressed genes was larger in young than in old leaves.

Non-real-time experiments were carried out on a VI calibration block using an USPC 3100 ultrasonic testing card to implement pulse-echo and NPD method respectively.
