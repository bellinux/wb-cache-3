5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E

25|$|On day 3, England’s bowlers {{continued}} their good work despite finding the {{hot and humid}} conditions difficult. They eventually bowled India out for 279, with Geraint Jones taking 5 catches as wicketkeeper. James Anderson took 4 wickets in the innings, including the vital ones of Tendulkar and Dravid.

In changed economical and political circumstances, Subotica was now a border-town in Yugoslavia and did <b>not,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, experience again the dynamic prosperity it enjoyed in the years preceding World War I. However, at that time, Subotica was the third largest city in Yugoslavia by population, following Belgrade and Zagreb.|$|E
25|$|Artists – {{apart from}} very few {{exceptions}} – {{make their living}} from other related graphic fields such as advertisement, animation, therefore devoted artists work on their comics projects in their free time. This way artists gain less practice than their professional contemporaries and a project takes longer to reach its final stage. Naturally, the quality and genre of these works strongly vary resulting in readers losing their faith in domestic comics. At this point the vicious circle would close in if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few publishers devoted to Hungarian comics. And luckily many artists, artist groups decide to take publishing of their own works into their own hands.|$|E
25|$|Behind a solid {{effort from}} running back Jermelle Lewis and wide {{receiver}} C.J. Jones, the Hawkeyes quickly jumped out to a 100 lead. And if it were <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fumble punt, the game wouldn't have gotten any closer. As it is, Michigan's Chris Perry scored moments later and Iowa took a 106 lead into halftime. After a Michigan field goal pushed the score to 109, Iowa took over. The Hawkeyes scored 24 unanswered points to finish the game as Lewis and Jones racked up two touchdowns each. Quarterback Brad Banks threw for 222 {{yards and three touchdowns}} as Iowa handed Michigan their worst home loss since 1967.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Van der Gouw again {{played in}} a crucial Champions League match for United, the second leg of the quarter-final against AS Monaco. In a {{spirited}} performance, he denied several clear chances for the opposition, and the 34-year-old Dutchman would have kept a clean sheet were it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> powerful long range goal early on from David Trezeguet. The Red Devils drew 1–1 but were knocked out on away goals. Ever the teacher, Van der Gouw coached United's young goalkeepers for a while, but relinquished this role in 1998–99 when Coton rejoined the club, in the same capacity, although not with a playing contract.|$|E
25|$|Milt Stegall {{joined the}} Bombers in 1995 after a three-year career {{returning}} kicks and seeing spot duty at receiver with the Cincinnati Bengals. He {{played in the}} Bombers' final six games of the 1995 season, racking up 469 receiving yards. In 1997, Stegall set a new league record that still stands today for average gain per reception with 26.5yards on 61 catches for 1616yards, including 14 touchdowns. Following a brief return to the NFL, that saw him {{on the verge of}} making the Green Bay Packers if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> serious knee injury at the end of training camp, Stegall remained the team's primary receiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} is elected by popular {{vote for a}} six-year term (eligible for a second term, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third consecutive term).

Leading political parties in Russia include United Russia, the Communist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and A Just Russia. In 2013, Russia was ranked as 122nd of 167 countries in the Democracy Index, compiled by The Economist Intelligence Unit, while the World Justice Project, as of 2014, ranked Russia 80th of 99 countries surveyed in terms of rule of law.|$|E

25|$|The Groupe Français d'Etudes Féministes {{were women}} intellectuals at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century who translated part of Bachofen's canon into French and campaigned for the family law reform. In 1905, they founded L'entente, which published articles on women's history, and became the focus for the intellectual avant-garde. It advocated for women's entry into higher education and the male-dominated professions. Meanwhile, the Parti Socialiste Féminin socialist feminists, adopted a Marxist version of matriarchy. Like the Groupe Français, they toiled for a new age of equality, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> return to prehistoric models of matriarchy. French feminism of the late 20th century is mainly associated with psychoanalytic feminist theory, particularly the work of Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, and Hélène Cixous.|$|E
25|$|Barks {{started taking}} various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer. From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, {{stubborn}} and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be. At {{the same time}} he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he was sure that if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: Walt Disney's Donald Duck and his own Scrooge McDuck.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, Carr ran, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sixth two-year {{term in the}} Texas House, but for {{attorney}} general. He lost the Democratic nomination to the incumbent Will Reid Wilson, Sr., a native of Dallas who since relocated to Austin. Wilson later became a Republican and in 1969 joined the Richard Nixon administration as an assistant U.S. attorney general {{in charge of the}} Criminal Division of the U.S. Justice Department. Carr was elected attorney general in 1962—he defeated Tom Reavley in the Democratic primary. He was reelected in 1964, as all statewide Republican candidates in Texas were again defeated in the Johnson-Humphrey landslide. As attorney general, he was involved in the prosecutions of swindler Billie Sol Estes of Pecos, and Jack Ruby, or Jack Rubenstein, the Dallas nightclub owner who murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Fadlan {{reports that}} the {{settlement}} of disputes in Khazaria was adjudicated by judges hailing each from his community, be it Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or Pagan. Some {{evidence suggests that the}} Khazar king saw himself as a defender of Jews even beyond the kingdom's frontiers, retaliating against Muslim or Christian interests in Khazaria in the wake of Islamic and Byzantine persecutions of Jews abroad. Ibn Fadlan recounts specifically an incident in which the king of Khazaria destroyed the minaret of a mosque in Atil as revenge for the destruction of a synagogue in Dâr al-Bâbûnaj, and allegedly said he would have done worse were it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fear that the Muslims might retaliate in turn against Jews. Ḥasdai ibn Shaprūṭ sought information on Khazaria in the hope he might discover 'a place on this earth where harassed Israel can rule itself' and wrote that, were it to prove true that Khazaria had such a king, he would not hesitate to forsake his high office and his family in order to emigrate there.|$|E
25|$|Fowler {{began his}} county cricket career at Essex County Cricket Club in 1877. A move to Somerset {{in the late}} 1870s saw him switch counties, and he began playing for Somerset County Cricket Club in 1879. His {{first-class}} debut was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> county team, but instead for the well-known Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1880. Facing Cambridge University, Fowler scored 36 runs in his only innings. He passed 50 {{for the first time}} in his following match, also for the MCC, scoring 61 runs after opening the innings against Oxford University. He played in Somerset's first ever first-class match in 1882, opening the innings alongside Edward Sainsbury, but his scores of 9 and 18 were the county's highest in each innings as they lost the match by an innings. Later that season, playing against the MCC at Lord's, Fowler had his best bowling performance in first-class cricket, claiming four wickets during his seven overs, conceding just eight runs. In the same match, having scored a duck in the first innings, he scored 23 in the second, which included a boundary which travelled a reputed 157yards before landing, leaving the ground. When the MCC visited Taunton that season, he reached his highest total in first-class cricket, totalling 139, his innings scattered with boundaries.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the quest for {{simplicity}} the original design concept was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Washington-Franklin series, but for a series devoted exclusively to Washington, with all its near-identical stamps exhibiting the same image of the first United States President—they would differ from one another only in denomination and color. This idea originated with one Charles H. Dalton of Boston, who, {{in a letter to}} his Senator, Winthrop M. Crane, expressed admiration for the current British stamps, all of which employed the same profile portrait of King Edward VII. Dalton recommended that the next U.S. series be similarly uniform, with every one of its stamps presenting the same profile head of Washington found on the 2¢ denomination of the 1894 First Bureau Issue. The senator passed this letter on to the Postmaster General, George Meyer, who by and large followed Dalton’s recommendation. Full uniformity, however, would have violated a long-standing postal tradition dating back to 1851, which had placed Franklin on every definitive one-cent stamp issued by the U.S. Post Office. It may have been for this reason that Franklin was admitted to the 1908 series in the single case of the one-cent stamp. The Washington-Franklin series resulting from this compromise was designed by the renowned artist Clair Aubrey Houston, known for his many postage stamp designs. Most denominations of the 1902–03 series had been identical in color to their counterparts in the preceding First Bureau Issue. By contrast, the Washington-Franklin set preserved the previous colors only for its five lowest values: new and very different colors were chosen for all denominations of 6-cents and higher.|$|E
