In general, with no chemotaxis, <b>non-diffusing</b> (D_S= 0) travelling wave solutions do not exist. However, we observe that this occurs due to the requirement that S_ 1 ∈ Y_S. This is not necessary {{in the case of}} no chemotaxis. Relaxing this restriction leads to <b>non-diffusing</b> travelling wave solutions (see Theorem  3). Note that, unlike Xue et al.

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} distributed systems is to detect termination of a distributed computation. A distributed computation {{is said to}} have terminated when all processes have become passive and all channels have become empty. We focus on two attributes of a termination detection algorithm. First, whether the distributed computation starts from a single process or from multiple processes: diffusing computation versus <b>non-diffusing</b> computation. Second, whether the detection algorithm should be initiated along with the computation or can be initiated any time after the computation has started: simultaneous initiation versus delayed initiation. We show that any termination detection algorithm for a diffusing computation can be transformed into a termination detection algorithm for a <b>non-diffusing</b> computation. We also demonstrate that any termination detection algorithm for simultaneous initiation can be transformed into a termination detection algorithm for delayed initiation. We prove the correctness of our transformations, and show that our transformations have only a small impact on the performance of the given termination detection algorithm...|$|E

While all three had a <b>non-diffuse</b> pattern on planar imaging, the majority of patients with <b>non-diffuse</b> planar imaging patterns did not have extra-articular activity. Therefore, three-dimensional imaging (SPECT or PET) fused with CT is required for accurate localisation of Y- 90 activity when there are <b>non-diffuse</b> patterns on planar imaging.

40|$|Quantitative {{ultrasound}} (QUS) {{techniques that}} parameterize the backscat-tered signal power spectrum have demonstrated significant promise for ultra-sonic tissue characterization. Some QUS parameters, including the effective scatterer diameter (ESD) and the effective acoustic concentration (EAC) {{that can be}} used for disease detection and diagnosis, require the assumption that the examined medium contains uniform diffuse scatterers. Structures that invalidate this assumption can significantly affect the estimated QUS parameters and decrease performance when classifying disease. In this study, methods were developed to reduce the effects of echoes that invalidate the assumption of uniform diffuse scattering. In order to accom-plish this task, backscattered signal sections containing <b>non-diffuse</b> echoes were identified and removed from the QUS analysis. In the first strategy, the data blocks used in the QUS estimation process and that contained <b>non-diffuse</b> echoes were identified and excluded from the QUS characterization of the diffuse scatterers.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{difficulties}} with interactive walkthroughs is the high quality rendering of object surfaces with <b>non-diffuse</b> light scattering characteristics. Since full ray tracing at interactive rates is usually impossible, we render a precomputed global illumination solution using graphics hardware and use remaining computational power to correct the appearance of <b>non-diffuse</b> objects on-the-fly. The question arises, how to obtain the best image quality as perceived by a human observer within {{a limited amount of}} time for each frame. We address this problem by enforcing corrective computation for those <b>non-diffuse</b> objects that are selected using a computational model of visual attention. We consider both the saliency- and task-driven selection of those objects and benefit from the fact that shading artifacts of "unattended" objects are likely to remain unnoticed. We use a hierarchical image-space sampling scheme to control ray tracing and splat the generated point samples. The resulting image converges progressively to a ray traced solution if the viewing parameters remain unchanged. Moreover, we use a sample cache to enhance visual appearance if the time budget for correction has been too low for some frame.

We use a dynamic spatial data structure to restrict the number of particles re-emitted during the local modifications of the scene. By combining this incremental particle trace with a line-space hierarchy for incremental update of diffuse illumination, we can locally modify complex scenes rapidly.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} algorithms for non-Lambertian photometric stereo can be partitioned {{into two}} categories. The first category is built upon stable outlier rejection techniques while assuming a dense Lambertian {{structure for the}} inliers, and thus performance degrades when general diffuse regions are present. The second utilizes complex reflectance representations and non-linear optimization over pixels to handle non-Lambertian surfaces, but does not explicitly account for shadows {{or other forms of}} corrupting outliers. In this paper, we present a purely pixel-wise photometric stereo method that stably and efficiently handles various non-Lambertian effects by assuming that appearances can be decomposed into a sparse, <b>non-diffuse</b> component (e. g., shadows, specularities, etc.) and a diffuse component represented by a monotonic function of the surface normal and lighting dot-product. This function is constructed using a piecewise linear approximation to the inverse diffuse model, leading to closed-form estimates of the surface normals and model parameters in the absence of <b>non-diffuse</b> corruptions. The latter are modeled as latent variables embedded within a hierarchical Bayesian model such that we may accurately compute the unknown surface normals while simultaneously separating diffuse from <b>non-diffuse</b> components.

Incoming first-shot is a generalization of a preprocessing technique called the first-shot that was developed for speeding up global diffuse radiosity algorithms. Alternatively, {{it can also be}} approached as a generalization of the direct-lightsource computation involved in gathering type methods. In order to reduce the prohibitive memory requirements of the original first-shot when it is applied to <b>non-diffuse</b> scenes in a direct manner, the proposed new method computes and stores only the incoming radiance generated by the lightsources and the reflected radiance is obtained from the incoming radiance on the fly taking into account the local BRDF. Since the radiance function of the reflection is smoother and flatter than the original lightsource function, this replacement makes the integrand of the rendering equation have significantly smaller variation, which can speed up global illumination algorithms.

A scale model is set up in many ways by increasing the amount of scattering, and detailing measurements of the reverberation time in each case. With the aid of statistical tools, the role of scattering in the process of achieving a diffuse sound field from initially <b>non-diffuse</b> conditions is outlined and a set of reference scattering threshold values is derived. It is found that the same values ensure the validity of the Sabine formula when corrections are adopted in its application. Reverberation time is also predicted in <b>non-diffuse</b> conditions by the Nilsson approach, and its performance is systematically compared with measurements. The Nilsson method was a better predictor of reverberation time under non- diffuse conditions than classical reverberation time formulas. However, for diffuse sound fields, the same method tended to diverge from measured values. An application using more realistic room conditions is developed together with computer simulations.

This diffuse image difference {{has been attributed to}} electron thermal ionization, but more recent experiments (800 nm) reveal a clear <b>non-diffuse</b> image superimposed on the diffuse image, whose origin remains a mystery.

Since two 400 -nm photons only resonantly excite the spherical 1 s SAMO and four 800 -nm photon excite the anisotropic 1 f SAMO, our finding gives a natural explanation of the <b>non-diffuse</b> image difference, complementing the thermal scenario.
