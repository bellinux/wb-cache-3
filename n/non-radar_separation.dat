40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) is a {{technology}} that can replace secondary surveillance radars and enhance cockpit situational awareness. It also {{has the potential to}} enable procedures not possible with current surveillance technology that would increase the capacity of the National Airspace System (NAS) in the US. Certain forms of ADS-B also have the bandwidth to upload weather and airspace information into the cockpit. However, prior to achieving the benefits of ADS-B, operators must equip with the technology. In order to voluntarily equip, owners and operators must receive benefits from the technology that outweigh the cost or receive other incentives. Through an online survey of stakeholders, applications of ADS-B with the strongest benefits to users are identified. In-cockpit data link offerings are explored in detail, along with a detailed analysis of ADS-B benefits for Hawaiian helicopter operators. The conclusions of this study are that ADS-B should be implemented in non-radar airspace along with busy terminal areas first to gain the most benefits from <b>non-radar</b> <b>separation</b> applications and traffic awareness applications. Also, the basis for the US dual ADS-B link decision is questioned, with a single 1090 -ES based link augmented with satellite data link weather recommended. The {{authors would like to thank}} all of interview and survey participants. Without their time and insights, this thesis would not be possible. Also, thanks to the FAA’s Surveillance and Broadcast Services program office for their support of this research under contract DTFA 01 -C- 00030...|$|E
