500|$|The runoff {{was held}} on 11 November 2007. Exit poll results {{published}} at {{the closing of the}} vote predicted a victory for Türk, with 69% of the vote. [...] "I'm very happy with the results as they appear <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a president who is uniting people. I believe that conditions here are such that people have a strong desire for something new," [...] Türk told reporters.|$|E
500|$|In a {{motel room}} in Roswell, New Mexico, Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder {{explains}} his belief [...] "that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{believe that if we}} listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." [...] Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, [...] "Maybe there's hope." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger {{people who are just}} starting their bands who happen to live in the canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E

500|$|The Infected, a core {{concept of}} the game, were {{inspired}} by {{a segment of the}} BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing it to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the {{concept of the}} fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The game does not directly explain the cause of the virus; Straley attributed this to the team's focus on the characters, as opposed to the virus. They preferred to explain the events through subtext, rather than explicitly explaining the cause of the infection. Straley compared the subtext included in The Last of Us to that of BioShock Infinite (2013). He felt that the latter had spawned various conversations within the industry, which he sees as a sign of a maturing industry. [...] "I've seen enough good stories in books and film. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see them in video games," [...] said Straley. The team used the concept of the Infected to force players to explore the limits of human perseverance. Throughout development, the team assured everyone that the Infected were strictly different from zombies.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} pop video {{received a}} positive reception from fans, according to Softpedia blogger Elena Gorgan. Following the premiere on The X Factor, will.i.am thanked his fans for their overwhelmingly positive feedback, tweeting, [...] "Wow!!! I feel so excited {{and full of}} energy right <b>now!!!</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> #screamANDshout. Thank you all." [...] Bruna Nessif of E! Online said that the video [...] "wasn't too crazy, but it definitely provided the futuristic vibe that will.i.am is famous from," [...] and Melinda Newman of HitFix praised Spears' hairstyle and make-up, and wrote, [...] "the futuristic, minimalistic clip is a cheap-looking affair that displays no chemistry between [...] ". Katie Atkinson of MTV compared Spears' persona on the video to Brigitte Bardot and wrote, [...] "if anyone doubted her enduring sex appeal, Spears proved she's still got it, in a midriff-baring bodycon dress... and a corseted leotard accented with feathers in later scenes." [...] 4music critic Jenny Mensah said that Spears [...] "sounds less Southern belle and more Swedish dominatrix in the video, as she takes on a deep, authoritative voice." [...] Hollywood.com blogger Leanne Aguilera wrote that despite not dancing in the video, Spears [...] "does look phenomenal. With her teased blonde locks, sexy (yet age-appropriate) pencil skirt and the highest of high heels, Ms. Spears looks sultry yet sophisticated." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} South African [...] "Freedom Songs" [...] had musical origins in makwaya, or choir music, which {{combined}} elements of Christian hymns with traditional South African musical forms. The songs were often short and repetitive, using a [...] "call-and-response" [...] structure. The music was primarily in indigenous languages such as Xhosa or Zulu, {{as well as}} in English. Melodies used in these songs were often very straightforward. Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa—re-purposing them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid. This trend had begun decades previously when South African jazz musicians had added African elements to jazz music adapted from the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Voëlvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols. Groups affiliated with the Black Consciousness movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music: the jazz-fusion group Malombo, for example, used traditional rhythms of the Venda people to communicate pride in African culture, often with music that was not explicitly political. While musicians such as Makeba, performing outside South Africa, felt an obligation to write political lyrics, musicians within the country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and, for instance, love songs, because the struggle of living a normal life was also a political one. Vusi Mahlasela would write in 1991: [...] "So who are they who say no more love poems <b>now?</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sing a song of love for that woman who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child." ...|$|E
5000|$|Haines {{described}} his {{motivation for the}} project: [...] "It {{occurred to me that}} we understand everything <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something that made people go, 'What the fuck is this?'

"Oh, well," [...] said Jimmy {{with some}} embarrassment, [...] "I feel I ought not <b>to</b> urge you <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know you belonged to me, and then I needn't bother when I'm at the ranch-- The trouble is, if I waited, {{somebody}} might carry you off.

2500|$|In October 2015, Albarn {{revealed}} that {{both he and}} Hewlett {{are working on a}} new Gorillaz album. Albarn said: [...] "I'm in the very early days on a new Gorillaz record. So far, it's really fast, and it's got quite a lot of energy. I've been stuck on piano, somewhere off Broadway, for years <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go somewhere completely opposite of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The actress Anna Wing, {{who was now}} 70 {{years old}} and had been acting since the late 1930s, {{audition}}ed for the role. She was so keen to play the part that she turned up for the audition clutching her birth certificate to prove she was a Hackney greengrocer's daughter and implored the producers to give her the job. When she first read for the part Holland and Smith felt that [...] "she overacted terribly", but on the second reading she [...] "brought the performance down considerably". There were initial fears over whether an actress of her age would have the stamina to survive EastEnders gruelling schedule, but when asked if she'd like to be in a popular soap, Wing replied [...] "All my life I've been an actress, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a household name!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, {{but he wants to}} make sure he remains healthy for the rigors of the preseason. He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see what I can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)." [...] He competed for the starting job in the 2009 NFL Season.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the film's origins, Henson {{explained}} that he and Froud [...] "wanted to do a lighter weight picture, with more {{of a sense of}} comedy since Dark Crystal got kind of heavy – heavier than we had intended. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do a film with the characters having more personality, and interacting more." ...|$|R

2500|$|We've {{seen here}} at the city of Kent especially, {{probably}} the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups. They make definite plans of burning, destroying, and throwing rocks at police and at the National Guard and the Highway Patrol. This is when we're going to use {{every part of the}} law enforcement agency of Ohio to drive them out of Kent. We are going to eradicate the problem. We're not going to treat the symptoms. And these people just move from one campus to the other and terrorize the community. They're worse than the brown shirts and the communist element and also the night riders and the vigilantes. They're the worst type of people that we harbor in America. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say this. They are not going to take over [...] campus. I think that we're up against the strongest, well-trained, militant, revolutionary group that has ever assembled in America.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, {{she began}} hinting that {{she was working on}} new {{material}} for her next album. The following year, on 18 May 2008, it was announced that [...] "Amebo" [...] would be the first single to be released from the album. According to Muma Gee, this song was what she had long desired to create: [...] "I have been doing my own thing. I've been experimenting even while at the University of Port Harcourt. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see what I can achieve professionally." [...] Explaining what [...] "Amebo" [...] was specifically about, she says, [...] "I am a homegirl, I am an indigenous musician. I believe so much in Nigeria. So, [...] "Amebo" [...] simply talks about our people, our values, and our heritage." [...] On 25 May, Muma Gee premiered the song at an exclusive night party in Ikoyi. Other roles she played at the event included meeting fans, and signing autographs. [...] "Amebo" [...] was sent to radio afterwards; Muma Gee also spoke briefly about the new album's content and direction, saying, [...] "I figured out that there are lots of love songs in the album. Maybe I am learning the rules to falling in love. (Laughs) and it's finding interest in my songwriting, maybe, maybe not, well I am not sure." ...|$|E
