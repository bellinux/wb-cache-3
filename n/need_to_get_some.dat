2500|$|At {{the start}} of preseason, Vancouver hoped to add six young rookies to the team. While the goaltending {{situation}} almost assured that one rookie would be added, forwards Hunter Shinkaruk, Brendan Gaunce, Nicklas Jensen, and Horvat were also attempting to make the team. Defenceman Frank Corrado was looking to secure a regular spot after he played the final three regular season, and four playoff games for the Canucks in 2012–13. When asked about adding youngsters to the line-up Tortorella stated: [...] "We’re not going to force it, but we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> kids in our lineup." [...] In Vancouver's first preseason game Shinkaruk and Gaunce scored goals, while Läck stopped 25 of 27 shots in two periods of work. Vancouver lost the game 3–2 to San Jose as the Sharks out shot the Canucks 42–15.|$|E

5000|$|On the one hand, as {{scientists}} we are ethically {{bound to the}} scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts.

And like most people we'd {{like to see the}} world a better place, which in this context translates into our working {{to reduce the risk of}} potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> broadbased support, to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.

5000|$|In 2010, Gates {{wrote an}} op-ed in The New York Times that {{discussed}} {{the role played}} by Africans in the slave trade. In an article for Newsweek, journalist Lisa Miller reported on the reaction to Gates' article: The enemy of individuality is groupthink, Gates says, and here he holds everyone accountable. Recently, he has enraged many of his colleagues in the African-American studies field—especially those campaigning for government reparations for slavery—by insistently reminding them, as he did in a New York Times op-ed last year, that the folks who captured and sold blacks into slavery in the first place were also Africans, working for profit. [...] "People wanted to kill me, man", Gates says of the reaction to that op-ed. [...] "Black people were so angry at me. But we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> distance from the binary opposition we were raised in: evil white people and good black people. The world just isn't like that." [...] Lolita Buckner Inniss, a professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, wrote a letter to The New York Times in response to the Gates' piece. She argued that regardless of who did the capturing, it was white people who created the market for African slaves and perpetuated the practice even after the import trade was banned. [...] "Up until that recent piece, people would have thought of him as someone who took a cautious and nuanced approach to questions like reparations." [...] Gates has such an eminent reputation, she said, and [...] "so much gravitas. Many of us were troubled." ...|$|E

Winger David Booth was scheduled {{to return to the}} line-up {{for the first time since}} an ankle injury ended his previous season in March. During the morning practice he suffered a groin injury but returned for the game. Jordan Schroeder became the first casualty of shot blocking suffering a hairline fracture in his foot after being struck by a Nail Yakupov shot. Jensen was checked hard into the boards and sustained a shoulder injury. Dale Weise delivered a check to Taylor Hall striking the Oilers' forward in the head. Hall later said that the hit was [...] "probably a mistake on both parts" [...] and [...] "I have to have my head up". Hall was uninjured on the play and stayed in the game. The hit was reviewed by the NHL's Senior Vice President, and disciplinarian, Brendan Shanahan who suspended Weise for the remaining three games of the preseason. Later in the game Zack Kassian attempted to deliver a body check to Sam Gagner, who made a hard stop to avoid contact. Kassian began a spin move while swinging his stick towards Gagner, lost his balance so that it hit Gagner's head. He suffered a broken jaw, eventually missing the first 13 games of the season. Kassian was assessed a double minor penalty for high sticking. In a post game interview, Oilers head coach Dallas Eakins called the action [...] "a disturbing play by a disturbing player". During his disciplinary review of the play, Shanahan said that he accepted Kassian's claim that he did not intend to strike Gagner in the head, but that he was responsible for his actions. He suspended Kassian for eight games - the remaining three pre-season, and five regular season games.|$|E

We are going to find out what the requirements are but we are certainly expecting that the requirement would be at least 40,000 seats. The ability to do that at Pride Park Stadium exists, the land exists. So we know that if we were successful, that is something that could be done." [...] To qualify as a host stadium, the ground would need to expand to at least 40,000 capacity and the club announced that three methods could be undertaken to achieve this, two of which would leave the stadium permanently expanded. Option A would see the additional capacity supplied by temporary stands erected behind each goal, removing the current roof, and be supported by steel structures, with all the stands removed after the World Cup and the original roofing replaced. Option B would also see temporary seating built in the north and south stands as well as an additional structure placed on the east stand which the club could choose to keep, increasing the capacity to 39,000. The final Option, C, would see the removal of seating from the north, south and east stands and three new 20 row decks placed in each stand. This again came with the option of retaining the east stand expansion, raising the stadium capacity to a permanent 37,000. The club itself stated that it preferred to explore temporary, rather than permanent, expansion, saying [...] "We'd like to meet the World Cup standards for matches when it comes to expansion but then perhaps scale down the stadium to something closer to where we are right now. That way, we can keep the intimacy and special atmosphere that has almost become a hallmark of going to a Derby County match. When the team play at home, having a full stadium is a huge advantage because it creates a brilliant atmosphere. What we wouldn't want to do is have a stadium that all of a sudden was too big after the World Cup had gone." [...] On 16 December 2009, Derby's campaign was rejected by the FA, along with Hull and Leicester to local rival bid by Nottingham Forest. Tom Glick later commented, [...] "We're all greatly disappointed. Thousands of hours of hard work has been put in across the city from a number of agencies.
