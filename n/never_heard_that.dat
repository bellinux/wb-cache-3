25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, {{even if they have}} <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E
500|$|... "On Doing Good" [...] is {{mentioned}} in the Drapier's sixth letter when he states, [...] "I did very lately, as I thought it my duty, preach to the people under my inspection, upon the subject of Mr. Wood's coin; and although I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> my sermon gave the least offence, as I am sure none was intended; yet, if it were now printed and published, I cannot say, I would insure it {{from the hands of}} the common hangman; or my own person from those of a messenger." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} in Massachusetts to Hutchinson's death was harsh. The Reverend Thomas Weld wrote, [...] "The Lord heard our groans to heaven, and freed {{us from our}} great and sore affliction…. I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the Indians in those parts did ever before this commit the like outrage upon any one family or families; and therefore God's hand is the more apparently seen herein, to pick out this woeful woman". Peter Bulkley, the pastor at Concord, wrote, [...] "Let her damned heresies, and the just vengeance of God, by which she perished, terrify all her seduced followers from having any {{more to do with}} her leaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilder was {{not only}} proud of his film, he was plainly fond of it as well: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> expression, film noir, when I made Double Indemnity... I just made {{pictures}} I {{would have liked to}} see. When I was lucky, it coincided with the taste of the audience. With Double Indemnity, I was lucky." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{on holiday}} in Marrakesh, Morocco, Stevens was {{intrigued}} {{by the sound of}} the Aḏhān, the Islamic ritual call to prayer, which was explained to him as [...] "music for God". Stevens said, [...] "I thought, music for God? I'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> before – I'd heard of music for money, music for fame, music for personal power, but music for God!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Brian Dunning no one {{has ever}} seen this diary, and there is no {{evidence}} that it ever existed: [...] "Conveniently, every person with firsthand knowledge of the Bell Witch hauntings was already dead when Ingram started his book; in fact, every person with secondhand knowledge was even dead." [...] Dunning also concluded that Ingram was guilty of falsifying another statement, that the Saturday Evening Post had published a story in 1849 accusing the Bells' daughter Elizabeth of creating the witch, an article [...] which was not found at the time. Joe Nickell argues the chapter includes the use of Masonic themes and anachronism which impacts credibility. Jim Brooks, native of Adams, writes in his work Bell Witch Stories You <b>Never</b> <b>Heard,</b> <b>that</b> Bell family descendants report that Ingram did not return the manuscript to the family. Brooks explores the possibility that Ingram would have had an enhanced opportunity to modify the story by not returning the papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "God knows, {{who knows}} all, {{and the devil}} who freighted her. I broke prison six weeks afterwards, and <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> but <b>that</b> she got safe into Panama." ...|$|R
60|$|He had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>that</b> name, {{and said}} so. They deplored {{the lack of}} wind. And presently, still mystified, but {{gathering}} courage, he asked her why she blushed, at which her colour deepened.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{became of}} them?" [...] he said quickly. [...] "They {{never came to}} Horse Shoe Settlement, where the others landed from the wreck. I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>that</b> boat's crew or of ANY landing HERE." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Scruggs was 21, Monroe {{was looking}} for a banjo player for his group because David Akeman, known as Stringbean, was quitting. At the time, banjo players often functioned in the band as comedians, and the {{instrument}} was often held as a prop — their clawhammer playing was almost inaudible. Monroe, along with band member Lester Flatt, auditioned several banjo players who had the same traditional playing style as Akeman. When Scruggs auditioned for them at the Tulane Hotel in Nashville, Flatt said," [...] I was thrilled. It was so different! I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> kind of banjo picking". [...] Scruggs joined Monroe in late 1945, earning $50 a week. After they accepted Scruggs as one of the Blue Grass Boys, the roster consisted of Bill Monroe (vocals/mandolin), Lester Flatt (guitar/vocals), Earl Scruggs (banjo), Chubby Wise (fiddle), and Howard Watts (stage name Cedric Rainwater) on bass. This group of men became the prototype of what a bluegrass band would be.|$|E
2500|$|The mysterious F. Fred Palakon first appears {{a quarter}} of the way into the novel, when he offers to pay Victor $300,000 to track down his former Camden classmate Jamie Fields, a double-agent working in the {{terrorist}} organisation with which Victor becomes involved. It is never clarified exactly which political organisation Palakon appears to be working for; he even appears alongside Senator Johnson, Victor's father, a United States Senator with ambitions to become President. Of Palakon, 'the director' says [...] "We've been through this a hundred times... There is no Palakon. I've <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> name. Victor's girlfriend Chloe Byrnes is a supermodel and a recovering drug addict. Alison Poole, the main character from Jay McInerney's 1988 novel Story of My Life, appears, having also previously appeared in American Psycho in 1992. In Glamorama, Alison is [...] " [...] boss's girlfriend (another supermodel)", [...] "here playing Lewinsky". Bobby Hughes is a successful male model and the leader of his international terrorist group. Victor engages in a bisexual threesome with him and with Jamie Fields. Lauren Hynde from The Rules of Attraction also reappears, having become a successful actress with ties to Hughes' terrorist organisation; other Rules characters appear (e.g., in flashback) such as Bertrand, who is now a terrorist also.|$|E
2500|$|Noel {{admits that}} certain {{lines from the}} song are lifted from John Lennon: [...] "I got this tape in the United States that had {{apparently}} been burgled from the Dakota Hotel and someone had found these cassettes. Lennon was starting to record his memoirs on tape. He's going on about 'trying to start a revolution from me bed, because they said the brains I had went to my head.' I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?" [...] Gallagher also admits that he was under the influence of illegal substances when he wrote the song and to this day he claims he does not know what it means.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She has <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>that,</b> you may depend,' said Cherry, {{gathering}} up {{the corners of}} her mouth, and nodding at Tom. 'I am far from sure that she would bear you any mighty ill will for it, if she had.' ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Judson nodded, with {{a perfect}} {{expression}} of contrition and humility, as if she knew all about it, although, in reality, she knew only all about her employer and had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> till <b>that</b> moment of his engagement at eleven-thirty.|$|R
6000|$|She {{listened with}} {{profound}} interest, then said, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> all <b>that</b> before; I didn't know the name, though I've known this stone since I was a child. I used to climb {{on to it}} then. Can you read me another?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is for licking trenchers, and {{scratching}} copper, I suppose," [...] {{said the}} Baronet, sotto voce; and added, in a louder and more distinct tone,--"He <b>never</b> before <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> a setter was fit to follow any man's heels but a poacher's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Was she? Bloom ejaculated, {{surprised}} {{though not}} astonished by any means, I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> rumour before. Possible, especially there, {{it was as}} she lived there. So, Spain.|$|E
