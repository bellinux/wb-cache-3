This degradation has been observed to occur at temperatures as low as 125 oC. The source of the degradation {{has been linked to}} hydrogen gas that has been absorbed in the package's metals (Kovar, plating, etc.) and converted into atomic hydrogen within the Pt or Pd metallization of the gate structure.

40|$|Adenovirus-mediated {{gene therapy}} is a {{potential}} complement to standard cancer treatments. Advantages are that vectors {{can be used to}} target tumors and that replicating viruses lead to increased therapeutic dosage. In this thesis, an oncolytic serotype 5 adenovirus (Ad 5), Ad[i/PPT-E 1 A, E 3], was developed where viral replication is controlled by the insulator-shielded (i) prostate-specific PPT promoter. The adenoviral E 3 region was inserted for its immune regulatory and lysis functions. Ad[i/PPT-E 1 A, E 3] had improved cytotoxic abilities both in vitro and in a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model compared to a virus lacking the E 3 region. To further improve adenoviral vectors, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) FK 228 was studied. FK 228 has been proposed to enhance the effect of adenoviral therapy by upregulation of CAR, the primary receptor for Ad 5 infection. In the present study, we observed that FK 228 promotes transgene expression even better when administered after viral transduction, indicating a post-transductional enhancement of transgene expression. Another interesting finding was that FK 228 reduced transgene expression from the PPT promoter in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. This is {{explained by the fact that}} different HDACi have the ability to provoke a neuroendocrine phenotype of LNCaP. A potential drawback with adenoviral gene therapy is the rapid clearance of the virus from the circulation. Viral particles have been coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to evade immune recognition, a strategy that works well in mouse models. However, less is known about the effects of adenoviral PEGylation in human blood. We have studied cell interactions and immune responses to PEGylated and uncoated Ad 5 vectors in human whole blood using a blood loop model with constant blood flow. Limited effects of PEGylation were observed in human blood, which were associated with <b>the</b> <b>neutralizing</b> ability of <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> blood. An important finding that donors with high neutralizing ability in whole blood do not necessarily have <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies against <b>the</b> virus strongly implies that neutralization should be measured in whole blood...|$|R

40|$|A gift on the {{occasion}} of death (donatio mortis causa) in Roman law was a contractual disposition, made during the life of <b>the</b> <b>donor,</b> and in his contemplation of his own death, which took effect upon <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> death. <b>The</b> donee had no claim against <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> during <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> life. Only on {{the occasion}} of <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> death, had <b>the</b> donee assumed property rights over {{the subject matter of the}} gift. The transfer of property was conditional upon the donee outliving <b>the</b> <b>donor.</b> In contrast, a post-mortem gift (donatio post mortem) a contract modality with a suspensive term (dÃ©lai suspensif).

Still, the confusion among the two is not uncommon in contemporary legal doctrine and legislation. For instance, some agreements are sometimes labeled as gifts {{on the occasion of}} death, even though they do not possess characteristics of the Roman donatio mortis causa. On the other hand, a post-mortem gift is occasionally being assigned certain characteristics, which are in fact typical for a gifts on the occasion of death...|$|R
