5|$|The Crimes Act made <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> the {{creation}} of federal prisons. Instead, a September 21, 1789 concurrent resolution asked the state legislatures to authorize their prisons to imprison federal prisoners. The first federal prison was not opened until 1894 at Fort Leavenworth.|$|E
5|$|The 4th North Korean Division in the {{meantime}} was suffering serious logistical setbacks from lack of food, equipment, ammunition and, weapons. Conscripts from local South Korean villages were brought in to replace mounting losses. There was also virtually <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> the wounded in the division, and the North Korean forces began to come apart under these stresses. Still, the division's morale remained relatively high and General Lee refused to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|On May 10, 1800, the Indiana Territory {{was created}} {{by an act of}} Congress, but <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> an {{official}} seal was included in the measure. The earliest recorded use of Indiana Territory's seal was on court documents that were signed by Governor William Henry Harrison in January 1801. The seal he used was an adaptation of the original seal created for the Northwest Territory. Although its origin is uncertain, it is likely that it was Harrison who made the alterations.|$|E
5|$|The Ecological {{footprint}} measures {{human consumption}} {{in terms of}} the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> other organisms). The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries).|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

5|$|EU {{legislation}} makes <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> {{the preservation}} {{and protection of}} breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> a jury from the vicinage. If {{it could have been}} done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be {{impracticable}} in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E

5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} constitution made <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> {{a vacancy}} {{in the office}} of the lieutenant governor; in the event of the lieutenant governor's death or resignation, the lieutenant governorship usually remained vacant until the end of the term. In 1938, following the resignation of lieutenant governor Henry Gunderson, Governor Philip La Follette appointed Herman Ekern lieutenant governor to fill the vacancy. This appointment was challenged in court, and ruled valid in the case State ex rel. Martin v. Ekern. In 1979 the constitution was amended to explicitly allow this: in the event of a vacancy {{in the office of}} the lieutenant governor, the governor nominates a candidate who becomes lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term upon his approval by the Wisconsin Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate.|$|E

25|$|Public {{debate of}} issues is {{inhibited}} {{by the fact}} that much government decision making takes place behind closed doors. There is <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> the disclosure of government information to the public, and the State Secrets Law is strong and comprehensive.|$|E

2500|$|Structure of government: The Act {{defined the}} {{structure}} of the provincial government.

25|$|The {{office of}} vice {{president}} remained vacant {{for the remainder of}} Pierce's term, as the Constitution then had <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> filling it intra-term (prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967). As such, the President pro tempore of the Senate, initially David Atchison of Missouri, was next in line to the presidency.|$|E

50|$|Unlike TFTP, however, it made <b>no</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> {{sending the}} file-name {{as part of}} transfers, so {{it could only be}} used either in places that didn't need a file name (as with spooling), or in {{conjunction}} with another protocol that provided the file-name (as in booting).|$|R
50|$|Many alloys {{that do not}} undergo {{martensitic}} transformation {{have been}} subjected to the same treatments as steels—that is, cooled with <b>no</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> cold work.
