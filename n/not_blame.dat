5|$|Glenn Close as Carrie Johnson, Troy's devastated mother. She {{tries to}} mask her grief with a cheerful persona, and {{continually}} guilts her neighbors {{by telling them}} bluntly that she does <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> them for Troy's death.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While {{contemporary}} critics did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren {{believed that the}} choices of the selectors had {{made it impossible to}} win, and continued to write about the series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1836, Lincoln {{agreed to}} a match with Mary if she {{returned}} to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Praising me? You are sure? <b>Not</b> <b>blaming</b> me for {{standing}} {{on my own}} defence against a crew of plunderers, who could suck me dry by driblets? <b>Not</b> <b>blaming</b> me for getting a little hoard together?' ...|$|R

5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> this on Creutz.|$|E
60|$|DAISY. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>blaming</b> you. I'm only {{wondering}} how I shall ingratiate myself with him.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} Test, England were bowled out for 165 after Yardley won the toss and batted in {{difficult}} conditions. Wisden did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> Yardley for the collapse as England did not bat well. He then set defensive fields to keep down Australia's scoring rate, taking a wicket {{himself with his}} fourth ball as part of figures of two for 32. The Australian batsmen {{found it difficult to}} score quickly against the negative tactics but still established a lead of 344. Yardley batted an hour in the second innings to score 22 but Australia recorded an eight wicket win. Before the second Test, Yardley played for Yorkshire against the Australians, and although unsuccessful with the bat, took two for nine with the ball, his first wickets of the season for his county.|$|E
5|$|Miles' father also reappears, and {{relates to}} his son that as a young man, he and Aaron {{went to work for}} a {{criminal}} named Turk after Jefferson was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a spy in order to infiltrate the organization of the then-up-and-coming international criminal Wilson Fisk. Jefferson did this for a time, but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes, and Jefferson offered a chance to be a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, he refused, not wanting any part of his brother's world. He met Rio a week later {{and fell in love with}} her. Jefferson fled after learning that Miles was Spider-Man because it brought back unresolved issues from that earlier time in his life, and tells Miles that he does <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> Miles for his mother's death, and regrets abandoning him.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E

50|$|Sudden crises are {{circumstances}} that occur without warning and beyond an institution’s control. Consequently, sudden crises {{are most often}} situations for which the institution and its leadership are <b>not</b> <b>blamed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before Flight 605, Captain Gopujkar was {{involved}} in a taxiing incident in Cochin, although he was <b>not</b> <b>blamed</b> for the incident. During Flight 605, he was seated on the right seat.|$|R
5|$|They meet up {{with the}} rest of the family at a car museum. They steal a replica of the main villain's car from The Road Warrior and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film {{executives}} on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their car out of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter walks up to them, slaps them, and threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, but he does <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> him, arriving to the conclusion there is no place for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks him out of his limousine.|$|E

5000|$|Feminism {{bringing}} {{attention to}} the 'feminine voice.' Through this, the mythopoetic men felt that their voices had been muted (though Bly and others are careful in <b>not</b> <b>blaming</b> feminism for this).|$|R
6000|$|... "They are all {{saying that}} you ought to give up the case to Dr. Mulbridge. But I hope you won't. I should <b>n't</b> <b>blame</b> you for calling in another female physician"-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The Coroner's Inquest, which {{reported}} in April 2016, found that Wright was [...] "instrumental {{in the effort}} to ensure the Yorkshire force was <b>not</b> <b>blamed</b> for the tragedy", [...] "amending" [...] contemporary accounts that criticised the police, and attempting to ensure that [...] "drunken ticketless individuals" [...] were <b>blamed,</b> <b>not</b> the police.|$|R

25|$|Trafficking victims {{normally}} are not detained, jailed, or deported. The Ministry of Justice's {{training seminars}} for internal security forces included a component emphasizing that they <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> trafficking victims for illegal activities {{they may have}} become involved in {{as a consequence of}} their exploitation.|$|E
25|$|Backstage in his post-fight interview, Coleman {{stated that}} the whole melee {{happened}} {{in the heat of}} the moment and that he did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> the Chute Boxe team for coming in and backing their fighter. He then added that similar to Chute Boxe, Hammer House is also like a family, and thanked Baroni for coming in and watching his back. An outraged Chute Boxe refused to accept Coleman's backstage apology. The Chute Boxe team was assigned a yellow card for instigating this infraction.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{decision}} was made not to allow the prosecution, Terry Lubbock, the father of Stuart Lubbock, met with Barrymore, when it was alleged that Terry Lubbock told Barrymore he did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> him for his son's death. Bennett, though, maintained that the private prosecution would proceed, but that he would reconsider if asked to drop the case by the Lubbock family. He added that evidence from the night of Stuart Lubbock's death, made available at the inquest, had not been seen by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).|$|E
25|$|The fame of Seduction of the Innocent {{added to}} Wertham's {{previous}} celebrity {{as an expert}} witness and led to his appearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver. In testimony before the committee, Wertham restated arguments from his book and pointed to comics as {{a major cause of}} juvenile crime. The committee's questioning of their next witness, EC publisher William Gaines, focused on violent scenes of the type Wertham had described. Though the committee's final report did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> comics for crime, it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily. Publishers then developed the self-censorship Comics Code Authority.|$|E
25|$|Hussein {{decried the}} morale of those in his {{generation}} who sought to simply make a living instead of fighting for their rights. However, he did <b>not</b> <b>blame</b> this perceived submissiveness and aimlessness solely on the Arab youth themselves, but to {{the environment in which}} they grew up, with many having lived through the Nakba ("the Catastrophe"), the term used for the Palestinian exodus {{as a result of the}} establishment of Israel, and the ensuing 1948 Arab-Israeli War. According to Hussein, the neighboring Arab states reacted to the Palestinian Arab calamity by replacing their old leadership. However, in the case of the Palestinians in Israel, the old leadership was restored to control the Arab community on behalf of the state.|$|E
