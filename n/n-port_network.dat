40|$|The {{measurement}} of the scattering matrices of n-port networks is an important task. For this purpose two ports of the <b>n-port</b> <b>network</b> are connected with the network analyzer and the remaining ports are connected to reflecting terminations. In order to specify the scattering matrix of a <b>n-port</b> <b>network</b> with the multi-port method (Rolfes et al., 2005), n reflecting terminations are required from which at least one reflection factor needs to be known. There are some cases, in which the multi-port method shows weak convergence properties. For example, a T-junction cannot be identified if the reflecting terminations used are short circuits and if the line length is equivalent to a multiple of a half wavelength. This {{is due to the}} fact that the two ports connected to the network analyzer become isolated.

40|$|A {{microwave}} reflectometer is {{an instrument}} to measure a complex ratio between reflected and incident waves at an input port of a uniform transmission line terminated in a Device Under Test (DUT). The conventional reflectometer is formed by a four-port network with two ports connected to a microwave source and DUT, and the remaining ports coupled to a heterodyne receiver which acts as a Complex Ratio Detector (CRT). By using the heterodyne receiver technique, the two microwave signals are converted in the linear manner to an Intermediate Frequency (IF) of hundreds of kHz where they are processed using digital means. The use of the heterodyne technique enables a very large dynamic range of 100 dB or more {{for this type of}} reflectometer. However, as the ratio of two original microwave signals has to be preserved at IF, a very advanced electronic circuitry is required to accomplish the linear conversion process. This complicated electronics leads to a large size of the conventional reflectometer and its high price tag. Many applications require compactsize and low-cost reflectometers. They can be built using N-port networks, with N being greater than 5, equipped only in scalar (power) detectors. This chapter describes the concept of a multi-port reflectometer which employs scalar instead of complex ratio detector to determine the complex reflection coefficient of DUT. It is shown that such a device requires a suitable calibration and mathematical transformations of the measured power at selected ports of the N-port to obtain the complex reflection coefficient of DUT. Because of this requirement, the multi-port reflectometer uses a computer to perform calibrations and measurements.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the transformerless synthesis of passive electrical networks, which is motivated by mechanical control based on inerters. Passive network synthesis is a significant topic of circuits and systems theory, which is to physically design a circuit containing passive components according to a given function describing the network, such as an impedance, admittance, transfer function, etc. The most general one-port transformerless realization approach, Bott-Duffin procedure, always generates many redundant elements, and the transformerless realization problem for multi-port passive networks is still an open question. After the 1970 s, research interest of passive network synthesis has declined due to the rapid development of integrated circuits. More than one decade ago, a new kind of passive mechanical elements named the inerter was invented, which completes the analogy between passive mechanical and electrical systems. As a result, passive network synthesis {{can be applied to the}} design of passive mechanical networks, which has been successfully utilized in a series of mechanical control systems, such as vehicle suspensions, train suspensions, machine vibration systems, etc. Such a passive control method can have lower cost and higher reliability compared with the active control approach, and it has been shown that the introduction of the inerter can certainly enhance the system performances. Since in practice mechanical systems usually require low complexity due to the limitation of weight and space, research interest in transformerless synthesis of passive networks become significant and urgent for more effective mechanical control. In this thesis, the minimal realizability problem of a biquadratic impedance with double poles and zeros as a seven-element series-parallel network is investigated, which is the series or parallel connection of a three-element seriesparallel network and a four-element series-parallel network. Such a class of biquadratic impedances can provide fast transitions, which is expected to have advantages in some mechanical systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for such a realizability is presented. This thesis also solves the minimal realization problem for a third-order real symmetric matrix as the admittance of a three-port resistive network. A necessary and sufficient condition for the realizability is derived and the configurations to cover the condition are also presented. The investigation can provide guidance on minimal realization problems of more general <b>n-port</b> resistive <b>networks</b> and can be a first critical step toward solving the realizability of <b>n-port</b> RLC <b>networks.</b> Moreover, the results can be utilized to solve minimal realizations of one-port or two-port passive mechanical or electrical networks based on the elements extraction approach. In addition, this thesis {{is concerned with}} the realization problem for a class of transfer functions as a two-port RC ladder network with a specified gain. The cascade realization methodology and the continuous gain adjustment technique based on the congruent transformation are utilized.

An ideal conference network is one where the loss of signal is entirely due to the signal being split between multiple conference subscriber ports. That is, there are no dissipation losses within the network. The network must contain ideal transformers only and no resistances. An <b>n-port</b> ideal conference <b>network</b> exists if and only if there exists a conference matrix of order n. For instance, a 3-port conference network can be constructed with the well-known hybrid transformer circuit used for 2-wire to 4-wire conversion in telephone handsets and line repeaters. However, there is no order 3 conference matrix and this circuit does not produce an ideal conference network. A resistance is needed for matching which dissipates signal, or else signal is lost through mismatch.As mentioned above, a necessary condition for a conference matrix to exist is that n&minus;1 must be the sum of two squares. Where {{there is more than one}} possible sum of two squares for n&minus;1 there will exist multiple essentially different solutions for the corresponding conference network. This situation occurs at n of 26 and 66. The networks are particularly simple when n&minus;1 is a perfect square (n = 2, 10, 26, …).|$|R

They can be built using <b>N-port</b> <b>networks,</b> with N being greater than 5, equipped only in scalar (power) detectors. The thesis describes {{the concept of a}} multi-port reflectometer which determines the complex reflection coefficient of DUT with the use of scalar detectors instead of the complex ratio detector. It is shown that this device can be designed using an assembly of linear circuits in the form of quadrature (Q) and/or divider (D) hybrids. Assuming ideal operation of these components, it is shown that the reflection coefficient of DUT can be determined using simple mathematical operations on the power values measured by scalar detectors. Alternatively, it can be obtained from the intersection of power circles in a complex reflection coefficient plane. These simple mathematical expressions can be used to obtain an approximate real-time operation of reflectometer. For more accurate results, the multi-port has to be calibrated using calibration standards. A review of full calibration methods for a multi-port reflectometer is presented. In order to obtain wideband performance, the multi-port reflectometer has to be formed by components all having wideband performance. To obtain its low manufacturing cost, these components should preferably be of planar format and lead to a full integration of reflectometer. The thesis investigates a variety of planar couplers and dividers which can offer wideband performances. However, not all of them can lead to a fully integrated multi-port reflectometer. In order to overcome this shortfall, a multilayer microstrip-slot technique is proposed and investigated to obtain wideband components that can lead to a full integration of multi-port reflectometer. It is demonstrated that through the use of multilayer microstrip-slot technique, ultra wideband microwave 3 -dB couplers and two-way dividers of in-phase or out-of-phase type can be designed. It is shown that the chosen configurations of dividers are compatible with the 3 -dB couplers so that a fully integrated reflectometer can be formed. This compatibility is accomplished through the use of suitably designed microstrip to slotline transitions. An attractive feature of the designed couplers and dividers is that they are of sub-wavelength size and thus are very compact. A fine operation of these components is demonstrated via full electromagnetic wave simulations and experimental tests over and ultra wide frequency band of 3. 1 to 10. 6 GHz. Rogers substrate RO 4003 featuring a relative dielectric constant of 3. 38 and a loss tangent of 0. 0027 is chosen as a microwave substrate for the design of these components. The design and analysis are carried out with the commercially available full EM simulator CST Microwave Studio while the experimental tests are done with the Vector Network Analyser, HP 8510 C. By using these components, an ultra wideband complex ratio measuring unit (CRMU), which is the heart of a multi-port reflectometer, is designed. This CRMU is fully integrated and of compact size. Its operation over an ultra wide frequency band is demonstrated via simulations. A particular attention is paid to its real-time mode of operation. Using this mode of operation, the complex ratio of two waves can be displayed on an oscilloscope using an analog electronics performing simple mathematical operations on the measured powers by detectors. While discussing the operation of CRMU, the attention is paid to the location and spacing of power circles centres (q-points) which are used for geometrical interpretation of operation of this device. Good operation of CRMU in this approximate operation mode indicates that the device will operate very well when it is fully calibrated. For simulations of CRMU, CST Microwave Studio, Agilent’s Advanced Design System (ADS) and MATLAB software are applied. Having accomplished the successful design of CRMU, the last step includes the formation of a fully integrated multi-port reflectometer. To this purpose an extra circuitry including multilayer microstrip-slot 3 -dB couplers is added to CRMU. The purpose of this additional circuitry is to reroute the incident and reflected signals from the DUT to the input ports of CRMU. A few configurations of multi-port relectometer formed by multilayer microstrip-slot couplers or dividers are investigated via simulations with respect to real-time mode of operation. Then, the best performing configuration is selected for the final development. The device is manufactured in Rogers RO 4003 substrate. Its S-parameters are measured with HP 8510 C analyser and compared with the simulated values. Having obtained a relatively good agreement between the simulated and measured results, the device is calibrated using multiple calibration standards. Its operation is verified for selected DUTs by comparing the measured reflection coeffcients with those obtained using the conventional VNA (HP 8510 C) over an ultra wide frequency band. A relatively good agreement is obtained between the two sets of measured results. The obtained results prove that the multilayer microstrip-slot technology can successfully be used {{for the development of a}} compact low-cost and fully integrated UWB multi-port reflectometer. Because of its compact size and good electrical performance, this device can be used in many microwave sub-systems offering a limited space for implementation of microwave measurements.

[...] University of Washington, 1997 The {{design of}} 2 N-port {{networks}} that allow good power flow between N isolated resistors and a general, passive, <b>N-port</b> <b>network</b> is discussed. A new design procedure is derived by first solving a multiport matching problem exactly {{for a particular}} class of load network. Then a strategy to extend this design to general load networks is presented. A congruence transformation that approximately diagonalizes the impedance matrix of a given multiport over a band of frequencies is found. It is shown how this congruence transformation can be practically implemented as a network at microwave frequencies. This 2 N port transforming network is {{placed in front of}} the given multiport, so that the impedance looking into the transforming network consists of N approximately isolated impedances. Then N two port matching networks are designed to be placed between the isolated resistors and the input to the transforming network. These matching networks together with the transforming network constitute a 2 N port lossless coupling network with the desired performance. A specific multiport network model for array antennas is developed. A new expression for the power dissipated by a load with a Toeplitz immittance matrix, excited by a progressive phase signal, is derived. It is shown how the design of coupling networks at a particular frequency, and for a particular excitation pattern, is straightforward, but the performance can be unsatisfactory at other frequencies or with other excitation patterns. Results of several coupling network design techniques as applied to a feed network for a four element, linear array of slots at 3 GHz are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-An {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between}} the sensitivity coefficients and the K-matrix of n-port networks is presented. The results available on the K-matrix and the adjoint network approach for sensitivity computations will form the basis of the discussions. THE P-MATRIX ONSIDER a resistive <b>n-port</b> <b>network</b> N. Let 4 = C {gi} denote the column matrix of edge conductances of N. We shall denote by Jo. = {gio} the nominal value of @., The sensitivity coefficient matrix P = [pii] with respect to the Y-matrix of N will be defined as follows: Pij = 218 =Oo I where yii is the short-circuit driving-point admittance across port i of N. Pij will be referred to as the sensitivity coefficient of yii with respect to the conductance gj. It may be seen that the matrix P is of order it x e, where e is the number of edges in N. Without any loss of generality the graph of the network N may be assumed to be complete by permitting edges with zero admittances. It follows from the results of [l], [2] that where vkj (a,‘) is th e voltage across conductance gk when port j(i) is excited with a source of unit voltage and all the other ports are short-circuited. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Hence we get Pik IO = 80 = Cvk’ 12 (3) as a consequence of the no amplification property of resistive networks pik I 1. Let the port configuration T of N be in p parts Tl, T,, * *., Tp. Let the set of vertices in Ti be denoted by l$. Let To be a tree of N such that T c To.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to develop the basic techniques and computer programs for the interactive on-line computer aided design of linear microwave circuits. Initially all the possible types of microwave circuits were considered {{to see how they}} could be analysed in a computer program. The result of this was that {{it was found that the}} best way to analyse a microwave circuit was to consider the circuit to consist of an assembly of n-port networks, with the entire circuit consisting of a single <b>n-port</b> <b>network.</b> All the results of interest to the microwave engineer were described and the equations given for these. For the analysis of microwave circuits the chain matrix, nodal analysis and a new mixed matrix method of analysis were considered in detail and a comparison of the optimum method and computation time made. The result of this was that it was found that the chain matrix analysis was the fastest but of limited application whilst the new mixed matrix analysis was able to analyse any microwave circuit. The first computer programs developed by the author used the chain matrix analysis, the main one of these being the CHAIN 1 program. This program advanced the use of chain matrix analysis to its limit. A path topological analysis was included in the program which broke the circuit down into an assembly of cascades of 2 -port networks in the circuit. Thus it was not necessary to define the path topology precisely in the data. Later the MICRO 3 program was developed by the author to use the new mixed matrix analysis for a general assembly of n-port networks. This program was found to be far more versatile and almost any microwave circuit could be handled by the method of analysis used in this program. During the development of the programs, as each new program was developed, more facilities were included for the interactive on-line use of the programs. In the MICRO 3 program a list processing approach to the data structure in the program and a full syntactical analysis of the data was included. This made it possible to generate very complex data structures in the program thus making the program ideal for interactive on-line use on a computer. The data for this program was more like a programming language than normal data and any data error could be correct on-line during the run of the program. The program could be used on batch processing, on a remote teletype interactively or with a graphical display to display the results of an analysis in graphical form. An investigation into the equations describing microwave components and optimisation techniques was carried out. The MICRO 3 program was prepared for these facilities but there was not sufficient time to include these facilities completely...|$|E
40|$|Concurrency is {{a special}} kind of analog circuit {{parallelism}} that uses a single circuit with necessary bandwidth to process multiple signals at the same time. Concurrent radios offer a higher data rate and improved system diversity. Our comprehensive treatment comprises proposals for potential transceiver architectures, invention of circuit blocks, and provisions of innovative analysis methods. The analysis of concurrent circuits are often complex. To simplify noise analysis, a R^(N^ 2) -vector space is first proposed to re-formulate the <b>N-port</b> <b>network</b> noise modeling problem. Any internal physical source inside the noisy network contributes a small vector in the defined R^(N^ 2) -vector space, and the aggregate statistical behavior of this noisy network can be viewed as the vector sum of these vectors. Applying this concept to FET noise modeling leads to several modified FET noise models, in which three uncorrelated noise sources are sufficient to describe the statistical behavior of an intrinsic FET. The use of these new FET models can simplify the analysis, simulation, and optimization of low noise systems without sacrificing accuracy. Broadband low-noise amplifier is a critical block in concurrent receiver systems. We propose a novel low-noise weighted distributed amplifier (WDA) topology, which uses the internal finite-impulse-response filtering inside a conventional distributed amplifier to partially suppress internal thermal noise. A distinct advantage of this topology is its tolerance to input parasitic capacitance which can be used to provide good electro-static discharge (ESD) protection without sacrificing its noise performance and power consumption. A compact 3. 1 ─ 10. 6 GHz WDA IC is built on a 130 nm CMOS process. Experimental results show 2. 3 ─ 4. 5 dB NF at 23 mW power consumption. Using concurrency in wireless link can boost communication data rate. As a proof-of concept, we propose dynamically scalable concurrent communication by dividing the 7. 5 GHz bandwidth of the unlicensed 3. 1 ─ 10. 6 GHz spectrum into seven concurrent channels. A CMOS octa-core RF receiver is implemented to validate the idea. Based on the receiver measurement results, a wireless link can be built to achieve a 16 Gbps channel limit at five meter TX-RX distance at 400 mW power consumption. Tunable concurrency can improve the receiver diversity. A prototype 6 ─ 18 GHz concurrent tunable dual-band phased array receiver element IC is proposed and built on a 130 nm CMOS process. Experimental results demonstrate successful dual-band RF reception within a low band (6 ─ 10. 4 GHz) and high band (10. 4 ─ 18 GHz) with 300 MHz baseband bandwidth. A final four-element phased array receiver built from the prototyped ICs shows an array pattern with worst-case 21 dB peak-to-null ratio across all frequencies. Concurrency {{can also be used to}} achieve multi-beam reception by providing multiple phase-shifts for each RF signals and combining them separately at baseband outputs. A 10. 4 ─ 18 GHz concurrent dual-beam phased array receiver is proposed based on this concept, and is implemented on a 130 nm CMOS process. A final four-element phased array system shows successful concurrent dual-beam reception at the same RF frequency. Yu-Jiu Wang (209...|$|E
