40|$|Extended Abstract: The Cariboo {{region of}} British Columbia (B. C.) is the {{northern}} extent for many grassland-dwelling species at risk. The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>badger</b> (Taxidea taxus jeffersonii) is one endangered species {{that occurs in}} the grasslands of the Cariboo (Fig. 1). Badgers were previously thought to be at low densities in the Cariboo region {{because it is the}} limit of their distribution; however, the recent number of badger sightings suggests that there may be more badgers in the Cariboo than previously thought. In 2003, research began south of the community of 100 Mile House to (1) determine local distribution and relative abundance of badgers in the region, (2) locate and describe suitable burrowing habitat, and 3) identify key prey species. Herein, we report our preliminary findings within the study area (4337 km 2). Figure 1. The study area (2003) in relation to the estimated range of badgers in British Columbi...|$|E
2500|$|<b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>badgers</b> (Taxidea taxus) hunt Richardson's ground {{squirrels}} (Spermophilus richardsonii). The {{most common}} hunting technique is excavation of burrow systems, but plugging of openings into ground-squirrel tunnels accounts for 5–23% of hunting actions. Badgers usually use soil {{from around the}} tunnel opening, or soil dragged 30–270cm from a nearby mound to plug tunnels. The least common (6%), but most novel, form of plugging used by 1 badger involved movement of 37 objects from distances of 20–105cm to plug openings into 23 ground-squirrel tunnels on 14 nights.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the winter {{activities}} and burrow characteristics of <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>badgers</b> (Taxidea taxus jeffersonii). At the northern range-limit of these animals (British Columbia, Canada) winter is long and harsh and habitat patchy and atypical; thus, badgers may respond to winter differently here than elsewhere. Using radio-telemetry and remote-cameras, I documented winter activities of 16 badgers (12 ♀, 4 ♂) between 2007 and 2011. Similar to limited and anecdotal data collected elsewhere, badgers during winter reduced home range 3. 5 (SD = 0. 6) km 2 and movements 110. 5 (SD = 12. 2) m /day and intensively used burrows 1. 3 (SD = 0. 8) burrows per winter. Total winter burrow stay averaged 34 days (SD = 25. 0) per winter and this use coincided with the onset of torpor (first week in January). Despite intensive burrow-use, badgers emerged frequently (0. 30 ± 0. 07 events/camera-night) and displayed foraging behaviour (mean foray length: 46. 70 ± 65. 44 min). Burrow emergence was not related to temperature or snow depth; rather it was best explained by the amount of time elapsed since the badger entered the burrow in mid-winter (Julian Day). Despite these trends, winter activity was quite variable among individual badgers. I also compared the thermal properties of the burrows used by the badgers to those previously used in summer or for rearing offspring (natal). As expected, all burrow temperatures remained relatively mild and constant throughout the winter; however, winter burrows were significantly cooler during this time than burrows that had been used in the previous summer, albeit a small difference (average 1. 9 o C). Snow depth at winter burrows did not differ from ‘summer burrows’, yet natal burrows had significantly less snow. Analysis revealed that soil fan size, number of entrances, horizontal cover, presence of infrastructure, and a coarse description of habitat differentiated seasonal burrow types relatively well. I suggest that individual variation (strategies) may be a response to local conditions. Relatively small, patchy, atypical habitat, in combination with extremely large summer home ranges may limit the ability of some animals to gain sufficient fat reserves, thus necessitating additional foraging during winter. Moreover, my research suggests that seasonal burrows differ with respect to measurable habitat features that can be used to identify and protect important burrows (natal and winter burrow). This study has been the first dedicated winter ecology study of free ranging <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>badgers</b> and has expanded our knowledge about the winter activities, movements and burrow use of this endangered species. As winter is a critical time in the life history of many mammals, an effective management plan will require an understating of species ecology across all seasons.

40|$|The Big Sur Land Trust {{contracted}} Connectivity for Wildlife LLC (CFW), {{a wildlife}} research organization, {{to conduct a}} wildlife connectivity study in the Central Coast of California. Using extensive field work combined with Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling CFW documents species presence and ground-truths habitat suitability models to better understand wildlife movement patterns and identify lands and waterways that provide important connectivity between core habitat areas for wildlife between Central Coast mountain ranges including the Sierra de Salinas, Santa Lucia, Santa Cruz and Gabilan mountains. Data was collected by camera trap stations, wildlife track and sign surveys and documented road-kill incidents. Results {{may be used to}} inform the Land Trust’s conservation initiatives, stewardship and education programs and to aid policy makers and planners in developing compensatory mitigation and infrastructure design considerations that protect and enhance critical wildlife linkages throughout California’s Central Coast. This study began in October 2008 and is ongoing. This report discusses data collected from a monitoring period of October 2008 through December 2009 and focused on the Highway 68 corridor and the area around Marks Ranch, Toro Park, and Fort Ord Natural Reserve – protected lands that sit {{at the north end of}} the Sierra de Salinas Mountains and level off to the north into the grassland, maritime chaparral, oak woodland, coastal scrub and dune habitats of the coastal plain along the southern end of the Monterey Bay. Understanding wildlife movement in this region is a priority for The Big Sur Land Trust because of the organization’s investment in Marks Ranch and conservation initiatives within the Sierra de Salinas Mountain Range. Highway 68 separates Marks Ranch and Toro Park from the Fort Ord Natural Reserve. El Toro Creek passes under a bridge on Highway 68 providing safe passage and habitat for wildlife moving between the uplands of the Sierra de Salinas and the lowland habitats toward Monterey Bay. A total of 404 individual detections were recorded using riparian habitat and safe passage afforded by the creek and bridge. Results of this portion of the study conclude that this region facilitates a high degree of wildlife movement. The data collected to date, combined with aerial imagery, habitat suitability models and other GIS tools graphically demonstrate that the narrow undeveloped gap that exists between the relatively dense housing along San Benancio Road and Toro Park Estates serves as an active linkage for animals moving between the uplands of the Sierra de Salinas mountains and the lowland, dune and other suitable coastal habitats of the Fort Ord Reserve and the shores of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Policy makers and planners seeking to sustain connectivity and minimize negative impacts on wildlife populations in this region should consider development configurations that accommodate existing movement paths for wildlife. Any proposed and future development in these relatively intact natural lands without primary regard for wildlife, their habitat requirements and movement patterns could effectively and completely isolate populations and individuals of such sensitive and large ranging species as the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>badger</b> and mountain lion. The isolation of these populations could lead to their local extinction in otherwise viable lowland and coastal habitats along the southern portion of Monterey Bay...|$|E
