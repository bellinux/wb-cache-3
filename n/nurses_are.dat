5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered <b>nurses</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of}} the patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E

This qualitative study seeks to gain an understanding of the perceptions of active nurses in Pakistan about nursing art and yields four major themes: artful <b>nursing</b> <b>is</b> embedded in humane responsiveness, artful nursing has healing power, artful <b>nursing</b> <b>is</b> a satisfying experience, and artful <b>nursing</b> <b>is</b> invisible in <b>nursing</b> practice. Study participants valued nursing art, and their perceptions illuminate Watson 2 ̆ 7 s Theory of Human Caring (1988) ...|$|R

Similar to other professionals, both types of nurses can only work within their licensed scope of practice, training, and certification.|$|E

Nurses also help doctors perform diagnostic tests. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> almost always working {{on their own or}} with other nurses.
