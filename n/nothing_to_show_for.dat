5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of General Flagg, Hawk assumes command of the G.I. Joe team, but is still advised by General Austin. Operations at The Pit keep him busy, so Hawk relegates field command to Duke. When General Austin later suffers a heart attack, he retires and {{promotes}} Hawk to Brigadier General, giving him command of the entire G.I. Joe operation. After the G.I.

25|$|While Dupont lingered at Andújar {{with two}} {{divisions}} (Generals Barbou and Fresia), attempting {{to master the}} strategic Madrid—Seville highway and the wide plains which it crossed, Castaños' four divisions advanced steadily {{from the south and}} guerrillas from Granada marched to bar the road to the sierra and La Mancha beyond. Vedel's division was posted east to Bailén with a view to guarding these nearby mountain passes and on July 1 Vedel was forced to dispatch a brigade under General Cassagne to curb the advance of the guerrillas on Jaén and La Carolina, stretching the French line still further east. Meanwhile, General Liger-Belair with 1,500 men moved into a forward post at Mengibar, a village on the south bank of the Guadalquivir. At Andújar a tower by the river was fortified and small field works constructed on the south bank to forestall an enemy crossing, but, the Guadalquivir being fordable at so many points, and open to fire from the surrounding hills, Dupont's defences did not inspire much confidence. Cassagne, after driving the guerrillas off in rout, returned to Bailén on July 5 with 200 dead or wounded and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> his exertion—the Spaniards having plundered the towns of all provisions.|$|E

According to official records the rebels lost four killed on the Drewry and the Scorpion plus fifteen wounded. However, some sources cite the rebels as having lost at least six men on the Virginia II alone. Ultimately the Confederate force failed in its main objective of attacking City Point and they had to return to Chaffin's Bluff with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> the advance other than a mess for ships, most of which sustained some type of battle damage. Commodore Mitchell was relieved of command and replaced by Admiral Raphael Semmes, who commanded CSS Alabama in her battle with USS Kearsarge off Cherbourg, France. Exactly two months after the battle, the Petersburg Campaign ended with General Robert E. Lee's final decision to evacuate the city. When the Southern capital of Richmond fell on April 3, the James River Squadron was scuttled to prevent their falling into enemy hands. The battle of Trent's Reach was the last important naval engagement of the Main Eastern Theater.|$|E

Why is it that, into the twenty-first century, with the convenience of practically any type of red meat or fish available at the local supermarket, we continue to hunt game and fish on open waters? The answer is that no matter how sophisticated we think we are, no matter how technologically advanced we become, there is still something deep within us that beckons us to “the hunt. ” This desire creates the customs, beliefs, and rituals related to hunting—for deer, hogs, and other four-legged critters, as well as fish and snakes, and other things that perhaps aren’t physically alive, but capture our interest as much as the prey mentioned above. These rituals and customs lead to some of our most treasured stories, legends, and practices. This volume of the Publications of the Texas Folklore Society includes serious, introspective articles on hunting and fishing, as well as humorous tall tales and “windies” about the big ones that got away—all lore that reminds us of that drive that calls us to become predators again...|$|R

Despite being highly criticized for his morals, Wolfe was responsible for making women’s wrestling profitable. Instead of being viewed as a sideshow, Wolfe tried to make it respectable.

Susenyos' first campaign against them, which began in February 1629 with raising an army of 30,000 men in Gojjam, was defeated and his son-in-law Gebra Krestos slain.

2500|$|Greene {{recognizes the}} [...] "great bases" [...] of line 3 to be a manor house which carry over into his {{understanding}} of the Second Quatrain. According to Greene, this [...] "manor house is faintly sustained by [...] "ruining", [...] "dwellers", [...] "rent", and the possible allusion to compound and simple interest". This economic terminology transforms the actions of the suitors into a sort of currency that is spent too quickly. In line 7, the compound sweet is seen by Greene as an artificial confection or overwrought style of poetry in great use by the other suitors who are themselves poets. It is a reference to Sonnet 76 in [...] "which the poet reproached himself for omitting it from his own verse". The symbolism behind dwellers and rent is meant to show {{that a large number of}} people are offering grand gestures of affection with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> it in the end. There is no returned investment when you rent a property, because the owner receives and retains all of the expense you put into it. Greene puts a great deal of meaning to the closing line of the Second Quatrain. According to Greene, the word [...] "spent" [...] means bankrupted, exhausted, and failed while also referring to being [...] "drained of semen". He sums this up by adding, [...] "Unsuccessful entrepreneurs, with only the groundworks built of their mansion of love, the failure of their misguided, formalist generosity is symbolized by the suitors' symbolic distance from their prize, observable but not touchable". The suitors are [...] "pittifull thrivors" [...] who have expended so much to win affection only to find themselves wanting.|$|E

The Century, Scribner's, the Cosmopolitan, McClure's, and I know not what others, were still unimagined by five, and ten, and twenty years, and the Galaxy was to flash and fade before any of them should kindle its more effectual fires. The Nation, which was destined to chastise rather than nurture our young literature, had still six years of dreamless potentiality before it; and the Nation was always more Bostonian than New-Yorkish by nature, whatever it was by nativity.|$|R

However, when Billie hides in the Amish-like [...] "Camdenite" [...] settlement, she has a change of heart. She divorces Earl and gives him the rest of her insurance settlement money.|$|R
6000|$|If, dear Reader, {{you will}} {{faithfully}} observe these Rules, and so give my little book a really fair trial, I promise you, most confidently, {{that you will}} find Symbolic Logic {{to be one of}} the most, if not the most, fascinating of mental recreations! In this First Part, I have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of (say) twelve or fourteen years of age. I have myself taught most of its contents, vivâ voce, to many children, and have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject. For those, who succeed in mastering Part I, and who begin, like Oliver, [...] "asking for more," [...] I hope to provide, in Part II, some tolerably hard nuts to crack----nuts that will require all the nut-crackers they happen to possess! [...] pg-xiii Mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental health; and you may get much healthy enjoyment, no doubt, from Games, such as Back-gammon, Chess, and the new Game [...] "Halma". But, after all, when you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these Games, you have <b>nothing</b> real <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> it, as a result! You enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, at the time: but you have no result that you can treasure up and get real good out of. And, all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect mine of wealth. Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a mental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that will be of real use to you in any subject you may take up. It will give you clearness of thought----the ability to see your way through a puzzle----the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and get-at-able form----and, more valuable than all, the power to detect fallacies, and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments, which you will so continually encounter in books, in newspapers, in speeches, and even in sermons, and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating Art. Try it. That is all I ask of you! ...|$|R
40|$|Positioned in {{the context}} of the technology-based {{industrial}} emergence literature, this dissertation identifies and examines organizational, managerial, and institutional challenges that small and medium sized Finnish biotechnology companies have encountered during the emergence of the field as an industry. Based on the results, central Implications for research, management and policy are suggested. The five separate studies that constitute this dissertation fill specific, clearly demarcated gaps in the underlying literature that have not been explicitly scrutinized in extant works. The contributions are made in three domains that are central to the emergence of technology-based industries: In the academic domain the dissertation brings forth new knowledge on bridging the gaps between academia and industry in university-industry technology transfer (UITT) that has previously been found to be riddled with challenges. The dissertation adds to the understanding on the role and value of organizational practices performed by universities and their respective technology transfer offices (TTO) to overcome the challenges and to bring forth university inventions to industrial and societal use. TTOs are found to lower the threshold of UITT stakeholders to participate in and sustain the process of UITT, to facilitate congruence between the features of scientific discoveries and specific market needs, and to mitigate the detrimental effects that opportunistic incentive structures of diverse stakeholders can have on UITT. In the business domain, the dissertation establishes that academia-based start-ups are at a relative disadvantage regarding their capabilities to attract financing, recruit skilled labor, and design viable business strategies - mostly due to a lack of business-related skills, experience and vision as well as an enchaining bond to academic culture, principles and incentives. Young, high-quality firms are also found to suffer most severely from information asymmetry related problems, because they often have <b>nothing</b> tangible <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> their actual quality and cannot distinguish themselves from so-called lemons. Hence, their capital is under-valued on financial markets. Finally, contributing in the public policy domain the dissertation reveals that strategically weak governmental funding can have two disadvantageous externalities: First, due to information-asymmetry-related difficulties in differentiating between high-quality companies and lemons, risk capital instruments in particular tend to support only the latter type of companies, as high-quality companies refrain from applying for such funding in the first place. And second, governmental funding instruments that do not factor in the compatibility of the business models, contents and embeddedness of funding recipients with their respective regional industry structure tend to artificially ventilate businesses that would not otherwise be viable in these specific regions...|$|R
