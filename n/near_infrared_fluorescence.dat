Here we report on the early use of poorly water-soluble chlorophyll with <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>fluorescence</b> extracted from the leaf of Chimonanthus salicifolius, for mouse axillary SLN mapping. Methods and results: To improve the water solubility and SLN targeting of the chlorophyll, we encapsulated the chlorophyll in nanoscale liposomes. The liposome-coated chlorophyll nanocomposites obtained were spherical in shape and had an average diameter of 21. 7 &plusmn; 6. 0 nm. The nanocomposites dispersed well in water, and in aqueous suspension they exhibited brighter <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>fluorescence</b> than chlorophyll alone. After incubation of the nanocomposites with normal liver cells (QSG- 7701) and macrophage cells (Ana- 1) for no more than 48 hours, there was no obvious reduction in cell viability. When the nanocomposites were injected intradermally into the paw of a mouse, the axillary SLN was found to be strongly fluorescent and was easily visualized in real time without a requirement for surgery. The intensity of the <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>fluorescence</b> emitted by the SLN was obviously brighter than that emitted by the SLN of another mouse that had been intradermally injected with chlorophyll alone.

Through fluorescence imaging, the cell uptake and tumor accumulation of FA-IHA NPs were observed in vitro and in vivo, analyzed by confocal microscopy and NIR fluorescence imaging in tumor xenograft mice. Based on the diagnostic results, FA-IHA NPs at 24  h post injection and combined with NIR irradiation (808  nm, 1  W/cm 2) could efficiently suppress tumor growth through a photo-chemo combination therapy, with no tumor recurrence in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry requires narrow {{variability in the}} dissolution rate of hard gelatin capsules. To test this property, gelatin is aged in high temperature and humidity conditions to mimic gelatin shelf-life. These conditions induce cross-link formation in gelatin chains and change {{the properties of the}} capsule. Gelatin is produced worldwide in various environmental conditions. This study set out to evaluate the impact of geographic production origin on gelatin composition, before and after aging treatment, and on its dissolution properties. Non-aged and aged pig skin gelatins from three different production plants (A, B and C) were analyzed in raw granules and in powder by <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> and <b>fluorescence</b> spectroscopy to identify the mechanisms of cross-link formation during aging. Gelatin composition (lipids, dityrosine, 3, 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)) and oxidation level, before and after aging, varied according to production origin.
