5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers could <b>not</b> <b>find</b> a clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of}} the series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E
5|$|Brothers Cory and Todd Edwards founded Blue Yonder Films after {{a number}} of years spent {{producing}} commercials and music videos in Tulsa.

5|$|Casting {{the role}} of Dimitri gave All My Children difficulty.

5|$|Coenraad Jacob Temminck first {{described}} the Japanese serow in 1836, and named it Antilope crispa. John Edward Gray gave it its current name in 1846.

5|$|Early on, Lull {{postulated}} that the frills may {{have served as}} anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles.

5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was not useful for homing on a target, so some system of direction indication was required. The team seriously considered phase comparison as a solution, but could <b>not</b> <b>find</b> a suitable phase shifting circuit.|$|E
5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done in the same area.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice {{completed}} {{the investigation into}} Jowers' claims but did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> evidence to support allegations about conspiracy.

40|$|Does early {{detection}} of renovascular hypertension improve outcomes?
