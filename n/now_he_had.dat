5|$|He {{would have}} tried to reconquer the {{province}} if he had the resources, but <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.|$|E
5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation {{less than three months}} into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E
25|$|By <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a {{favourite}} plane, {{serial number}} E5947. He would run off {{a series of}} seven victories in it, with the last being his 13th win on 6 September 1918. A squadron-mate then ruined it with a fast hard landing.|$|E
60|$|For {{just one}} moment we have a seeming flash of {{comprehension}} of, the Kanaka's reason for exiling himself: he goes away to acquire civilization. Yes, he was naked and not ashamed, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> is clothed and knows how to be ashamed; <b>he</b> was unenlightened; <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a Waterbury watch; <b>he</b> was unrefined, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> jewelry, and something to make him smell good; he was a nobody, a provincial, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been to far countries and can show off.|$|R

His winning string continued into September with four more victims joining his list, the last on 14 September. By <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> 16 accredited claims. He was awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern on the 19th.|$|E
25|$|Hay {{was back}} with Derbyshire in the 1878 season, still beating Hickton to {{the mantle of}} second-choice bowler, though <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to shake {{competition}} off from John Platts, in the same position. Though he never played {{as often as he}} did during the 1878 season on any further occasions, Hay's round-arm bowling was at times preferred to John Platts' occasional deceptively-layered pace. In the 1879 season Hay put in fewer games for Derbyshire as he was playing for Keighley.|$|E
25|$|He {{achieved}} his 150th victory which earning him the Oak Leaves to the Knight' Cross on 14 January 1945 by {{this time}} his score stood at 156 kills. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been promoted {{to the rank of}} Hauptmann and was Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of III./JG 51. His final victory came on the 25 April 1945. Joachim Brendel finished the War with 189 victories and emerged as JG 51 highest scorer on the Eastern Front, including over 90 heavily armored Ilyushin Sturmoviks.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 23 May, Gort ordered a retreat from Arras. By <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no faith in the Weygand plan, nor in Weygand's {{proposal}} at least to try to hold a pocket on the Flemish coast, a so-called Réduit de Flandres. Gort knew that the ports needed to supply such a foothold were already being threatened. That same day, the 2nd Panzer Division had assaulted Boulogne. The British garrison there surrendered on 25 May, although 4,286 men were evacuated by Royal Navy ships. The RAF also provided air cover, denying the Luftwaffe an opportunity to attack the shipping.|$|E
25|$|At the 1922 election, Labour {{replaced}} the Liberals {{as the main}} opposition party to the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin, making MacDonald Leader of the Opposition. By <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{moved away from the}} Labour left and abandoned the socialism of his youth: he strongly opposed the wave of radicalism that swept through the labour movement {{in the wake of the}} Russian Revolution of 1917 and became a determined enemy of Communism. Unlike the French Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Labour Party did not split and the Communist Party of Great Britain remained small and isolated.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand's chief administrator, Walter Hadlee, had {{advocated}} a compromise from the start. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{no objection to}} WSC making a brief tour of his country in November, nor {{was he going to}} stop the Kiwis' best player, his son Richard, from appearing with WSC. The South Africans, subject to an international boycott caused by the apartheid policy of their government, were keen to see their individual cricketers compete with the world’s best. Some were prepared to acclaim South Africa as the best side of the world {{on the basis of the}} performances of some of their players in WSC.|$|E

25|$|In 1796 Shah Zaman {{crossed the}} Indus {{for the third}} time and planned to capture Delhi. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> raised an Afghan army of 3000 men. He was {{confident}} numerous Indians would join him. Nawab of Kasur had already assured him help. Sahib Singh of Patiala declared his intention to help Shah Zaman. Shah Zaman was also assured of help by the Rohillas, Wazir of Oudh, and Tipu Sultan of Mysore. The news of Shah Zaman's invasion spread quickly and people began fleeing to the hills for safety. By December Shah Zaman occupied territory up to Jhelum. When he reached Gujrat (Punjab), Sahib Singh Bhangi panicked and left the place.|$|E
25|$|Until <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been batting in {{the middle}} of the order, but at the end of June 1966 he was given the chance to open the batting, with Mickey Stewart {{dropping}} down the order. This transformed his fortunes, and he struck up a productive opening partnership with John Edrich. The pair would go on to have 17 century partnerships for the first wicket. Edwards made his first century that season, and reached 1,000 runs, the first of five occasions on which he did so. In 21 matches he made 1,064 runs at 30.40. He also held 41 catches, almost two catches per match. During the season he was awarded his county cap.|$|E
25|$|The {{disciplinary}} problems continued. Mannerheim heartily {{disliked the}} school and the narrow social circles in Hamina. He rebelled by going on leave without permission in 1886, for which he was expelled from the Finnish Cadet Corps. Mannerheim next attended the Helsinki Private Lyceum, and passed his university entrance examinations in June 1887. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a better school report to show than the one from the Finnish Cadet Corps. He wrote to his godmother, Baroness Alfhild Scalon de Coligny, who had connections at the Russian court, to help him enter the Nicholas Cavalry School. His real wish was to join the Chevalier Guard; but his relatives balked at the costs, so he dropped it. Mannerheim's godmother invited him to her husband's country house, Lukianovka, in summer 1887. There Gustaf worked to improve his Russian. While in Russia, he spent some time at a military camp at Chuguyev, which strengthened his decision to choose a career in the military.|$|E

25|$|Back in Venice, Casanova {{started his}} {{clerical}} law career and was admitted as an abbé after being conferred minor orders by the Patriarch of Venice. He shuttled {{back and forth}} to Padua to continue his university studies. By <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become something of a dandy—tall and dark, his long hair powdered, scented, and elaborately curled. He quickly ingratiated himself with a patron (something he was to do all his life), 76-year-old Venetian senator Alvise Gasparo Malipiero, the owner of Palazzo Malipiero, close to Casanova's home in Venice. Malipiero moved in the best circles and taught young Casanova a great deal about good food and wine, and how to behave in society. However, Casanova was caught dallying with Malipiero's intended object of seduction, actress Teresa Imer, and the senator drove both of them from his house. Casanova's growing curiosity about women led to his first complete sexual experience, with two sisters, Nanetta and Marton Savorgnan, then fourteen and sixteen, who were distant relatives of the Grimanis. Casanova proclaimed that his life avocation was firmly established by this encounter.|$|E
25|$|He {{also began}} to visit the Paris Conservatoire library, seeking out scores of Gluck's operas and making {{personal}} copies of parts of them. He recalled in his Mémoires his first encounter with Luigi Cherubini, the Conservatoire's then music director. Cherubini attempted to throw the impetuous Berlioz out of the library since {{he was not a}} formal music student at that time. Berlioz also heard two operas by Gaspare Spontini, a composer who influenced him through their friendship, and whom he later championed when working as a critic. From then on, he devoted himself to composition. He was encouraged in his endeavors by Jean-François Le Sueur, director of the Royal Chapel and professor at the Conservatoire. In 1823, he wrote his first article—a letter to the journal Le corsaire defending Spontini's La vestale. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> composed several works including Estelle et Némorin and Le passage de la mer Rouge (The Crossing of the Red Sea)– both now lost;– the latter of which convinced Le Sueur to take Berlioz on as one of his private pupils.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} Low and [...] "Heroes", Bowie {{spent much}} of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing {{the music of the}} first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was [...] "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage.... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends." [...] Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage, released the same year.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 4/5July, Nos.463 and 467 Squadrons bombed supply depots for V-weapons near Saint-Leu-d'Esserent. Brill's Lancaster was {{attacked}} by three German night fighters, but {{he was able to}} evade them with only a few bullets striking his plane. His [...] "fine leadership and courage" [...] during the action earned him a bar to his DFC; the award was promulgated in The London Gazette on 16January 1945. Brill completed his second tour of operations later in July but stayed on to fly more missions, often mentoring less experienced crews. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> earned a reputation for being quite [...] "mad", as he would often circle back and check over his handiwork after a bombing run, rather than making his escape from the target area as quickly as possible. During non-operational periods, he made a habit of taking a Lancaster on a so-called test flight to the southern border of Northern Ireland, where he and his crew would change into civilian clothes, cross into Ireland and stock up on food and liquor for a party back at Waddington; he always made a point of inviting the Air Officer Commanding RAAF Overseas Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, to such events, which Wrigley attended without fail. Brill handed over command of No.467 Squadron on 12October 1944, becoming the first man to survive his time as its leader. He had flown a total of 58 missions in Bomber Command when he returned to Australia in the new year. On 29January 1945 he married Ilma Kitto, a teacher, at Ganmain's Methodist Church. The couple had been engaged since before the war; they later had two sons and a daughter.|$|E
2500|$|He married Carolyn Bockius of Wilmington {{and settled}} in Chadds Ford in 1908 {{to raise a family}} on [...] near the {{historic}} Brandywine battlefield. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> left Pyle, and commissions were coming in quickly. His hope had been that he would make enough money with his illustrations {{to be able to afford}} the luxury of painting what he wanted; but as his family and income grew, he found it difficult to break from illustration.|$|E
