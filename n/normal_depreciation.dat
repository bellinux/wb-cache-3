40|$|The Government of Pakistan, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, has opted for tax holidays as an important fiscal measure to encourage rapid industrialisation in the backward areas. This concession is also supplemented by several other economic and non-economic measures including import duty, and depreciation allowances. Mintz (1990) discusses the efficacy of tax holidays {{in the presence of}} accelerated depreciation allowances concludes that tax holidays which are designed to increase capital formation may end up penalising capital formation. Mintz’s (1990) conclusion {{is based on the assumption}} that if the assets are long-lived, and the income tax system allows deductibility of accelerated depreciation but cannot be deferred, then the tax holidays, by preventing depreciation deduction in the early period may actually penalise investment during the tax holiday period. If on the other hand the depreciation allowance is deferred till the end of tax holiday period, the tax system is genuinely generous and provides a real incentive for capital formation. In Pakistan the tax code are such that the firms in the tax holidays region are not allowed to claim or defer accelerated depreciation allowance but can claim <b>normal</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowance only after the expiry of tax holidays period. Whereas the firms in developed areas can claim both accelerated (25 percent) and <b>normal</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances (10 percent) annually. Import duty concession is given for most of the underdeveloped areas and few of the developed areas. These different sets of incentives affects the cost of capital and hence investment differently. The purpose of the present paper is to see these effects by computing the cost of capital for developed and under developed areas. This will help us to examine whether the tax holidays as an incentive is effective or act as a barrier to claim other generous concession like the depreciation allowance. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the biggest}} {{knowledge}} gaps in bridge asset management is reliable infor-mation on the deterioration rate of bridge components. The overwhelming need for bridge reha-bilitation in North America demands good field information and reliable forecasting data to de-termine appropriate bridge management strategies. A novel approach to improving this information shortfall consists of characterizing a bridge and its components in terms of Depre-ciation, Defects, and Damage. Depreciation is a simple deterministic measure based on the age and deemed life expectancy of the component. Defects are undesirable but non-threatening component attributes not caused by <b>normal</b> <b>depreciation</b> and are field identified and quantified during inspection. Similarly, Damage is any transformation of a component to a structurally weaker condition. Confining bridge inspection quantities to the less subjective measures of De-fects and Damage will yield an improved understanding of bridge component deterioration and, it is proposed that a more consistent bridge condition metric will evolve...|$|E

40|$|Comments welcome Existing {{proposals}} {{to escape from}} a liquidity trap and deflation, including my “Foolproof Way, ” {{are discussed in the}} light of the optimal way to escape. The optimal way involves three elements: (1) an explicit central-bank commitment to a higher future price level; (2) a concrete action that demonstrates the central bank’s commitment, induces expectations of a higher future price level and jump-starts the economy; and (3) an exit strategy that specifies when and how to get back to <b>normal.</b> A currency <b>depreciation</b> is a direct consequence of expectations of a higher future price level and hence an excellent indicator of those expectations. Furthermore, an intentional currency depreciation and a crawling peg, as in the Foolproof Way, can implement the optimal way and, in particular, induce the desired expectations of a higher future price level. I conclude that the Foolproof Way is likely to work well for Japan, which is in a liquidity trap now, as well as for the euro area and the United States, in case either would fall into a liquidity trap in the future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing Policy (QQE) of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) by transmission channels in comparison with those of the Comprehensive Monetary Easing Policy (CE) and the subsequent monetary easing policies (2010 - 2012), based on the event study using financial market data. As for the QQE under <b>normal</b> market conditions, <b>depreciation</b> of foreign exchange rate in the context of portfolio balance channel functions quite strongly, while as for the CE, signaling channel through the commitment and credit easing channel at the dysfunctional markets work. The direct inflation expectation channel is weak for both QQE and CE, although the QQE has adopted various ways to exert a direct and strong influence on inflation expectation. It can be conjectured that the gradual rise in inflation expectation comes mainly from other channels like the depreciation of the yen. The most crucial characteristic of the QQE is to maximize the potential effects of easing policy by explicitly doubling and later tripling the purchased amount of JGBs and then the monetary base proportionally. The amount of JGB purchases by the BOJ surpasses the issuance amount of JGBs, thereby reducing the outstanding amount of JGBs in the markets. Shortage of safety assets would increase the convenience yield, which itself would reduce the economic welfare and not permeate the yields of other risky assets theoretically. This paper then {{examines the}} impact of reduction in JGBs on yield spreads between corporate bonds and JGBs based on money-in-utility type model applied to JGBs, and finds that at least severe scarcity situations of JGBs as safe assets are avoided, since the size of Japan’s public debt outstanding is the largest in the world. Even so, the event study shows no clear evidence that the decline in the yield of long-maturity JGBs induced by the QQE permeates the yields of corporate bonds. Recently demands for JGBs have been increasing from both domestic and foreign investors as collaterals after the Global Financial Crisis and from financial institutions that have to correspond to strengthened global liquidity regulation, while the Government of Japan is planning to consolidate the public debts. These recent changes as well as market expectation for future path of JGB amounts should also be taken account of to examine the scarcity of safe assets in case of further massive purchases of JGBs. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the Stock of Fixed Assets in Chile, consistent with the macroeconomic measurements of the System of National Accounts (SNA) of the United Nations. In agreement with the recommendations of revision 3 of the SNA, the Stock of Fixed Assets was determined, for the Chilean economy as a whole, at constant prices based 1986, and at current prices. For the calculation of the Stock of Fixed Assets at constant prices, the Perpetual Inventory Method was used, as proposed by the United Nations. This method accumulates the annual Gross Fixed Capital Formation by type of asset and deducts the <b>normal</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the Capital in the productive activity. Additionally, from the levels obtained at constant prices, the Stock of Fixed Assets at current prices was calculated applying appropriated indices of price. The results are referred to the series 1985 – 2000, and are divided in Stock of Capital at constant and at current prices. ...|$|E
40|$|Current {{economic}} conditions are forcing {{a number of}} farmers to re-appraise their programmes of machinery replacement. Historically plant {{has been a significant}} component of Total Farm Capital on many New Zealand farms, particularly those involved with cropping. Recent substantial increases in the purchasing price of all items of farm machinery have meant that <b>normal</b> <b>depreciation</b> reserves are no longer capable of financing the replacement of major items of plant. The small farmer particularly is faced with this problem, and due to low usage rates and consequent high overhead costs, many large items of agricultural equipment are beyond his resources. In addition, wage inflation has encouraged the substitution of capital for labour. An existing alternative to the purchase of machinery is the use of contract services, but farmers find this a costly alternative for some types of operation. Additionally where timeliness is important, they may be reluctant to rely heavily on outside operators. A second alternative which is gaining popularity overseas is machinery syndication. Where the purchase and sole use of a large machine is clearly uneconomic for individuals a group of farmers combining to purchase the same machine may derive the benefit of a new and technologically advanced machine at acceptable costs...|$|E
