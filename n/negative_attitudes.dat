As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.|$|E

We found that despite a majority of consumers voicing a <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> toward GM food over 50 % of our European respondents stated {{that they did not}} actively avoid the purchase of GM food and 6 % actually purchased one of the few available GM labeled food products in the period between September 2006 and October 2007.

The sampling technique used stratified cluster random sampling and three schools selected namely SMPN 1 Delanggu, SMPN 1 Prambanan and SMPN 2 Wedi. Two-way variance {{analysis was used to}} test the hypothesis, followed by scheffe 2 ̆ 7 technique. Considering the result of analysis, the following conclusion could be drawn. (1) The students 2 ̆ 7 achievement who learnt by using DL was better than PBL and direct learning models.

5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

Bell & Gossett {{was by far}} {{the leading}} company in the hydronics heating and cooling market (hot water/chilled water systems), with an estimated market share at that time of approximately 65 to 70 percent. Subsequently, ITT received negative media coverage in the 1960 s and 1970 s for a variety of reasons. Four brand awareness and opinion studies were conducted of Bell & Gossett's primary customers, plumbing and heating contractors, from 1968 through 1971. These studies uncovered a <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> towards ITT that was adversely affecting Bell & Gossett's own image with its customers. A follow-up opinion study conducted in 1980 using personal interviews clearly indicated that this <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> toward ITT was continuing to grow with a corresponding growth in the negativism displayed towards Bell & Gossett since it was owned by ITT. ITT then launched a public relations program with all of its major publics to offset this negative publicity that began in the late 1970 s and continued throughout the 1980 s. Follow-up brand awareness and opinion studies were conducted in 1987 with this same Bell & Gossett customer group to determine if the <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> towards ITT was still impacting adversely on Bell & Gossett. The 1987 study results contained little or no <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> toward ITT and its ownership of Bell & Gossett. This series of studies demonstrated two conclusions: 1. A conglomerate's image can adversely affect the reputation of its acquired companies. An effective public relations program can offset negative publicity and transform a <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> into a positive one. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
25|$|Social {{reformer}} Jeremy Bentham {{wrote the}} first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, {{at a time when}} the legal penalty for buggery was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his utilitarian philosophy, in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings. However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.|$|E
