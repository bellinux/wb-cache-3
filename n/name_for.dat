5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{regarded}} Geastrum indicum as the correct <b>name</b> <b>for</b> G.triplex.

If {{it is in fact}} the same species, the first published name (i.e., G.indicum) has nomenclatorial priority according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. More recently, several authors argue that G.indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G.triplex maintained as the correct <b>name</b> <b>for</b> the species.|$|E
