Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this.

25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>wants</b> are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>wants.</b> [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business.

500|$|A user's motor abilities, {{communication}} skills and needs, cognition and vision are assessed {{in order to}} determine the most appropriate match to a communication system. Depending on the individual's physical status, recommendations of an alternative access method, a change in seating/positioning, a mounting system and/or communication aid adaptations may be needed. For example, someone with spastic arm movements may require a key guard on top of the keyboard or touchscreen to reduce the selection of non-target items. The person's needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization, with the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts, with different communication partners, and for different social purposes. Researcher Janice Light identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>wants</b> to a listener, the transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices such as [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you". These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family. In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual's self-determination, i.e., the ability to make one's own decisions and choices. However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct, and influence family attitudes towards AAC.|$|E

The first Russian newspaper in Riga–Rossiyskoe ezhenedelnoe izdanie v Rige (Российское еженедельное издание в Риге, Russian Weekly in Riga)– was founded in 1816. The Russian daily newspaper Rizhskij Vestnik (Рижский Вестник, [...] "Riga Herald"), founded in 1869 by Evgraf Vasilyevich Cheshikhin (Евграф Васильевич Чешихин) and published {{until his death in}} 1888, established the notion of [...] "the <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>wants</b> of the local Russian population".

2500|$|The ancient Chinese {{believed}} {{that every person}} has 2 souls – 1 is called ‘hun’ {{and the other is}} called ‘po’. When a person passes on, the hun soul leaves the body and ascends to heaven, while the po soul remains with the corpse. In ancient China, tomb artefacts were created specifically for the po soul to use in its afterlife, according to what the deceased usually needed and wanted when he or she was alive. The primary purpose of a tomb artefact was to care for its deceased master in his or her afterlife. Therefore, studying the tomb artefacts from different Chinese dynasties helps one to understand the changing social and historical circumstances of each dynasty, since the people of different dynasties had different <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>wants,</b> depending on the sociopolitical situation of each dynasty.|$|E

2500|$|Brookes {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by several American landscape designers, but considers Thomas Church to be his “guru.” Church’s landmark book “Gardens Are for People” led Brookes to his own garden philosophy in which he concluded that what a client <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>wants</b> comes first in formulating a design for a garden. [...] The design and style of the garden is then driven by the characteristics, features, and orientation of the site, {{the architecture of the}} house or outbuildings and how they are sited, the patterns and topography of the land, and the cultural context, including history, of the site. [...] The last step in his design projects is the creation of a planting plan. [...] Brookes clearly articulated his guiding design principle – that “gardens are fundamentally a place for the use by people”—in his first book, Room Outside, published in 1969 and revised in 2007. This was revolutionary thinking in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor.

Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>wants.</b> [...] "One of the worst ways {{to make a decision about}} where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor.
