40|$|Abstract. Local o cials in China have {{strongly}} supported new nonstate rms, yet other o cials in transition countries have often strongly hindered them. We {{argue that a}} likely cause of these sharp di erences in behavior is di erences in the source of government revenue. Local revenue in China came from pro ts and other taxes on new entrants, while elsewhere in transition countries tax revenue came disproportionately from the old state enterprises. All these o cials can easily draw on public funds for personal use. As a result, local Chinese o cials have a personal interest in encouraging the development of <b>new</b> <b>rms,</b> while other o cials have a nancial interest in suppressing <b>new</b> <b>rms.</b> To induce o cials to be supportive of <b>new</b> <b>rms,</b> the model suggests raising the e ective tax rate on these rms.

40|$|An {{international}} project developed, quality-tested, {{and determined}} isotope-delta values of 19 new organic reference materials (RMs) for hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen stable isotope-ratio measurements, {{in addition to}} analyzing pre-existing RMs NBS 22 (oil), IAEA-CH- 7 (polyethylene foil), and IAEA- 600 (caffeine). These <b>new</b> <b>RMs</b> enable users to normalize measurements of samples to isotope-delta scales. The RMs span a range of delta H- 2 (VSMOW-SLAP) values from - 210. 8 to + 397. 0 mUr or parts per thousand, for delta C- 13 (VPDB-LSVEC) from - 40. 81 to + 0. 49 mUr and for delta N- 15 (Air) from - 5. 21 to + 61. 53 mUr. Many of the <b>new</b> <b>RMs</b> are amenable to gas and liquid chromatography. The RMs include triads of isotopically contrasting caffeines, C- 16 n-alkanes, n-C- 20 -fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), glycines, and L-valines, together with polyethylene powder and string, one n-C- 17 -FAME, a vacuum oil (NBS 22 a) to replace NBS 22 oil, and a H- 2 -enriched vacuum oil. A total of 11 laboratories from 7 countries used multiple analytical approaches and instrumentation for 2 -point isotopic normalization against international primary measurement standards. The use of reference waters in silver tubes allowed direct normalization of delta H- 2 values of organic materials against isotopic reference waters following the principle of identical treatment. Bayesian statistical analysis yielded the mean values reported here. <b>New</b> <b>RMs</b> are numbered from USGS 61 through USGS 78, in addition to NBS 22 a. Because of exchangeable hydrogen, amino acid RMs currently are recommended only for carbon- and nitrogen-isotope measurements. Some amino acids contain C- 13 and carbon-bound organic H- 2 -enrichments at different molecular sites to provide RMs for potential site-specific isotopic analysis in future studies...|$|E

30|$|After lung {{recruitment}} it {{is necessary}} to perform a step-wise decrement in PEEP (PEEP trial) to detect the lung’s closing pressure. During this phase the echo probe is kept in the same position (dependent lung) as before. The very moment when normal lung aeration images transform into a B 1 –B 2 pattern and consolidation pattern will define the closing pressure. The final selected level of PEEP is chosen to be 2 cm H 2 O above the detected closing pressure [14, 16, 17]. Once the patient’s opening and closing pressures are known, a <b>new</b> <b>RM</b> is performed reaching these target pressures and the identified PEEP level is set for ongoing ventilation.|$|R
40|$|As {{markets and}} {{business}} patterns change, new business establishments are created to serve them. Those new establishments {{can be provided}} by entrepreneurs creating <b>new</b> fi <b>rms</b> or by the owners of existing businesses opening new locations. We show {{that over the past}} three decades, new establishments have increasingly been provided by existing businesses opening new locations. Those new locations have created jobs at a higher rate than brand-new fi rms, which helps to boost job creation. Looking at both forms of new establishments shows that job creation is down following the recession, but new locations were growing entering the recession and should be a critical component of job creation as the economy continues to recover. The rate at which Americans start new businesses has declined signifi cantly over the past three-and-a-half decades, raising concerns among economists and policymakers about the state of American entrepreneurship. The decline is troubling because new companies have historically {{played an important role in}} job creation—recent estimates put the number of new jobs created by <b>new</b> fi <b>rms</b> at 2. 9 million annually on average (Haltiwanger et al. 2013). But between 1978 and 2011, the formation rate for <b>new</b> fi <b>rms</b> with more than one employee dropped by more than one-third on a per capita basis, and the number of jobs created by <b>new</b> fi <b>rms</b> fell from 3. 4 percent of total business employment to 2. 0 percent. Moreover, these changes have occurred across all broad industry sectors and nearly all geographic locations (Decker et al., 2014; Hathaway and Litan, 2014). But discussions about the engines of job growth may be too narrowly focused on <b>new</b> fi <b>rms.</b> After all, a brand-new company is not the only type of new business establishment that can be formed. When Walmart opens up a new store, Honda builds a new auto plant, or a local sports bar opens a second location across town, new establishments are formed and new jobs are created. And though these new business locations are included in the offi cial new-establishment statistics, researchers frequently sift them out in order to focus only on brand-new fi rms when they investigate the drivers of job growth...|$|R

40|$|Faraday {{rotation}} measure (RM) synthesis is {{an important}} tool to study and analyze galactic and extra-galactic magnetic fields. Since there is a Fourier relation between the Faraday dispersion function and the polarized radio emission, full reconstruction of the dispersion function requires knowledge of the polarized radio emission at {{both positive and negative}} square wavelengths λ^ 2. However, one can only make observations for λ^ 2 > 0. Furthermore observations are possible only for a limited range of wavelengths. Thus reconstructing the Faraday dispersion function from these limited measurements is ill-conditioned. In this paper, we propose three new reconstruction algorithms for RM synthesis based upon compressive sensing/sampling (CS). These algorithms are designed to be appropriate for Faraday thin sources only, thick sources only, and mixed sources respectively.
