5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was under consideration {{as early as}} 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier was turned down due to the increases in manpower and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Avinor sees {{a problem}} in getting <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{of the size of}} the Dash 8-100 (39 seats) which can use the 800 meter runways, so they plan to use smaller planes with 19 seats when the Dash 8-100 retire.|$|E
5|$|Glorious was {{recalled}} to the Home Fleet in April 1940 {{to provide}} air cover for British forces landing in Norway. Gloster Gladiators of No. 263 Squadron RAF were flown aboard {{to be transferred}} to Norwegian airbases. Glorious and Ark Royal arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the Trondheim area before Glorious had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark <b>new</b> <b>aircraft.</b> She returned on 1 May, after failing to load <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the Luftwaffe all day and was withdrawn that evening.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, McDonnell's Chief of Aerodynamics, Dave Lewis, was {{appointed}} by CEO Jim McDonnell to be the company's preliminary design manager.

5|$|In July 2012, Mohammed Osman Ali (Dhagah-tur), the General Director of the Ministry of Aviation and Transport, also {{announced}} that the Somali government had begun preparations to revive the Mogadishu-based national carrier, Somali Airlines.

5|$|After several {{variants}} were proposed {{but later}} abandoned, some industry observers became skeptical of <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> proposals from Boeing. However, in early 2004, Boeing announced tentative {{plans for the}} 747 Advanced that were eventually adopted. Similar in nature to the 747-X, the stretched 747 Advanced used technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems. The 747 remained the largest passenger airliner in service until the Airbus A380 began airline service in 2007.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War progressed, so did {{the need}} for <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> and techniques. The first KC-97 Stratofreighter arrived at Loring with the {{activation}} of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron in January 1955. The B-36's were not actually equipped to perform aerial refueling, so the planes supported other units until {{the arrival of the}} B-52 in 1956. Eventually, 21 tankers were based at Loring, along with 30 air crews.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Generalleutnant Walther Wever in an air crash, Kesselring became Chief of Staff of the Luftwaffe on 3 June 1936. In that post, Kesselring oversaw the {{expansion}} of the Luftwaffe, the acquisition of <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> types such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Junkers Ju 87, and the development of paratroops.|$|E
5|$|I. and II. JG 1 {{were the}} first units to equip with the Heinkel He 162A-2 Spatz (Sparrow, Heinkel's name for the design), with {{deliveries}} of the He 162 in February 1945 to I./JG 1 at Parchim. Around April 1945, II./JG 1 moved to Rostock-Marienehe near the Heinkel factory to receive the deliveries of the <b>new</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E

50|$|The sole SB-13 was flown, {{modified}} {{and studied}} from 1988 to 2000, {{when it was}} damaged and set aside in favour of <b>newer</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In 2007 {{it went to the}} Deutsches Museum, Munich for exhibition.|$|R

5|$|In 2016, the ICAO {{adopted a}} {{standard}} that, by November 2018, all aircraft over open ocean report their position every 15 minutes. In March, the ICAO approved {{an amendment to}} the Chicago Convention requiring <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> manufactured after 1 January 2021 to have autonomous tracking devices which could send location information at least once per minute in distress circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011, the FAA {{assigned}} a common type rating to the 787 and 777, allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models, due to related design features. The smaller 787 {{was the first}} stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Reportedly, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> family, Yellowstone 3, which would draw upon technologies from the 787.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1944, the USAAF {{released}} General Operational Requirements {{for a day}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of 600mph (521kn, 966km/h), combat radius of 705miles (612nmi, 1,135km), and armament of either six 0.50in (12.7mm) or four 0.60in (15.2mm) machine guns. In addition, the <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> had to use the General Electric TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as the Allison J35.|$|E
50|$|At Langley {{the group}} trained in such {{aircraft}} as the Consolidated PB-2, Curtiss P-6, and Boeing P-12. Over {{the next several}} years, the group transitioned to such <b>newer</b> <b>aircraft</b> as the Seversky P-35, Curtiss P-36 Hawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, and the Curtiss P-40.|$|R
50|$|The JH-7A had {{a lighter}} and {{stronger}} airframe than the JH-7, allowing the <b>newer</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{to carry a}} maximum ordnance load of 9000 kg. In PLANAF, this allowed four YJ-82 anti-ship missiles to be carried, compared to the two on the JH-7.|$|R
50|$|The ensign may {{be flown}} at {{aerodromes}} in New Zealand, on any <b>New</b> Zealand <b>aircraft</b> {{and from the}} principal offices of airlines which own <b>New</b> Zealand <b>aircraft.</b> Additionally, the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand may fly the ensign from its buildings or aircraft.|$|R
5|$|On 29 April 1946, {{five days}} after the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-300 and the Yak-Jumo made their first flights, the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> similar to the Yak-Jumo, using the RD-10 engine with {{improved}} aerodynamics. This generally resembled the original aircraft, but the wings were entirely redesigned with laminar flow airfoils, the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted.|$|E
5|$|Prior to a {{government}} report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition, while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{based on the belief that}} deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to pay more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Spain, already {{using the}} AV-8S Matador, {{became the first}} {{international}} operator of the AV-8B by signing an order for 12 aircraft in March 1983. Designated VA-2 Matador II by the Spanish Navy (Armada Española), this variant is known as EAV-8B by McDonnell Douglas. Pilot conversion {{took place in the}} US. On 6 October 1987, the first three Matador IIs were delivered to Naval Station Rota. The <b>new</b> <b>aircraft</b> were painted in a two-tone matt grey finish, similar to US Navy aircraft, and deliveries were complete by 1988.|$|E
50|$|From 1946 through 1949, {{what little}} money became {{available}} {{was used to}} buy new planes (B-50 Superfortress, B-36 Peacemaker) for SAC, and as the <b>newer</b> <b>aircraft</b> became available, the older B-29s were sent to storage depots or sent to Air Force Reserve units for training missions.|$|R
50|$|Gradually, the Londons' duties were {{assumed by}} <b>newer</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{such as the}} Lockheed Hudson, while squadrons flying Atlantic and Mediterranean patrols were re-equipped with Short Sunderlands.
