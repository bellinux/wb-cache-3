Habib Bourguiba and others established it as the next generation's continuance of the original spirit of Destour. The French authorities later arrested its leaders and harassed the <b>Neo-Destour,</b> diminishing its presence and effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Habib Bourguiba, {{the leading}} {{figure in the}} <b>Neo-Destour</b> party, imprisoned in Vichy France, had been taken to Rome by the Germans, and feted there to further Italian designs on Tunisia; then he was repatriated to his Axis-occupied homeland. But Bourguiba {{remained}} pro-Independence without being anti-French (his wife being French). In Tunisia, however, some pro-German Destour leaders {{had been willing to}} work with the Third Reich, despite Bourguiba's persistent warnings. After the war, Bourguiba's American connections managed to clear him of false charges that he was a collaborator. Then with his compatriot Salah Ben Youssef and others there began the rebuilding of the <b>Neo-Destour</b> political organization.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{faced with}} {{simultaneous}} defeat at Dien bien Phu in Vietnam, and the upsurge of revolution in Algeria, France {{agreed to the}} end of the Protectorate in Tunisia. In the decades-long struggle for independence, <b>Neo-Destour</b> leaders were able to gain independence for Tunisia by maneuver and finesse.|$|E
25|$|During {{subsequent}} Tunisian {{negotiations with}} France, a conflict erupted between the rival leaders of <b>Neo-Destour.</b> Habib Bourguiba saw advantage in accepting an interim autonomy before mounting the final push for full independence. Salah ben Yusuf demanded {{nothing less than}} an immediate settlement for the ultimate prize. In the ensuing political contest {{for control of the}} movement, Bourguiba managed to best ben Yusuf, who was eventually expelled from Neo-Dustur. He then left Tunisia for residence in Cairo.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1940 fall of France, French authorities in Tunisia supported the Vichy regime, which continued {{to govern the}} southern provinces of France after its capitulation to German forces. Many Tunisians had felt some satisfaction at France's defeat. In July, 1942, Moncef Bey acceded to the Husaynid throne. Immediately he took a nationalist position, asserting Tunisian rights against the new Resident General appointed by Vichy. He toured the country, dispensing with beylical protocol. Soon becoming very popular as the new voice of Tunisians, Moncef Bey had assumed {{the place of the}} leadership of the Destour and <b>Neo-Destour</b> parties, which remained effectively suppressed by the French.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II the <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party reemerged {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Habib Bourguiba and Salah ben Yusuf. Already Bourguiba had enlisted the close support of the national labor union, the Union Générale des Travailleurs Tunisiens (UGTT). It was the successor of the short-lived Tunisian union organization, the Confédération (CGTT), which the French had suppressed in 1924. During the 1940s Farhat Hached had then followed the CGTT example and organized the UGTT, which was nationalist and not associated with the communist-led French union CGT. Quickly UGTT entered into a lasting alliance with Neo-Dustour. As Secretary General of the party, ben Yusuf pursued a policy of opening it to all Tunisians. He formed alliances with large commercial interests, with the Zaituna Mosque activists, and with pan-Arab groups favored by the Bey.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, the {{struggle}} for national independence continued and intensified. The <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party reemerged under Habib Bourguiba. Yet {{with a lack of}} progress, violent resistance to French rule began in the mountains during 1954. [...] The Tunisians coordinated with independence movements in Algeria and Morocco, although it was Tunisia at first became independent. Ultimately, the <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party managed to gain sovereignty for its people by maneuver and finesse.|$|E
2500|$|Organized {{nationalist}} sentiment among Tunisians, driven underground in 1912, resurfaced {{after the}} great War. Encouragement came from many directions, e.g., {{the formation of the}} League of Nations in 1919. Nationalists established the Destour [...] Party in 1920. Habib Bourguiba established and led its successor, the <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party, in 1934. French authorities later banned this new party, while the fascist organizations of the Tunisian Italians supported it (Mussolini obtained the liberation of Bourghiba from a Vichy jail in 1942).|$|E
2500|$|Its {{first modern}} leader, President Habib Bourguiba {{brought to the}} office hard-won {{political}} experience, after many decades of service in [...] {{the leadership of the}} independence movement. As the major figure of the <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party, he was instrumental in obtaining full independence for Tunisia in 1956. He dominated the government until his removal in 1987. During his years in office, his accomplishments included: a law reform, economic policies which detoured briefly in a socialist direction, a moderate but steady improvement in standard of living, and a foreign policy which retained an independent approach while maintaining trade and economic connections to the west.|$|E
2500|$|One serious rival to Habib Bourguiba was Salah Ben Youssef. Exiled in Cairo {{during the}} early 1950s he had absorbed the pan-Arab {{nationalism}} associated with the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser. Yet {{as a result of}} his strong opposition to the Neo Destour leadership during their negotiations with France for autonomy prior to independence, Ben Youssef was removed from his position as secretary-general and expelled from the party. Nonetheless he rallied disaffected union members, students, and others, enough to put 20,000 youssefists into the street during the next congress of the Neo Destour party. Eventually he left Tunisia for Cairo. [...] This was the end of any meaningful opposition to Bourguiba. [...] In 1963, the <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party was proclaimed to be the only legally permitted party, though for all intents and purposes Tunisia had been a one-party state since independence.|$|E
2500|$|In 1896 Bashir Sfar {{and other}} advocates of renewal from al-Hādira founded al-Jam'iyah Khalduniya its charter was {{approved}} by a French decree. The society provided a forum for sophisticated discussions; it was named after the famous medieval historian of Tunis Ibn Khaldun. According to professor Laroui, it [...] "emphasized the need for gradual reform" [...] {{of education and the}} family. Khalduniya also facilitated the role played by ulama progressives at Zitouna Mosque. Khalduniya, wrote Laroui [...] "became increasingly French both in mentality and in language." [...] The Khalduniya society [...] "opened a window on the West for Arabic-speaking Tunisians," [...] comments professor Perkins. It offered to the public free classes in European sciences. Many decades later, regarding the new political party <b>Neo-Destour,</b> Khalduniya (and Sadiki College) [...] "channeled many young men, and a few women, into the party." [...] Khalduniya also helped create the demand in Tunisia for foreign Arabic newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the party}} was founded, the <b>Neo-Destour</b> aimed to {{strengthen}} its position among the political movements. The young team faced the resident-general, Marcel Peyrouton, who was dedicated to stopping the nationalist protests in an economic crisis atmosphere, which {{was an opportunity to}} seduce a larger audience. Thus, they needed to earn a greater place on the political stage, spread their ideology and rally the supporters of a still-strong Destour, and also convince the lower classes that the <b>Neo-Destour</b> was their advocate. The <b>Neo-Destour</b> invited the lower classes to join in a [...] "a dignity tormented by half a century of protectorate". Therefore, Bourguiba traveled all around the country and used new methods of communication {{different from that of the}} Destour elders. The lower classes, alienated and troubled by economic crisis, were convinced by his speech and joined his cause, bringing their full support to it. Units were created all over the country and a new structure was settled, making the <b>Neo-Destour</b> a more efficient movement than all those before. If the elders addressed the colonial oppressor to express their requests, the [...] "secessionists" [...] addressed the people. Even worldwide, the new party succeeded in finding support among French socialists, including philosopher and politician Félicien Challaye, who endorsed the <b>Neo-Destour.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 21 July, Bourguiba was {{transferred}} into The Château de La Ferté in Amilly (110 kilometers from Paris) on {{the orders of}} Mendès France to preparing the upcoming negotiations. On 31 July, the new French prime minister travelled to Tunis and gave his famous speech in which he stated that the French government unilaterally recognizes the internal autonomy of Tunisia. Meanwhile, Bourguiba received representatives of <b>Neo-Destour</b> in Paris, {{under the supervision of}} the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux. In Tunis, a new cabinet led by Tahar Ben Ammar was formed to negotiate with the French authorities. Four members of <b>Neo-Destour</b> were made ministers.|$|E
50|$|On 10 June, the National Council of <b>Neo-Destour</b> {{gathered}} {{to establish a}} new policy towards this change in the French government. It ended with the endorsement of the new French policy and elaboration upon a series of feasible requests, to which the <b>Neo-Destour</b> expected a quick resolution. At the end of the meeting, Bourguiba was sent to Paris to set forth the platform of the party. In France, he became close to the Tunisian nationalist students such as Habib Thameur, Hédi Nouira and Slimane Ben Slimane. Furthermore, he met under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, Pierre Viénot, on 6 July 1936. This publicly stated interview was unpopular among the French colonialists in Tunisia, which led later meetings to be conducted secretly. But French authorities were opposed to the hopes of Tunisian militants, and some of them even thought that it was a mere illusion. When he returned to Tunis, in September, the political atmosphere had changed with the re-establishment of liberties, which permitted the expansion of <b>Neo-Destour</b> and an increase in its members.|$|E

5000|$|Tunisian {{nationalism}} {{refers to}} the nationalism of Tunisians and Tunisian culture. Tunisian nationalism's origins stretch back to the 19th century; however, Tunisian nationalism became a significant political force after 1908 with {{the founding of the}} Young Tunisians movement, and the more significant Destour (Arabic for [...] "Constitution) Party established after World War I. The Destour Party called for Tunisian autonomy within the French Empire and that France should not dominate Tunisia's politics and society. France responded by banning the Destour Party in 1933, resulting in the rise of a more radical nationalist party, the <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party being formed in 1934 led by Habib Bourguiba. The <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party demanded independence of Tunisia from France, though it respected French and Western culture and sought to maintain close links with France after independence was achieved.|$|E
50|$|The congress, which {{finished}} on 2 November, {{ended by}} withdrawing its {{support to the}} French government and therefore, the confidence the party had granted it for nearly two years. Bourguiba, who helped numerous young people join the leadership, strengthened his position and authority among the <b>Neo-Destour</b> and ended up victorious.|$|E
50|$|L'Action Tunisienne (sometimes {{abbreviated}} to L'Action) {{is a former}} Tunisian Francophone newspaper founded by Habib Bourguiba and published from November 1, 1932 to March 19, 1988. Working for the Destour party, at first, it later {{became part of the}} <b>Neo-Destour</b> then the Socialist Destourian Party, since its foundation on March 2, 1934, in Ksar Hellal.|$|E
50|$|In his youth, he {{took part}} in the militant {{movement}} for Tunisian independence. He {{was a member of the}} <b>Néo-Destour</b> delegation to Paris and president of the Association des étudiants nord-africains de France, which led to him being part of the Tunisian delegation in Tuniso-French negotiations from 1954 and then represented his country as ambassador in Paris, and then, from 1957, in Madrid.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, in Cairo, the Arab League {{resigned}} to inscribe the North African case is its agenda. Furthermore, a congress {{held by the}} nationalists of Cairo, from 15 to 22 February 1947 about the case of North Africa, ended {{with the creation of}} an Maghrebi office, replacing the representation of <b>Neo-Destour.</b> Its essential goals were to reinforce resistance movements inside colonized countries but also abroad, aiming to get the United Nations involved. Habib Thameur was designated as head of this organisation. In March 1947, Bourguiba came back to Cairo and, for nearly a year, tried to convince Arab leaders to introduce the Tunisian Case to the UN. In addition, he endowed <b>Neo-Destour</b> of its second representation in the Arab World, in Damascus, led by Youssef Rouissi, who knew the Syrians well. Nevertheless, progress were slow and Bourguiba's journey in Middle-East ended only with a substantial material assistance on behalf of Saudi Arabia, neither Iraq nor Syria nor Libya wanting to support his cause.|$|E
5000|$|Under the {{original}} Tunisian constitution, the Chamber of Deputies theoretically possessed great lawmaking powers, and {{even had the}} right to censure the government by a two-thirds majority. In practice, the body was dominated by the Democratic Constitutional Rally (formerly the <b>Neo-Destour</b> Party and Socialist Destour Party) from independence until the 2011 Tunisian revolution. The <b>Neo-Destour</b> won every seat in the Chamber at the first elections in 1959. From then on, Tunisia was effectively a one-party state, even though opposition parties nominally remained legal until 1963. Even after opposition parties were legalized again in 1981, they did not manage to enter the Chamber of Deputies until 1994. Even then, in the five elections held before the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, they never accounted for more than 19 percent of the total seats in the chamber. During the last few years of Ben Ali's tenure, the chamber took an increased role in debating national policy. However, all legislation still originated with the president, and there was little meaningful opposition to presidential decisions.|$|E

50|$|Adda was {{a member}} of the Tunisian Communist Party (PCT) from 1934. He belonged to the group which went on with the clandestine {{struggle}} after the arrest of the <b>Neo-Destour</b> and Communist leaders in September 1934. He was himself imprisoned by the French colonial authorities from September 1935 to April 1936. Once out of jail, he was nominated on June 1, 1936 at the National Conference of the party as Vice Secretary-General, and in charge of the Communist Youth.|$|E

5000|$|Following independence, proclaimed on 20 March 1956, a National Constituent Assembly was elected, on 25 March, {{in order}} to write a constitution. Therefore, Bourguiba ran to {{represent}} the constituents of Monastir, as the <b>Neo-Destour</b> candidate. On 8 April, the assembly held its opening session, chaired by M'hamed Chenik while Al-Amine bey attended the ceremony. The same day, Bourguiba was elected as President of the National Constituent Assembly and gave a speech, summarizing his ambitions for the country: ...|$|E
5000|$|In this conjecture, {{was held}} the second {{congress}} of <b>Neo-Destour</b> in Tribunal Street, Tunis, on 29 October 1937. The voting of a motion regarding the relations with France {{was in the}} agenda. The congress represented the fight of the two factions which appeared within the last months. In his speech, Bourguiba tried to balance both trends. Upon reducing {{the influence of the}} Destour over the nationalist movement, he strongly defended the progressive emancipation policy which he had advocated: ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to specify that, during his conquest and exercise of power, he systematically rejected all his allies who became rivals: Abdelaziz Thâalbi and Mohieddine Klibi, who represented the bourgeoise faction of Destour; Salah Ben Youssef, supported by Naser, that he assassinated in 1961. Tahar Ben Ammar who ratified the independence protocol Ahmed Mestiri, who represented the liberal faction among his party Mahmoud El Materi, {{the first president of}} <b>Neo-Destour,</b> who was discredited many times and, losing confidence in Bourguiba, decided to retire.|$|E
50|$|In these conditions, the French {{government}} decided to replace De Hauteclocque with Pierre Voizard as resident-general, on 23 September 1953. Trying {{to appease the}} uprising, he lifted the curefew and newspaper censorship but also freed nationalist leaders. Furthermore, he replaced Baccouche with Mzali and promised new reforms which soon seduced the Tunisian people. Nevertheless, Bourguiba remained detained in La Galite Island with, however, a softening of imprisonment conditions. If the reforms legislated the principle of co-sovereignty, Bourguiba judged these measures to be outdated. But he was worried of the cleverness of Voizard, whose methods {{seemed to be more}} dangerous than the brutality of De Hauteclocque. This obvious liberalism seduced numerous Tunisians tired of this violence climate which had imposed itself for too long but divided the <b>Neo-Destour</b> between those who supported the policy of the new resident-general and those who didn't. The differences among the party deepened more and more upon Voizard's plans. Both Bourguiba and Ben Youssef remained strongly opposed to the collaboration between the bey and the residence. After a period of hesitation {{about what to do with}} the reform project, the <b>Neo-Destour</b> gave orders to resume actions of resistance. Therefore, the Fellaghas decided to resume the attacks in the countryside.|$|E
50|$|Born in the Medina of Tunis to {{a family}} of Turkish origin, Turki studied at the University of Ez-Zitouna and the Institute for Advanced Studies, while taking classes at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts in Tunis. In 1946, he held a {{position}} in the administration before being recruited by French schools to teach Arabic. In 1952, he was forced into exile for having participated in the actions of the Tunisian nationalist movement <b>Neo-Destour.</b> He settled in Sweden, from 1953 to 1958, where he joined the Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm.|$|E
