500|$|In 1920, Lloyd {{appeared}} {{twice at}} Hendon Magistrates Court and gave {{evidence of the}} abuse she had suffered from Dillon. [...] Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed. [...] When asked by prosecutors how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied [...] "I cannot tell you, {{there were so many}} [...] [...] It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk." [...] By <b>now,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage. [...] She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as [...] "A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{squadron}} {{arrived in}} Bombay {{shortly before the}} Prince, who was travelling on [...] and , {{and a number of}} grand events took place. On one evening a dinner was arranged for the Prince in the Caves of Elephanta, on an island near Bombay. [...] The ships were arranged around the approach with illuminations and fireworks brought from England. As the Prince's ship approached, rockets were set off, one or two hundred at a time. One of Raleighs sails caught fire, but preparations had been made in anticipation that something would catch fire in the rigging, and it was soon put out. As Raleigh was the only ship fast enough to keep up with Serapis and Osborne, Tryon then accompanied the royal progress to Goa, Bepore, and Colombo, where the party disembarked for a tour of Ceylon. [...] Raleigh was required to accommodate all the newspaper correspondents who wished to accompany the Prince. The royal party rejoined at Madras to travel to Calcutta, where Raleigh had to leave the party, being too big to navigate the Hooghly. [...] Raleigh rejoined once more at Bombay for the return trip to England via the Suez canal, setting out on 13 March 1876. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> required to accommodate gifts given to the Prince, including two tigers, a leopard, a number of birds and smaller animals, which occupied the space previously taken by the journalists. [...] The remainder of the Flying Squadron left for China. The royal party arrived at Portsmouth on 11 May and were met at The Needles by the Princess of Wales. The whole party proceeded through the Solent with an elephant standing on each of the paddleboxes on Osborne.|$|E
