He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sorry for him and to leave.|$|E

25|$|Topon {{has stated}} {{numerous}} {{times that the}} name Fuck the Facts was chosen, in part, as a statement about his attitude towards the music he wrote. He tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> hampered by genre labels, and that {{is reflected in the}} musical style. The earlier Fuck the Facts recordings up until approximately 2000 featured a combination of grindcore and noise. Though those two genres were prominent during this era of recording, many other styles crept into the music as well including death metal, electronic and even as some as diverse as disco and jazz. When Discoing the Dead was released in early 2001, it retained many of these experimental styles, paving the way for the beginning of the first incarnation of Fuck the Facts as a full band.|$|E
500|$|During {{the open}} {{multiplayer}} beta, IGN writer Nathan Lawrence called the beta disappointing, considering it {{less of a}} classic style [...] "arena shooter" [...] and unfavorable compared to other shooters such as Halo. Similarly, the beta was negatively received by players on Steam, with mostly negative reviews {{at the time when}} the beta was active. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Adam Smith found the beta both to be similar to games such as Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, and the Call of Duty series and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like Doom itself, and criticized the weapon loadout concept. Review copies of the game were held back until release day.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Christian Donlan {{considered}} {{that the game}} lacked the same [...] "surprise" [...] as its predecessor, but praised the overall improvement of bosses, animations and the scope of activities available. Donlan said that the game environment was intricate and very detailed, and the abilities provided for its traversal made it [...] "hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like the world's greatest detective, on patrol". IGN's Greg Miller said [...] "the voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and {{the feeling of being}} the Dark Knight—these are the things that standout". Miller said that the Catwoman missions were a fun change of pace from the main gameplay, and that he [...] "adored" [...] the option to replay the game with unlocked abilities and more difficult enemies.|$|E

500|$|Though he {{had helped}} {{to come up with}} the design and had been a long-time proponent of the concept, Teller was not chosen to head the {{development}} project (his reputation of a thorny personality likely played a role in this). In 1952 he left Los Alamos and joined the newly established Livermore branch of the University of California Radiation Laboratory, which had been created largely through his urging. After the detonation of Ivy Mike, the first thermonuclear weapon to utilize the Teller–Ulam configuration, on November 1, 1952, Teller became known in the press as the [...] "father of the hydrogen bomb." [...] Teller himself refrained from attending the test—he claimed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> welcome at the Pacific Proving Grounds—and instead saw its results on a seismograph in the basement of a hall in Berkeley.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{academics}} {{have considered}} Dark Angel {{to be part}} of a wave of shows in the late 90s and early 2000s including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, , and La Femme Nikita that feature strong female characters. Writing in Science Fiction Film & Television, Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered to be a [...] "distinctly millennial post-third-wave feminist warrior. She also felt that Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an African American lesbian, conveyed female empowerment. For example, Cindy encourages Max <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex. McConnell and Jowett also cited Max as an example of female empowerment; Jowett considered Max to be the [...] "usual postmodern, postfeminist representation of the female action hero with [...] a reversal or [...] a mixture of traditional gender traits." ...|$|E

500|$|Max {{has been}} cited as a feminist {{character}} and is considered a symbol of female empowerment. Writing for the University of Melbourne, Bronwen Auty considered Max to be the [...] "archetypal modern feminist hero – a young woman empowered to use her body actively to achieve goals", citing Max's refusal to use firearms and instead using martial arts and knowledge as weapons as contributing to this status. Writing in Science Fiction Film & Television, Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered a [...] "distinctly millennial post-third-wave feminist warrior, and considered Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an African American lesbian, to convey female empowerment. For example Cindy encourages Max <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex. Writing in Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture, Lorna Jowett also considered Max an example of female empowerment, saying {{she appeared to be}} the [...] "usual postmodern, postfeminist representation of the female action hero" [...] who displayed mixtures and reversals of traditional gender traits.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering {{if there is such}} a thing as love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard it all before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't want to hear it again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E
500|$|Wennersten {{contacted}} Sparks when Jasenko Selimovic, {{the head}} of SR Radioteatern, decided that the station would produce {{a number of new}} musicals. She thought Sparks would be suitable for the format: [...] "They are a bit extravagant; they have a larger-than-life quality, and above all, they make music that is colourful enough for it <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like you miss a visual component." [...] Sparks were initially somewhat surprised by the invitation to write a musical for Swedish radio, and were hesitant to take on the project. However, after several months of persuasive effort from Wennersten, via e-mail and telephone, they decided to accept the challenge. [...] "We originally thought of it as a side project between albums, but once we started working on it, it took on a bigger life," [...] Sparks have said. [...] "As Americans we have almost abandoned radio drama and it was truly exhilarating for us to work in a medium where the imagination of the listener is so integral a part of the work. Aside from our love of Bergman, we have a love of Orson Welles and his use of the medium of radio was something that inspired us in this work." ...|$|E

[...] They then sailed to King George's Sound in south west Australia, a dismal settlement then being replaced by the Swan River Colony. Darwin {{was impressed}} by the [...] "good disposition of the aboriginal blacks... Although true Savages, it is impossible <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> an inclination to like such quiet good-natured men."

500|$|... "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. IGN's Chris Carabott {{wrote that}} [...] "if last week's 'Not in Portland' didn't {{get you back}} on the Lost hype train then for goodness' sake the equally outstanding 'Flashes Before Your Eyes' hopefully grabbed your attention." [...] Carabott went on to praise the on-screen chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that [...] "their on screen chemistry makes the love between the two characters real and makes their inevitable breakup that much harder to handle." [...] He also complimented the scene between Desmond and Charles, saying that [...] "it's hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> Desmond's heart crushed when Widmore denies him Penelope's hand in marriage." [...] Josh Spiegel, a writer for CinemaBlend.com, had similar praise. He said that for him [...] "it was a nice change of pace to not see Jack, Kate or Sawyer {{on the show and}} focus more on some of the lesser-known castaways." [...] Spiegel {{went on to say that}} the episode was [...] "fantastic". Mania.com's Stephen Lackey wrote that [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] was an [...] "episode has everything die hard LOST fans expect, riveting plot twists, foreshadowing, and as many questions as answers" ...|$|E
500|$|In New York City, Bella Abzug, who had {{introduced}} the first gay {{civil rights bill}} in U.S. Congress in 1974, was awoken at 2 am by {{people in the street}} chanting her name. [...] "It was hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sad for this crowd", Abzug said of the several hundred people below her window. She was optimistic, telling them the defeat would develop a maturity and determination in gay activism. About the same time that evening, about 3,000 gay men and lesbians spontaneously gathered in what had become the largest gay neighborhood in the United States—Castro Street in San Francisco—furious at the loss in Dade County. The crowd marched around the Castro District, chanting [...] "We Are Your Children!" [...] pulling people out of gay bars to cheers. Local gay activist and future supervisor Harvey Milk led marchers through a [...] course through the city, careful not to stop for too long lest rioting began. He addressed the crowd with a bullhorn: [...] "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force".

Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club compared the song's sexiness to that of [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] in a style of an [...] "overeager, pre-shower quickie", calling both of them the singer's raunchiest and most romantic. Mike Diver of Clash felt surprised by Miguel's writing contribution mostly due to the sound showcased in the song. Nows Julia LeConte listed the song as the best on the entire album. Andy Kellman from AllMusic called [...] "Rocket" [...] the second best song on Beyoncé, deeming it an [...] "amusing mix of metaphorical and explicit come-ons" [...] with an [...] "elegant" [...] opening line. Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone provided a positive review for the [...] "squishy" [...] tune where Beyoncé [...] "hits nasty highs", further praising the first line as a nice song-opener. Jon Dolan of the same publication further praised it as the best opening line of the [...] "sumptuously asstastic" [...] track. In an article for Vulture, Jody Rosen viewed the song as [...] "teasingly slow and salacious" [...] and felt that its opening line {{was one of the best}} of all time. James Montgomery from MTV News regarded it as a [...] "slowed-down jam in the purest sense of the term".|$|E
500|$|... "The Boat" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Erik Adams called it [...] "another solid late-period episode", praising Rainn Wilson's commitment to Dwight throughout the main plotline. He also complimented the Andy-Erin subplot, and considered it {{superior to the}} previous episode for featuring more consistency in Andy's characterization. He also complimented Dan Sterling and John Krasinski's work on the episode, saying that the script made [...] "good on previous hints that Andy and Erin's story won't end like Jim and Pam's" [...] and that Krasinski's direction added [...] "just enough energy <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> overwhelming". He gave the episode a [...] "B+". IGN writer Cindy White called the episode a [...] "pleasant surprise", for its use of the supporting characters and its development of the season's plotlines. She complimented most of the subplots, and compared Pete and Erin's romance to Jim and Pam's from the early seasons of the series. Her only complaint was Andy's characterization throughout the episode and the ninth season, as a whole, for being [...] "mopey and self-obsessed." [...] Despite this, she gave the episode an 8.0/10, calling it [...] "Great". WhatCulture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer gave the episode four stars out of five, praising the episode for making the previously unsuccessful Oscar-Senator storyline and the Andy's bankrupt family storyline entertaining. He also complimented the fact that Jim and Pam's bickering from the previous episode was not expanded upon, and praised their prank on Dwight, calling it a [...] "great bit" [...] and [...] "an excellent comedic balance to the more serious story of Andy's inner demons." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E
