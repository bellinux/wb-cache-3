5|$|All of McCain's {{family members}} are on good terms with him, and he has defended them {{against some of the}} <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> his {{high-profile}} political lifestyle. His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV ("Jack") graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy. His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate {{about the future of the}} Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Others {{point out}} that in philosophy, a {{critical}} and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out the <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments {{can be traced back}} to 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} has established an Integration Office under the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Economic Affairs. To minimise the <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland's {{isolation from the}} rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons. A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin Convention besides others. They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.|$|E
40|$|Using Hofstede’s {{cultural}} dimension of masculinity/femininity, this quantitative content analysis investigated {{the coverage of}} virginity loss (i. e., occurrence, tone, and association with <b>negative</b> <b>consequences)</b> and pregnancy (i. e., occurrence, tone, and <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> sex) in 2, 496 feature stories from all issues of three U. S. and three Dutch teen girl magazines from 2006 to 2008. Stories about virginity loss and pregnancy occurred equally often in the U. S. and Dutch magazines. Pregnancy was attached with a negative tone in both the United States and Dutch coverage. Virginity loss, however, was portrayed with a positive tone more often in the Dutch coverage than in the U. S. coverage. In addition, pregnancy was depicted as a <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> sex more often in the U. S. coverage than in the Dutch coverage. Implications are {{discussed in terms of}} differences in adolescent sexual socialization in the United States and the Netherlands...|$|R

30|$|The use of {{computer-aided}} detection {{certainly has}} a role in minimising the likelihood of missing some radiologic abnormalities, especially in mammography and lung nodule detection on CT, but carries the <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the increased sensitivity being accompanied by decreased specificity [43]; radiologist input remains essential to sorting the wheat from the chaff.|$|R
5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against the <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added {{it was necessary to}} teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} trade boom in Eastern Europe {{showed the}} first signs of the approaching crisis in the 1580s, when food prices stopped increasing. It was followed by a gradual decline in agricultural products prices, a price depression, initially present in Western Europe. The <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> this process on folwark economies of the East had reached its culmination {{in the second half of}} the 17th century. Further economic aggravation resulted from Europe-wide devaluation of the currency around 1620, caused by the influx of silver from the Western Hemisphere. At that time however massive amounts of Polish grain were still exported through Danzig (Gdańsk). The Commonwealth nobility took a variety of steps to combat the crisis and keep up high production levels, burdening in particular the serfs with further heavy obligations. The nobles were also forcibly buying or taking over properties of the more affluent thus far peasant categories, a phenomenon especially pronounced from the mid 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Zajdel's early works, from 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, focuses on {{scientific}} inventions {{and their role}} in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved {{to focus on the}} social aspects and often <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> those inventions. Over time, an increasingly visible theme became visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions {{about the nature of the}} universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies leaving under extreme forms of mass surveillance.|$|E
50|$|A <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> {{the trade}} was {{its impact on}} {{fur-bearing}} animals, initially the beaver and later the American bison or buffalo, whose populations were pushed to the brink. The worst consequence physically was the ravages of European diseases such as smallpox being increasingly spread to Native Americans by traders and trappers.|$|R
50|$|At the Reichstag at Mainz of August 15, 1235 Bishop Conrad II {{reached the}} {{official}} acknowledgement of Hildesheim as a Prince-bishopric (Hochstift) by Emperor Frederick II. As a <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> this success, Hildesheim began {{to interfere with}} the neighbouring Welf duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, culminating in the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud 1519-1523 with the warlike Brunswick duke Henry the Younger that led to a significant loss of territories.|$|R

25|$|In Africa, China may {{sell its}} own low quality or overproduced goods and inventory, a key outlet which helps {{maintain}} China's {{economic and social}} stability. Chinese shop-owners in Africa are able to sell Chinese-built, Chinese-shipped goods for a profit. A <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> China's low-cost consumer goods trade is that it only goes one way. China does not purchase manufactured products from Africa, while cheap Chinese imports flood the local marketplace, {{making it difficult for}} local industries to compete.|$|R
25|$|Essential tremor {{may benefit}} from slight doses of ethanol, but the {{potential}} <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> regular ethanol intake {{need to be taken}} into account.

25|$|In 197, the warlord Cao Cao – who {{had become}} the de facto head of the Han central {{government}} – placed Zhong Yao, the Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隷校尉), in charge of guarding the Guanzhong region. Zhong Yao wrote to Ma Teng and Han Sui, explaining to them the benefits of submitting to the Han court and the <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> not doing so.

25|$|Tackle design {{began to}} improve from the 1880s. The {{introduction}} of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods {{made it possible to}} cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. A <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> this, was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.|$|R
25|$|Those who {{generally}} view modernity as obsolete or an outright failure, {{a flaw in}} humanity's evolution leading to disasters like Auschwitz and Hiroshima, see postmodernity as a positive development. Other philosophers, particularly those seeing themselves as within the modern project, see the state of postmodernity as a <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> holding postmodernist ideas. For example, Jürgen Habermas and others contend that postmodernity represents a resurgence of long running counter-enlightenment ideas, that the modern project is not finished and that universality cannot be so lightly dispensed with. Postmodernity, the <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> holding postmodern ideas, is generally a negative term in this context.|$|R
25|$|Harlow {{attended}} Stanford in 1924, {{and subsequently}} became {{a graduate student}} in psychology, working directly under Calvin Perry Stone, a well-known animal behaviorist, and Walter Richard Miles, a vision expert, who were all supervised by Lewis Terman. Harlow studied largely under Terman, the developer of the Stanford-Binet IQ Test, and Terman helped shape Harlow's future. After receiving a PhD in 1930, Harlow changed his name from Israel to Harlow. The change was made at Terman's prompting for fear of the <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> having a seemingly Jewish last name, even though his family was not Jewish.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism {{in family}} systems {{refers to the}} {{conditions}} in families that enable alcoholism, {{and the effects of}} alcoholic behavior by one or more family members {{on the rest of the}} family. Mental health professionals are increasingly considering alcoholism and addiction as diseases that flourish in and are enabled by family systems. Family members react to the alcoholic with particular behavioral patterns. They may enable the addiction to continue by shielding the addict from the <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> his actions. Such behaviors are referred to as codependence. In this way, the alcoholic is said to suffer from the disease of addiction, whereas the family members suffer from the disease of codependence.|$|E
25|$|Procrastination is {{considerably}} more widespread in students {{than in the}} general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point. A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct. This study argues that academic misconduct {{can be seen as}} a means to cope with the <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> academic procrastination such as performance impairment.|$|E
50|$|Hindsight bias {{decreases}} one’s rational thinking {{because of}} {{when a person}} experiences strong emotions, which in turn decreases rational thinking. Another <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> hindsight bias is the interference of one’s ability to learn from experience, as a person is unable {{to look back on}} past decisions and learn from mistakes. A third consequence is a decrease in sensitivity toward a victim by the person who caused the wrongdoing. The person demoralizes the victim and does not allow for a correction of behaviors and actions.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} Dixon {{graduated}} from the RCA {{the decline in the}} etching market had begun, a decline compounded by the <b>negative</b> economic <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> the Wall Street Crash in America in October 1929.|$|R
40|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> fire, {{especially}} fire in public buildings, brings {{too much}} of lost in both human and money. The fire evacuation specialists proposed many evacuate techniques, methods and policies adapting to the given building, groups of people, or situations. However, conducting experiments to test these proposed solutions, in the reality, is nearly impossible. Therefore, simulation of fire and fire evacuation to evaluate these proposals is a reasonable solution. This paper proposes an agent-based model for modeling and simulation of fire evacuation in public buildings. The model is implemented and tested using the GAMA agent-based simulation platform. </p...|$|R
