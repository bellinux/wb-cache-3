40|$|The Federal Government’s {{decision}} to make changes to how FBT claims are processed was prompted {{by the desire to}} ensure that the transition to a floating Carbon Price (earlier than planned) had a neutral effect on the budget. Those who seek to claim FBT will now have to keep records for 12 weeks over the period of 5 years – to prove, as their claim for FBT infers, that they are using their car for business purposes. Up until the change was announced a person could make a claim for FBT without actually demonstrating or being required to demonstrate that the car in question was being used for business purposes. Surely this is to be welcomed. It will mean that if a person has been claiming FBT improperly in the past, it will be harder {{to do so in the}} future. However the {{decision to}} bring greater integrity to the taxation system has not been universally welcomed.   A coalition of car manufacturers, car leasing companies and salary packaging industry representatives are seeking a meeting with the Federal Government to discuss the recent announcement regarding the FBT. They are concerned that the decision to improve the integrity of the taxation system could have dire and unintended consequences to the car manufacturing industry and in turn the car leasing and salary packaging industries. The most dramatic effects of the change to FBT claims are said to foretell the loss of jobs and the death of several interrelated industry, but are these claims well founded? I am not in a position to make a determination. However what is clear is that any calls for the Federal Government not to implement the proposed changes cannot be entertained. If the Federal Government’s announcements are accurate, it is expected that the change will provide savings of $ 1. 8 b. In other words FBT claims of $ 1. 8 bn are wrongly being paid out. Surely we cannot simply ignore this misappropriation? In seeking to answer this question we cannot ignore the fact that it comes amidst ongoing community discussion as the future of the car manufacturing industry in Australia. These discussions have highlighted the existence of two, diametrically opposed groups; those who would remove all tariffs and government assistance packages that seek to prevent the demise of the car manufacturing industry and those who support the status quo.   What the latest manifestation of this discussion highlights is that as a community we have a choice to make; do we protect or do we support our car manufacturing industry? Some may think that the difference between ‘protect’ and ‘support’ is merely semantics. Although the words are similar, and may be used interchangeably in some situations, a clear difference can be substantiated for present purposes. To ‘protect’ denotes a lack of agency on the part of the car manufacturing industry; it is a passive recipient, not required to respond to market changes or conduct research and development. In contrast, support requires the car industry to evolve, to conduct research and development and ultimately respond to market changes. The former is infinite in its duration, the latter is finite. The car manufacturing assistance package agreed to by car industry representatives and governments has not conclusively resolved the stance that has be taken: to protect or to support. The fact that the package is to have a lifetime of ten years and requires car manufactures to make a corresponding investment would seem to suggest that the approach we tend to favour is one of support. What we have before us is a chance to resolve the ambiguity that surrounds our approach to the car manufacturing industry. If we are to protect the industry, then the proposed changes to FBT should be reversed. Yet, if it is our desire to support the industry, then the changes should proceed as planned. In resolving this ambiguity much has to be borne in mind. A decision to protect the car manufacturing industry involves both financial and <b>non-financial</b> costs. Government <b>assistance</b> packages have an obvious financial cost, and this may grow as competitors invest in research and development and our car industry remains static. Further there is the opportunity cost; the cost associated with not being able to spend the money that provides for the government assistance package on something else. Perhaps that same money could have been spent on building a new industry: an industry that does not require constant government assistance packages? But there are also costs associated with deciding to support, rather than to protect the car manufacturing industry. Support, by its very nature, is to be finite. Thus our decision to support may require us to let the car manufacturing industry cease to play a major role in our economy. Now the obvious ramification of that will be a loss of jobs, both directly and indirectly. There will be a direct loss of employment with the car manufacturers themselves. The indirect loss of employment will come with the lost of employment in the industries and workplaces that support the car manufacturers. Further there is the ramifications that the loss of employment will have on the communities in which these workplaces, factories and employees are located. The families of the former employees will experience a significant decline in their spending power and hence a corresponding decline in spending and employment in local shops, businesses and services can also be expected to follow suit. Losses in employment can also be expected to attract a greater demand for support in the community in the form of unemployment benefits: adding greater strain to our public budgets. If this does eventuate, then we may also expect to see an increase in family stress, family breakdown, poor health outcomes, and ultimately community dissociation. Now many of theses costs may not eventuate, or at least eventuate to that extreme. However what it does demonstrate is that we have to be acutely aware as to the ramifications of any decision regarding our car manufacturing industry. The Federal Government announcement on FBT is greater than simply a discussion on the Carbon Price or the integrity on the taxation system. The decision provides a watershed moment, a chance to resolve the ambiguity that surrounds our car manufacturing industry. Some may wish bury their head in the sand, whilst others may claim that the dire predictions made by industry representatives are baseless. Neither are acceptable stances to take. Whilst the ambiguity provides that either a protective or supportive approach to the car manufacturing industry remain possible, this scenario comes with costs and risks. The longer we wait, the more limited the opportunities for action become. If our approach is to be one of support, as it seems, then this should be made known now. Although it may preordain the end of the car manufacturing industry, it also provides ample time to support the creation of a new manufacturing industry, new employment and community stability. Surely this is better than the ambiguity that currently surrounds our car industry. Photo Credit: RaeAllen via Compfight c...|$|R

Design and Methods: Qualitative focus groups and in-depth interviews were supplemented with participant exit surveys about preferred smoking cessation strategies. Each discussion was audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using a thematic analysis. The setting was six non-government community welfare service organisations operating in New South Wales, Australia. Eleven social services offered by these organisations participated. Thirty two clients participated in six client focus groups, 35 staff participated in six staff focus groups and eight manager telephone interviews were conducted. Results: Clients indicated that the cost of nicotine replacement therapy was a barrier to its use and that financial incentives were acceptable. Of the 16 possible strategies listed in the exit survey, the three selected as the most preferred by clients incorporated financial or <b>non-financial</b> <b>assistance.</b> By contrast, staff and managers selected financial and non-financial incentives as the least preferred and least feasible strategies. Discussion and Conclusions: The study found high acceptance of incentives as a smoking cessation strategy among a disadvantaged group of non-government welfare service clients.

40|$|Financial {{ties between}} medical journalists and for-profit {{companies}} they cover in their reporting have received little {{attention in the}} media or from the research community. Such ties warrant scrutiny, not least because many of us first learn about new treatments from the news media, and these reports can affect the way the public uses health care. The media also affect medical practice by influencing the medical literature: journal articles that get media coverage {{are more likely to}} be subsequently cited, regardless of the article’s intrinsic value. To promote awareness and provoke debate we discuss three areas of “entanglement”: education of journalists, awards for journalists, and the actual practice of journalism. Education of journalists: training and further education of medical journalists should not be funded by the healthcare industries that the journalists cover, whether the education is delivered by universities or professional associations. Journalists’ awards: to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest medical journalists should not accept from the healthcare industries they cover any awards, scholarships, gifts, travel, special treatment, or anything that could be seen as affecting what or how news is reported. The practice of journalism: just as medical journals require disclosure of conflicts of interest, medical journalists should disclose any financial or <b>non-financial</b> <b>assistance</b> from the industry in researching or writing their stories, including identifying quoted patients and experts with ties to the industry. Conflicts of interests of sources should routinely be disclosed. As researchers and writers acting to improve medical journalism, we encourage journalists, educators, and professional associations to scrutinise their own relations with the industry as intensely as they do those between doctors and drug companies and to develop workable solutions...|$|E

As aconsequence of this process, the market is improved and it incentivizes the creation ofinnovative solutions to solve problems. The study focuses on the pivotal function of theentries in this process. To better understand the creation of new ventures process the study investigates how thecontextual factors impact the entrepreneur’s decision of starting a new business, focusingon two business environments: Sweden and Brazil. Through interviews with Swedish andBrazilian entrepreneurs we analyze how entrepreneurs perceive the contextual factors andhow it impacted their new venture creation process. Through the literature we find that the business environment is composed by seven majorfactors that, with an extended framework based on literature review, we consider as:economic wealth, government policies and procedures, legal & administrative, society’sculture; network and knowledge; financial assistance; and <b>non-financial</b> <b>assistance.</b> Analyzing the empirical material about the business environments we find that Swedishand Brazilian entrepreneurs feel the influence of the different contextual factors inbusiness creation but do not always understand their causes.

40|$|Abstract: Extended {{households}} have always provided {{a safety net}} for orphaned children. However, {{the high rate of}} HIV (AIDS) infection, unemployment and poverty has weakened their capacity to fulfil this vital role. Most of the extended households with orphan-care responsibilities are forced to subsist under poor socio-economic conditions and depend on government social grants for their material survival. Consequently, the majority of extended households live in poverty and therefore lack sufficient resources to care for these children. In addition to receiving government social grants, some extended households are also receiving financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>assistance</b> from local non-governmental organisations (NGOs). These local NGOs {{play an important role in}} strengthening the these households ― which, as mentioned, provide a refuge to orphaned children ― by providing basic needs such as food, clothes and medical care to orphans living in extended family units. However, despite this significant role of local NGOs, little has been done to quantify their economic impact. It is against this background that this mini-dissertation strives to bridge this gap by investigating the economic impact of NGOs in improving the well-being of vulnerable orphaned children living in these extended households of Soweto. Methodologically, this mini-dissertation employs the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) poverty indices (1984), in order to assess the impact of NGOs’ help in reducing the level and the depth of poverty in poor households living with orphaned children. We used the Kruskal-Wallis (1952) non-parametric test to test whether the help of NGOs was significant in reducing the level and the depth of poverty in these homes. In the second approach, we use the logit econometric model to control for variables that may affect the probability of an orphaned child to be poor. Before we analysed the results of the FGT poverty indices and the logit econometric model, we started by analysing the demographic profile of all households who participated in this study in order to have knowledge of the prevailing socio-economic conditions of these households. We further compared the income of each household in [...] . M. Com...|$|E
40|$|Abstract After several postponements, the Malaysian Goods and Services Tax (GST) {{has finally}} been {{scheduled}} to commence in April 2015. Since the GST Bill was first announced in 2005, {{the private sector and}} the Government of Malaysia have conducted various information sessions and GST seminars to educate Malaysian business taxpayers. However, little is known about business taxpayers’ concerns and their readiness for the implementation of the GST. This study attempted to examine some of the major issues and concerns business taxpayers perceive as key challenges in preparing for the GST. More specifically, four broad issues were investigated, namely: (i) businesses readiness to implement the GST, (ii) the GST compliance burden imposed on businesses, (iii) business taxpayers’ perceptions of the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) to provide financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>assistance</b> and (iv) {{to determine whether or not}} business perceptions are related to business characteristics. From April 2013 to June 2013 a survey was conducted with a sample of 1, 500 business taxpayers; 426 survey responses were received representing a satisfactory response rate of over 28 %. The survey results indicated that business taxpayers are overall poorly prepared for the implementation. Only nine percent of respondents claimed to be substantially ready. With respect to computer system readiness, only 22 % of the respondents perceived to be ready. A worrying finding was that over 25 % of respondents who are eligible to register for GST stated they would not register for GST. Over 74 % of respondents felt the GST would place an additional compliance burden on them. Only 24 % of respondents stated that they were confident they would get the required assistance from RMCD for GST implementation. Further statistical analyses reveals larger businesses are better prepared for GST overall and smaller businesses felt more stressed about GST. It is concluded Malaysian businesses were poorly prepared in 2013 and do require additional assistance. A number of measures are suggested to alleviate businesses compliance burden. They include compensation for GST set-up costs, more free training and simplification of GST reporting. In particular, the RMCD should strive to build a closer relationship with business taxpayers to iron out the major issues so that business taxpayers are encouraged to register and comply with GST laws and regulations...|$|E
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the administrative effectiveness of Defence’s procedures to provide emergency {{assistance to the}} civil community. Introduction An emergency situation can be a natural occurrence, such as a bushfire, flood or cyclone, or result from human activities. Emergencies occur frequently in Australia and range in severity from small-scale incidents to large-scale, catastrophic events. The human and economic cost of these events can be substantial. For example, the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria in 2009 {{claimed the lives of}} 173 people, affected over 78 communities and destroyed 2029 homes; and the insured cost for losses due to Cyclone Oswald in 2013 was estimated at $ 1. 1  billion in Queensland and New South Wales, with $ 154  million in State and Australian Government assistance provided to those affected. A well‑directed, coordinated and timely emergency management response acts to minimise the impact of an emergency on the community and support the recovery process. When a natural disaster or other domestic emergency occurs, it is primarily the responsibility of the relevant state or territory (state) government to protect life, property and the environment. State governments draw on a range of emergency services, volunteer organisations and commercial resources when responding to emergencies. State governments may also request Australian Government <b>non‑financial</b> <b>assistance</b> to provide additional resources for response and recovery activities. The Department of Defence (Defence) undertakes a large majority of Australian Government emergency assistance tasks in response to state requests. When Defence accepts a request and provides emergency assistance, this is referred to as emergency ‘Defence Assistance to the Civil Community’ (DACC). The benefits of utilising Defence in support of emergency responses include that Defence is often able to deploy Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel (including Reserve personnel) with relevant expertise and skills (for example, engineers), as well as equipment (from transport aircraft to water purification units). Defence may also have the capacity to deploy its personnel and equipment at relatively short notice due to the geographical proximity of certain bases to incident areas and its access to transport assets. Further, Defence has developed approaches to the planning, coordination and conduct of operations, which may be readily adapted to emergency responses. Based on Defence data, 275 emergency DACC tasks were recorded for the period 2005 – 06 to 2012 – 13. Examples of the emergency assistance provided by Defence include: airlift of equipment and personnel; engineering support; search and support; temporary accommodation and general support; health and psychological support; aviation refuelling; and communications. Overall conclusion Under national emergency management arrangements, state and territory (state) governments have primary responsibility for protecting life, property and the environment {{in the event of an}} emergency in their jurisdiction. When state resources are inadequate, the Australian Government can be called upon to provide assistance, representing a ‘surge’ capacity within the federation. Some of the skills and assets available to Defence to conduct military operations can be readily applied in support of states responding to natural disasters and other emergencies, and as a consequence there is a regular demand for Defence assistance. Defence can provide assistance either directly for local emergency assistance (category 1 tasks), or through Emergency Management Australia (EMA) for significant emergency assistance (category 2 tasks) and emergency recovery assistance (category 3 tasks). Defence’s emergency Defence Assistance to the Civil Community (DACC) procedures therefore need to establish clear decision making, coordination and administrative arrangements to guide Defence commanders and personnel on the conduct of tasks outside of core military operations. The effective contribution of Defence in emergency situations is highly dependent on the quality of relationships across the areas of Defence with emergency DACC roles, and between Defence, EMA and state emergency management authorities. It also depends on a strong feedback loop so that on-the-ground experience informs future operations. In recent years Defence has played a prominent role in responding to natural disasters in Australia. As part of five major emergency DACC operations between 2008 – 09 and 2012 – 13, Defence has deployed significant human and physical resources, organised in Joint Task Forces (JTF), to provide assistance to state emergency management authorities. For example, Defence assistance to the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria reached a peak operational strength of approximately 800 Defence personnel per day, and over 1250 Defence personnel provided assistance over the seven weeks of the operation. For these major operations, Defence also recorded supplier expenses totalling some $ 6. 7  million, for items such as travel, consumable goods and garrison support. Defence has also undertaken many smaller scale emergency DACC tasks utilising Defence base personnel and resources located in the area of an incident, at the discretion of local commanders. Overall, Defence’s emergency DACC procedures are generally effective in guiding and enabling the provision of Defence assistance in response to emergencies. The DACC Manual outlines principles for Defence commanders to consider when judging the merits of requests for Defence assistance, including the need to evaluate the readiness of Defence resources to achieve the Government’s expected defence outcomes against the capacity to make those same resources available in an emergency. Defence has also developed sound coordination arrangements with state emergency management authorities, involving the appointment of Defence liaison officers, who communicate with states about their emergency assistance needs and Defence’s capability to provide support, both prior to and during emergencies. Emergency management authorities interviewed as part of this audit acknowledged the responsiveness of Defence and the value of the support provided. However, emergency DACC has been largely focused on response efforts, with less attention given to meeting the administrative requirements set out in the DACC Manual, particularly in the areas of task recordkeeping and cost recovery. There is also scope for Defence to develop a stronger feedback loop to inform decision making on future emergency DACC delivery approaches. While emergency DACC is only a small part of Defence’s overall responsibilities, it can involve a large number of Defence personnel, and the utilisation of valuable Defence equipment and supplies. In the circumstances, there is a need for Defence to develop straightforward administrative requirements. The Instruction of 2004 and the DACC Manual of 2012 set out extensive reporting requirements for individual DACC tasks, indicating a desire by Defence to understand the nature and cost of the provision of DACC, and to learn from experience. However, for many years Defence has not met these requirements across the DACC tasks it undertakes. The main focus of Defence units has been to complete tasks, and they have not prioritised reporting on tasks outside of the Service chain of command. The failure to record key task data means that other areas of Defence responsible for emergency DACC strategy, procedures and reporting are not routinely informed about the nature, resource impact and cost of emergency DACC tasks, as well as any task acceptance and delivery issues. To address these issues, Defence should review task reporting requirements to ensure they do not present an unnecessary administrative burden, but instead give priority to meeting an appropriate set of requirements that generates useful information to help shape future emergency DACC activities while satisfying recordkeeping requirements for accountability purposes. To further encourage states to manage emergency recovery efforts using their own resources, the DACC Manual requires that the direct costs incurred by Defence in undertaking category 3 ‘recovery’ tasks be reimbursed by states, and only allows the ‘waiver’ of cost recovery in limited ‘special circumstances’. However, Defence has not consistently recovered or waived costs in accordance with the requirements of the DACC Manual. In contrast to its current policy, Defence has advised that it plans to amend the DACC Manual to indicate that costs are ‘generally not recovered unless the government recipient agrees to pay costs’, and that cost recovery ‘may not be warranted where it is not cost effective or it would be inconsistent with government policy objectives’. However, this approach does not clarify the circumstances in which cost recovery is warranted and Defence personnel are obliged to pursue the recovery of costs. While it is a decision for Defence and the Government, the ANAO suggests that Defence review and clarify its cost recovery policy for emergency DACC, and develop practical thresholds for the application of cost recovery, in terms of the estimated value and type of recovery assistance provided. Pursuing such an approach would reinforce the responsibility of state governments for emergency recovery when the immediate threat to life, property and the environment has passed. The emergent nature of emergency DACC tasks means that it is difficult to develop and apply objective measures of performance. Nevertheless, identifying lessons from emergency DACC activities, including the efficiency and effectiveness of the approaches adopted remains important. Defence has established some elements of an emergency DACC evaluation and learning system, including reports on major operations and an annual Lessons Board. The Lessons Board considers key themes arising from these reports, and can recommend procedural changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency DACC. However, these elements are not currently supported by an information system to record and manage key lessons and recommendations arising from DACC activities, creating a risk that learning will be lost and actions not pursued. The initial roll-out of a Defence‑wide system for managing lessons learned is planned for July 2014, presenting an opportunity for Defence to develop a stronger feedback loop to inform improvement in the administration and delivery of emergency DACC activities. Within Defence, various office holders, Groups and Services have different emergency DACC responsibilities, ranging from the development of strategy and procedures to the completion of tasks. The audit highlights that the overall effectiveness of emergency DACC administrative arrangements depends on the collective contribution of all of these areas toward planning, delivery, monitoring and review efforts. To this end, the ANAO has recommended that Defence review the minimum information necessary to be reported for each emergency DACC task for planning, management and accountability purposes. The recommendation also encourages Defence to take steps to strengthen the priority afforded by Defence units to meeting mandatory reporting requirements...|$|E
