5000|$|Changes in how {{call costs}} for 084 and 087 non-geographic calls should in future be communicated to callers were announced. The callers phone line {{provider}} has to list a single Access Charge per tariff for the 084, 087, 09 and 118 <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> ranges and the called party has {{to display the}} single Service Charge (or [...] "premium") details for their <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> ranges also changed, {{with the}} prefix for seven-digit mailbox numbers {{changing}} from 07 to 217.|$|E

50|$|Some {{consumers}} {{have tried to}} avoid calling <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> by instead calling a non-advertised geographic number. Geographic rate alternatives to chargeable <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> can often be found through simple online searches on web sites such as saynoto0870.com.|$|R

50|$|For any {{telephone}} {{call to a}} <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number,</b> there are four parties involved: the caller, the originating telecommunications company (or 'telco'), the terminating telco and the called party. The caller pays their telephone bill to the originating telco.|$|E
50|$|Certain <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> ranges {{might not}} be {{possible}} when calling from abroad of the United Kingdom. This is mostly {{the case with the}} 070 personal numbering range, the 080 freephone range and service numbers starting 084, 087, 090, 091 and 098.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{discontinued}} on 31 March 2014. As {{a part of}} the National Health Service, NHS Direct {{services were}} free, although the 0845 number was usually chargeable as a <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number.</b> Some landline providers allowed 0845 calls within [...] "inclusive" [...] minutes.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>non-geographic</b> {{telephone}} <b>numbers</b> in the United Kingdom {{has also}} been a major cause of bill shock. Pollster YouGov found that 49% of mobile users have been surprised to see how much they have been charged for calling <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> and 90% believe organisations should make the cost of these calls clearer. According to Ofcom, UK consumers paid around £1.9 billion for calls to <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> in 2009.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{voice over}} IP {{providers}} offer virtual numbers; unbundled providers label these as [...] "DIDs" [...] (direct inward dial). These are typically offered as local geographic numbers in various selected cities or as toll-free numbers, with the <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> carrying higher per-minute cost to receive calls.|$|E
50|$|A <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> {{is a type}} of {{telephone}} number that is not linked to any specific locality. Such numbers are an alternative to the traditional 'landline' numbers that are assigned geographically using a system of location-specific area codes. Non-geographic numbers are used for various reasons, from providing flexible routing of incoming phone calls to generating revenue for paid-for services.|$|E
50|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 2007, these 03 {{numbers have}} been the only variety of <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> whose charge is officially linked to that of geographic numbers. No provision has been made for replicating the old 'local rate' or 'national rate' prefixes, as almost all UK telephone operators now charge all landline calls at the same rate, regardless of location.|$|E

50|$|With the {{increased}} price differential, {{the use of}} <b>non-geographic</b> telephone <b>numbers</b> in the United Kingdom {{has been a major}} cause of bill shock. Pollster YouGov found that 49% of mobile users have been surprised to see how much they have been charged for calling <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> and 90% believe organisations should make the cost of these calls clearer. According to Ofcom, UK consumers paid around £1.9 billion for calls to <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Usage of <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> {{and popular}} {{opposition}} ...|$|R
50|$|Numbers {{starting}} 070 {{are intended}} to offer <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> functionality to individuals - such as by allowing people to have a single number that directs calls to their home, work or mobile phone as they choose. They are controversial {{as they can be}} confused for mobile numbers, and therefore the cost of calls to them may not be apparent to callers until they receive their bills.|$|E
5000|$|With {{no further}} {{geographic}} renumbering undertaken, the 03 numbering range {{was no longer}} required for its original purpose and was instead redesignated for [...] "non-geographic numbers charged at geographic rate" [...] service in 2006. Telecoms regulator Ofcom introduced the range as it believed that some organisations would benefit from a type of <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> that did not impose any additional charges on callers, and that some consumers were confused about charges for existing special-rate numbers starting 084 and 087.|$|E
50|$|The {{format of}} the {{toll-free}} number is called a <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number,</b> in contrast to telephone numbers associated with households which are geographic. (Since the advent of cell phones and voice over IP, households can have any area code in the U.S. —it is still geographic {{in the sense that}} calls from that area code are considered local, but the recipient can be physically anywhere). In the latter case, it is possible to determine an approximate location of the caller from the area code (e.g. New York or London). In contrast, toll-free numbers could be physically located anywhere in the world.|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of telephone numbers are submitted by visitors to the website, but the discussion board also offers a place for visitors to request alternative telephone numbers {{if they are not}} included in the database. Some companies that advertise a <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> will also offer a number for calling from abroad - usually starting +44 1 or +44 2 - this number can be used within the UK (removing the +44 and replacing it with 0) to avoid the cost of calling non-geographic telephone numbers. Some companies will also offer a geographic alternative if asked.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{increasing}} consumer opposition to non-geographic numbers. This is {{partly due to}} revenue sharing concerns and partly due to these calls not being eligible for use within inclusive minutes. Whilst a national or regional business may want a single contact number that is not tied to a location, there seems little sense in a small trader covering a town, or at most a county, having a <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number</b> for their single telephone line. Businesses are attracted to using 084 numbers as many of the sellers of NGNs assert that callers are paying only a [...] "local rate" [...] call.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 July 2006, Ofcom {{announced}} that companies {{will soon be}} able to use an [...] "03" [...] <b>non-geographic</b> <b>number,</b> in place of other non-geographic numbers (such as 0870 or 0845 numbers). Callers would be charged {{at the same rate as}} if they were calling a geographic number (01 or 02). This means that customers who are benefiting from inclusive minutes on mobile phone or landline calling plans would also be able to call these numbers using their inclusive minutes. On 13 February 2007, Ofcom released more details on their plans for the 03 range and {{announced that}} allocations of 03 numbers to providers would begin in March 2007. Whilst 01, 02 and 07 numbers can receive text messages, currently the majority of cellular network providers do not support the sending of text messages to 03 numbers. Three different ranges of numbers were announced; those beginning 030x are reserved for qualifying public bodies and non-profit organisations, those beginning 033x, which are available for allocation to anyone, and those beginning 034x and 037x which will be used for migration from the matching 084x and 087x number ranges respectively. Ofcom itself began using 03 numbers on 13 November 2007 for public use.|$|E
50|$|Ten-digit <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> {{beginning}} with 1 are written 1X0Y BBB BBB, where X is 8 for toll free numbers, 3 for fixed-fee numbers and 9 for premium services. Six-digit <b>non-geographic</b> <b>numbers</b> are written 13 BB BB or 13B BBB; these are fixed-fee numbers. Seven-digit 180 BBBB numbers also exist. 'B's are sometimes written as letters.|$|R
