5000|$|Until the {{commercial}} development of mobile DNA technology in 2007 and zinc-finger nuclease technology in 2009, {{there were only}} two technologies {{that could be used to}} produce rat models of human disease: cloning and chemical mutagenesis using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Although cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) could theoretically be used to create rats with specific mutations by mutating somatic cells, and then using these cells for SCNT, this approach has not been used successfully to create knockout rats. One problem with this strategy is that SCNT is extremely inefficient. The first published attempt had a success rate of less than 1%. Alternatively, ENU mutagenesis is a common random mutagenesis gene knockout strategy in the mouse that can also be used in the rat. ENU mutagenesis involves using a chemical, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), to create single base changes in the genome. ENU transfers its ethyl group to oxygen or <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals</b> in DNA, resulting in mis-pairing and base pair substitution. Mutant animals can be produced by injecting a male mouse with ENU, and breeding with a wild type female to produce mutant offspring. ENU mutagenesis creates a high frequency of random mutations, with approximately one base pair change in any given gene in every 200-700 gametes. Despite its high mutagenicity, the physical penetration of ENU is limited and only about 500 genes are mutated for each male and a very small number of the total mutations have an observable phenotype. Thousands of mutations typically need to be created in a single animal in order to generate one novel phenotype.|$|E

We determined the relative contributions of bacterial versus host-derived oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals</b> to cellular damage in pneumococcal infection.

40|$|The {{performances}} {{of a number}} of theoretical methods in the calculation of N-H bond dissociation energies and radical stabilization energies associated with the X-NH ¥ radicals were examined. It was found that the UHF, UMP 2, and UMP 4 methods were not reliable for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals</b> because of the spin contamination suffered by them. Surprisingly, the ROHF, ROMP 2, and ROB 3 LYP methods were not found to be reliable for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals</b> either, because they could lead to unrealistic spin-localization of the radical. This unrealistic spin-localization was even seen with the UCCSD(T) method. The only credible modest-level method for the nitrogen radical was found to be UB 3 LYP, which could provide at least qualitatively correct radical stabilization energies for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals.</b> The basis set effect on the UB 3 LYP calculation was also found to be very small. Nevertheless, G 3 and CBS-Q methods were found to be able to provide fairly accurate bond dissociation energies and radical stabilization energies for the substituted <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals.</b> According to G 3 and CBS-Q results, CH 3, NH 2, OH, F, Cl, and CN were assigned to be stabilizing substituents for the nitrogen radical, as these groups could effectively delocalize the odd electron on the nitrogen radical. By contrast, COCH 3, CONH 2, COOH, and CHO were assigned to be destabilizing substituents for the nitrogen radical, although these groups could also delocalize the odd electron on the nitrogen radical.

40|$|The {{cytochrome}} P- 450 -mediated {{activation of}} phenacetin (PHEN) to reactive intermediates by two hypothetical mechanisms {{has been studied}} by use of SV 6 - 31 G ab initio energy and spin distribution calculations. In our calculations, the cytochrome P- 450 enzyme system has been substituted by a singlet oxygen atom {{in order to reduce}} the computational efforts and to fulfill the requirements as to spin conservation. Both mechanisms are based on the currently increasingly accepted view that radical intermediates, formed via sequential one-electron steps, play a crucial role in the metabolic activation of substrates by cytochrome P- 450. The first pathway is proposed to involve an initial abstraction of an electron and a proton from the alpha-methylene carbon atom in the ethoxy side chain and can explain the O-deethylation products paracetamol and acetaldehyde. In the second pathway, an initial abstraction of an electron and a proton from the nitrogen atom in the acetylamino side chain is proposed. The calculated spin densities of the formed <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radical</b> indicate that the unpaired electron is primarily localized at the nitrogen atom and to a smaller extent at the ortho- and paracarbon atoms relative to the acetylamino group.

The extent of sulfinate oxidation induced by the system SOD/Hydrogen Peroxide in the presence of bicarbonate (Carbonate anion radical generation), or nitrite (<b>Nitrogen</b> dioxide <b>radical</b> generation) has been evaluated. Hypotaurine is efficiently oxidized by the carbonate radical anion generated by the peroxidase activity of Cu,Zn SOD.

Considering that the carbonate radical anion could be formed in vivo at high level from bicarbonate, this radical can be included in the oxidants capable of performing the last metabolic step of taurine biosynthesis. Moreover, the protective effect exerted by hypotaurine and cysteine sulfinate on the carbonate radical anion-mediated tyrosine dimerization indicates that both sulfinates have scavenging activity towards the carbonate radical anion.
