5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
500|$|At 11p.m. on 14 November, Deodoro took {{command of}} 600 men, the {{majority}} of whom either had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was occurring or {{believed that they were}} organizing a defence against the National Guard or the Black Guard. A few republicans yelled [...] "Hail to the Republic" [...] but Deodoro ordered them to be silent.|$|E

25|$|At this point, flight {{controllers}} {{were aware}} {{only that the}} plane had disappeared from radar and {{did not respond to}} radio calls, but had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> either <b>what</b> had happened or the plane's location.|$|R
500|$|When Timberlake {{began working}} on FutureSex/LoveSounds at Timbaland's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia, they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the album would be like with no plan for it or even a title. He told his {{collaborators}} to do a remake of his previous single, [...] "Cry Me a River". Danja, a protégé of Timbaland, stated: [...] "We had no direction at all other than 'Cry Me a River,' {{and not in the}} sense of mimicking the track, but in how big the song was. There was no direction for how he wanted the song to sound, because there was no direction for how he wanted [...] to sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry later said: [...] "The newspapers, television, theatres {{and radio}} were all run {{by people of}} a {{different}} generation who had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> youngsters wanted. For decades they had manipulated and controlled them. Suddenly, there was an awareness of being young, and young people wanted their own styles and their own music, just {{at the time they}} were beginning to earn money, which gave them the spending power. Mersey Beat was their voice, it was a paper for them, crammed with photos and information about their own groups, which is why it also began to appeal to youngsters throughout Britain as its coverage extended to other areas." [...] Because of the employment situation in Liverpool at the time, The Daily Worker newspaper denounced the enthusiasm of younger people in Liverpool by saying [...] "The Mersey Sound is the sound of 30,000 people on the dole." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2017, Rachel Sylvester {{reported}} in The Times that Johnson was ineffective and incoherent on major issues like North Korea and Qatar whilst on Brexit, {{he appeared to}} have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was required. His rhetoric seemed {{to suggest that the}} UK could dictate the terms [...] "as if {{it was some kind of}} public school game rather than a negotiation on which the future of the nation depends." [...] Sylvester believed that both European ministers and White House officials regard him as a joke. This follows a Today programme interview in June on the Queens speech where, asked about the Government's answer to the [...] "burning injustices," [...] highlighted by Theresa May when she became prime minister, he showed a lack of understanding of the issues sufficiently serious to require prompting by Eddie Mair.|$|E
5000|$|Quentin and his {{siblings}} witness all of this, given {{that they are}} present for every major conversation between their father and Nancy. Mr. Compson tries to help her {{up to a certain}} extent, first by taking her home at night despite the fact that Mrs. Compson feels jealous and insecure that her husband is more worried about protecting some [...] "Negro woman" [...] than herself. He puts her up one night at Quentin and Caddy's room when she is too afraid to stay alone in the kitchen. The kids, however, have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going on, and cannot understand Nancy's fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and it was}} I who {{had made}} him believe. I didn't mean to, at the time, so much; for I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> then <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was coming. But I did it, I did it!" [...] the Princess declared.|$|R
60|$|Then, for example, Johnny began {{shouting}} his wares in a {{way that}} was more noisy than distinct. But after he had repeated it several times, selling two papers in the meanwhile, Paul had <b>no</b> more <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he said than if he had been speaking in a foreign tongue.|$|R
2500|$|Rainer's anthropometric work, {{which used}} for a {{permanent}} record peasant photographs, in large part taken by Milcu, remains a problematic aspect of Gustian sociology. As noted by cultural historian Z. Ornea (based on Stahl's recollections), Rainer [...] "carried out unperturbed his anthropometric research, although {{he was not an}} adept of racial science and had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> this anthropometry and blood chemistry [...] were going to be used for. And yet, the great professor of histology would return annually to the villages that were studied by the monographic teams and to carry out this research with no purpose and no finality." [...] Anthropologist Vintilă Mihăilescu also notes that the combination of Gusti's sociology and Rainer's physical anthropology was a [...] "domestic ethnology", [...] "self-referential" [...] and [...] "biased", but nevertheless an [...] "important tool" [...] for later cultural anthropology.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced by Shashida, after {{a number}} of contacts, Bhupen {{recognised}} in Bagha Jatin the leader he was waiting for. Invited by his friend Hemanta Kumar Sarkar, Bhupen went to Krishnagar and spent a few days in the company of Subhas Chandra Bose, the future [...] "Netaji". Contrary to his habit, during a conversation, Bhupen disclosed to the friends his meeting with Bagha Jatin and informed them that he sensed that there was a big revolutionary preparation going on under Jatin's guidance. Subhash listened to all this and, moved up to his core, retired without dinner. He had a conviction that one had to be a [...] "liberated soul" [...] (mukta-purush) in order to lead a revolution and, the next day, asked Bhupen point blank, [...] "Is Jatin Mukherjee a mukta-purush?" [...] Bhupen told him that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a mukta-purush was, but there was a man who not only quoted the Gita but whose very life was an embodiment of the teachings of the Gita.|$|E
2500|$|At about 08:30, a FAR Sea Fury piloted by Carlos Ulloa Arauz {{crashed in}} the bay, due to {{stalling}} or anti-aircraft fire, after encountering a FAL C-46 returning south after dropping paratroops. By 09:00, Cuban troops and militia {{from outside the}} area had started arriving at the Central Australia sugar mill, Covadonga and Yaguaramas. Throughout the day they were reinforced by more troops, heavy armour and T-34 tanks typically carried on flat-bed trucks. At about 09:30, FAR Sea Furies and T-33s fired rockets at Rio Escondido, which then 'blew up' and sank about [...] south of Girón. Rio Escondido was loaded with aviation fuel and as the ship started to burn, the captain gave the order to abandon ship with the ship being destroyed in three explosions shortly afterwards. Rio Escondido carried not only fuel, but also enough ammunition, food and medical supplies to last ten days and the radio that allowed the Brigade {{to communicate with the}} Liberation Air Force. The loss of the communications ship Rio Escondido meant that San Román was only able to issue orders to the forces at Blue Beach, and he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was happening at Red Beach or with the paratroopers. A messenger from Red Beach arrived at about 10:00 am asking San Román to send tank and infantry to block the road from the Central Australia sugar mill, a request that he agreed to. It was not expected that government forces would be counter-attacking from this direction.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, {{there was}} <b>no</b> clear <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Pakleds should look like, {{other than that}} they should appear as {{harmless}} as possible. Director Les Landau described the aliens as [...] "ugly and slow", and compared their motivation as [...] "a need for things" [...] which he said was a reflection of modern society.|$|R
5000|$|... {{initially}} Alan just {{wrote an}} opening chapter {{with a man}} being hanged and finding himself {{in a world of}} mazes.

60|$|Spring! Ha! {{who among}} the dwellers in our favoured land has the faintest idea of--of--pooh!--words are wanting.

5000|$|The film {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film {{a score of}} 29%, an average rating of 4.4/10, sampled from 24 reviews. The consensus states: [...] "The Benefactor has Richard Gere and Dakota Fanning, but <b>no</b> clear <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do with either of them, resulting in a drama that never comes anywhere near its intriguing potential."
