50|$|Under {{a system}} of fiat fixed rates, the local {{government}} or monetary authority declares a fixed exchange rate but does not actively buy or sell currency to maintain the rate. Instead, the rate is enforced by <b>non-convertibility</b> measures (e.g. capital controls, import/export licenses, etc.). In this case there is a black market exchange rate where the currency trades at its market/unofficial rate.|$|E
50|$|The Revolución Juliana (July 9, 1925) {{initiated}} {{the process of}} founding a national bank issuer. The country's crisis, caused by <b>non-convertibility</b> of the currency, banknote printing without reserves to support the increase in currency, inflation, speculation, abuse of credit, unbalanced payments, lack of official control over the banks and banking anarchy and strife, required cleaning up the currency situation. Current governor is Diego Martinez.|$|E
50|$|His {{government}} started {{under the}} weight of the worst Chilean economic crisis of the 19th century. This was made worse by the floods of 1876, that laid waste to the nascent infrastructure. An earthquake on May 9, 1877, completed the destruction. At this juncture, he declared the <b>non-convertibility</b> of the currency, a measure that prevented a run on the banks and saved the public credit, but caused him the enmity of the opposition.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of various {{previous}} proposals, an expert group chaired by Luxembourg’s Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Pierre Werner, presented in October 1970 the first commonly agreed blueprint to create an economic and monetary union in three stages (Werner plan). The project experienced serious setbacks from the crises arising from the <b>non-convertibility</b> of the US dollar into gold in August 1971 (i.e., {{the collapse of the}} Bretton Woods System) and from rising oil prices in 1972. An attempt to limit the fluctations of European currencies, using a snake in the tunnel, failed.|$|E
5000|$|Of equal {{benefit to}} Laos was the rapid {{expansion}} of tourism in South-East Asia, in which again Thailand was a leading participant. The Lao government saw the possibilities of income from tourism in the 1990s, but the almost total lack of tourist infrastructure, the poor transport system, the <b>non-convertibility</b> of the Lao currency and fears by some communist officials of political dangers and [...] "cultural pollution" [...] from an influx of foreigners all acted as barriers. The American writer Brett Dakin, who worked as an adviser to the Lao National Tourism Authority, has written an amusing account of the struggles of the Lao bureaucracy to adapt {{to the demands of the}} tourism industry.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese currency, the renminbi (RMB), {{had been}} pegged in 1994 to the U.S. dollar at {{a ratio of}} 8.3 RMB to the dollar. Having largely kept itself above the fray {{throughout}} 1997-1998, there was heavy speculation in the Western press that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency to protect the competitiveness of its exports vis-a-vis those of the ASEAN nations, whose exports became cheaper relative to China's. However, the RMB's <b>non-convertibility</b> protected its value from currency speculators, and {{the decision was made to}} maintain the peg of the currency, thereby improving the country's standing within Asia. The currency peg was partly scrapped in July 2005, rising 2.3% against the dollar, reflecting pressure from the United States.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurrying is a {{transformation}} of term rewrite systems which may contain symbols of arbitrary arity into systems which contain only nullary symbols, together with a single binary symbol called application. We show that for all term rewrite systems (whether orthogonal or not) the following properties are preserved by this transformation: strong normalization, weak normalization, weak Church-Rosser, completeness, semi-completeness, and the <b>non-convertibility</b> of distinct normal forms. Under the condition of left-linearity we show preservation of the properties NF (if a term is reducible to a normal form,then its reducts are all reducible to the same normal form) and UN→ (a term is reducible to at most one normal form). We exhibit counterexamples {{to the preservation of}} NF and UN→ for non-left-linear systems. The results extend to partial currying(where some subset of the symbols are curried),and imply some modularity properties for unions of applicative systems...|$|E
40|$|This chapter characterizes Oceanic {{exchange}} {{regimes in}} terms of a continuum. It is suggested {{that there are a number}} of broadly parallel axes of difference along which very diverse exchange systems can be ranged. At one end are forms of exchange that typically transact like against like, that deploy quantity rather than qualitative rank difference, that often are based on food rather than valuables and are also articulated with brideservice rather than bridewealth. These systems are also typically localized rather than regionally extensive, they exist within societies which are not economically specialized, they are characterized by intense and unstable competition, and values are generally non-convertible, that is, life and valuables circulate in distinct spheres and cannot be written off against one another. This regime of <b>non-convertibility</b> is epitomized by the Marquesas in Polynesia and many Austronesian and non-Austronesian New Guinea societies. The exchange regimes characterized by convertibility, regional differentiation, the use of valuables and categorically hierarchical relations are epitomized by Fiji. While such a schematic analysis requires many qualifications, the broad continuum is important for the colonial histories in which indigenous systems are caught up. In general, “non-conversion ” regimes are less able to exploit and incorporate the new possibilities for external and internal exchange that contacts with traders, missions, and the like, enable. Although there is a brief period of political efflorescence in the early nineteenth century in eastern Polynesia, the pattern is one of political decline, that contrasts sharply with the continuing dynamism of “value conversion ” systems such as Fiji...|$|E
40|$|The {{collapse}} of financial markets and exchange rates across Southeast and East Asia in 1997 and 1998 affected {{the economies of}} China and Vietnam much less than those of most other Asian countries. Ironically, the two transitional economies were protected {{to a great extent}} by the incomplete nature of their banking reforms and financial market development. The yuan and the dong were not yet traded internationally, securities markets were in very early stages of development, and tax codes, trade regulations, and accounting standards in the two countries did not yet fully conform to international norms. Yet the <b>non-convertibility</b> of their currencies served to shield the Chinese and Vietnamese economies from the sharp declines in exchange rates and securities prices that devastated the incomes of millions of people in Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This paper examines the implications for future policy reforms in China and Vietnam {{of the impact of the}} Asian financial crisis. The relative immunity of the two economies calls into question some central assumptions of conventional economic development theory. It is no longer clear that full currency convertibility should be sought at the earliest opportunity. The experiences of the Asian economies in the late 1990 s suggest that emphasis on development of stable, efficient domestic banking systems and mature financial markets should take priority over full integration with international financial markets. This argument has been developed by Pan Yotopoulos in his book, Exchange Rate Parity for Trade and Development (Cambridge, 1996), and merits further consideration with respect to the financial policies of Vietnam and China.

Lawson {{from the}} Centre d'application agropastoral de Kovié, Lomé, Togo has written {{to express his}} {{frustration}} relating to the different currencies in which the books featured on pages 14 and 15 of Spore are sold. 'We {{find it very difficult}} to obtain books which have to be paid for in foreign exchange. The cost can double by the time the bank charges have been paid, even if the transaction is allowed in the first place. I know from experience that I {{will not be able to}} order books, even if the price is reasonable. Would it not be possible to look into this and suggest a way of paying that avoids this problem? Obviously CTA cannot send out books willy nilly but it is very frustrating to read about books that we know would be useful to us and yet be unable to obtain them. ' Spore: Lack of foreign exchange and the <b>non-convertibility</b> of money are major obstacles to the dissemination of publications and, therefore, access to information. CTA distributes publications of many different kinds to ACP readers but our limited budget means, of course, that we cannot help everyone to the extent they would wish. UNESCO has established a system of coupons which are designed to overcome foreign exchange problems. The coupons have a US dollar value and can be used for publications (including periodicals), audio-visual and scientific materials. In practice, you buy coupons in your local currency and these have a dollar value (at the UN rate). You can then pay for books or other educational or scientific materials with the coupons. The publisher, bookshop or other recipient exchanges the coupons, through UNESCO, for their monetary value. We do not have space here to give you all the details but we suggest that you write to UNESCO Coupons Office, 7 Place de Fontenoy, 75700 Paris, France and they will be able to supply you with further information and an address from where you can purchase coupons in your own country or region.
