5000|$|A {{number of}} {{artefacts}} {{have been collected}} {{by a number of}} researchers who have visited the site including canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block, duck bill leather sewing pliers, percussion <b>cap,</b> <b>nipples</b> and bullets consistent with the calibre, vintage and make of weapons taken on the Burke and Wills Expedition. These artefacts have been compared with the [...] "List of Stores III" [...] from the expedition and found to be consistent with goods that were officially supplied.|$|R
50|$|The cap of H. subalpinus is {{typically}} 4 to 6 cm in diameter, with a convex shape that becomes flattened in age; sometimes it develops a central umbo (a rounded elevation resembling a <b>nipple).</b> The <b>cap</b> is sticky, white, and the cap margin often has {{fragments of the}} veil adhering. The flesh is soft, thick and white. The gills, which are attached decurrently to the stipe (running {{down the length of}} the stipe), are narrow, packed closely together, and white-colored. The stipe is white, 3 to 4 cm long and 1 to 2 cm thick at the apex; when young the base of the stipe is bulbous but as it grows it thins and becomes almost the same width as at the top of the stem. A membranous annulus is present, placed low on the stipe.|$|R
50|$|It had {{a single}} 1.25 inches caliber smooth-bore barrel. The barrel was fed from a revolver-like ring, but with an axis of {{rotation}} perpendicular to the bore, rather than the usual revolver configuration with parallel axes. The cylinder housed 18 copper-lined chambers that were muzzle loaded from the outer side of the ring. The interior side of the multiple-chamber ring was lined with the corresponding 18 percussion <b>cap</b> <b>nipples.</b> The ring was rotated by a hand lever. The gun had a cast iron receiver.|$|R
5000|$|The Landmark {{conversion}} {{refers to}} a modification invented by Jens Landmark. The chamber, which on a kammerlader is a separate piece tilted up and to the rear, is opened as before, but can be tilted further backwards {{by means of a}} hinge {{in the middle of the}} chamber. The 12.17 x 44 mm rim fire cartridge is placed backwards, facing the shooter, before everything is rolled back forward. The only part to be modified was the chamber and a curving firing pin was added where the <b>nipple</b> for the <b>cap</b> had been. Pictures showing the Landmark conversion can be found here https://web.archive.org/web/20030311160938/http://www.svartkrutt.net/landmark.php ...|$|R
50|$|The {{alteration}} {{of the military}} flint-lock to the percussion musket was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan by a perforated nipple, and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint with a smaller hammer that had a hollow to fit on the nipple when released by the trigger. The shooter placed a percussion cap (now made of three parts of potassium chlorate, two of fulminate of mercury and powdered glass) on the <b>nipple.</b> The detonating <b>cap</b> thus invented and adopted, brought about {{the invention of the}} modern cartridge case, and rendered possible the general adoption of the breech-loading principle for all varieties of rifles, shotguns and pistols. This greatly streamlined the reloading procedure and paved the way for semi- and full-automatic firearms.|$|R
60|$|Now it chanced {{that some}} months before a young Englishman of good family--he {{was named the}} Honourable Vavasseur Smyth--who had {{accompanied}} an official relative to the Cape Colony, came our way in search of sport, of which I was able to show him {{a good deal of}} a humble kind. He had brought with him, amongst other weapons, what in those days was considered a very beautiful hair-triggered small-bore rifle fitted with a <b>nipple</b> for percussion <b>caps,</b> then quite a new invention. It was by a maker of the name of J. Purdey, of London, and had cost quite a large sum because of the perfection of its workmanship. When the Honourable V. Smyth--of whom I have never heard since--took his leave of us on his departure for England, being a generous-hearted young fellow, as a souvenir of himself, he kindly presented me with this rifle,* which I still have.|$|R
5000|$|The Plant Camp is {{significant}} for {{its potential to}} contain additional archaeological artefacts associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, particularly equipment associated with Wills' decision to [...] "plant" [...] or bury his astronomical equipment and Burke's order to leave behind everything except food and whatever they could carry on their backs. The Plant Camp has been identified through the presence of archaeological artefacts and two blazed trees situated along an unnamed ephemeral creek line on Durrie Station. Artefacts located to date include percussion <b>caps,</b> <b>nipples,</b> buckles, canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block and duck bill leather sewing pliers {{a number of the}} brass fittings, including a clasp, escutcheon, latch and hinge all suggestive of a possible instrument case. These artefacts date to the same period (s-1860s) as the Burke and Wills expedition and are consistent with items listed in the detailed [...] "List of Stores III" [...] of goods officially supplied to the expedition.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the percussion cap building on the percussion powder innovations of the Rev. Alexander Forsyth's patent of 1807 (which ran until 1821), and the industrial revolution allowed pepperbox revolvers to be mass-produced, making them more affordable than the early handmade guns previously only seen {{in the hands of}} the rich. The {{invention of}} the percussion cap has been variously attributed to several Englishmen including Joseph Egg, Col. Peter Hawker, James Purdey and Joshua Shaw in the late 1810s and early 1820s. The uncertainty has been compounded because no British patent was awarded while the use of fulminating salts for priming guns was protected by Forsyth's earlier patent. Some French makers attempted to patent the idea including Prelat in 1818 and Deboubert in 1820. Examples of these early weapons are the English Budding (probably the first English percussion pepperbox), the Swedish Engholm and the American three-barrel Manhattan pistol. Most percussion pepperboxes have a circular flange around the rear of the cylinder to prevent the <b>capped</b> <b>nipples</b> being accidentally fired if the gun were to be knocked while in a pocket, or dropped, and to protect the eyes from cap fragments.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next major}} leap in {{ignition}} technology was {{the invention of}} the chemical primer, or [...] "cap", and the mechanism which used it, called the [...] "caplock". Percussion ignition was invented by Scottish clergyman Rev. Alexander John Forsyth in 1807 but needed further refinements before it was gradually accepted in the 1820s to 1830s. By the middle of the 19th century the percussion or caplock system was well established. It was adopted by both sides in the American Civil War, as it was simpler and more reliable than the flintlock. The main reason the caplock was so quickly adopted was its similarity to the flintlock and the ease of converting older arms to use percussion-cap ignition; usually the same lock and barrel could be used with minor changes. The flashpan and frizzen were removed and replaced by a small, hollow horizontal cylinder (drum) screwed into the bored-out and tapped flash hole and carrying a [...] "nipple" [...] over which the cap could be fitted. A [...] "hammer" [...] which also had half-cock (for loading and applying the cap) and full-cock positions replaced the cock. When released by pulling the trigger, the hammer would strike the cap, crushing it against the <b>nipple.</b> The percussion <b>cap</b> was a thin metal cup that contained a small quantity of pressure-sensitive explosive. When crushed, the explosive would detonate, sending a stream of hot gas down {{through a hole in the}} nipple and into the touchhole of the gun to ignite the powder charge. In the process of firing, the cap generally split open and would fall off when the hammer was moved to half-cock position for loading. The caplock system worked well, and is still the preferred method of ignition for hunters and recreational shooters who use muzzle-loading arms.|$|R
