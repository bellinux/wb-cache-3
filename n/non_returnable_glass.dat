50|$|Three {{of these}} grand homes remain within the village. Pittsford Farms, {{the oldest of}} the three village estates, was {{established}} in the 1860s by Jarvis Lord, a canal contractor. The property has retained its historic appearance and remains today a 200 acre working farm, owned by descendants of the Zornow family. The farm's dairy plant continues to bottle milk in <b>returnable</b> <b>glass</b> containers. The Town of Pittsford has purchased the development rights to this farm and seven others to ensure their open space remains for generations to come.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the social}} impact of liberalisation of plastic bottles in Malta, wherein {{the system of}} <b>returnable</b> <b>glass</b> bottles has effectively {{been replaced by a}} system of disposable plastic bottles. The paper applies concepts such as Ulrich Beck's (1992) 'risk society', and Michael Cahill's (1994) 'consumer society' to the issue under research. A quantitative survey administered in two Maltese localities shows that whilst there is a wide-ranging opposition towards the plastic bottles system, at the same time, most respondents are not ready to make financial contributions for a better environment. Such perceptions are compared with those of European counterparts. plastic bottles; risk society; environmental sociology; consumer society; Malta; social impacts; liberalisation; <b>returnable</b> bottles; <b>glass</b> bottles; disposable bottles; Ulrich Beck; Michael Cahill; quantitative surveys; local opposition; financial contributions; environmental improvements; waste management; sustainability; sustainable development; consumerism; soft drinks; beverages; consumer attitudes; packaging; Attard; Marsascala; bottling plants; refuse collection; recycling; Europe; green economics. ...|$|R

Therefore, an industry or a company should always maintain the quality of their products in order to get loyal customers and are able to survive in the competitive market. Coca-cola Bottling Indonesia Central Java Limited Company is one of the manufacturing company engaged in the beverage packaging industry and always trying to improve the quality for customer satisfaction. Although it has been to improve the quality, there are still defective product because it does not meet the quality characteristics. Monitoring the result of production process aims to determine whether the process is stable or not.

50|$|Milk can {{be shipped}} in many forms. One of the {{traditional}} forms was reusable <b>returnable</b> <b>glass</b> milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common: one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, one-way recyclable glass bottles, one-way milk bags, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint, the reuse of bottles is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is silica-sand, which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with milk and distributed to the consumer. A reverse logistics system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually the heavy duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized. The material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a life cycle assessment {{can be used to}} calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.|$|R

[...] The Brewery uses a traditional bottle-washing machine to clean the returned glass bottles and prepare them for refilling. Heavy-duty, reusable cardboard cases and dividers enable the Brewery to minimize the amount of new packaging material. Straub Returnables are known to be an environmentally sustainable product, produced by an American Legacy Brewery™ in the PA Wilds.

50|$|Ajegroup employs certain {{strategies}} {{to help maintain}} its low cost economic plan. Ajegroup has bottling plants in Huejotzingo, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. The largest of the plants is in Huejotzingo, where production lines run for 24 hours a day, six days a week. Ajegroup therefore produces its own plastic bottles, which provides a low-cost alternative to <b>glass</b> <b>returnable</b> bottles and has helped brands like Big Cola compete with bigger names like Pepsi and Coca Cola.Ajegroup also utilizes lean staffing to cut costs, and modern equipment and kaizen, or continuous improvement, to help {{reduce the number of}} workers on each of the Huejotzingo plant's seven production lines to eight, which is fewer than half that of a typical bottling facility. Ajegroup also gives deliveries to independent truckers rather than employing their own fleet of trucks and drivers, saving money on distribution. This, in addition to their minimal advertising technique, further reduces its costs. Ajegroup has had few television and billboard ads, and primarily relies on word of mouth to find customers.|$|R
40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as wine bottling depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. Bottle washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer bottles, wine bottles, or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as <b>returnables.</b> Today, most <b>glass</b> containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine bottles remain an exception. Wine bottles manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine bottles is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine bottle does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight wine bottles as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine bottle washing facilities. Finally, wine bottles wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine bottles. The collection of bottles must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers. Certai...|$|R
