50|$|The {{future of}} False Creek south was {{subsequently}} shaped by debates on freeways, urban renewal, {{and the rise}} of citizen participation in urban planning. Through the 60s, the ruling NPA city government and senior city bureaucrats had hatched a plan - with little or <b>no</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> - to run freeways through the city. In the same period, the City razed large portions of Strathcona under the aegis of urban renewal. A group of influential citizens formed The Electors Action Movement (TEAM) to oppose the freeway and to radically change the way decisions were made on land use. A key figure amongst these people was Walter Hardwick, a Geography professor at UBC who envisioned the retrofit of this brownfield industrial site into a vibrant waterfront mixed-use community.|$|E

Drive just forty-five minutes {{northeast}} of Edmonton and you enter the Alberta Industrial Heartland. Here, the North Saskatchewan River flows by numerous factories that are tied to AB's gas and oil boom. Three factories are built here because of the rich Redwater gas fields. Now the bitumen from the tarsands is shipped by pipeline down to this area to be processed, refined and used by the many industries that rely upon oil (e. g. pesticide manufacturing). Local residents are overwhelmed by the recent restructuring of their communities-vast areas now designated "industrial". The residents' lives are consumed by attending open houses for new industries that are moving into their communities, council meetings where "deals" are announced and sealed-usually with litle or <b>no</b> legitimate <b>public</b> <b>consultation,</b> and official inquiries where the industries present scientific data to document that there will not be any harmful emissions from their industrial processes.

Our work builds on experience from co-design workshops we held in Upplands Väsby concerning a conflict between politicians, civil servants and citizens. Seeing the workshop as a space of agonism, an arena for different positions to meet and negotiate, we as designers work with form and material to support the different interests. We suggest three categories to consider when crafting this agonistic space; perspectives, format and material. Acknowledging the complexity of planning, no longer striving for consensus but to keep the negotiation alive, is a starting-point for understanding the different conflicting interests and together create ways of working well with wickedness through making more sensible judgements...|$|R

50|$|NOTA UK is a {{voluntary}} organisation {{set up in}} 2010 to campaign for a formal None Of The Above (NOTA) option {{to be added to}} ballot papers for all future UK elections. It has made numerous written evidence submissions to the parliamentary Political & Constitutional Reform Committee (PCRC) making the case for NOTA 'with teeth' i.e.: formalised consequences for the election result {{in the event of a}} NOTA 'win' (as opposed to 'faux' NOTA, whereby the next placed candidate takes office anyway as happens in India and elsewhere). As a result of these representations, the PCRC explicitly recommended in its final report on 'voter engagement', published February 2015, that the next UK government should hold a public consultation before May 2016 solely on inclusion of NOTA on UK ballot papers. This in turn has led to increased support for and awareness of NOTA UK's campaign and its founder, recording artist and music producer Jamie Stanley (aka: Mailman), being asked to give a number of media interviews. <b>No</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> materialised as the incoming Conservative government scrapped the PCRC, effectively disregarding all of its recommendations.|$|E
40|$|Transition, {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} dramatic changes that have impacted Canadian television broadcasting {{over the past two}} decades. Placing the largely market-driven and indus-try-led digitization of channels under scrutiny, the author questions if we can still refer to the current situation as “broadcasting, ” since the traditional sender-receiver model and mass dissemination of content via analogue systems is now nearly obsolete. Startlingly, the changeover from analogue to digital services has occurred with little or <b>no</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultation,</b> or any form of dialogue between key players in government, industry, and Canadian society. This is especially surprising since digital broadcasting changes the way Canadians “view ” television: while it seemingly offers more content choices through on-demand services, digital broadcasting also saddles consumers with a technological lock-in and a media landscape marked by convergence—not to men-tion greater surveillance and data-mining by media corporations. The transition from an analogue “push ” medium to a digital “pull ” service (reflected predominantly by video-on-demand and greater audience interactivity), presents...|$|E

40|$|Street Pastors have {{appeared}} {{on the streets of}} Britain with virtually <b>no</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> or discussion. They are in many cases being integrated into the policymaking machinery of local government and policing which is of concern. An evaluation of their activities and of the public‟s attitudes to their role is, therefore of great importance. Although the stated aims of the Street Pastors centre around crime reduction, reduction of fear of crime and offering a „listening ear‟ to vulnerable people, there has been unsubstantiated evidence that many Street Pastors are using their position to engage in „preaching‟ and evangelical work. In this research we explored this further and identified how far Street Pastors are associated with a religious role rather than a crime reduction, support or safety role. This enabled us to evaluate the role of the Street Pastors by collecting data on the perceptions and attitudes to their activities. It also enabled us to hypothesise about explicit linkages between religion and trust levels, and to compare levels of trust between different groups involved in the night time economy. This research follows from previous research on Street Pastors (see Barton, Johns & Squire, 2009) and on trust and substitutes for trust (Barton & Johns, 2009; Johns & Green, 2009). It reports on the findings of an online survey of students in a major city in the south of England about their interactions with, and attitudes to the Street Pastors in that city. A number of studies place the church near the top of a list of most trusted institutions, and religious personnel as trustworthy on an individual basis (Ipsos Mori, 2008; Charity Awareness Monitor, 2008). The aims were to explore the perceived role of the Street Pastors by students; to compare the levels of trust students‟ have in the various groups they interact with in the night time economy; and to develop further the notion of trust substitutes in the night time economy...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} the latest draft law on special autonomy in Papua, the politics {{behind it and}} how it might feed into Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s coming national elections. Overview: The idea of a new law on enhanced special autonomy (otsus plus) for Papua is still alive, {{but it is not}} clear who beyond a tiny elite in Papua province really wants it. Teams representing the governors of Papua and Papua Barat provinces have produced a joint draft, but Papua Barat remains deeply unhappy with the final product. It is now in the hands of the central government, awaiting a “harmonisation” process through which it will be reviewed and almost certainly watered down by various ministries. Officials say the target date for getting a final draft adopted by the Indonesian parliament is 17 August 2014. They believe there is still a chance that it can squeeze through, despite national elections and a long list of other legislative priorities competing for attention. The latest draft contains several new provisions, all of which were inserted by the Papua team and opposed by its counterpart from Papua Barat. It creates the largely powerless position of governor-general to supervise the law’s implementation in both Papua and Papua Barat. It defines indigenous Papuan in racial terms, granting indigenous status to anyone born of a Melanesian Papuan father regardless of the mother’s origin but not to someone whose mother only was Melanesian Papuan. It also requires that only indigenous Papuans be allowed to stand for all elected executive posts from governor and vice-governor down to village head. It abandons direct local elections. It mandates a single and strengthened Papuan People’s Council (Majelis Rakyat Papua, MRP) that would be based in Jayapura. The most controversial provision, which would have given Papua the right to call a referendum on self-determination if the law is not fully implemented, was removed just before it was presented to the president on 28 January. The current version—Draft No. 14 —pays lip service to the idea of a single Papua, but the drafting process has highlighted deep divisions between the two provinces that have not been erased, even after a meeting on 15 February produced a formal consensus. From the outset, the push for otsus plus has been driven by Papua Governor Lukas Enembe and a small circle of advisers in Jayapura. Their main aim was to strengthen provincial authority. They never seriously invited input from their colleagues in Manokwari, the Papua Barat capital, and even after the latter produced an alternative draft with innovative proposals, they failed to incorporate many of its key provisions. The central government has encouraged the process to date for several reasons. President Yudhoyono reportedly wants to ensure a concrete legacy in Papua before he leaves office in October 2014. His political party, Partai Demokrat, whose Papua provincial branch Enembe heads, has plummeted in the polls and is looking for a success, if possible before the April legislative elections. The Ministry of Home Affairs likes the bill—or at least some aspects of it—because with its provision on the removal of direct elections, it promotes the concept of “asymmetric decentralisation” or different governance arrangements for different parts of the country. The Ministry is hoping to drive through new laws on local government and local elections before the end of the legislative term that that will also feature this concept, and with Enembe’s team backing it for Papua, the Ministry can say it has local support. In the meantime, for all the effort that has gone into revising drafts, it is still the case that there has been <b>no</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> or debate, and Papuan civil society seems to regard the whole idea of revising special autonomy with deep cynicism, if not derision. Other issues have captured far more attention: • The inadequacy in Papua of preparations for the general elections that will be held in only six weeks’ time, including uncertainty about whether the noken system, an allegedly traditional practice that gives the authority to local leaders to vote on behalf of their communities, will be allowed. The potential for violence one way or another could be high, especially in the highlands. • The continuing pattern of attacks on security forces in Puncak Jaya district and mixed messages from local officials on the nature and success of informal efforts at dialogue with the armed guerrilla movement, the Free Papua Organisation (Organisasi Papua Merdeka, OPM). • The unsolved rash of shootings in December and January along the road to the giant Freeport mine, and the prospects of massive layoffs at the site because of the provisions of a new mining law. • The sentencing of ALL the members of the Papua Barat legislature to terms ranging from twelve to fifteen months for their role in a corruption case involving alleged private loans from the provincial budget. None are yet in prison, and business continues as usual in Manokwari pending the outcome of an appeal at the Jayapura court. • The conviction of a notoriously corrupt police official from Sorong, Papua Barat on illegal logging charges. He was sentenced to only two years’ imprimsonment when the prosecution had asked for fifteen, and most of the more serious money laundering and smuggling charges against him were dropped. • The failure of the Mimika kabupaten government to hold a second round of elections, where the leading candidate is a non-Papuan. • The active consideration by the Ministry of Home Affairs of at least 30 new kabupaten across Papua and Papua Barat and three new provinces (Papua Tengah, Papua Selatan and Papua Barat Daya). With everything else going on, the otsus plus debate seems like a sideshow, but the implications if some version of it does get adopted could be huge...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{expectation}} {{by the public}} for {{a greater degree of}} participatory democracy in planning and development. Governments have responded to this expectation by increasing the amount of <b>public</b> <b>consultation.</b> Still, <b>public</b> discontent with the efficacy of <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> including the level of participation, accessibility, transparency and accountability remains. This thesis focuses on the importance of the quality over the quantity of <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> to improve satisfaction with government decision making related to land use planning and development. More specifically, it focuses on the following elements: the types and levels of <b>public</b> <b>consultation,</b> accessibility of the consultations for different stakeholders, the influence of stakeholders in decision-making, and the meaning attached by stakeholders to the consultation experience in various planning and development processes. 	This thesis examines the degree of participatory democracy {{within the context of a}} case study of <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> undertaken by the City of Saskatoon between 2000 and 2010 to plan and develop the South Downtown Waterfront Redevelopment. The analysis is rooted in theoretical and conceptual frameworks contained within the relevant literature on <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> drawn from different disciplines. The case study produced several key findings; the most notable is that the stakeholder assessment of the value or efficacy of <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> used by the City is affected by the mechanisms in which they participate. Public sector and business sector stakeholders invited by the City to participate in central participative mechanisms, such as steering committees, expressed a higher degree of confidence that the consultations had significant positive influence in shaping the project. By contrast, community stakeholders invited by the City to participate in less participative mechanisms, such as open houses, expressed a lower degree of confidence that the <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> had significant positive influence in shaping the project. This thesis concludes by recommending that the City of Saskatoon enhance participatory democracy in land use planning and development by: expanding the 'Community Engagement Model' to encompass the full 'Public Participation Spectrum' for all stakeholders; establish a complementary evaluation framework based on normative participation principles; expand the types and levels of <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> available; and, adopt more inclusionary, accountable and transparent <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> practices...|$|R
