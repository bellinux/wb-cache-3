5|$|The frailty of the {{argument}} is that it implies that God, a being which does <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from transworld depravity by the assumption of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E

5|$|Miskovsky {{was born}} on May 11, 1926 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Jaroslav Miskovsky, an {{immigrant}} from Czechoslovakia, and Ruth Miskovsky (nee Patera). He grew up during the Great Depression, but his family did <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> significant economic harm. Miskovsky's father was heavily involved in Chicago politics, and Miskovsky would frequently help him deliver food and clothes to people unable to afford them.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, Headley's {{average in}} Test matches of 60.83 is third highest {{among those with}} 2,000 runs, behind Bradman and Graeme Pollock, and but for the Tests he played after the war, {{he would have been}} above Pollock. In all {{first-class}} matches, he has the third highest average with 69.86, behind Bradman and Vijay Merchant among those who played 50 innings. He averaged a century every fourth innings in which he batted, second again to Bradman, and did <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> a poor series in his career before the war.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{approved}} the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see also Soviet–Afghan relations) {{just as he}} had previously {{approved the}} Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In both cases, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest for a possible armed intervention. Several leading members of the Soviet leadership decided to retain Brezhnev as General Secretary so that their careers would <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> by a possible leadership reshuffling by his successor. Other members, who disliked Brezhnev, among them Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Mikhail Suslov (Central Committee Secretary), feared that Brezhnev's removal would spark a succession crisis, and so they helped to maintain the status quo.|$|E

They put to sea again on the evening of 29January and eventually reached Kiel in Germany on 1February.|$|E
5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species did <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E
5|$|In theory, {{if enough}} {{satellites}} were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid {{version of the}} Dyson shell mentioned below. Such a shell would <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell {{as high as the}} rigid form. Such a shell would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see below).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), {{former head}} of Project Alice {{and the head of}} the North American Umbrella facility, {{operated}} in Nevada, considers Alice's recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture until they are informed of her location.|$|E
5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures.

5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver {{to concentrate on the}} road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E
