5000|$|The {{experiences}} of famine relief organizations {{throughout the world}} over the 1980s and 1990s resulted {{in at least two}} major developments: the [...] "livelihoods approach" [...] and the increased use of <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement income, etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of agricultural land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass starvation. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving markets, the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} population groups in India live in Bastar. The area {{is home to a}} number of different tribal groups (Scheduled tribes) and a variety of languages and dialects are spoken locally. Human developmental shortfalls among these groups have been further compounded in recent times by the incidence of left wing extremism. Local agriculture, animal husbandry and forest based livelihood systems as well as weekly markets and transport networks have been disrupted by prolonged conflict. In a region where standard human development indicators were relatively low to begin with, widespread absence and worsening access to healthcare, education, drinking water, sanitation and food is creating an alarming situation. Availability of state functionaries responsible for delivering these basic minimum services in the conflict affected areas is also very low. Not surprisingly the health and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> of all the districts are well below the state average.|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore which demographic and health status variables moderated the relationship between psychological distress and three nutrition indicators: the consumption of fruits, vegetables and takeaway. - Method We analysed data from the 2009 Self-Reported Health Status Survey Report collected in the state of Queensland, Australia. Adults (N = 6881) reported several demographic and health status variables. Moderated logistic regression models were estimated separately for the three <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators,</b> testing as moderators demographic (age, gender, educational attainment, household income, remoteness, and area-level socioeconomic status) and health status indicators (body mass index, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes status). - Results Several significant interactions emerged between psychological distress, demographic (age, area-level socioeconomic status, and income level), and health status variables (body mass index, diabetes status) in predicting the <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators.</b> Relationships between distress and the <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> were not significantly different by gender, remoteness, educational attainment, high cholesterol status, and high blood pressure status. - Conclusions The associations between psychological distress and several <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> differ amongst population subgroups. These findings suggest that in distressed adults, age, area-level socio-economic status, income level, body mass index, and diabetes status may serve as protective or risk factors through increasing or decreasing the likelihood of meeting nutritional guidelines. Public health interventions for improving dietary behaviours and nutrition may be more effective if they take into account the moderators identified in this study rather than using global interventions...|$|E

This is because India (where almost three-quarters of the region's children live) made the least progress of any country in South Asia; just a 27% improvement. In this region, child nutrition is a substantial obstacle; almost 1 in 2 children is underweight.

Objective: To determine implementation effects of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding before and after WBTi tool assessment using infant/child health data collected between 2000 and 2013 in Cameroon. Methods: A descriptive analysis of Cameroon’s policies, programmes and practices was conducted using the WBTi tool. Child survival and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> before (2003 - 2008) and after (2009 - 2013) WBTi assessment were analyzed {{using data from the}} 2009 and 2015 State of the World’s Children statistical tables Results: Implementation of the GSIYCF improved after WBTi assessment in 2008. Cameroon’s policies and programmes improved more than practices. Under-five and infant mortality rates over the period markedly improved. From 2009 to 2013 there was a 9. 4 % increase in complementary feeding rates, 14. 3 % increase in rates of infants still breastfeeding/breastfeeding at age two, and a 6 % decrease in undernutrition in children between zero and 59 months. Conclusion: The findings of this study reflect an increase in IYCF implementation effects on child survival and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> after WBTi assessment compared with the WHO tool era. This suggests that use of the WBTi tool helped Cameroon focus on specific childhood preventive health interventions to improve child survival and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> in Cameroon.

Aim of the study: Assessment of the relationship between 24 -hour blood pressure parameters in hospitalised teenagers with primary hypertension and their nutrition status at the stage of diagnosis. Material and methods: The study group consisted of  112 patients aged 11 – 17 years (42 girls and  70 boys) with diagnosed primary hypertension. <b>Nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> were taken into account. The study group was divided into group I – persons with normal nutrition status (40 patients) and group II – persons with overweight/obesity (72 patients). The groups were compared using the t-test with a separate variance estimation or with the Mann–Whitney U test. The relationship between blood pressure parameters and nutrition status indicators was assessed based on Spearman’s rank correlation.

The key to this action-oriented framework is the identification of a set of intermediate variables which directly affect the health status of children, but can be influenced by PHC interventions as well.

40|$|The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) {{has been}} an {{important}} contribution to the debate on national and international poverty measurement. With the creation of the global MPI, OHPI and UNDP have provided a household-level multidimensional poverty measure for over 100 developing countries that can usefully complement the widely used $ 1. 25 a day income poverty indicator. Given its link to the concept of human development, it is an important element of the suite of human development indicators maintained and published by UNDP. Nonetheless, there are many open empirical questions and issues regarding the conceptual underpinning of the MPI that need to be discussed and carefully considered. This essay discusses issues with the dual cut-off method for poverty identification, and how inequality could be incorporated in this poverty measure. Moreover, the choice of headline indicator is debated. We also propose a number of changes regarding the empirical implementation. These include dropping the WHS as one of the data sources, dropping the BMI as a <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicator,</b> and changing the age ranges and cutoffs for the education and mortality indicators. Different approaches to deal with the large share of households where information on an MPI indicator is missing are also discussed.

40|$|Abstract Background Cluster surveys provide rapid but {{representative}} {{estimates of}} key <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> in humanitarian crises. For these surveys, an accurate {{estimate of the}} design effect is critical to calculate a sample size that achieves adequate precision with the minimum number of sampling units. This paper describes the variability in design effect for three key <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> measured in small-scale surveys and models the association of design effect with parameters hypothesized to explain this variability. Methods 380 small-scale surveys from 28 countries conducted between 2006 and 2013 were analyzed. We calculated prevalence and design effect of wasting, underweight, and stunting for each survey as well as standard deviations of the underlying continuous Z-score distribution. Mean cluster size, survey location and year were recorded. To describe design effects, median and interquartile ranges were examined. Generalized linear regression models were run to identify potential predictors of design effect. Results Median design effect was under 2. 00 for all three indicators; for wasting, the median was 1. 35, the lowest among the indicators. Multivariable linear regression models suggest significant, positive associations of design effect and mean cluster size for all three indicators, and with prevalence of wasting and underweight, but not stunting. Standard deviation was positively associated with design effect for wasting but negatively associated for stunting. Survey region was significant in all three models. Conclusions This study supports the current field survey guidance recommending the use of 1. 5 as a benchmark for design effect of wasting, but suggests this value may not be large enough for surveys with a primary objective of measuring stunting or underweight. The strong relationship between design effect and region in the models underscores the continued need to consider country- and locality-specific estimates when designing surveys. These models also provide empirical evidence of {{a positive relationship between}} design effect and both mean cluster size and prevalence, and introduces standard deviation of the underlying continuous variable (Z-scores) as a previously unexplored factor significantly associated with design effect. The magnitude and directionality of this association differed by indicator, underscoring the need for further investigation into the relationship between standard deviation and design effect...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} {{evidence of the}} multiple effects of diets on public health nutrition, society and environment. Sustainability and food security are closely inter-related. The traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is recognized as a healthier dietary pattern with a lower environmental impact. As a case study, the MD may guide innovative inter-sectorial efforts to counteract the degradation of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity and homogeneity of diets due to globalization, through the improvement of sustainable healthy dietary patterns. This consensus position paper defines a suite of the most appropriate nutrition and health indicators for assessing the sustainability of diets based on the MD. Methods: In 2011, an informal International Working Group from different national and international institutions was convened. Through online and face-to-face brainstorming meetings over four years, a set of nutrition and health indicators for sustainability was identified and refined. Results: Thirteen <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> of sustainability relating were identified in five areas: •Biochemical characteristics of food (A 1. Vegetable/animal protein consumption ratios; (A 2. Average dietary energy adequacy; (A 3. Dietary energy density score; (A 4. Nutrient density of diet) : •Food Quality (A 5. Fruit and vegetable consumption/intakes; (A 6. Dietary diversity score) : •Environment (A 7. Food biodiversity composition and consumption; (A 8. Rate of Local/regional foods and seasonality; (A 9. Rate of eco-friendly food production and/or consumption) : •Lifestyle (A 10. Physical activity/Physical inactivity prevalence; (A 11. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern) •Clinical Aspects; (A 12. Diet-related morbidity/mortality statistics; (A 13. Nutritional Anthropometry. A standardized set of information was provided for each indicator: definition, methodology, background, data sources, limitations of the indicator and references. Conclusions: The selection and analysis of these indicators has been performed (where possible) with specific reference to the MD. Sustainability of food systems is an urgent priority for governments and international organisations to address the serious socioeconomic and environmental implications of short-sighted and short-term practices for agricultural land and rural communities. These proposed <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> will be a useful methodological framework for designing health, education and agricultural policies in order, not only to conserve the traditional diets of the Mediterranean area as a common cultural heritage and lifestyle, but also to enhance th...|$|E
