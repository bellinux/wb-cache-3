5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines <b>near</b> (<b>and</b> bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} August 19, a {{tropical}} cyclone was <b>near</b> <b>and</b> south of Guam. Its track curved from the west-northwest to the north, drifting at times {{west of the}} Marianas Islands. The typhoon turned to the northwest, and was nearing the Ryukyu Islands on August 27. Turning westward and later to the west-southwest, the storm moved across Taiwan moved into the South China Sea. The typhoon moved ashore southern China in Guangdong on or after August 30 {{to the west of}} Hong Kong. In the province, the typhoon and its accompanying waves killed 5,000 people. More than 20,000 homes were damaged, and around 400 boats were wrecked, estimated at US$1 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|By midday on August 15, rainbands with gusty winds began {{affecting}} the Texas coastline. As it moved ashore, the storm produced heavy rainfall <b>near</b> <b>and</b> to the or northeast of its path, reaching 11.02inches (280mm) at a station in Lockwood. The storm caused several bayous in the Houston area to reach or exceed flood levels. Across southeastern Texas, the cyclone spawned several funnel clouds, and near IAH an EF0 tornado was reported. Wind gusts from Erin were minor across the state, peaking at 35mph (55km/h) at Palacios with an unofficial report of 39mph (63km/h) at Jamaica Beach. Upon moving ashore, the storm produced a minor storm surge peaking at 3.22feet (0.98m) at Pleasure Pier, which caused minor beach erosion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} week of September, a cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States and stalled over the Atlantic Ocean. By September 8, a weak frontal wave began {{developing}} along the cold front. Late on September 9, convection increased over the broad low pressure area, and the overall system intensified beneath an upper-level low. Subsequently, the system abandoned its frontal features as its appearance became more circular. With persistent but limited convection <b>near</b> <b>and</b> {{to the west of the}} center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375mi (604km) west-southwest of Bermuda; it was considered subtropical because the upper-circulation was believed to have been cold-core. Operationally, advisories on the system were not initiated until 21hours later.|$|E

5|$|Eraserhead is a 1977 American surrealist body horror film written, produced, and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Lynch. Shot in black-and-white, Eraserhead is Lynch's first feature-length film, coming after several short works. The film was produced {{with the assistance of}} the American Film Institute (AFI) during the director's time studying there. Starring Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Jeanne Bates, Judith Anna Roberts, Laurel <b>Near,</b> <b>and</b> Jack Fisk, it tells the story of Henry Spencer (Nance), who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape. Throughout the film, Spencer experiences dreams or hallucinations, featuring his child and the Lady in the Radiator.|$|E

5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural choke point was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland.

Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, linen, and other goods to the <b>near</b> <b>and</b> far East. Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the GDP of each nation or society that {{was involved in the}} trade system.

5|$|Rainbands spawned <b>near</b> <b>and</b> {{ahead of}} cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes.

If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E

5|$|Several {{types of}} cricket songs {{are in the}} {{repertoire}} of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is <b>near</b> <b>and</b> encourages her to mate with the caller. A triumphal song is produced {{for a brief period}} after a successful mating, and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male. An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.|$|E

Many areas reported at least 2in (50mm) of rain between September26 and October1; coastal areas <b>near</b> <b>and</b> west of Acapulco received up to 6in (150mm). As river levels rose, a state of emergency was declared for eight municipalities, which was only concluded on September30. Two landslides occurred in Chilpancingo; several others occurred in Coyuca de Benitez and Sierra de Atoyac. More than 300homes were flooded with up to 6in (15cm) of water in Coyuca de Benitez. Three temporary shelters were opened in Barra de Coyuca, however, they were closed as no one moved in.|$|E

It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents.

Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come <b>near</b> <b>and</b> the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
