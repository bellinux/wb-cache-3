It features Walker singing in various locations in Melbourne including Degraves Street and Flinders Lane. Walker said to MTV's Clippin that shooting the video in public made him feel embarrassed and he found it difficult <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> during its filming.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Gandhi's {{choice of}} the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; Sardar Patel {{suggested}} a land revenue boycott instead. The Statesman, a prominent newspaper, wrote about the choice: [...] "It is difficult <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> and we imagine {{that will be the}} mood of most thinking Indians." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{directed}} and edited (along with Pile) by Tristram Shapeero and Dominic Brigstocke. Sketches were sped up or slowed down to create comic effect, often using body language to create humour. Editing {{was also used}} due {{to the amount of}} corpsing that occurred during the filming of the show. Tamsin Greig was said to corpse frequently, and episodes were written to minimise the contact between the characters of Caroline Todd and Alan Statham because Greig found it difficult <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> when acting alongside Mark Heap. The music, which plays prominently in the show, was written by Jonathan Whitehead (under the name [...] "Trellis") and won him an RTS Craft & Design Award.|$|E

500|$|Although the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] skit and {{the scenes}} {{in which it was}} {{prepared}} were all scripted, Carell and Ryan improvised several of the moments including Michael's [...] "Yay!" [...] cheer upon getting an answer right, the bow Carell and Ryan take at the end while the Buffalo branch employees are angry, and Michael's Indian accent. Carell improvised with several different accents on the set, with the producers settling on the one that sounded most like the character from the film, although he used his regular accent when answering the final question in the skit. Carell and Ryan also made up the Jaws song parody ("Dunder...Dunder...") while filming, and Carell made up the subsequent line [...] "We're circling it" [...] about their good sketch idea. The extras were told <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> or react at all to the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] sketch, but Carell and Ryan were not told of those instructions {{in order to create a}} genuine stage fright awkwardness among the two actors; Ryan in particular was thrown off guard by their lack of response.|$|E
500|$|As Charles {{was always}} trying to find {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms, the episode had a scene in which Jerry dreams he is interrogated by the FBI for his illegal cable hookup, and is killed when he tries to escape. Charles recalled the dream sequence as [...] "one of the most ambiguous scenes we did [...] " [...] and felt it was very Tarantino-like. At the end of the dream Kramer holds Jerry in his arm, stating [...] "what have you done to my little cable boy?"; this scene had to be filmed multiple times, as it was hard for Seinfeld <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> when Richards stated the line. In audio commentary he recorded for the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD set, Charles noted how he established three of the episode's four storylines in one scene, in which the characters eat and talk at Monk's Cafe. [...] "The Baby Shower" [...] also {{is one of the few}} episodes of season two in which the primary storylines of all four characters come together in the final scene. In [...] "The Busboy", which had been filmed earlier, the four storylines also intersected in the final scene, but the episode aired as the final episode of season two. Charles also felt the episode defined the Kramer character more, as it is the first episode in which Kramer speaks out against the system. In addition, the episode also establishes Elaine's interest in the Kennedys, a plot element that would return later in the season four episode [...] "The Virgin".|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga and anime have {{commented on}} Hiruma's character. Chris Beveridge from Mania.com stated that [...] "the outlandish nature of Hiruma with his guns blazing gets old very quickly" [...] and {{considered it a}} [...] "downside" [...] to the series. On the other hand, Ain't It Cool News' Scott Green said that [...] "impish Hiruma starts out as a unique star." [...] Mania.com's Jarred Pine noted that Hiruma is [...] "so completely over-the-top and out of left field that I couldn't help laughing" [...] and that his [...] "rude, crude, and completely unpredictable" [...] behavior [...] "makes his character so damn enjoyable". Pine concluded that Hiruma's personality was [...] "instantly memorable" [...] and his [...] "unpredictable nature" [...] was responsible for making the story [...] "so enjoyable". The contrast with [...] "Sena's hard effort and Hiruma's trickery and devilish nature" [...] was also praised by Pine. Writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Carlo Santos praised Hiruma's character design as [...] "imaginative" [...] with his [...] "lanky" [...] and [...] "demon-like appearance" [...] and additionally commented that [...] "despite his sheer ruthlessness, it's hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> as Hiruma enthusiastically resorts to blackmail in recruiting students for the team". Erin Finnegan of ANN also noted the [...] "demonic-looking" [...] aspect of Hiruma, saying he is [...] "like a predecessor of Ozu from The Tatami Galaxy with a love of football". ANN's Zac Bertschy called Hiruma the [...] "most fun" [...] character insofar, making note of his [...] "brash, menacing and ultimately passionate" [...] personality and that [...] "in a sense, Hiruma turns the 'kindly old coach-come-mentor who helps the hero along' clich√© on its ear". Chris Homer of The Fandom Post considered Hiruma [...] "the most memorable part of the show", saying he is [...] "everyone's favourite and most memorable character". Partly because of his [...] "sheer insanity", demonstrated by his recruiting methods, {{and partly because of}} the fact he gradually shows care and trusts for the team Homer wrote that [...] "he is an instantly memorable character" [...] and [...] "so unique in this show (and any show for that matter)".|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, Puyi visited Japan, sailing from Dalian to Yokohama on the warship Hiei Maru, {{and while}} meeting the Showa Emperor at a Tokyo {{railroad}} station, {{a moment of}} unintentional comedy occurred when Puyi attempted to take off a too tight white glove before shaking the Emperor's hand, which he had to struggle with for some time while everyone else struggled <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b> The Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Hsinking, Kenjiro Hayashide, served as Puyi's interpreter during this trip, and later wrote what Behr called a very absurd book The Epochal Journey to Japan chronicling this visit, where he managed to present every banal statement made by Puyi as profound wisdom, and claimed that he wrote {{an average of two}} poems per day on his trip to Japan, despite being busy with attending all sorts of official functions. A typical passage from the book records that Puyi was seasick while travelling to Japan, but how [...] "the Ruler's great joy at seeing Their Imperial Majesties the Emperor and Empress of Japan ... removed all thoughts of fatigue from the voyage". Hayashide had also written a booklet promoting the trip in Japan, which claimed that Puyi was a great reader who was [...] "hardly ever seen without a book in his hand", a skilled calligrapher, a talented painter, and an excellent horseman and archer, able to shoot arrows while riding, just like his Qing ancestors did. The Showa Emperor took this claim that Puyi was a hippophile too seriously and presented him with a gift of a horse for him to review the Imperial Army with; in fact, Puyi was a hippophobe who adamantly refused to get on the horse, forcing the Japanese to hurriedly bring out a carriage for the two emperors to review the troops.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the album}} did not gain much {{attention}} from the general press on its original release, the album retrospectively has been given critical acclaim and has been cited {{as one of the}} most important hardcore punk albums ever released. Rolling Stone in their retrospective review says that [...] "Black Flag lived up to it, defining L.A. hardcore punk with violent guitar and the pissed-off scream of Henry Rollins, especially on [...] "TV Party" [...] and [...] "Rise Above." [...] Punks still listen to Damaged, and parents still hate it." [...] Pitchfork in their retrospective review from 2002 says [...] "Black Flag took on the essential ferocity of men about to snap, and combined that with an acidic sense of humor and these things called 'songs', a concept that many of the wannabe punkers of the day were still trying to sort out. Damaged hit in 1981, and by 1982, four bars bearing the Black Flag name had been airbrushed across miles and miles of spiked leather. Conflicting feelings of violence, apathy, rage, and self-satire course through this one, the essential touchstone of the entire genre of West Coast hardcore, crystallizing the turmoil of the movement. Listen to 'Rise Above' and try not to be incensed, then listen to 'TV Party' and try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud. That's awesome." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a very high rating of a [...] "A-" [...] and saying [...] "...Greg Ginn is the greatest noise guitarist since Johnny Thunders, new vocalist Henry Rollins can snarl along any tortured contour they serve up, and 'Rise Above', 'Six Pack', and the uproarious 'TV Party' prove they can write songs as well as gnash fragments." [...] John Dougan of AllMusic gave it a perfect five star rating saying [...] "...Although Black Flag had been recording for three years prior to this release, the fact that Henry Rollins was now their lead singer made all the difference. His furious bellow and barely contained ferocity was the missing piece the band needed to become great. Also, guitarist/mastermind Greg Ginn wrote a slew of great songs for this record that, while suffused with the usual punk conceits (alienation, boredom, disenfranchisement), were capable of making one laugh out loud, especially the protoslacker satire 'TV Party'..." [...] and also noted [...] "...Extremely controversial when it was released, Damaged endured the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism (some reacted as though this record alone would cause the fall of America's youth) to become and remain an important document of its time." ...|$|E
