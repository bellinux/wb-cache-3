The method consists in extracting relevant subsets {{from the initial}} log {{with the aim of}} discovering frequent patterns more accurately. In a first step, the alarm types presenting the same temporal behaviour are clustered with a self organizing map. Then, log areas which are rich in alarms of each cluster are regrouped in subsets which are subsequently exhaustively searched for frequent patterns. We demonstrate the efficiency of our preprocessing method through experiments on an actual alarm log from an ATM network.

One {{of the most important}} malware are botnets that convert infected computers into agents that follow actions instructed by a command-and-control server. A botmaster can control thousands of agents. This means a significant capacity to accomplish any kind of network attack (DoS), email spam or phishing. In this paper, communication peculiarities with the command-and-control server are used to provide an identification of computers infected by a botnet. This identification is based mainly in DNS records of registered domains where command-and-control servers are hosted.

40|$|A {{real-time}} traffic {{incident detection}} {{algorithm is proposed}} and applied to the monitoring of a complex road junction {{in the city of}} Nancy in France. This algorithm has the potential to provide local monitoring of traffic sensors. Our approach is based on macroscopic traffic flow models, and more precisely on the flow-density relationship. Once this relation is extracted from real traffic data, an admissible region is defined in the flow-density space. Then, the classification properties of neural networks are used to design the monitoring network, which detects and isolates the incidents, that disturb the traffic, when the measured data are out of the admissible region. A hierarchical schema to deal with incidents in large scale networks is developed as well.

Therefore, focus will be set on errors, deliber-ate or not, from the implementation {{or the use of}} such tools, to information leakage. First, straight attacks on encryption keys are examined. They are searched in binary files, in mem-ory, or in memory files (such as hibernation files). We also show how a bad initialization on a random generator sharply reduces key entropy, and how to negate this entropy by insert-ing backdoors. Then, we put ourselves in the place of an attacker confronted to cryptography. He must first detect such algorithms are used. Solutions for this problem are presented, to analyze binary files as well as communication streams. Sometimes, an attacker can only access encrypted streams, without having necessary tools to generate such a stream, and is unable to break the encryption used.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the aims}} of sewer {{networks}} is the protection of population against floods and the reduction of pollution rejected to the receiving water during rainy events. To meet these goals, managers have to equip the sewer networks with and to set up real-time control systems. Unfortunately, a component fault (leading to intolerable behaviour of the system) or sensor fault (deteriorating the process view and disturbing the local automatism) makes the sewer <b>network</b> <b>supervision</b> delicate. In order to ensure an adequate flow management during rainy events {{it is essential to}} set up procedures capable of detecting and diagnosing these anomalies. This article introduces a real-time fault detection method, applicable to sewer networks, for the follow-up of rainy events. This method consists in comparing the sensor response with a forecast of this response. This forecast is provided by a model and more precisely by a state estimator: a Kalman filter. This Kalman filter provides not only a flow estimate but also an entity called ‘innovation’. In order to detect abnormal operations within the network, this innovation is analysed with the binary sequential probability ratio test of Wald. Moreover, by crossing available information on several nodes of the network, a diagnosis of the detected anomalies is carried out. This method provided encouraging results during the analysis of several rains, on the sewer network of Seine-Saint-Denis County, France...|$|E
40|$|The wavelength-division-multiplexed passive {{optical network}} (WDM-PON) offers many {{advantages}} such as large bandwidth per user, easy management, high network security and low insertion loss enabling long-reach and/or high split-ratio. However, with the rapid development and growing interest for deployment of WDM-PON, the PON systems are becoming increasingly vulnerable to various failures. Therefore, <b>network</b> <b>supervision</b> becomes extremely important to guarantee an appropriate level of network reliability performance. The aim of PON supervision is to provide automated test and diagnostic capability without compromising the available bandwidth for services. An essential function is to detect any kind of deterioration in the network that can cause suspended services and to remotely localize these faults {{in order to avoid}} the high cost arising from troubleshooting. In this thesis, we evaluate several existing WDM PON supervision methods, based on which two simple and cost-effective new solutions are proposed to localize fiber failures in WDM PON systems. In the first solution, a conventional optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) and a switch unit are employed, while in the second method, a novel architecture based on N×N arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) is proposed. Both methods are able to localize failures in feeder fiber and drop fibers without e. g. using expensive tunable OTDRs. A patent has been filed based on the second solution. The first proposed method is validated by simulations using VPI Transmission Maker. According to the results, this supervision method is able to give accurate measurement of many different types of failures that may happen in a fiber link. Furthermore, VPI is examined in terms of its future applicability in modeling complete PON supervision methods based on OTDR...|$|E

40|$|The use of SCADA and DMS {{systems in}} the main control center of a {{distribution}} company overlaps. A new common user interface framework for SCADA and DMS systems in ABB MicroSCADA Pro is currently in development, and it was piloted in this thesis. To {{be able to make}} a successful user interface for a combined SCADA and DMS system, it must be known how the systems are used. In this thesis, three distribution companies were visited to identify most common tasks performed in the main control center. Three most common tasks performed in the main control center of a distribution company are supervision, fault management, and maintenance outage management. The supervision task consisting of high voltage, medium voltage, and low voltage <b>network</b> <b>supervision,</b> power management and system supervision, is described in this thesis. The fault management and maintenance outage management tasks are described with as much details as possible and also the specialties caused by a major disturbance situation is covered. In addition to the most common tasks, also visualization requirements for a combined SCADA and DMS system were gathered during the visits. The requirements were gathered by studying the problems in the existing systems as well as the ideas and solutions found in the distribution companies current systems. It was found out that for a combined SCADA and DMS system, there are visualization requirements concerning events and alarms, navigation and zooming, supervision and overviews, fault management and maintenance outage management. In this thesis, four visualization prototypes to help fault management were created into the common user interface framework. The four visualizations form a basis for a new fault management dashboard. The fault management dashboard supports the new fault management model introduced in this thesis. Also visualization concepts to help operators in maintenance outage management and power management were created. This thesis concludes, that many kinds of visualizations are required for a combined SCADA and DMS system. The faults and alarms in the system should be clearly visualized, especially in a major disturbance situation. In a combined SCADA and DMS system, the operator can work more effectively, because only one user interface is required. The common user interface framework was found to have a good potential to become a successful user interface for a combined SCADA and DMS system: No major problems were found and integrating data from both systems into one user interface was found easy and efficient. Going forward, the visualizations in the fault management dashboard should be finalized and deployed into real environments. A few improvements should be implemented into the common user interface framework, and a lot of new visualizations are required to support all required features in a combined SCADA and DMS system...|$|E
40|$|Chromatic {{dispersion}} (CD) {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that light with different frequencies travel at different speeds inside fiber. It causes pulse spreading and intersymbol interference (ISI) which would severely degrade the transmission performance. By feeding a signal into a fiber loop which consists of a high-birefringence (Hi-Bi) fiber, we experimentally show that the amount of experienced dispersion can be deduced from the RF power at a specific selected frequency which is determined by the length of the Hi-Bi fiber. Experimental results show that this technique can provide high monitoring resolution and dynamic range. Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) splits an optical pulse into two orthogonally polarized pulses traveling along the fiber at different speeds, causing crosstalk and ISI. The third part of the thesis demonstrates two different PMD monitoring schemes. The first one is based on the analysis of frequency-resolved state-of-polarization (SOP) rotation, with signal spectrum broadened by self-phase modulation (SPM) effect. Experimental results show that the use of broadened signal spectrum induced by SPM not only relaxes the filter requirement and reduces the computational complexity, but also improves the estimation accuracy, and extends the monitoring range of the pulsewidth. The second one is based on the delay-tap asynchronous waveform sampling technique. By examining the statistical distribution of the measured scatter plot, unambiguous PMD measurement range up to 50 % of signal bit-period is demonstrated. The final part of the thesis focuses on the monitoring of alignment status between the pulse carver and data modulator in an optical system. We again employ the two-tap asynchronous sampling technique to perform such kind of monitoring in RZ-OOK transmission system. Experimental results show that both the misalignment direction and magnitude can be successfully determined. Besides, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the use of off-center optical filtering technique to capture the amount of spectrum broadening induced by the misalignment between the pulse-carver and the data modulator in RZ-DPSK transmission system. The same technique was also applied to monitor the synchronization between the old and the new data in synchronized phase re-modulation (SPRM) system. The tremendous increase of data traffic in the worldwide Internet has driven the rapid development of optical networks to migrate from numerous point-to-point links towards meshed, transparent optical networks with dynamically routed light paths. This increases the need for appropriate <b>network</b> <b>supervision</b> methods. In view of this, optical performance monitoring (OPM) has emerged as an indispensable element for the quality assurance of an optical network. This thesis is devoted to the proposal of several new and accurate techniques to monitor different optical impairments so as to enhance proper network management. When the optical signal is carried on fiber links with optical amplifiers, the accumulated amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise will result in erroneous detection of the received signals. The first part of the thesis presents a novel, simple, and robust in-band optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) monitoring technique using phase modulator embedded fiber loop mirror (PM-FLM). This technique measures the in-band OSNR accurately by observing the output power of a fiber loop mirror filter, where the transmittance is adjusted by an embedded phase modulator driven by a low-frequency periodic signal. The robustness against polarization mode dispersion, chromatic dispersion, bit-rate, and partially polarized noise is experimentally demonstrated. Ku, Yuen Ching. "August 2007.
