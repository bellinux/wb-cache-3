5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

25|$|Larger scaled figures (primarily 25mm and up) {{tend to be}} used in {{skirmish}} games {{where the}} single miniature represents a single man/animal/vehicle. This is because, although scales in this region provide greater detail that is easier to paint, their higher cost and larger size limits the size of battles that might be recreated. Games of this scale that are not mounted on trays (and thus <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> in block formation) tend to offer greater flexibility of movement.|$|E

25|$|Hyperion {{is unique}} among the large moons {{in that it}} is very irregularly shaped, has a fairly {{eccentric}} orbit, and is near a much larger moon, Titan. These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 orbital resonance between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The fact that its rotation is <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion's surface, in contrast to many of Saturn's other moons, which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.|$|E
25|$|The 29 car {{returned}} in 2005 at Bristol Motor Speedway {{as part of}} a promotion for Reese's Chocolate and Peanut Butter Lovers Cups. The promotion involved the 29 painted as the Chocolate Lovers car and the 21 painted as the Peanut Butter Lovers car. The plan was for Jeff Burton to drive the 29 while Kevin Harvick would drive the 21. Qualifying was rained out, so the entries were switched to assure that both cars would make the field (Harvick was a past champion and the No. 29 was <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> in). Burton drove the 21 while Harvick drove the 29. Harvick won the race in this car with Burton finishing second in the 21. Later in the season, Mayflower Transit came on to sponsor Burton after a seven-year relationship with him.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 the {{situation}} once again arose where both schools finished {{the regular season}} atop the polls. This time, {{there would be a}} matchup between Miami and Penn State and it required a different plan as to how to resolve where the game would be taking place. All of the bowl games had been set except for the one that Miami and Penn State would be playing in for the national championship. The Fiesta Bowl selection committee's only opposition came from the organizers of the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, which like the Fiesta Bowl was <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> in to taking anyone from a conference. The bidding process resulted in the game being awarded to the Arizona bowl, and this allowed the Fiesta Bowl to gain much more national prestige than it had before and eventually enabled it to replace the Cotton Bowl as one of the four major bowl games; the Fiesta Bowl became part of the Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series years later.|$|E

50|$|Soft drops {{were first}} {{implemented}} in Nintendo releases of Tetris so that pieces {{would be able}} to drop faster while <b>not</b> <b>locking</b> as to slide into gaps. The other option is hard dropping, which originated in early PC games such as Microsoft Tetris, a game developed by Dave Edson and bundled with Microsoft Entertainment Pack. With hard dropping, a piece falls and locks in one frame. Newer Tetris games feature both options. Some games have their locking roles reversed, with soft dropping making the pieces drop faster and locking down, and hard dropping making the pieces drop instantly but <b>not</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R

25|$|The band holds tryouts usually {{two weeks}} before school starts. This is {{somewhat}} variable as the band staff tries to allow for members to perform in Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis. In recent years, DCI Finals night was held on a Saturday night, while OSUMB Candidate Days (for all prospective band members who have not made the band before) would begin the following Sunday morning. Due to a tighter schedule in 2016, Candidate Days were held during DCI Finals, and full band tryouts began the following morning. Typically this is avoided however, to allow incoming freshmen to finish a drum corps tour and then learn the OSU style in the two days prior to full band tryouts. Once the band is picked and until school starts up, the band practices {{three times a day}} Monday through Friday. Once school starts, the band rehearses Monday-Friday from 4:10-6:15 PM. However, the Band Center doors are typically <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> until midnight, as many band members will do other classwork while practicing and memorizing their music for the week's show. Many shows must be learned in as little as four days, with all music and drill committed to memory.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the first}} year, {{there were more}} than 100,000 {{registered}} members who rode over , including 70,000 members {{in the first three months}} alone. On August 6, 2013, riders took 42,010 trips, the largest single-day total for any North American bike-sharing system. [...] In Citi Bike's first few months, some kiosks docked too many bikes while others did not have enough, so the city started using a fleet of box trucks to carry bikes between different kiosks every day. The kiosks also had some software problems in their early months. Problems included stations that did not accept payment information; other stations that did not work at all; kiosks where passersby could take bikes without paying because the bikes were <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> securely; and bike docks that did not work, forcing riders to travel to other stations.|$|E

500|$|Several gaming and {{technology}} sites reported an [...] "overheating bug" [...] with StarCraft II {{that in some}} cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards. The source of the problem {{is the fact that the}} frame rate is <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> on menu screens. This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image, resulting in excessive heat. Blizzard has acknowledged the problem, and posted a temporary workaround. [...] They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the videocard manufacturer for hardware-related issues. In response to the reports, Blizzard's Public Relations Manager, Bob Colayco said: [...] "There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat. When we saw this issue first reported, we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem, the cause is most likely hardware-related." [...] CrunchGear has also suggested that the problem is not with StarCraft II, but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling. They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non-framerate locked screens and provide the fix that Blizzard has offered to users. [...] Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the cooling efficiency of their systems. Blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding the issue that has since been removed. The message was: [...] "Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient. This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Due {{to being}} vivified electricity, Cole {{is unable to}} use vehicles, take up weapons, or swim. Cole easily climbs {{buildings}} and other structures and can fall a great height without taking damage. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game; once acquired the player can use experience points, awarded for specific actions, stunts and missions, to increase the power's effectiveness. The growth of these powers is affected by Cole's current Karma level. Starting in a neutral position, it ranges from Guardian to Champion to Hero on the Good side, [...] and from Thug to Outlaw to Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as stopping to help injured citizens or draining their health to restore Cole's, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma Moments, when the action pauses and the player is told, through a monologue by Cole, of two actions that can be taken, always a good and bad option. For example, one scenario the player is presented with is to either pull a valve and get a spray of tar in his face (Good), or force a civilian to do it for him (Evil). There are also a number of paired Good/Evil side missions in the game; completing one will lock out the other mission but will reward the player with a large amount of Karma towards their selected Karma goal. Completion of these missions helps gain access to unique super powers based on the Karma level. The player is <b>not</b> <b>locked</b> into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Doing so will lock out any purchased power(s) in the original chosen Karma sector. In addition to altering Cole's appearance and certain aspects of the game's story, Karma also influences the behavior of the citizens of Empire City, they will come to help Cole in battle if his Karma is Good, but will turn on Cole and throw rocks at him if he has Bad Karma.|$|E
