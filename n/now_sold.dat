5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is <b>now</b> <b>sold</b> in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more and more people have adopted it as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E
5|$|Having {{traveled}} to France {{in the early}} 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who {{was one of the}} co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for the frog cake in European confectionery. The frog cake was introduced by Balfours in 1922 after Gordon's return to Adelaide, during a time in which tearooms were still popular in the city. It soon became known as the Balfours mascot, and has traditionally only been sold in South Australia, although they are <b>now</b> <b>sold</b> in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.|$|E
5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are <b>now</b> <b>sold</b> only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} {{artist of the}} 1990s was British band Simply Red, who topped the UK Albums Chart for 19 weeks with four different albums. Stars, their fourth studio album, sold 3.29million copies in total, and was the biggest-selling album of both 1991 and 1992. Stars was the second biggest-selling album of the decade; it was outsold by Manchester band Oasis's second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, which spent 10 weeks at number one during 1995 and 1996, and sold 4.16million copies. It was the highest-certified album of the 1990s, achieving platinum certification 13 times. Following the album's success, Oasis's follow-up, Be Here <b>Now,</b> <b>sold</b> 663,000 copies {{in the first four}} days of its release, making it the fastest-selling album in UK chart history.|$|E
5|$|Be Here Now was {{released}} in the UK on 21 August 1997. The release date had been brought forward out of Ignition's fear that import copies of the album from the United States would arrive in Britain before that country's designated street date. Worrying that TV news cameras would interview queuing fans at a traditional midnight opening session, Ignition forced retailers to sign contracts pledging not to sell the record earlier than 8:00am. However, when the album did go on sale, the cameras showed up regardless, {{just in time to}} record the initially slow trade. It was not until lunch time that sales picked up. By {{the end of the first}} day of release, Be Here <b>Now</b> <b>sold</b> over 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 663,389, making it, at the time, the fastest-selling album in British history. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard charts in the United States kept off the #1 spot by Puff Daddy's No Way Out, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment.|$|E
