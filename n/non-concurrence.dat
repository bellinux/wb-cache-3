There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.|$|E

50|$|On January 7, 1868, the Senate {{passed a}} {{resolution}} (35-to-6) of <b>non-concurrence</b> with Stanton's dismissal. Grant wrote his resignation letter that same day and vacated the office, {{but he did not}} notify Johnson of this. Consequently, Stanton re-occupied the office of the Secretary of War. At a cabinet meeting the following day, Grant made stammering, unintelligible excuses for failing to pre-notify Johnson. Believing the Tenure of Office Act unconstitutional, Johnson ignored the Senate's reinstatement of Stanton until, on January 28, he offered the post to Lorenzo Thomas, a brevet major general in the Army, who first turned it down, saying {{that he would like to}} stay in office as Adjutant General until his retirement. (The President originally wanted the position for General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was an enemy of Stanton's, but Sherman turned the President down, saying he hated politics.) Johnson later convinced Thomas to help him make a test case, however, and on February 21, 1868, the President appointed Lorenzo Thomas Secretary of War and ordered the removal of Stanton from office. Thomas personally delivered the President's dismissal notice to Stanton, but the Secretary refused either to accept its legitimacy or to vacate the premises. Instead, Stanton had barricaded himself in his office and ordered Thomas arrested for violating the Tenure of Office Act.|$|E

A month later, Japan's space agency launched an experimental communications satellite designed to enable super high-speed data transmission in remote areas.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To assess {{indicators}} for anti-infective prescribing not concurrent with regional pharmacotherapeutic treatment guidelines (PTGs) on infectious diseases. Methods A retrospective explorative cohort study based on hospital-wide anti-infective prescription data of a 2 -month cross-sectional period (n = 1037). Risk rates (absolute risks: AR), risk rate ratios (relative risks: RR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) were estimated for patient, disease, drug, and prescriber variables {{considered to be}} potential indicators. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Findings <b>Non-concurrence</b> existed of non-indicated prescribing of (particular) anti-infectives (24. 3 %) and prescribing of non-first choice anti-infectives (55. 2 %). Non-concurrent durations of treatment and dosing issues accounted for 17. 2 % and 16. 2 % respectively. <b>Non-concurrence</b> was associated with empirical therapy, with certain diagnoses, such as skin and soft tissue, urinary, and osteoarthrological infections, and with prescriptions involving topical dosage forms, cephalosporins, macrolides and lincosamides, and quinolones. There was also an association with certain hospitals and with prescribing by geriatricians, surgeons, pulmonologists, and urologists and, in general, junior clinicians in training. Conclusions Other hospitals could use our epidemiological framework to identify their own {{indicators for}} non-concurrent prescribing. Our findings suggest tailor-made enforcement of PTG adherence for certain prescribers while conversely, adaptation of the PTGs will be required for some infectious diseases.

40|$|Additivity is an {{important}} assumption {{in the analysis of}} data from a randomized complete block design or other two-way classifications. Statistical tests for detecting non-additivity have been proposed by Tukey and Mandel. These tests have been developed under the usual assumptions that the errors are uncorrelated and the error variances are homogeneous. Often, however, these assumptions are obviously violated with error variances being heterogeneous or errors being correlated or both. The effect of departures from the usual assumptions on Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s test and on the tests of concurrence, <b>non-concurrence,</b> and slopes proposed by Mandel are investigated in this thesis. Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s test and the test for concurrence are similar in that both test the same hypothesis but use a different estimate for experimental error;The effect of heterogeneous error variances on tests of non-additivity is that the actual levels of significance are different from those obtained when the error variances are homogeneous. This difference can be substantial and is not always in the same direction. The degree the tests are affected does not simply depend on the value of the variances or how the variances are arranged. Other factors, such as the number of rows, row effects, and column effects, together with the variance heterogeneity affect the tests. In general, it can be concluded that the test for concurrence is affected by these factors to a much lesser degree than for slopes and <b>non-concurrence.</b> Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s test generally performs well, but can be affected greatly for some combinations of variances and column effects;Correlated errors also affect the actual levels of significance for the tests of non-additivity. The correlation structures investigated are first order serial correlation and first order autoregressive. These were chosen to represent how repeated measures in time might affect tests of non-additivity. Correlated errors can affect the actual levels of significance substantially. The departure from the desired levels of significance can be in either direction depending on the column effects, and the magnitude and sign of the correlation parameter. It was shown that the direction of the departure can change when different column effects are used with the same correlation structure. In general, the tests for slopes and <b>non-concurrence</b> are affected much more than the test of concurrence. Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s test performs well, but overall is affected more than the test of concurrence...|$|E

An {{attempt was made to}} determine in what cases and due to what reasons Slavic loanwords integrated into a certain type of declension system. It also discusses the problem of gender nonconformity (Slavic languages have three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter, while the Lithuanian language has two). For example, the research of Slavisms in Daukša’s Postilla indicated that if in Slavic languages the stem was soft then a Slavism would not integrate into o, a, u stems in the Lithuanian language. The present research shows {{that it is important to}} pay attention not to the added and rejected endings (cf.

TDW learns diagnostic rules from training sets of images, using a symbolic induction algorithm developed specifically for this applica-tion. TDW uses machine vision to identify image features of diagnostic significance (findings), which are described to the physician in a write-up. The physician can perform automated diagnosis by applying a rule set to the findings, selected from TDW’s catalog of learned rules. The physician can also view imagery, record his(her) own findings, and enter a diagnosis. TDW informs the physician of its concurrence or <b>non-concurrence</b> with the physician’s diagnosis.

40|$|The {{new book}} by Jonas Pontusson joins two themes which play a {{prominent}} role in recent social sciences debates: first, the so-called “big trade-off ” originally described by Arthur Okun in the early 1970 s manifests the <b>non-concurrence</b> of full employment and income equality in capitalist market economies (see Okun 1975). Growing income ine-quality as a worldwide phenomenon and a marked variety of labor market and unemploy-ment performances since the early 1980 s revitalized the belief that an appropriate labor market functioning requires a degree of wage and income dispersion sufficient to match productivity differences between receding industrial and growing service sector employ-ment. Second, since the publication of Andrew Shonfield’s Modern Capitalism (Shonfield 1965), political scientists and political economists have been aware that the institutional features of market economies crucially influence their economic performance and, more-over, this institutional set-up varies considerably across nations. Politically with the down-fall of the “iron curtain ” in Europe in the late 1980 s and economically with the intensification of world-wide economic integration known as “globalization ” at around the same time, different institutional set-ups – “models ” or “economic systems ” – appear t...|$|E
40|$|Aims This {{research}} examines current hospital drug formularies (HDFs) of all Dutch general hospitals. It {{assesses the}} extent to which they recommend the same drugs, the breadth of their coverage in terms of therapeutic areas, drug groups incorporated and individuals drugs included, and their extent of conservatism by considering the year of introduction of the drugs included within groups. Furthermore, it considers {{the extent to}} which their recommendations concur and comply with those of national pharmacotherapeutic guidelines and the WHO Essential Drugs List (EDL). Methods Seventy-eight (81 %) out of all 96 current Dutch HDFs were received of which 62 were suitable for study. Differences between HDFs and eventual associations with hospital characteristics were researched by statistical testing and case-control studies. To evaluate HDFs' concurrence with national guidelines and compliance with the WHO EDL, nine drug groups were studied in detail: benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin-II inhibitors, NSAIDs, H- 2 -receptor antagonists, 5 HT(3) -antagonists, and H+-pump inhibitors. Concurrence and compliance with national guidelines and the WHO EDL was defined as inclusion of recommended drugs. <b>Non-concurrence</b> was defined as inclusion of nonrecommended drugs. Results The total number of indications addressed and drug groups incorporated within HDFs varied from 28 to 72 (median 56) and from 30 to 123 (median 97), respectively. The total number of individual drug entities (pharmacological substances) included ranged from 239 to 658 (median 430) and the total number of drug products, including all different dosage forms, from 412 to 1121 (median 655). Within drug groups, drug entities first marketed were most frequently included. Teaching hospitals were most likely to include recently marketed drugs. Depending on the drug group, HDFs' concurrence and compliance with national guidelines and the WHO EDL ranged from 35 % to 100 %. Conclusions Findings indicate that Dutch HDFs are rather uniform in the indications addressed and the drug groups incorporated. However, the number of individual drug entities and drug products included within groups varies considerably. Furthermore, Dutch HDFs are considered rather conservative, as older drugs are favoured over more recent drugs. Generally, with some drug exceptions, Dutch HDFs concur and comply with recommendations in national pharmacotherapeutic guidelines and with the WHO EDL over 90 %...|$|E
40|$|In a world {{characterized}} by a continuous growth of the population, the energy sources management becomes the most important challenge. In order to guarantee the sustainable development using the different sources in a smart way first of all {{it is necessary to}} have a large variety in the energy mix. Renewable energy sources play a fundamental role in this challenge and they find the optimal exploitation in the distributed power generation organized through smart grids. One of the bigger problems of the renewables it is the <b>non-concurrence</b> in time between energy production and energy loads. The solution of this problem is another great challenge: the development and the design of efficient energy storage. Depending on the area of interest and on the particular power plant it will be critical to make a convenient and suitable choice of the storage type: thermal, electrical, chemical, mechanical. The technology that I am developing with my research group is a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) which exploits the gyroscopic effects of a flywheel in order to convert the mechanical energy of the sea waves into electrical energy. This device already presents a mechanical storage consisting in the flywheel but the real challenge to deal with is on the electrical part of the energy conversion. Being the energy source (sea waves) strongly irregular and {{characterized by}} high power peaks, {{in order to have a}} feasible grid connection it is necessary to have a smoother electrical power profile. A storage capacity can absolutely help in this problem. For this purpose the most suitable technology has not been already identified. To study the different opportunities and to gain a whole comprehension of the advantages and of the disadvantages for each one is essential in order to make the right choice for the technology that I'm dealing with. On the other hand it will be very useful to understand which kind of storage is the most suitable for each kind of renewable energy system. Furthermore to have the chance to apply the storage concept to a real innovative application it would be very interesting to highlight all the properties required by a good energy storage for smart grids developmen...|$|E
