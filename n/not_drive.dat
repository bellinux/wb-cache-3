5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could <b>not</b> <b>drive</b> and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E

5000|$|Karen Carson, 49 and {{licensed}} for 28 years, from Port Perry, Ontario, {{was once}} confident {{as a driver}} but is now too terrified to drive. When she does drive with her husband, it leads to fighting in the car. As a result, she has <b>not</b> <b>driven</b> at all for over a year, and has <b>not</b> <b>driven</b> on a highway for longer. She is nominated by husband Allan, a police officer. She drives a black Subaru Forester.|$|R

The union may, in fact, have made a deal of some sort with Buchalter, although no evidence has ever surfaced, despite intensive efforts of political opponents of the union, such as Thomas Dewey and Westbrook Pegler, to find it.

25|$|Unlicensed taxicabs {{are found}} among the Amish of rural Pennsylvania. Old Order Amish do <b>not</b> <b>drive,</b> but will hire a van or taxicab for trips which they cannot use their {{traditional}} horse and buggy transportation. According to an April 2011 {{study conducted by the}} Chicago Dispatcher, Pennsylvania taxis have relatively low standard fares, charging an estimated $13.30 for a distance of five miles with five minutes wait time. Philadelphia's fares, however, are slightly higher, charging an estimated $14.57 with the same qualifications.|$|E
25|$|In Wisconsin, {{the legal}} {{drinking}} age is 21, except when {{accompanied by a}} parent, guardian, or spouse who is at least 21 years old. Age requirements are waived for possessing alcohol when employed by a brewer, brewpub, beer and/or liquor wholesaler, or producer of alcohol fuel. The minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21, with no exceptions. The Absolute Sobriety law states that any person not of legal drinking age (currently 21 years of age) may <b>not</b> <b>drive</b> after consuming alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not {{necessarily}} {{play an important role in}} structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967). Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966). The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top-down control does <b>not</b> <b>drive</b> the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The Campaign for New York's Future {{supported}} {{congestion pricing}} throughout the political discussion. They {{argued that the}} plan would reduce road congestion, shorten commutes, reduce air pollution, and raise funds for long-term mass transit upgrades. The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, {{a member of the}} Campaign for New York's Future, released an analysis of Census data showing that the vast majority (approximately 93–99%) of workers in the MTA service area, and in individual legislative districts, did <b>not</b> <b>drive</b> to work in Manhattan. TSTC stated that the data showed that congestion pricing was progressive policy.|$|E
25|$|Rumors {{spread that}} Yoong {{was to be}} {{replaced}} by either Alonso, who was Renault's test driver, or Bryan Herta and Justin Wilson. Minardi eventually settled for Anthony Davidson to compete in the Hungarian and Belgium Grand Prix to allow Yoong for preparation for the final three rounds of the season. During this period, Yoong underwent a program in testing. Minardi later announced that Yoong would <b>not</b> <b>drive</b> for the team in 2003 but did not rule out any further involvement. Yoong was also in talks to partner Olivier Panis at Toyota.|$|E

25|$|Obtaining {{a driving}} licence as of 2010 {{requires}} having held a learners permit for 6 months and completing a combined practical and theory driving test, which covers driving, road safety and a minor amount of mechanical {{knowledge of a}} car. Obtaining a learners permit to begin with requires passing a computerised theory test. Those on learner permits for most categories of licence must <b>not</b> <b>drive</b> unaccompanied. No learner permit holders are allowed to drive on motorways and all must display red L-plates at all times, either on their vehicle or on a tabard if a motorcyclist.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June 1969, {{eight of}} the Ramblers were entered into the passenger-car {{category}} and the two 4WD versions were in the Experimental class. Garner did <b>not</b> <b>drive</b> in the race because of a film commitment in Spain. Seven of the Ramblers finished the grueling race, taking three {{of the top five}} places in the passenger-car class. One of the four-wheel-drive cars came in fourth in its class. The AIR team included a car with Bob Bondurant and Tony Murphy that took first place. For one of the winning Rambler drivers, this was his first ever race and the experience launched the career of Walker Evans.|$|E
