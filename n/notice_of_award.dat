NOAA evaluated and awarded the Northern Gulf Institute Cooperative Institute to the team led by Mississippi State University on October 1, 2006. The award is part of the Cooperative Institute Program furthering regional and national interests in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. The institute is consistent with and expands upon the Memorandum of Agreement between MSU and NOAA, the NOAA <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>award</b> to MSU of October 1, 2006, and the NOAA Cooperative Institute Interim Handbook. NGI’s approach to Northern Gulf Regional issues and opportunities is closely aligned with NOAA’s strategic and research priorities. The NGI is also guided in its mission by a number of sources, the White House’s Ocean Action Plan and the 2004 coordinated and comprehensive report of the congressional United States Commission on Ocean Policy, the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, and others. The result is an approach that is science driven, regionally focused, and coordinated with other Gulf of Mexico Basin activities.|$|E
