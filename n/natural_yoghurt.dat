40|$|This study compares three {{widely used}} methods for product {{optimisation}} or development: the just about right (JAR) method, the conventional method and a variant thereof. Three independent samples of respondents evaluated five variations of <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt</b> {{according to one}} of the three methods. Theoretically, JAR and the variant method differ in how they approach attribute deviations from ideal (directly versus indirectly). The fundamental difference between the conventional and the variant method are the ideal points (calculated versus measured directly). Overall, we found that the methods yield similar orders of ideal points despite their methodological dissimilarities. However, in terms of suggested directions for product improvement, substantial differences exist which suggests that statistical criteria are an insufficient basis for these decisions which needs to be complemented by managerial judgment {{on the size of the}} deviatio...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the content of major {{minerals}} (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron and zinc) in the nature yoghurt (without sugars) and three yoghurts added with date powders. The latter’s were from three dry date varieties (Mech-Degla, Degla-Beida and Frezza). The elements determination was carried out using atomic absorption spectrometry after mineralization processing. Total mineral content showed a great difference between the yoghurt nature and yoghurts enriched by date powder fruits. In the yoghurts added with date powder, following results were found (in mg/Kg) : calcium (2213. 31 - 2938. 67), sodium (783. 37 - 959. 36), potassium (725. 68 - 771. 77), magnesium (169. 54 - 267. 85), iron (9. 6 - 11. 52), zinc (1. 29 - 7. 93). Concerning the <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt</b> the values obtained were (in mg/Kg) : calcium (1950. 41), Sodium (684. 72), potassium (540. 58), magnesium (132. 16), iron (5. 26), zinc (0. 35).

40|$|The {{development}} of microstructure in <b>natural</b> set-style nonfat <b>yoghurt</b> was stud i ed by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition to thin-sectioning and conventional SEM described in the literature, this review illustrates gelation of milk with micrographs obtai ned by rotary shadowing of casein micelles and their clusters. The existence of void spaces occupied by lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt was con finned by cold-stage SEM of uncoa ted specimens. The microstructure of yoghurt {{is affected by the}} preheat treatment of milk, bacterial starter cultures, total solids content, and the presence of thickening agents. The microstructure was found to be related to firnmess and susceptibility to syneresis.

40|$|The Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) {{method was}} {{originally}} developed to extract volatile and semivolatile compounds from wastewater samples but {{has since been}} applied to flavour compounds in foods and beverages. Research using the HS-SPME in related areas such as cheese and skim milk powder {{has been carried out}} but, to date, no work has been done on yoghurt flavours. The main objective {{of this study was to}} devise a methodology for the Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) technique to investigate and quantify six flavour analytes in <b>natural,</b> set <b>yoghurts</b> made from recombined milk. The relevant literature was reviewed and from it, a research proposal for this work on yoghurts was drawn. The first step in analysing and quantifying the yoghurt volatiles was to set up a working methodology for the HS-SPME method. The 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre was chosen along with 20 minutes being the optimum fibre adsorption time. General equipment, materials and methods used throughout this thesis are also detailed. The external standard (ES) method was used to calibrate the GC and quantify the analyte concentrations in this study. The internal standard (IS) method was not used as a quantitative tool in this study. Once the HS-SPME methodology had been set up for the analysis of yoghurts, the classical Static Headspace (SH) method was compared with the HS-SPME method for extraction efficiency. The results suggested that the two methods were complementary in that the SH method extracted the more volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, acetone and 2 -butanone) whereas, the HS-SPME method extracted the semi- to non-volatile compounds (ethanol, diacetyl and acetoin) more readily. However, the HS-SPME was found to be the more sensitive and effective method of the two techniques tested. The next step in the thesis was to investigate the presence of the six analytes in milk and cultured yoghurt. The effects of the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation on the volatile concentrations were also examined. The results suggested that the six analytes were inherently present in milks but at low concentrations. No conclusive effects were found for the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation. However, it was evident that fermentation of the milks using bacterial starter cultures resulted in a large increase in some of the volatiles being investigated. Following this, the effects of fat levels, storage time and storage temperature on the six volatiles in yoghurts were examined. The results indicated that significant fat level effects were only seen for diacetyl and acetoin, while temperature effects were only observed for ethanol. In both trials, only general trends for the analytes concentrations were drawn because the data varied from day to day. The results suggested that most of the compounds decreased with time except for diacetyl, which seemed to increase. The final part of this study looked at applying the devised HS-SPME methodology to a series of commercial yoghurts as a preliminary trial, with a view to investigating a potential application for the HS-SPME method. Fourteen commercial yoghurts were analysed and the six analytes quantified. The data obtained was analysed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which divided the yoghurts into groups based on their analyte concentrations. From these groupings, eight yoghurts were selected and fresh samples were analysed using HS-SPME and PCA. This was carried out parallel with an untrained consumer panel, which had to distinguish differences between the yoghurts in a series of triangle tests by smelling the headspace on opening the yoghurt containers. The conclusions drawn were that, unlike the HS-SPME method with PCA, the average consumer could not differentiate the yoghurts based on smell alone. PCA also showed that the HS-SPME results obtained were fairly reproducible. In conclusion, the HS-SPME method was shown to be a useful analytical technique, which can be used to analyse and quantify flavour compounds in <b>natural,</b> set <b>yoghurts.</b> This area of investigation has a lot of scope, with the results from this study providing a basis or starting point for further investigations in this area. Future studies may lead to potential applications for the HS-SPME method, one of which may be quality control where correlation of sensory data with HS-SPME analytical data is required...|$|R

Part of this work was to analyse acidity and viscozity in selected kinds of natural yoghurts purchased in the market network of the Czech Republic (CR). The literature search mentions basic characteristic of yoghurts and their classification, acidity and rheological properities of yoghurts including the factors, which affect them and sensory analysis. In the experimental {{part of the study}} the acidity value, total solids and viscosity measurements were detected by physico-chemical analyses of samples of natural yoghurts. At samples of yoghurts with different content of skimmed milk powder the sensory evaluation was also subjected and the graphs of sensory profile were compiled.

40|$|Vaginal {{symptoms}} {{caused by}} thrush are extremely common. However, {{there have been}} few qualitative studies reporting women's perceptions and self-management of this condition. This paper reports the results of 30 telephone interviews that were conducted with women who had previously presented at community pharmacies with a self-diagnosis of vaginal thrush. Some women reported that thrush made them feel miserable, unable to work, embarrassed, or even stigmatized. About half of the women knew that they could take simple measures to prevent the symptoms of thrush, but others wanted more information. Most women reported that over-the-counter medicines had cured their symptoms, but some stressed that alternative remedies such as <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt</b> were also beneficial. Since it appears that thrush may {{have a major impact on}} women's lives, it should be taken seriously by health care professionals. Women need reassurance that thrush is a common condition, and that it is not generally regarded as sexually transmitted. Some researchers have argued that women suffering from chronic thrush may benefit from the development of psychological treatment initiatives. However, it is also important to ensure that women know how to prevent thrush, and to inform women about the range of effective remedies that now exist for this condition...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{selected}} individual determinants of dietary choices, important for etiology and prevention of degenerative cardiovascular disorders, in a group of menopausal women diagnosed with arterial hypertension. Material and methods: The study included a group of 160 women from the Małopolska region, aged between 45 and 60 years and diagnosed with arterial hypertension. A questionnaire assessing the frequency of food product consumption was used, along with standardized psychological tests (GSES, LOT-R, and SWLS). Spearman’s coefficients of rank correlation and the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: We revealed that higher levels of self-efficacy were associated with more frequent consumption of whole grains, oatmeal, raw vegetables, fruit, semi-skimmed milk, <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> marine fish, legume seeds, soy products, nuts, plant oils, and fruit and vegetable juices, as well as with less frequent consumption of whole milk, high-fat cottage cheese, and sweetened carbonated beverages and alcoholic beverages. The levels of optimism and satisfaction with life correlated positively with the consumption frequency of brown rice, whole grains, oatmeal, fruit, marine fish, legumes, soy products, nuts, butter, and fruit juices, and were inversely correlated with the consumption of white bread, high-fat cottage cheese, pork meat and sausages, and sweets and pastries. Conclusions : Postmenopausal women with arterial hypertension who were characterized by lower levels of self-efficacy, optimism, and satisfaction with life made less rational dietary choices which could negatively affect the efficacy of the secondary prevention of cardiovascular degenerative disorders...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, yoghurt is {{produced}} in a hydrated form and, thus, possesses a limited shelf-life even when refrigerated. Consumption {{within a short time}} of production is advisable, particularly if advantage is to be taken of the putative benefits associated with the ingestion of live yoghurt cultures. The production of an instant yoghurt powder would, thus, provide benefits of shelf-life extension and convenience of preparation and storage. However, the drying of such products is difficult due to low pH, which causes stickiness in drier chambers and makes powder recovery difficult. Furthermore, key flavour components formed by fermentation such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl which contribute to the unique flavour of <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt</b> are sensitive to heat and easily lost during spray-drying. Hence, a major challenge of this project was to investigate the processing technologies and conditions necessary for the minimisation of flavour losses during the spray-drying of acidified/fermented milk bases, to monitor the effects on drier performance such as powder adhesion to drier walls, and to develop functional forms of the spray-dried ingredients. The main aims of the project were to: - improve yoghurt powder spray-drying efficiency through optimisation of concentrate solids, - investigate the effect of spray-drying conditions on flavour losses of sensitive products such as dehydrated yoghurt and fermented creams,- apply technological approaches for the reduction of flavour losses: a) ingredient formulation, b) modification of fermentation conditions, - investigate the production of agglomerated forms of spray-dried yoghurt powders, - study factors affecting the physical properties such as rheological characteristics and powder bulk density, and - adapt technology to ensure greater viability of culture cell numbers {{at the end of the}} drying process.

40|$|Natural {{is a funny}} word, isn’t it? What {{a recipe}} book will call plain yoghurt will be called <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt</b> on the packaging; the brand’s {{marketing}} people will have seen to that. Some years ago OUP put out an underrated coursebook series called Natural English, which begs the question: was everything else unnatural English? What does natural mean in a title called Natural Business English? Does it mean authentic, as the subtitle – Authentic language for business today – suggests? Seemingly not, {{at least not in}} the sense of the texts it contains being drawn from the world outside ELT (or BELT – Business English Language Teaching). Indeed, there are few texts, since most of the language is delivered at the sentence level, and they are clearly written to provide a nesting place for the new lexis, not that there is anything wrong with specifically written texts. Would anyone complain about footwear being specifically designed for skiing, football, trekking, snorkelling or dancing? Natural here seems not to denote much; what this really is is a 120 -page book of lexical input for 20 sectors in the world on Business English. And it’s quite impressive. The author promises and delivers some 800 words, collocations and multi-word units that occur in the professional domain. They’re organised into 20 four-page units, with 10 or 11 steps or exercises, three of which are linked with the included audio CD. After every four units there is a two-page Review spread that is set out rather like a test, which of course you mark yourself, as the Answer Key is at the back of the book, along with the Audio Scripts and a seven-page Glossary that gives you some grammatical information but no phonological guidance or unit references. It still comes across as being very user-friendly. But who is the user? While it’s aimed primarily at the self-study market, it could be used in small doses in class. No student–student interaction is envisaged, though there are small hints for any lingering teacher at the bottom of every second page, suggesting a research or homework task. Level? They say B 2 /C 1, and certainly any BEC candidates who sprinkled their output with this lexis would favourably impress examiner...|$|E

Thesis (PhD Food Sc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: One of the curious facts about the food industry {{is that many of}} the processes in use today were being practised, in some form or other, by the Roman legions as they marched across Europe and beyond. Certainly they were familiar with the basic techniques of fermentation, and much current research into fermented foods is concerned with understanding the fundamental nature of these traditional processes, and how the individual stages in a particular fermentation can be better controlled. Recent developments in the dairy industry have tended to reflect this pattern and, over the years, my research group has done much to support the expanding markets for yoghurt and similar fermented milks. Our evaluation of the polysaccharide-producing characteristics of starter cultures, for example, encouraged yoghurt manufacturers to match physical properties to the perceived demands of consumers, and most culture suppliers followed this lead by labelling their products with precise designations as to their potential for imparting viscosity to a retail item. Similarly, my group was the first to record the unique physical properties of the concentrated yoghurt, labneh, C 230 g 1 - 1 total solids) that had been made for hundreds of years by draining whey from <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt</b> hanging in a cloth or animal-skin bag. This detailed analysis of the product facilitated the application of ultra-filtration to <b>natural</b> <b>yoghurt</b> to generate a product with a quality that matched traditionallabneh and, today, factories in the Middle East, Greece and elsewhere are using modern membrane-filtration plants to satisfy a growing market demand. Our success in publicising the attractive properties of concentrated yoghurt encouraged me to devote time to yet another 'historical' concept, namely the apparent 'health benefits' derived by small communities in Eastern Europe from consuming kefir and koumiss. In the West, the flavour and texture of these latter products have never been accepted, but employing similar cultures to produce 'health-promoting' bio-yoghurts opened an entirely new avenue for research. As clinical evidence in support of the prophylactic and therapeutic properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a species of Bifidobacterium became available, so it became apparent that the therapeutic advantage that accompanies the regular ingestion of 'bio-yoghurts' depended on the survival of these microfloras over the stipulated shelf-lives of the retail vehicles. However, no laboratory medium was immediately available for the simultaneous enumeration of Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium along with the yoghurt cultures, i. e. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii sub-sp. bulgaricus. Designing such a medium became a priority for one of my students, and, even today, the procedures that he derived are being used by consumer groups that monitor the performance of the major dairy companies in England. If the improved quality of yoghurts and 'bio-yoghurts' had a major impact on consumer perceptions of fermented milks, the food sector in England gradually became aware of an even more dramatic change in consumer attitudes. Thus twenty years ago, cheese meant 'Cheddar' but, following a 'deluge' of television publicity about the attractions of 'exotic' catering, housewives began demanding mozzarella and mascarpone for lavish desserts, Feta to sprinkle over salads and Halloumi to grill or fry. In turn, exporting countries like Italy, Greece and Cyprus came under intense pressure to increase supplies of top quality products. Local manufacturers soon realised, however, that there was little information available concerning the scientific basis to the procedures employed to make some of these traditional cheeses, and my research group was selected by Funding Agencies in Greece and Cyprus to act as a focus for a series of studies of Feta and Halloumi cheese. The need to eliminate pathogens from the storage brines of Feta cheese without killing the yeasts and bacteria associated with maturation became an important consideration for exporters, and one of my students exploited a novel procedure employing furocoumarins and long-wave ultra-violet light to achieve the desired selective inactivation. At present, the economics of commercial application are somewhat dubious but, as soon as cheap, synthetic, non-toxic furocoumarins become more readily available, the system may well merit re-evaluation. We did confirm, however, that the metabolic activities of the yeasts and bacteria typically isolated from storage brines are essential for flavour development in Feta cheese, and that similar microfloras are instrumental in the development of the important charactistics of traditional Halloumi cheese. In particular, a new species of lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus cypricasei, was isolated from samples of the traditional ovine cheese, but whether or not the species has a unique role(s) in the maturation process remains an open question. Clearly there is still much to learn but, if the activities of my reseach group have added just a little to the scientific background essential for future studies of cheese and fermented milks, then their completion will have been worthwhile. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Een van die merkwaardigste feite omtrent die voedselindustrie is dat baie van die prosesse wat vandag gebruik word, in een of ander vorm deur die Romeinse magte gebruik is toe hulle deur Europa marsjeer het. Basiese fermentasie tegnieke was aan hulle bekend, en heelwat huidige navorsing oor gefermenteerde voedsel is gemik daarop om die fundamentele natuur van hierdie tradisionele prosesse te verstaan en hoe die individuele stappe in 'n spesifieke fermentasie beter beheer kan word. Onlangse ontwikkelinge in die suiwelindustrie reflekteer hierdie patroon, en my navorsingsgroep het oor die jare heelwat gedoen om die groeiende markte vir joghurt en soortgelyke gefermenteerde melk te ondersteun. Ons evaluasie van die polisakkariedproduserende eienskappe van suursels het byvoorbeeld joghurtvervaardigers gehelp om fisieke eienskappe daar te stel wat verbruikers tevrede sal stel. Meeste verskaffers van kulture het hierdie voorbeeld gevolg deur hul produkte so te etiketteer dat duidelik gewys word watter potensiaal dit het om viskositeit aan die finale produk te verleen. Verder was my groep die eerste om die unieke fisiese eienskappe van die gekonsentreerde joghurt, labneh (230 g 1 - 1 totale vastestowwe) te bepaal, wat vir honderde jare gemaak is deur die wei van natuurlike joghurt te dreineer deur dit in "n materiaal- of diervelsak te hang. "n Gedetailleerde analise van hierdie tradisionele produk het bygedra tot die gebruik van ultrafiltrasie op natuurlike joghurt om "n produk te gee met dieselfde kwaliteit as tradisionele labneh. Vandag gebruik fabrieke in die Midde Ooste, Griekeland en elders moderne membraan-filtrasie aanlegte om in die groeiende vraag na die produk te voorsien. Ons sukses met die bekendmaking van die aantreklike eienskappe van gekonsentreerde joghurt het my aangespoor om tyd te spandeer aan nog 'n sogenaamde "historiese" konsep, naamlik die skynbare gesondheidsvoordele van klein gemeenskappe in Oos-Europa wat kefir en koumiss verbruik. In die Weste is die smaak en tekstuur van hierdie produkte nooit werklik aanvaar nie, maar om soortgelyke kulture te gebruik om "gesondheidsbevorderende" bio-joghurt te produseer, het 'n hele nuwe navorsingsveld daargestel. Soos kliniese bewyse van die terapeutiese en voorkomende voordele van Lactobacillus acidophilus en 'n spesie van Bifidobacterium bekend gemaak is, het dit duidelik geword dat die terapeutiese voordele wat saamgaan met die gereelde inname van "bio-joghurts", afhang van die oorlewing van hierdie mikroflora oor die gestipuleerde rakleeftyd van die kommersiële produkte. Geen laboratorium medium was egter onmiddellik beskikbaar vir die gelyktydige telling van Lb. actdophilus en Bifldobacterium tesame met die joghurt kulture Streptococcus thermophilus en Lb. delbrueckii sub-sp. bulgaricus. Die ontwikkeling van so 'n medium het een van my studente se prioriteit geword, en selfs vandag word die prosedures wat deur hom ontwikkel is, gebruik deur verbruikersgroepe wat die optrede van groot suiwelmaatskappye in Engeland monitor. lndien die verbeterde kwaliteit van joghurts en bio-joghurts 'n groot impak gehad het op verbruikers se persepsie van gefermenteerde melk oor Wes-Europa heen, het die voedselsektor in Engeland bewus geraak van selfs 'n meer dramatiese verandering in verbruikers se houding. Twintig jaar terug het kaas "Cheddar" beteken, maar na 'n stortvloed televisie advertensies oor die aanloklikheid van eksotiese geregte, het daar by huisvroue 'n vraag ontstaan na Mozzarella en Mascarpone vir nageregte, Feta oor slaai en Halloumi om te bak of te braai. Italië, Griekeland en Siprus wat hierdie produkte uitgevoer het, het onder kwaai druk gekom om groter hoeveelhede, top-kwaliteit produkte te lewer. Plaaslike vervaardigers het gou agtergekom dat min inligting beskikbaar was oor die wetenskaplike basis van die prosedures wat gebruik word om hierdie tradisionele kase te maak en my navorsingsgroep is deur befondsingsagentskappe in Griekeland en Siprus genader om studies te doen oor sekere aspekte van die vervaardiging van Feta en Halloumi kaas. Dit het vir beide in- en uitvoerders belangrik geword om die patogene te elimineer uit die soutoplossing waarin Fetakaas gestoor word, sonder om die giste en bakterieë wat rypwording aanhelp, te dood. Een van my studente het 'n innoverende prosedure ontwikkel wat furocoumarins en lang-golf-ultra-violet lig gebruik om selektiewe inaktivering te kry. Op die oomblik is daar effense onsekerheid oor die ekonomiese implikasies van die kommersiële toepassing, maar sodra goedkoop, sintetiese, nie-toksiese furocoumarins geredelik beskikbaar word, moet die sisteem weer geëvalueer word. Ons het egter bevestig dat die metaboliese aktiwiteite van die giste en bakterieë in die stooroplossing noodsaaklik is vir geurontwikkeling in Feta kaas en dat soortgelyke mikrofloras instrumenteel is in die ontwikkeling van die belangrike karaktereienskappe van tradisionele Halloumi kaas. 'n Unieke melksuurbakterium, Lactobacillus cypricasei, is uit monsters tradisionele skaap Halloumi geïsoleer, maar of hierdie spesie 'n unieke rol speel in die verouderingsproses is nog 'n ope vraag. Duidelik is daar nog baie om te leer, maar indien my navorsingsgroep se aktiwiteite slegs 'n klein bydrae gemaak het tot die wetenskaplike agtergrond wat essensieel is vir toekomstige navorsing, was die voltooiing daarvan die moeite werd...|$|E
