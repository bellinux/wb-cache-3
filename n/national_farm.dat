5|$|A {{vote was}} held on 3 May 1965 in which the {{committee}} voted to strike against Coachella Valley grape growers. Although the strikers weren't able to negotiate {{a contract with the}} growers, they did succeed in winning higher wages. Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against grape growers in Delano, California, where the grape season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's <b>National</b> <b>Farm</b> Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E

25|$|In 1962 Macpherson {{first became}} {{involved}} in land use planning after the <b>national</b> <b>farm</b> press began publishing articles on the topic. Around the country residential housing was beginning to encroach upon established farm land, driving up land values and making agricultural production uneconomic. In California an alternative had been conceived {{in the form of}} special farm zones, which would protect farmers from this escalating problem. Macpherson could foresee a similar situation developing in his own area and was interested by the idea, which he was able to promote through his chairmanship of an advisory committee to the Oregon State University Extension Service.|$|E
25|$|In August 1966, the <b>National</b> <b>Farm</b> Workers Association (NFWA) and Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), two unrecognized and {{relatively}} minor labor unions claiming organizing jurisdiction over farm workers in California, merged {{to form the}} United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (the predecessor organization to the United Farm Workers). Adopting the philosophy of pacifism {{in the face of}} often violent reaction to its organizing efforts and engaging in strikes, hunger strikes, boycotts and secondary boycotts (including the successful Delano grape strike), marches, rallies and cutting-edge public relations campaigns, the United Farm Workers (UFW) began organizing large numbers of agricultural laborers into unions. In some cases, the UFW even won recognition and negotiated contracts.|$|E
25|$|The United Farm Workers of America , or more {{commonly}} just United Farm Workers (UFW), is a labor union for farmworkers in the United States. It originated from {{the merger of}} two workers' rights organizations, the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) led by organizer Larry Itliong, and the <b>National</b> <b>Farm</b> Workers Association (NFWA) led by César Chávez and Dolores Huerta. They became allied and transformed from workers' rights organizations into a union {{as a result of}} a series of strikes in 1965, when the mostly Filipino farmworkers of the AWOC in Delano, California initiated a grape strike, and the NFWA went on strike in support. As a result of the commonality in goals and methods, the NFWA and the AWOC formed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee on August 22, 1966.|$|E

25|$|Feeling {{abused by}} the railroads and the grain elevators, militant farm {{organizations}} appeared, notably the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), formed in 1909. Guided by {{the ideas of}} William Irvine and later by Henry Wise Wood, the UFA was intended at first to represent economic interests rather than to act as another political party. But farmers' dissatisfaction with Liberal provincial policies and Conservative federal policies, combined with falling wheat prices and a railroad scandal, drove the farmers to favour direct politics and the election of three Farmer-oriented MLAs and a MP in the 1917 to 1921 period {{opened the door to}} a general contesting for power in 1921. There was an overwhelming UFA landslide in the provincial legislature in 1921. Alberta also gave strong support to UFA and Labour candidates in the 1921 federal election. The elected MPs worked with the Progressive Party of Canada, a <b>national</b> <b>farm</b> organization. Together they held the balance of power for the minority Liberal and Conservative governments in power for much of the 1920s.|$|E
500|$|The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and <b>National</b> <b>Farm</b> Workers Association merged to {{form the}} United Farm Workers; Itliong was skeptical of the merger, as he {{believed}} that Mexicans would become dominant over the Filipinos when the organizations merged, and that improving work conditions would {{come at the expense}} of Filipino farmworkers, but Itliong kept those feelings to himself at the time. In 1966, the California Rural Legal Assistance was founded as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, with Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and Itliong sitting on the founding board. Itliong served as assistant director of the United Farm Workers under Cesar Chavez, and in 1970 he was appointed the United Farm Workers' national boycott coordinator. In 1971, Itliong resigned from the United Farm Workers because of disagreements about the governance of the union; another reason for resigning from the United Farm Workers, was that Itliong felt that the union was not willing to support aging Filipinos. Alex Fabros, a doctoral candidate at University of California, Santa Barbara, called the merger [...] "devastating for the Filipinos who participated in the UFW.".|$|E

2500|$|In March 1962 at the Community Service Organization convention, Chávez {{proposed}} {{a pilot project}} for organizing farm workers which {{was rejected by the}} organization’s members.

40|$|Bachelor thesis {{provides}} {{comprehensive information}} about the origin, development and Lipizzan horse breeding in the <b>National</b> Stud <b>Farm</b> Topoľčianky. The work consists of four parts. The first part informs about the <b>National</b> Stud <b>Farm</b> Topoľčianky itself, its location and surroundings. It describes formation of stud farm, its major milestones and formation of Lipizzan horse breeding in stud farm, which forms its integral part. The first part ends with description of current status of horses, while except {{for the number of}} horses and foals bred in the stud farm it includes characteristics of stallions for years 2015 and 2016. The second part informs about another stud farms that are breeding the Lipizzan horses in Europe, in particular the <b>National</b> Stud <b>Farm</b> in Lipica where the breed originated, the <b>National</b> Stud <b>Farm</b> in Piber and other stud farms in Central and Eastern Europe. The third section characterizes the Lipizzaner horse, describes the beginning of its breed in Slovakia and characterizes the breed through breeding standard, labelling of horses and their colouring. As next, a part of this chapter consists of a brief characterization and division of the stud book and there are also described various lines of stallions and mare families. The penultimate part of the third section of work is the provincial breeding and labour exploitation of the Lipizzan horses, in the Spanish riding school and tandem driving. The last part introduce the statistology of mare vital statistics aberrancy from the breed standard. For creating the summary sheet of that statistics, the stud books with bodily rates of 1921 to 2007 brood mares form the <b>National</b> Stud <b>Farm</b> Topoľčianky were used. The conclusion of this own research part is finding that the <b>National</b> stud <b>farm,</b> despite small variations still holds the breed standard, which confirms to us the correctness of line breeding, high breeding professionalism and especially conscientious work of all employees of the stud farm. The goal of the work was the approximation of the Lipizzan horse, his journey from place of origin to Slovakia and its settling down in the <b>National</b> Stud <b>Farm</b> Topoľčianky, as well as the work of stud farm in area of breeding, but also in sports, where riders achieve remarkable results both in tandem driving and the Spanish riding school...|$|R

2500|$|Cesar Chavez (born César Estrada Chávez, March 31, 1927 – April 23, 1993) was an American labor {{leader and}} civil rights activist who, with Dolores Huerta, co-founded the <b>National</b> <b>Farm</b> Workers Association (later the United Farm Workers union, UFW) in 1962. Originally a Mexican American farm worker, Chavez became the best known Latino American civil rights activist, and was {{strongly}} promoted by the American labor movement, which was eager to enroll Hispanic members. His public-relations approach to unionism and aggressive but nonviolent tactics made the farm workers' struggle a moral cause with nationwide support. By the late 1970s, his tactics had forced growers to recognize the UFW as the bargaining agent for 50,000 field workers in California and Florida.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{still in}} its infant stages, the {{organization}} lent its support to a strike by workers in the rose industry in 1965. [...] This initial protest by the young organization resulted in a failed attempt to strike against the rose industry. [...] That same year the farm workers {{who worked in the}} Delano fields of California wanted to strike against the growers in response to the grower’s refusal to raise wages from $1.20 to $1.40 an hour, and they sought out Chávez and the <b>National</b> <b>Farm</b> Workers Association for support. [...] The Delano agricultural workers were mostly Filipino workers affiliated with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, a charter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. [...] The unification of these two organizations, in an attempt to boycott table grapes which were grown in the Delano fields, resulted {{in the creation of the}} United Farm Workers of America.
