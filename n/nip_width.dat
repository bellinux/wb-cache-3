40|$|In the {{stationary}} state the <b>nip</b> <b>width</b> in contact between metal and rubber covered rollers with their axes parallel is almost {{described by the}} roller diameter, the applied load and the modulus of elasticity of material with which the roller is covered, but in the rotational state it is different. The behavior of rubber changes with its peripheral speed by the rheological property. 　For the purpose of analysing it 2 ̆ 7 s system, {{we assume that the}} behavior of rubber is Voigt model, then we can estimate the constant of Voigt model of rubber from the change of <b>nip</b> <b>width</b> with the speed in the rotationa state. On the other hand, we calculate the modulus of elasticity and dynamic modulus of it by means of the measurment of stress-strain curve of tensile tester and the dynamic measurement by VIBRON II. 　As compared with their modulus, we do not find the coincidence of them in value, but discover the orders of them in equal...|$|E
40|$|Ink trappings {{were studied}} by using {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) film with black inks for offset proofing and synthetic paper. By observing printed matter from reverse side through the PET film, we detected many air bubbles in the ink layer {{and between the}} ink layer and the PET film. They are classified roughly to two groups, small number of large ones (φ = 2 - 5 μm) and many small ones (φ = 0. 5 - 1. 0 μm). The former ones were fixed air bubbles during the trapping. The latter ones decreased according {{to increase the amount}} of ink trapped (y). Because number of the air bubbles (Nair bubble) increased with increasing the ink distribution time, they seemed to be yielded by suspension of air into the ink layer during ink distribution. By observing printed surface, we also detected many ink peaks (immediately after the trapping) and pinholes (at 24 h). The numbers of the ink peaks and pinholes (Nink peak and Npinhole, respectively) decreased also with increasing the y value and increased with increasing the ink distribution time. We studied effects of <b>nip</b> <b>width</b> on these values (distribution time = 2 min.; <b>nip</b> <b>width</b> = 2, 3 and 4 mm). The Nair bubble value decreased with increasing <b>nip</b> <b>width</b> contrary to increase the Nink peak and Npinhole values. The effects can be represented by differences in the values of 2 and 4 mm nip widths. At y = 2 gm- 2, the difference in the Nair bubble value is about one third (synthetic paper ink) or a half (offset proofing ink) of the difference in the Nink peak values...|$|E
40|$|The {{computation}} of {{the mechanical}} behaviour of systems of two rolls and related operating quantities {{plays an important role}} in the effective organization of the process of development and design of systems of rolls. The steps of the proposed design procedure will be presented. The procedure allows to carry out the design of the system of two rolls and to determine the operating quantities like <b>nip</b> <b>width</b> and nip pressure under consideration of both the existing physical and geometrical nonlinearities. In the case of a specific combination of rolls the design procedure is exemplary caried out. The attained numerical and analytical results are verified by experimental results...|$|E
50|$|Once {{the film}} tube is {{completely}} cooled, it {{is taken up}} by several <b>nip</b> rollers. The <b>width</b> of the resulting doubled-over flat film is equal to half of the blown tube's circumference. The film is then either spooled as a flattened tube, or immediately split into two separate pieces. At this point, the film is ready for further processing, such as printing or cutting into final shape.|$|R
40|$|Elastomer coated rolls play an {{important}} role in various technical branches. The high stresses in the elastomeric layer and their partial failure lead not only to insufficient quality of the production process, but can also frequently destroy the whole rolling system completely. This article describes the mechanical behaviour of a two-roll system. Numerical and experimental methods are utilized in order to establish an engineering approach for the design of such systems. The various stages of a design procedure will be presented which allows to determine the parameters important for the performance of this system, e. g. <b>nip</b> <b>width</b> or nip pressure, taking into account the geometrical and physical nonlinearities of the material behaviour The design procedure is explained using the example of a specific roll pairing. The numerical and analytical results are verified by experiments...|$|E
