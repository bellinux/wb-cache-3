40|$|In grinding, {{the high}} {{frictional}} energy is converted into heat, which may cause thermal damage and {{degradation of the}} wheel and the workpiece. Unwanted thermal effects must thus be reduced, often by external cooling using a curved-duct coolant distributor to match the wheel geometry. The performance of such a system depends strongly on the impinging jet flow properties to ensure efficient sprinkling of the hot spots. The fluid distributor, placed above the workpiece, is pierced with {{a certain number of}} identical <b>nozzle</b> <b>fittings,</b> providing multiple jets at the outlet of the nozzles. These jets sprinkle the solids over a given zone and remove the heat by convective transfer. The cooling is hence dependent on the flow structure, meaning the jet diameters, trajectories and velocities, determined up-flow by the distributor design. The present study is devoted to the hydrodynamics aspects of the fluid distributor, aiming to determine the flow-rate distribution at the different orifices and the flow-rate–pressure relationship, for a variety of nozzle diameters and feeding flow rates, under isothermal conditions. A simple hydraulic balance in the device was not able to predict with sufficient accuracy the actual measurements, even when the Venturi effect was accounted for. This discrepancy is due to the curvature of the distributor, inducing secondary flows in interaction with the nozzle outlets, which leads to a rather complex flow pattern. To overcome this issue, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool was used and compared with in situ experiments – global flow rate and pressure measurements were additionally taken with particle image velocimetry (PIV) to gain insight into the local structure. Simulations were performed with a 3 D turbulence model for Reynolds numbers up to 100, 000. This model provides an efficient tool for coupling with the thermal study at a later step, allowing global sizing and energetic optimization of the grinding process...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data were}} {{obtained}} on an optimally contoured nozzle with an area ratio of 1025 : 1 and on a truncated version of this nozzle with an area ratio of 440 : 1. The nozzles were tested with gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants at combustion chamber pressures of 1800 to 2400 psia and mixture ratios of 3. 89 to 6. 15. This report compares the experimental performance, heat transfer, and boundary layer total pressure measurements with theoretical predictions of the current Joint Army, Navy, NASA, Air Force (JANNAF) developed methodology. This methodology makes use of the Two-Dimensional Kinetics (TDK) nozzle performance code. Comparisons of the TDK-predicted performance to experimentally attained thrust performance indicated that both the vacuum thrust coefficient and the vacuum specific impulse values were approximately 2. 0 -percent higher than the turbulent prediction for the 1025 : 1 configurations, and approximately 0. 25 -percent higher than the turbulent prediction for the 440 : 1 configuration. Nozzle wall temperatures were measured {{on the outside of}} a thin-walled heat sink nozzle during the test <b>fittings.</b> <b>Nozzle</b> heat fluxes were calculated front the time histories of these temperatures and compared with predictions made with the TDK code. The heat flux values were overpredicted for all cases. The results range from nearly 100 percent at an area ratio of 50 to only approximately 3 percent at an area ratio of 975. Values of the integral of the heat flux as a function of nozzle surface area were also calculated. Comparisons of the experiment with analyses of the heat flux and the heat rate per axial length also show that the experimental values were lower than the predicted value. Three boundary layer rakes mounted on the nozzle exit were used for boundary layer measurements. This arrangement allowed total pressure measurements to be obtained at 14 different distances from the nozzle wall. A comparison of boundary layer total pressure profiles and analytical predictions show good agreement for the first 0. 5 in. from the nozzle wall; but the further into the core flow that measurements were taken, the more that TDK overpredicted the boundary layer thickness...|$|R
