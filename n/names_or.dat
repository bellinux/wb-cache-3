Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E

5|$|Many Māori {{place names}} possess either {{historical}} or mythological significance. Their meaning {{is not always}} apparent from literal translations {{and they have been}} passed down through oral tradition. Before European arrival, place names commemorated notable or historical incidents, described features of the location or were derived from traditional Hawaiki <b>names</b> <b>or</b> myths. After European arrival many locations became known as Māori versions of European words or poorly pronounced contractions of the original Māori names.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} Māori names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or dual English and Māori <b>names</b> <b>or,</b> in a few rare cases, dual Māori <b>names</b> <b>or</b> dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to capitalise on the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves to the movies.|$|E

5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{experimented with}} {{numerous}} robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers {{to form the}} final cast.

Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without <b>names</b> <b>or</b> surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E
5|$|Former Indian player Prabhakaralso {{publicly}} {{claimed that}} Kapil wanted {{to throw away}} a match against Pakistan. Prabhakar's allegations against an unknown team member was not new as he made these allegations to a magazine The Outlook in 1997 based on which BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar did not reveal <b>names</b> <b>or</b> provide evidence of his charges (match fixing and phone tapping allegation on then cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Kapil asked him to throw away the match. During the ensuing exchanges between various parties, Kapil Dev broke down {{in an interview on}} BBC's Hard Talk with Karan Thapar.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{reputation}} at {{this time}} was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the <b>names</b> <b>or</b> intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom {{he and the others}} in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.|$|E
5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of <b>names</b> <b>or</b> associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real <b>names</b> <b>or</b> addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E
