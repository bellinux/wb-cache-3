5|$|Strep throat is {{unlikely}} when {{any of the}} symptoms of red eyes, hoarseness, runny <b>nose,</b> <b>or</b> mouth ulcers are present. It is also unlikely {{when there is no}} fever.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF {{can sometimes be}} felt or observed as a discharge from the <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> ear.|$|E

50|$|A gumiho is a nine-tailed shapeshifting fox, {{usually in}} the form of a {{beautiful}} young woman. Gumihos are identifiable by their pointed <b>noses</b> <b>or</b> nine white tails, which they cannot hide; they usually seduce a man and then eat his liver.|$|R
5000|$|Although a few {{newspapers}} {{provided a}} quote by Ian Turner, the warden, about meerkats getting [...] "their nose and paws into most things", {{none of them}} specified which part of their bodies meerkats used to take the images: their <b>noses</b> <b>or</b> their paws, or both.|$|R
5|$|When cranial CSF leak is {{suspected}} because of {{discharge from the}} <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> ear that is potentially CSF, the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta-2 transferrin assay. This test can positively identify if the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, <b>nose,</b> <b>or</b> eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
60|$|We {{have never}} been quite sure as to what Adolay did on this occasion-- whether she rubbed <b>noses</b> <b>or</b> chins or touched lips. All that we are sure of is that the {{operation}} was equivalent to a kiss, {{and that it was}} reciprocated heartily.|$|R
50|$|An {{airborne}} {{disease can}} be caused by exposure to a source: an infected patient or animal, by being transferred from the infected person <b>or</b> animal’s mouth, <b>nose,</b> cut, <b>or</b> needle puncture. People receive the disease through a portal of entry: mouth, <b>nose,</b> cut, <b>or</b> needle puncture.|$|R
50|$|When {{greeting}} each other, {{these very}} sociable animals will usually touch <b>noses</b> <b>or</b> <b>nose</b> to cheek; in courtship rituals they may inter-lock teeth and nibble each other's ears and necks. They may also engage in play fighting, {{in which two}} marmots on their hind legs push each other with their paws; this play fighting is more aggressive between older marmots. In fights that have been observed during a study, only about 10% of fights had distinct outcomes.|$|R
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The <b>nose</b> (<b>or</b> rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an excerpt from the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E
2500|$|But the nudes!

They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself! ...|$|R

50|$|Nose tombs (鼻の墓) are tombs {{that contain}} human <b>noses</b> <b>or</b> other body parts that were {{brought back to}} Japan as trophies during the Japanese invasions of Korea in the late 16th century. War trophies {{were a part of}} Japanese {{tradition}} at the time and samurai warriors were often paid according to how many they collected.|$|R
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet <b>nose,</b> <b>or</b> rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the <b>nose,</b> <b>or</b> in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E
5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> wing leading edges.|$|E

50|$|The Pachon Navarro goes by {{many other}} names: Old Spanish Pointer, Perdiguero Navarro, Navarro Pointer, and Pachon De Victoria. It {{is closely related}} to the Portuguese Pointer. Split <b>noses</b> <b>or</b> double <b>noses</b> occur sometimes, though rarely, in many {{pointing}} breeds thought to have descended from the Portuguese Pointer and the Pachon Navarro, including the German Shorthaired Pointer.|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{intraoperative}} complications, all sinus membrane perforations {{were covered}} with a resorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Gide®, Geistlich Biomaterials, Baden-Baden, Germany) which applied as sealant to overlap the site of perforation prior to insertion of the graft material. These patients were advised to avoid physical stress, blowing their <b>noses,</b> <b>or</b> sneezing {{for a period of}} 3  weeks, and nose decongestant drops were prescribed.|$|R
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial leaks and spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the <b>nose,</b> <b>or</b> ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E
5|$|The wet <b>nose,</b> <b>or</b> rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Army Infantry School {{wrote that}} [...] "the Ministry of Emergency Situations workers, who were tasked with {{removing}} civilian corpses and {{taking them to}} the nearby village of Goyskoye for identification (...) collected bodies lying by the river, some of which had ears, <b>noses,</b> <b>or</b> fingers sliced off. It was not known who had mutilated the bodies, or why".|$|R

50|$|The Erbslöh was a blimp with a 27 m long gondola {{made from}} ash. The trim was {{regulated}} by pumping water {{back and forth}} between two tanks in the bow and aft section of the ship so that the airship adopted a <b>nose</b> up <b>or</b> <b>nose</b> down attitude.|$|R
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his <b>nose</b> <b>or</b> mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
