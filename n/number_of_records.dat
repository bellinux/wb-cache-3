5|$|The {{outline of}} the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner's life has been established from a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records,</b> mostly relating to commissions, payments and property transfers. There are no documents relating to his early life, a contributing factor being the loss of archival records from his supposed birthplace during the French occupation of Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> about land property {{in order to assess}} taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E

Newton {{contacts}} a second shapeshifter, Ray (Marcus Giamatti), to infiltrate the secured location where Van Horn's body is being held to remove the data disc that Walter will ultimately find. Ray regrets the possibility of having to leave his current identity, a police officer with a wife and son. Meanwhile, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Fauxlivia discover that Van Horn has acquired a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> on the personnel of the Fringe team, and likely has used the information to aid the parallel universe's Walternate (Noble).|$|E

5|$|Leto {{played his}} first video {{game at the}} age of five, playing Super Mario Bros. In his early teens he played and won local video game competitions. At the age of 17, he broke the world record for points scored in the video game Crazy Taxi, and when Twin Galaxies, which records video game records, wanted more proof, he {{recorded}} a video of beating his own record. He then spent the next year focused on breaking video game records and eventually broke 742 of them. He had the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> ever achieved until Tom Duncan surpassed him. Originally Zyos was interested in going to DigiPen Institute of Technology to learn how to create video games, but found it intense and that it was not his passion. Having dropped out of college, he later left his job at an ice cream shop at age 19 and began pursuing a career in professional gaming. In late 2002 Leto competed at AGP1, his first video game tournament, and though his team placed fifth, he ranked second individually out of three hundred players.|$|E

He was one of the highest paid recording artists of his time.|$|E
25|$|The Administration Building {{was erected}} in 1963 on the North Campus across from Wingate Hall.

25|$|One {{change during}} this period was his {{abandonment}} of the banjo {{in favor of the}} guitar.

It was the first time Reinhardt heard leading American jazz musicians, such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. The new sounds gave Reinhardt a vision and goal of becoming a jazz professional.|$|E

25|$|Knowledge of {{the spoken}} and written {{language}} of the Minoans is scant due to the small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> found. Clay tablets, dating to around 3000 BC, were found with Aegean scripts. Clay tablets were apparently in use around 3000 BC or earlier. Two clay cups from Knossos had remnants of ink, and inkwells similar to animal-shaped Mesopotamian inkstands have been found. The Eteocretan language, written with a Euboean-derived alphabet after the Greek Dark Ages, {{is believed to be}} a descendant of Minoan; however, there is not enough source material in either language to allow a firm conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Laurier holds a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> He is {{tied with}} Sir John A. Macdonald {{for the most}} {{consecutive}} federal elections won (four), and his 15-year tenure remains the longest unbroken term of office among prime ministers. In addition, his nearly 45 years (1874–1919) of service in the House of Commons is a record for that house. At 31 years, 8 months, Laurier was the longest-serving leader of a major Canadian political party, surpassing William Lyon Mackenzie King by over two years. Finally, he is the fourth-longest serving Prime Minister of Canada, behind King, Macdonald, and Pierre Trudeau. Laurier's portrait is displayed on the Canadian five-dollar bill.|$|E
25|$|Robert Graeme Pollock (born 27 February 1944) is {{a former}} cricketer for South Africa, Transvaal and Eastern Province.

Despite Pollock's international career being cut short at the age of 26 by the sporting boycott of South Africa, and all but one of his 23 Test matches being against England and Australia, the leading cricket nations of the day, he broke a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> His completed career Test match batting average of 60.97 remains second only to Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E

They entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 4–3 in the quarter-finals by Barcelona.

25|$|The Hough House was {{originally}} constructed in late nineteenth century, but {{has since been}} restored as a Colonial Revival style building. The structure emanates exuberance through its quality craftsmanship that showcases exquisite masonry work and wood detailing. The wood shingle roof, stone accents, facades, and Palladian style windows makes the Hough House the most stylish structure within the fort. The two-and-a-half storey building sits elegantly amongst the earthworks, creating an environment that resembles that of a countryside manor. The Hough House {{is perhaps the most}} visited site of Fort Malden, largely due to its attractive design, and more importantly the fact that it plays host to a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> and archives pertaining to the history of the fort itself.|$|E
