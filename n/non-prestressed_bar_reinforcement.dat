40|$|Abstract: Fatigue {{behaviors}} of prestressed concrete beams with different corrosion level are investigated {{in a series}} of bonded post-tensioned T-beams. The beams have the same designs and submitted to the same maximum and minimum load during the test. Accelerated corrosion method is used to make various corrosion rates of prestressed steel strands. With the corrosion level as main parameter, such as failure mode, fatigue life, mid-span deflection development, stiffness loss, stress expansion, are studied. The test results show that failure mode is changed fracture of <b>non-prestressed</b> steel <b>bar</b> into prestressed steel strand breaking with the increase of corrosion level. Corrosion reduces fatigue life and stiffness of beams, increase deflection and stress range of <b>non-prestressed</b> steel <b>bar...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} integrity of reinforced concrete structures in blast events {{is important for}} critical facilities. This paper presents experimental data generated for calibrating detailed finite element models that predict the performance of reinforced concrete wall panels {{with a wide range}} of construction details under blast loading. The test specimens were 1. 2 m square wall panels constructed using Normal Weight Concrete (NWC) or Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC). FRC consists of macro-synthetic fibers dispersed in NWC. Five types of panels were tested: NWC panels with steel <b>bar</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (Type A); FRC panels without additional reinforcement (Type B); FRC panels with steel <b>bar</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (Type C); NWC panels with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) <b>bar</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (Type D); and NWC panels reinforced with steel <b>bar</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and external bidirectional GFRP overlays on both faces (Type E). Three additional Type D panels were used as control specimens (CON). Each panel type was constructed with three thicknesses: 152 mm, 254 mm, and 356 mm. The panels were instrumented with strain gauges, and accelerometers; in addition, pressure sensors and high speed video were employed during the blast events. Panel types C and E had the best performance, whereas panel type B did not perform well. Preliminary dynamic simulations show crack patterns similar to the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the deficiencies of current composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> such as low elastic moduli, low pre-rupture elongation, brittle fracture as well as high cost, a new core-shell model of hybrid composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> has been developed in this study. In this model, steel and glass fibers are randomly dispersed across the {{cross section of the}} core while Twaron and carbon fibers are placed within the shell to improve the elastic modulus as well as to serve as a shield for protecting the glass fibers from alkaline attack; and the steel fibers from moisture and chloride induced corrosion. Glass composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> and hybrid composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> were fabricated by hand winding method. The tensile modulus and strength of the new hybrid <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> were determined to be 142 GPa and 628 MPa, respectively. New hybrid <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> were also conditioned in different alkaline environments and were evaluated for their alkaline resistance properties. Compared with glass composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars,</b> the new hybrid composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> possess characteristics of alkaline resistance, good ductility and increased modulus of elasticity, while the material costs of such hybrid composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> are slightly higher than the glass composite <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of an experimental program and analytical modeling for axial-flexural interactions of concrete-filled glass fiber-reinforced polymer tube (GFRP-CFFT) columns with and without reinforcing glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars. The experimental program included four steel RC specimens, four GFRP-CFFT specimens, and four GFRP bar-reinforced GFRP-CFFT specimens with an outer diameter of 205 - 206 mm and a height of 800 - 812 mm. The specimens were tested under concentric and 25 - and 50 -mm eccentric axial loads and four-point load. The experimental results showed that GFRP bar-reinforced GFRP-CFFT specimens sustained higher peak axial loads, axial and lateral deformations at peak axial load, and flexural loads than GFRP-CFFT specimens without reinforcing GFRP bars and steel RC specimens. Axial load and bending moment (P-M) interactions of GFRP-CFFT specimens with and without reinforcing GFRP bars and steel RC specimens were analytically modeled. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate the effects of actual confinement ratio and GFRP <b>bar</b> <b>reinforcement</b> ratio on P-M interactions of GFRP-CFFT specimens.

40|$|This study aims at {{obtaining the}} cost of Prestressed Concrete (PC) beams and Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams. These beams are {{designed}} {{according to the requirements}} of the ACI 318 - 05 code. The objective function comprised {{the cost of}} concrete and the cost of reinforcement. Two computer models were developed for the cost optimization of PC and RC simple beams using MATLAB software. The design variables of RC simple beams were beam width, effective beam depth, number of flexural <b>bars</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> diameter. Beam width, effective beam depth, number of flexural <b>bars,</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> diameter, number of tendons, tendon diameter and eccentricity of the centre of gravity of the tendons represented the design variables of PC simple beams. Practical design situations were considered using integer values for beam dimensions, number and diameter of bars/tendons. A catalogue of the common values of the beam dimensions and bar/tendon numbers and diameter dimensions were prepared for this purpose. A cost reduction of 27. 9 and 16. 7 % for the 4 and 8 m span RC beams, respectively and 29. 8 and 17. 8 % of the 10 and 20 m span PC beams was obtained by the GA model over the generalized reduced gradient method. The effect of concrete compressive strengths and wider design parameters bounds on the outputs of the optimization process were examined.

Most of residential houses in some countries are made of masonry walls. Because of the material cost and simple construction method, concrete brick masonry walls become widely used in Indonesia. Improving the structural performance {{of this kind of}} wall has become important. For this reason, experimental test was conducted on the flexural strength and ductility of concrete brick masonry wall strengthened by steel <b>bar</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The concrete bricks are in the form of cellular hollow concrete blocks which used for practical residential houses popularly. The aims of the test were to determine the out of plane flexural capacity and ductility of the strengthened masonry walls by using some variation steel <b>bars</b> <b>reinforcement</b> ratio in horizontal and vertical directions of the walls. The results of the test showed that the variations of flexural strength of unreinforced wall specimen were very high. The flexural capacity and ductility of strengthened walls were increased significantly, up to 5 - 16 times higher than that of non strengthened walls. Steel reinforcement could increase the flexural strength close to the theoretical.
