25|$|In his collegiate years, Eala {{used to call}} on the Man on the Ball {{radio show}} of Romi Kintanar. This later helped land him a job as {{commentator}} for PBA games on radio before joining Vintage Sports, later renamed as Viva-Vintage Sports on its TV panel. Eala started as an analyst from 1992 to 1994, then becoming a play-by-play commentator by 1995. Later on, Eala {{became one of the}} most popular commentators in the league with his famous lines such as Susmaryosep (a well known Filipino expression) and <b>Nobody</b> <b>does</b> it better, which drew raves and rants from fans.|$|E
500|$|Colin Greenwood {{admitted}} that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, [...] "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this... naughty thing, 'cause <b>nobody</b> <b>does</b> a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title [...] "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And I just thought, that's great. That's how people would like me to be. And {{that was the end}} of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." [...] In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it [...] "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together over a couple of evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] and the work of the Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote [...] "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.|$|E
500|$|A {{contemporary}} artist usually sings {{during the}} title sequence and an instrumental {{version of the}} main track may also be featured as a leitmotif during the film, which repeats in various moods. Writing for Rolling Stone, Andy Greene says that [...] "James Bond title songs, as a rule, have {{the name of the}} movie in the chorus," [...] though he notes that this is not always the case. On Her Majesty's Secret Service has an entirely instrumental credit sequence, though the film features an alternate theme, [...] "We Have All the Time in the World", sung by Louis Armstrong. Until the Daniel Craig era, only <b>Nobody</b> <b>Does</b> It Better and All Time High served as an opening theme without sharing a title with the movie. John Barry provided the title song music on ten of the eleven films for which he composed the musical score. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song and become pop hits, including Paul McCartney's [...] "Live and Let Die", Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] (for the film The Spy Who Loved Me), and Sheena Easton's [...] "For Your Eyes Only" [...] with Adele's [...] "Skyfall" [...] and Sam Smith's [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] eventually winning the award.|$|E

500|$|In 1995 Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly rated Never Say Never Again as {{the ninth}} best Bond film to that point, after 17 films had been released. Sauter thought the film [...] "is {{successful}} {{only as a}} portrait of an over-the-hill superhero." [...] He did admit, however, that [...] "even past his prime, Connery proves that <b>nobody</b> <b>does</b> it better". James Berardinelli, in his review of [...] Never Say Never Again, thinks the re-writing of the Thunderball story {{has led to a}} film which has [...] "a hokey, jokey feel, [...] is possibly the worst-written Bond script of all". Berardinelli concludes that [...] "it's a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out, hackneyed story." [...] Critic Danny Peary wrote that [...] "it was great to see Sean Connery return as James Bond after a dozen years". He also thought the supporting cast was good, saying that Klaus Maria Brandauer's Largo was [...] "neurotic, vulnerable... one of the most complex of Bond's foes" [...] and that Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger [...] "make lasting impressions." [...] Peary also wrote that the [...] "film is exotic, well acted, and stylishly directed... It {{would be one of the}} best Bond films if the finale weren't disappointing. When will filmmakers realize that underwater fight scenes don't work because viewers usually can't tell the hero and villain apart and they know doubles are being used?" ...|$|E
2500|$|If a {{property}} owner interferes with an easement upon his property {{in a manner}} that satisfies the requirements for adverse prescription (e.g. locking the gates to a commonly used area, and <b>nobody</b> <b>does</b> anything about it), he will successfully extinguish the easement. [...] This is another reason to quiet title after a successful adverse possession or adverse prescription: it clarifies the record of who should take action to preserve the adverse title or easement while evidence is still fresh.|$|E
2500|$|Her speech {{also sought}} to express the idea that really terrible things happen to good people: [...] "I would call it, in terms of writing, in terms of poetry, it's a laundry list.

I just wanted to admit, you know, that we didn't deserve this, and <b>nobody</b> <b>does.</b> And so I wanted to link our tragedy, in every sense, you know - we're no {{different}} from anything else that has hurt...." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{a period}} of heavy media {{criticism}} aimed at EastEnders throughout 2004 and 2005, the character—who was on a hiatus from the show—was reintroduced twice in what was branded by the press as a bid to [...] "boost flagging Enders" [...] and [...] "revive the soap's ailing ratings". His first return in April 2005 was generally well-received, with media comments such as [...] "the excellent, bug-eyed Steve McFadden proves <b>nobody</b> <b>does</b> psychotic thug better than him" [...] and [...] "McFadden's blistering performance on Tuesday defies that old cliché of a soap being bigger than its stars". Of the Mitchell brothers' highly publicised return in October 2005, a reporter from the Daily Mirror commented [...] "Soapville must confess that we did get goosebumps and feel properly excited when we first saw the Mitchell Brothers back on the Square...After all, you associate them with the golden days of Enders".|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Whammy! was positive {{at the time}} of its release. Most critics regarded the album as a return to form after their previous album Mesopotamia, which they felt strayed too far from the band's signature sound. Praise was given to the drum machines and synthesizers, which created upbeat and highly danceable songs, as well as the tight lyrics and over the top vocals. Rolling Stones Christopher Connelly, while referring to Mesopotamia as [...] "underrated", was pleased with the band's return to their trademark style, and felt that even with the addition of Devo-style keyboards, producer Steven Stanley had [...] "kept the band's band's basic strengths intact: breakneck tempos, deliciously uninhibited singing and an earnest enthusiasm for some of the universe's less-celebrated pleasures". He particularly praised Pierson, Wilson, and Schneider's vocals. While remarking that the entirety of side two is [...] "a waste", he concluded, [...] "What is important is that this band is having fun again - and in this age of dopey novelty songs and cheesy dance tracks, <b>nobody</b> <b>does</b> it better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zsa Zsa {{arrives in}} the show's setting of Albert Square, jumping the {{barriers}} at the tube station. She sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying {{in a car crash}} in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift. She then heads to the café where she overhears Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) breaking up with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), and she talks to Peter outside. Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) decides to hold a party at 89b George Street, and Peter invites Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Peter who lives there, and he says <b>nobody</b> <b>does.</b> They dance together and end up kissing. Lauren walks in and slaps Peter and Zsa Zsa, who fights with Lauren. Whitney intervenes, but ends up getting in the fight herself, and Zsa Zsa ends up with a cut on her forehead. When Lucy orders her out, Zsa Zsa throws punch over Lauren, Lucy and Whitney. Outside, she asks Peter if he knows Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), saying they go back a long way. Zsa Zsa visits Shirley and they talk. She is about to explain her reasons for being there when Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) comes in, and Shirley asks her to leave. Outside, Peter is waiting for Zsa Zsa. She goes to the bus stop and Peter wonders if he will see her again. She walks over to him and kisses him passionately, and says [...] "maybe", taking his keys without him knowing.|$|E

2500|$|On February 8, the TNT started {{broadcasting}} {{a so-called}} [...] "Island" [...] sitcom, which though quite traditional in its performance, was very remarkable for its subtext. For {{the first time}} a rating product of the TNT channel parodied the channel’s highly fashionable reality show with a 12-year history ("Dom-2"), doing this in quite a postmodern manner. According to the scenario, a group of participants of a certain reality show [...] "Island", consisting of four guys and four girls, reach a deserted island, where lots of television cameras are hidden in various places. On the first day, something unexpected happens: the entire film crew dies in the explosion of the yacht; which fact the participants of the show understand as a signal for the beginning of the game, and rush to perform sophisticated tasks of the editors and even carry out SMS-votes. They are sure that millions of viewers are watching them, although in reality <b>nobody</b> <b>does</b> and nobody cares about them (more precisely, they are seen by the audience, but a different one, not that of the reality show, but the sitcom audience). Just like the participants of [...] "Dom-2" [...] they unconsciously begin to break up into pairs and [...] "build relationships", although they were not asked to do so. They are accompanied by a local resident, and he alone knows the terrible truth, but he does not speak their language, and they do not understand him. Actually, [...] "Dom-2" [...] as well as some other TNT products are directly mentioned, and even mocked at, by the participants of the [...] "Island" [...] from the very beginning: ...|$|E
