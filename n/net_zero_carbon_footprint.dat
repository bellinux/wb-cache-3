40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{calculation}} of the carbon footprint of a typical West Australian mine site village and the ways by which it {{can be reduced to}} a point where the village can be legitimately described as 'carbon neutral'. The study contributes to a broader ARC joint research program by Murdoch and Curtin Universities entitled 'Decarbonising Cities and Regions'. The term carbon neutral has a far from uniform definition. For the purpose of the carbon accounting that follows carbon neutrality is achieved when there is a <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint</b> across the full life cycle or when total emissions are balanced by total offsets. As much of the full life cycle of the village as is practical is included in the process and acknowledges any omissions made. The paper will show how the carbon footprint of a mine site village in Western Australia's mid-west has been measured, calculated and reduced effectively to a point where carbon neutrality can be claimed. This will commence with calculation of the embodied and operational energy in constructing and operating the village, followed by methods towards achieving carbon neutrality. The latter includes energy efficiency opportunities; an environmental and economic sustainability assessment of renewable energy and construction materials; design modification of the infrastructure; and assessment of accredited biomass offset mechanisms. The whole process has been termed LEVI©, Low Energy Village Infrastructure. An economic assessment of the carbon neutral strategy is the key to implementation. Mining companies are particularly drawn to the 'bottom line' when making investment decisions and only sound financial analysis will facilitate substantial carbon neutral expenditure. LEVI© significantly includes a net present cost (NPC) analysis of all such investment and belies the myth that carbon neutral mine site accommodation cannot be achieved. The paper then presents a carbon accounting methodology of the case study mine site village and set out the results and overall carbon emissions the village is responsible for. This life cycle analysis (LCA) is done from cradle to gate in terms of LCA terminology and represents the manufacture, construction, installation and operation. Energy efficiencies and behavioural changes are then applied and estimated as to their carbon reductive effect on the total carbon, followed by verifiable renewable energy offsets. These offsets are substantiated by a vigorous renewable energy analysis and selection supported by an NPC analysis. An optimum renewable energy system (RE) is then selected (best value for money) and its carbon reducing effect over the current power system calculated. This amount, together with that produced by energy efficiencies and behavioural changes, makes a total carbon reduction and is annualised. The paper clearly shows that the projected life of the mine, and therefore the village, is a critical factor in the overall carbon analysis and that the optimum time period within which carbon neutrality of such a mine site village can be claimed lays somewhere between 7 and 10 years. Another key finding was that the capital expenditure (CAPEX) savings by developing such a village as a standalone facility produces clear advantages over connection to a mine power generation system as is the case study example. The optimum standalone RE system for introduction from 2014 was found to be 110 kW fixed amorphous photovoltaic array and two 100 kW wind turbines with one 150 kW and one 100 kW low-cycle diesel generators as a backup. The projected cost was approximately 2 million. It is contended that the metrics produced from the results can provide a pro-rata basis with which to model future carbon neutral villages of similar construction. The model accommodates dependencies such as life of mine, size of village, number of workers and location. The paper will describe some innovative solutions and outcomes from this research that may be applied to the built environment on a broader scale...|$|E

40|$|Quantifying a {{detailed}} inventory of carbon emissions {{attributed to a}} retail building is of vital importance to minimize (or offset) their environmental impact. However, quantifying {{the environmental impact of}} a commercial building's operation has attracted great controversy regarding both the carbon fields considered within the building's operational boundaries and the different responsibility levels among participants. This paper details a robust framework on how businesses operating under UK policy can measure the operational carbon performance attributed to their buildings. Furthermore, the paper investigates how the quantified emissions can be offset in order to reach <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> operational performance. The analysis is structured in three levels and its applicability is showcased through an industry-sourced example of a supermarket building. The first level aims to classify building emissions according to their sources namely electricity consumption, on-site fuel burning, water supply, transport operations and waste management & disposal. The developed carbon fields' analysis technique treats a commercial building as an on-going energy consuming system where different operations (e. g. transport activities) contribute to the building's commercial use as well as to its operational <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint.</b> In the second level, the study compares a food store's <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint</b> across different supply and operation scenarios in order to analyse how each sector can influence emissions.

40|$|The energy {{performance}} and greenhouse gas impact of homes {{has been at}} the forefront of Australian climate change mitigation policy discussion for several decades. Various levels of government have acted to improve the energy and carbon efficiency of new homes through planning and building regulatory instruments. Most recently the Building Code of Australia has been used to introduce minimum energy efficiency standards for new homes at 4 stars in 2003, 5 stars in 2006 and 6 stars in 2010. But while improving the performance of long-lived assets such as new homes is a commonly used policy of developed nations, the relatively poor energy and greenhouse performing existing housing stock will continue to have a significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions for many decades. The concept of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> homes has been in the Australian policy debate since that target was set by the United Kingdom Government for new homes in 2007, with the policy commencing in 2016. And while the focus of the policy debate to date has been centred on the construction of new homes, can the same concept of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> homes realistically be applied to the existing housing stock?

Halting global warming thus requires virtually zero annual CO 2 emissions at some point. Policymakers have now incorporated this concept in the negotiating text for a new global climate agreement, but confusion remains about concepts like carbon neutrality, climate neutrality, full decarbonization, and <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> or <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

40|$|Many impacts {{projected}} for {{a global}} warming level of 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels may exceed the coping capacities of particularly vulnerable countries. Therefore, many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1. 5 °C. Here we analyse integrated energy-economy-environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1. 5 °C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios, energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 °C-consistent scenarios, but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors, leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 °C- to a 1. 5 °C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO 2.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} European offshore gas-recycling in the North Sea to an exemplar onshore carbon capture-utilization-and-storage project (CCUS) in North America. Natural gas recycling has a long and successful history in the North Sea; while North America has pioneered the utilization of CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. With renewed interest in CO 2 EOR {{as a means of}} stimulating carbon capture and storage (CCS), a simple comparison of these two gas injection cultures illuminates the potential of CCUS to change the velocity of, and cost- of-entry for, large CCS projects in Europe. The comparison of Weyburn, a large CO 2 EOR operation in Canada, with Åsgard, offshore Norway, a large natural gas recycling operation, is based on a comparative CO 2 price of 70 USD per tonne and conservative oil price for the last decade of 70 USD per barrel. A hypothetical offshore CO 2 EOR scenario is described to illustrate how the revenue-expenditure ratios are similar for offshore and onshore projects – around 5 : 1 for the additional oil produced from acquired CO 2. A nominal carbon tax of 35 USD per tonne increases this to 10 : 1, demonstrating the potential for CO 2 EOR to stimulate CCS. However, large upfront capital investments and a regional shortage of captured CO 2 are significant hurdles to offshore European CCUS. The comparison also suggests a CO 2 emissions-storage ratio of 2 : 1. While this is a low <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint</b> for oil, in order for these projects to have a <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint,</b> they would require a transition to significant associated storage. It follows that the role of CO 2 EOR in a European CCUS context is primarily to stimulate the role-out of capture and transport infrastructure, and to access to large offshore CO 2 storage hubs in the North Sea...|$|R

The hydrofoil provides significantly reduced drag and improved seakeeping in higher sea states.

The use of solar cells and nature fibres for the construction of the vessel further enhances the sustainability. The vessel has a modular interior based on an aircraft track system, for which 3 distinctive GAs have been designed. This offers a significant level of configuration flexibility for charter and also creates a new charter market sector between charter and ownership, whereby the client can own an interior which is stored and transported in TEUs. The modular nature of the interior enables it to be fitted in 1 / 2 a day rather than a conventional refit which can take months. The exterior styling is informed by motoryacht trends.
