500|$|The OdioWorks {{case was}} one of the first {{high-profile}} cases illustrating Apple's attempts to employ federal police power in its litigation practices by invoking the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a means of shielding its intellectual property from reverse engineering. In November 2008, Apple sent a cease-and-desist letter to BluWiki, a non-commercial wiki provider, alleging BluWiki infringed Apple's copyrights in publishing a discussion of how to make the latest iPods interoperate with other software and that, by so doing, violated the DMCA. [...] In April 2009, OdioWorks, the operators of BluWiki, backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), defensively sued Apple seeking a declaration of <b>non-infringement</b> and non-circumvention. In July 2009, Apple ceased claiming infringement, stating it was [...] "withdrawing [...] takedown notifications" [...] and that [...] "Apple no longer has, nor will it have in the future, any objection to the publication of the itunesDB Pages which are the subject of the OdioWorks complaint". After Apple withdrew its complaint and cited code obsolescence as a contributing factor in its decision to withdraw, BluWiki then republished its discussion of the issue. The EFF noted, [...] "While we are glad that Apple retracted its baseless legal threats, we are disappointed that it only came after 7 months of censorship and a lawsuit".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, BT {{discovered}} it owned a patent (...) which it believed gave it patent rights {{on the use}} of hyperlink technology on the World Wide Web. The corresponding UK patent had already expired, but the US patent was valid until 2006.

50|$|The {{two most}} common {{defenses}} to {{a claim for}} patent infringement are <b>non-infringement</b> and invalidity. The defense of <b>non-infringement</b> is {{that at least one}} element of an asserted claim is not present in the accused product (or {{in the case of a}} method claim, that at least one step has not been performed). The defense of invalidity is a counter-attack on the patent itself., i.e., the validity of the patent and the allegedly infringed claims.|$|E

5000|$|The patent phase {{began on}} May 7, 2012 {{with the same}} jury. [...] By the time of trial, Oracle's patent case {{comprised}} claims from two patents, 6061520 (Method and system for performing static initialization), and RE38104 (Method and apparatus for resolving data references in generated code). [...] Google pursued a <b>non-infringement</b> defense. For the 6061520 patent, they argued that they were using parsing for optimizing static initialization, rather than [...] "simulating execution" [...] as the claim required. For the RE38104 patent, they argued that the instruction {{did not include a}} symbolic reference. The jury found <b>non-infringement</b> on all patent counts. [...] As a result of these rulings and a stipulation, there was no jury damages phase. The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code.|$|E

50|$|The court decided Philip’s notices of {{infringement}} provided Netgear sufficient {{knowledge of}} infringement. Likewise, the court {{could not find}} substantial non-infringing uses of wireless fragmentation. When considering material part of invention, the district court claimed defragmentation did not infringe US patent 4,974,952 as it only made material claims of fragmentation techniques. Weighing all four elements of direct infringement, the federal court reversed the district court’s summary judgment for <b>non-infringement</b> Netgear’s models WPN111, WG511, WPN824, and WG311T.|$|E
5000|$|Secure Computing {{argued that}} they did not {{directly}} infringe Finjan's patents because the software they sold to customers were“locked,” meaning that none of the infringing features were functional until the customers “purchased keys and unlocked” the software components. This implied that the customers were the direct infringers, and the defendants were indirect infringers. To prove their <b>non-infringement</b> theory, the defendants cited the Southwest Software, Inc. v. Harlequin Inc. casefor the proposition that “locked computer code” cannot infringe.|$|E
50|$|Fujitsu Ltd v. Netgear Inc was {{a patent}} {{infringement}} case centered on three patents {{claimed to be}} required for full compliance of the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard and the WiFi Alliance Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WMM) Specification. US patents 4,975,952, 6,018,642, and 6,469,993 were owned by Philips Electronics, Fujitsu, and LG Electronics respectively, {{and placed in the}} Via Licensing pool. The Via Licensing pool claimed to hold all patents required for a complete WiFi/WMM implementation. Netgear did not enter an agreement with Via Licensing but produced a series of products that conform to the WiFi standard and WMM Specification. Philips Electronics, Fujitsu, and LG Electronics sued Netgear for patent infringement claiming a complete implementation of the WiFi standard implied violating patents held by Via Licensing pool. When tried in United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, the court granted summary judgment of <b>non-infringement</b> by Netgear for all three patents thus plaintiffs appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confirmed <b>non-infringement</b> for two of the three patent and found infringement of the third patent in four of Netgear's products.|$|E

The Senseo creators had used their patent to get an {{injunction}} against the marketing of coffee pods by other coffee brands, and those others replied by seeking a declaratory judgment of <b>non-infringement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To {{apply the}} reverse {{doctrine}} of equivalents, the Federal Circuit said, a factual investigation {{was needed to}} determine whether the Matsushita device's [...] "structure is so far changed in principle that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way," [...] so that a trial of that issue was therefore required. This is not a legal question, the en banc SRI court insisted, and it disapproved the earlier statement of a Federal Circuit panel in Kalman v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., that <b>non-infringement</b> under the reverse doctrine of equivalents is a legal question.|$|E

The Third Circuit decided that because the alleged fraud had been perpetrated on it, {{rather than on the}} district court, it should decide the case instead of having the district court consider a bill of review.|$|E
50|$|The Gillette Defence {{is a way}} {{of arguing}} <b>non-infringement</b> by proving {{invalidity}} without requiring the patent claims to be construed. The defence is based on an early 1900s decision from the House of Lords and allows the defendant to plead that their alleged infringing actions are part of the prior art, and thus either the patent is invalid for claiming the prior art or if the patent is valid, the defendant does not infringe. In view of the Supreme Court's decision in Free World Trust, any Gillette Defence would still require that the patent claims are construed prior to determining infringement.|$|E
50|$|On June 28, 2013, Riverbed served Silver Peak Systems with an {{additional}} lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging infringement of two patents that {{are not covered by}} the lawsuit in Delaware.

On July 22, 2013, Silver Peak Systems denied the allegations and requested declaratory judgments of invalidity and <b>non-infringement.</b> On August 12, 2013, Silver Peak Systems amended its counterclaims, alleging infringement by Riverbed of U.S. patent 8,392,684, titled “Data Encryption in a Network Memory Architecture for Providing Data Based on Local Accessibility”.|$|E

50|$|Regarding {{the copies}} on the Hopper, Fox argued that Dish {{directly}} infringed on the copyright holders exclusive {{right to reproduction}} because Dish had an impermissible degree {{of control over the}} copying process of PTAT. The Court found that while Dish was substantially involved in the copying process on the users' PTAT, the involvement was not different from precedent <b>non-infringement</b> cases of Cartoon Network, LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc. and CoStar v. LoopNet, in which prior courts judged that the individual users, and not the service providers were liable for infringing copies. The Court concluded that the person who copied Fox's program on the user's PTAT was the user who initiated the command and not Dish.|$|E
50|$|The {{other two}} actions which were {{consolidated}} with the Graham case, (No. 37, Calmar, Inc. v. Cook Chemical Co., and No. 43, Colgate-Palmolive Co. v.

Calmar was {{a producer of}} “hold-down” sprayers for bottles of chemicals such as insecticides, and Colgate-Palmolive was a purchaser of these sprayers. Inventor Baxter I. Scoggin, Jr. had assigned his patent for sprayer design to Cook Chemical Co. Calmar and Colgate-Palmolive sought a declaration of invalidity and <b>non-infringement</b> of the patent, and Cook Chemical Co. sought to maintain an action for infringement. The validity of the patent was sustained by the District Court, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.|$|E

ERM filed a motion for summary judgement of <b>non-infringement,</b> arguing that a row of pixels is not a tile {{as defined by the}} patent. On December 12, 2000, the district court issued an order which granted ERM's motion, and determined {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "tile". On appeal, the Federal Circuit court reversed the grant of summary judgement and remanded for further proceedings, instructing the district court to consider the notion of [...] "tile" [...] to include a single row of pixels.|$|E
5000|$|During the appeal, Fujitsu claimed [...] "synchronously" [...] {{does not}} mean “at the same time”. Instead, Fujitsu stated [...] "synchronously" [...] means: “the {{shifting}} to a power-on state has a temporal relationship with the beacon signal so that the beacon signal can be received.” In addition, Fujitsu argued that the district court's definition of [...] "synchronous" [...] would require two events to occur at precisely the same time which they stated is a physical impossibility. Netgear argued the district court’s interpretation was correct. The circuit court defined synchronous to mean “just before or at the same time” and thereby slightly relax the limitation. Given the evidence from the district court’s experiment, however, the circuit court affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment of <b>non-infringement</b> without modification.|$|E
5000|$|The jury {{returned}} a verdict of infringement of the '216 patent following a full trial and awarded Uniloc $388 million in damages. The court noted the jury’s award was “the fifth largest patent verdict in history.” [...] The decision against Microsoft was subsequently overturned on September 29, 2009 when judge William E. Smith [...] "vacated" [...] the jury's verdict, ruling in Microsoft's favor once again. However, the district court, following post trial motions, granted {{a new trial}} on infringement and willfulness in infringement. Additionally, the district court granted Judgement {{as a matter of}} law (JMOL) of <b>non-infringement</b> on a few bases, granted JMOL of no willfulness, and granted a new trial on damages. In response, Uniloc appealed all but the denial of JMOL of invalidity.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2000, BT {{sent letters}} to Prodigy Communications Corporation ("Prodigy") and 16 other Internet service {{providers}} (ISPs), {{asking them to}} pay licensing fee for BT's hyperlink patent; all refused. [...] BT sued Prodigy, the oldest ISP in the U.S., for patent infringement on December 13, 2000. [...] In suing, BT claimed that the Sargent patent covered hyperlink technology, one of {{the building blocks of}} the World Wide Web. BT argued that not only had Prodigy directly infringed the Sargent patent, but that it was also liable for inducing its users to infringe BT's patent. Prodigy submitted a motion for summary judgment of <b>non-infringement,</b> arguing that the technology it used to provide Internet access to its consumers was not covered by the claims of the Sargent patent.|$|E
