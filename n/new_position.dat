5|$|On 15 July 1964, Mikoyan was {{appointed}} as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, replacing Leonid Brezhnev, {{who received a}} promotion within the Party.

5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} <b>new</b> <b>position</b> some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E
5|$|Accum {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy {{in a small}} room in his house on Old Compton Street.

An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E

5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a <b>new</b> <b>position,</b> a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods for {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a <b>new</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his <b>new</b> <b>position,</b> Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, Shabazz was {{overseeing}} the health sciences department, {{and the college}} president decided she could {{be more effective in}} a purely administrative position than she was in the classroom. She was promoted to Director of Institutional Advancement. In her <b>new</b> <b>position,</b> she became a booster and fund-raiser for the college. A year later, she was given tenure. In 1984, Shabazz was given a new title, Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs; she held that position at the college until her death.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Brand {{positioning}} {{is essential}} for brand differentiation and building brand equity. Obtaining and sustaining competitive advantage through brand positioning is a complex process {{in the context of}} increasing competition and complicated consumers. However, many positioning strategies are prone to follow similar pitfalls by aligning to market tendencies and thus failing to provide significant brand differentiation. This paper analyzes <b>new</b> <b>positioning</b> strategies for gaining sustainable competitive advantage. By using anti-market reactions such as transformation, subtraction and division, companies are able to build effective positioning strategies by making the problem of competition irrelevant. We relate these <b>new</b> <b>positioning</b> strategies to the classic positioning process and identify the key elements which make them successful. We describe the value proposition of <b>new</b> <b>positioning</b> strategies from the means-end theory perspective. Finally, the managerial implications of <b>new</b> <b>positioning</b> strategies are reviewed. We suggest directions for effective positioning and propose avenues for future positioning research...|$|R
5|$|Earp and Behan both {{applied to}} fill the <b>new</b> <b>{{position}}</b> of Cochise County sheriff, which like the Pima County sheriff job, paid the office holder 10% of the fees and taxes collected. Earp {{thought he had a}} good chance to win the position because he was the former undersheriff in the region and a Republican, like Arizona Territorial Governor John C. Fremont. However, Behan had greater political experience and influence in Prescott.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Marge {{discover}} that their house is partially sinking. Homer tries {{to repair the}} house himself, but is unsuccessful. Homer decides to call a foundation repairman and finds out that it will cost $8,500 for the repairs. Homer takes Marge to a party for the retirement of a Springfield Nuclear Power Plant employee. With a <b>new</b> <b>position</b> open at the power plant, Marge decides to apply for it {{to get the money}} for the foundation repair. With the help of Lisa, Marge gets the job at the power plant.|$|E
5|$|Humble began play on Rice's {{freshman}} team {{as an end}} in 1940. He {{advanced to}} the varsity team the next year. While he started as an end, coach Jess Neely switched him to guard before {{the first game of the}} season. He thrived in the <b>new</b> <b>position,</b> and was named a sophomore all-star by the Associated Press after the Rice Owls finished 1941 with a 6–3–1 win–loss–tie record. The following year, Humble earned All-Southwestern Conference honors and won the George Martin Award, given to Rice's most valuable player, as Rice put up a 7–2–1 record.|$|E

5|$|In 1915 Chamberlain was {{appointed}} {{member of the}} Central Control Board on liquor traffic. In December 1916 the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, offered Chamberlain the <b>new</b> <b>position</b> of Director of National Service with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. However, his tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George and in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned. The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would be one thenceforth of hatred.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, Winston Churchill {{took control}} of the Military Co-ordination Committee, charged with {{overseeing}} all of the military services. He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer, which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. While serving under Churchill had been a life-long dream for Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his <b>new</b> <b>position,</b> which seemed unclear and poorly defined.|$|E
5|$|In the East, {{under cover}} of ground fog the field army {{successfully}} withdrew from the Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared, and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops. The <b>new</b> <b>position</b> had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil {{had not yet been}} constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops.|$|E

In his <b>new</b> <b>position,</b> McCarty was primarily used for blocking and remained involved on special teams and as a receiver. He continued his extremely limited role as a rusher, finishing the season with just eight carries. McCarty had 16 catches for 123 yards and two touchdowns, {{as well as a}} career-high 12 special-teams tackles.|$|E

The band was working hard to establish themselves as a recording act, and Peart, {{along with the rest}} of the band, began to undertake extensive touring.|$|E
