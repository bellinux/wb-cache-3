5|$|Barnum Brown {{recovered}} the first described remains of Saurolophus in 1911, including a <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> skeleton (AMNH 5220). Now {{on display in}} the American Museum of Natural History, this skeleton was the first <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> dinosaur skeleton from Canada. It was found in rocks of early Maastrichtian age, in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (then known as the Edmonton Formation) near Tolman Ferry on the Red Deer River in Alberta. Brown wasted little time in describing his material, giving it its own subfamily. Saurolophus was an important early reference for other hadrosaurs, as seen in the names of Prosaurolophus ("before Saurolophus") and Parasaurolophus ("near Saurolophus"). However, little additional material has been recovered and described.|$|E
5|$|Anning {{discovered}} {{yet another}} important and <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> plesiosaur skeleton in 1830. It was named Plesiosaurus macrocephalus by William Buckland and {{was described in}} an 1840 paper by Richard Owen. Once again Owen mentioned the wealthy gentleman who had purchased the fossil and made it available for examination, but not {{the woman who had}} discovered and prepared it.|$|E
5|$|Confederate {{agents in}} Britain had {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} Confederate ships, most notably the CSS Alabama, which ravaged Union shipping after her construction in 1862. With two more such vessels under construction the following year, supposedly for French interests, Seward pressed Palmerston not to allow them to leave port, and, <b>nearly</b> <b>complete,</b> they were seized by British officials in October 1863.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of K. aethiopicus {{have been}} found only in the Tendaguru Formation, dated to the late Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian ages, about 152 million years ago. Hundreds of bones were {{unearthed}} by German expeditions to German East Africa between 1909 and 1912. Although no complete skeletons are known, the remains provided a <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> picture of the build of the animal.|$|E

5|$|After the Qing {{government}} {{defeated the}} Ming loyalist forces {{maintained by the}} Zheng family in 1683, parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing Empire. Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan's highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This era was characterized by a marked {{increase in the number}} of Han Chinese on Taiwan, continued social unrest, the piecemeal transfer (by various means) of large amounts of land from the aborigines to the Han, and the <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs.|$|E

5|$|An {{unpublished}} {{study conducted}} by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested that previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The {{study found that the}} Cryolophosaurus fossil has a <b>nearly</b> <b>complete,</b> undistorted cranial cavity which is complete enough to give an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, Sullivan {{scholars}} Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry {{announced that}} they had discovered a <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts. These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded. This piece has now been performed {{a number of times}} by amateur and professional companies, although it has not become a standard addition to the traditional scores or recordings.|$|E

5|$|Osteoderms (bony plates {{formed in}} the skin) have been found with at least 10 {{titanosaur}} genera. The lack of osteoderms in the <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> Opisthocoelicaudia skeleton might indicate that they are absent in this genus. However, the closely related Alamosaurus {{was found to have}} osteoderms nearly a century after its discovery, in addition to several other closely related titanosaurs, thus raising the possibility that Ophistocoelicaudia had them as well.|$|E
5|$|Scelidosaurus harrisonii, named and {{described}} by Owen, {{is currently the}} only recognized species, based on several <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> skeletons. A potential second species from the Sinemurian-age Lower Lufeng Formation, Scelidosaurus oehleri, was described by David Jay Simmons in 1965 under its own genus, Tatisaurus. In 1996 Spencer G. Lucas moved it to Scelidosaurus. Although the fossils are fragmentary, this reassessment has not been accepted, and S. oehleri is today once again recognized as Tatisaurus.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{understanding}} of Iguanodon {{has evolved over}} time as new information has been obtained from fossils. The numerous specimens of this genus, including <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> skeletons from two well-known bonebeds, have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding {{many aspects of the}} living animal, including feeding, movement, and social behaviour. As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.|$|E

5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over a kilometer) in elevation. An alternate {{theory is that}} the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now <b>nearly</b> <b>complete.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second storm {{discovered}} in contemporary reanalysis was identified based on meteorological reports {{from a single}} ship, the Ocean Spray, which experienced a northeast gale shifting to northwest on September 11.

5|$|The sixth {{production}} of Union Films, Soeara Berbisa {{was produced by}} Ang Hock Liem and directed by R Hu, an ethnic Chinese director {{who had worked for}} the company since 1940; the sound technician Boen Kin Nam served as assistant director. The screenplay was written by Djojopranoto, who replaced Union's former screenwriter Saeroen after the latter left for rival company Star Film following Wanita dan Satria (1941). The film began production by September 1941, and by October it was <b>nearly</b> <b>complete.</b>|$|E

5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E
5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a <b>nearly</b> <b>complete</b> rewrite of the {{abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Russian paleontologists began {{excavating}} Psittacosaurus {{remains at}} a locality {{near the village}} of Shestakovo in the oblast of Kemerovo in Siberia. Two other nearby localities were explored in the 1990s, one of which produced several complete skeletons. This species was named P. sibiricus in 2000 in a scientific paper written by five Russian paleontologists, but credit for the name is officially given to two of those authors, Alexei Voronkevich and Alexander Averianov. The remains were not completely described until 2006. Two <b>nearly</b> <b>complete,</b> articulated skeletons and a variety of disarticulated material from other individuals of all ages are known from the Ilek Formation of Siberia, which ranges from the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
