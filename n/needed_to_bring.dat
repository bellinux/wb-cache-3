5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as all available vessels were <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E

The Nigeriasat-1 {{was the first}} satellite to be built under the Nigerian government sponsorship. The satellite was launched from Russia on 27 September 2003. Nigeriasat-1 {{was part of the}} worldwide Disaster Monitoring Constellation System. The primary objectives of the Nigeriasat-1 were: to give early warning signals of environmental disaster; to help detect and control desertification {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria; to assist in demographic planning; to establish the relationship between malaria vectors and the environment that breeds malaria and to give early warning signals on future outbreaks of meningitis using remote sensing technology; to provide the technology <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> education to all parts of the country through distant learning; and to aid in conflict resolution and border disputes by mapping out state and International borders.|$|E

Sidonius asked Basilius' help, as he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> his petition to Emperor Anthemius; Basilius suggested him to compose a panegyric in honour of the Emperor, in occasion of the beginning of Anthemius' consulate (January 1, 468). After the declamation, Basilius interceded with Anthemius for Sidonius, and the Emperor made the Gallic-Roman poet a senator, a Patricius and Praefectus urbi.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, time had {{taken its toll}} on Craven Park stadium, {{following}} the Bradford City stadium fire, capacity was restricted {{and the cost of}} safety work spiraled. Major renovations were <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it up to scratch. Large amounts of money were spent on the ground each year repairing sections but once one section was repaired another would fall into disrepair. In 1988/89, their last full season at Craven Park, Rovers were relegated to the 2nd Division and Millward decided to stand down as coach. Wright Properties Ltd purchased Craven Park from the club and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.|$|E
25|$|From its {{earliest}} days the Society {{has taken a}} prominent role in advising on and lobbying for improvements to the physical development of the city. This has progressed from 1919 when it lobbied for improvements to the (then) village of Northfield right up to the present. Often, the Society has commissioned its own plans for developments either {{at the request of the}} City Council or on its own initiative. In some cases, such as the refurbishment of the Chamberlain Memorial Fountain in 1978 and the creation of formal gardens in some city parks, it has provided the funding <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about the developments in question.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the {{population}} of the District of Columbia rose by about 30 percent to 861,000 people. The terrible overcrowding and traffic jams in the city convinced many that not only was a subway system needed, but that vastly enlarged and improved highways were required as well. Post-war projections showed D.C. losing population to the suburbs, and planning for nuclear war emphasized moving many federal agencies into the suburbs as a means of reducing the government's vulnerability to attack. These and other factors meant that new superhighways would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> workers into town to work, and to move them from agency to agency throughout the day quickly and efficiently.|$|E

25|$|Before the 19th century, {{young women}} lived under the {{economic}} and disciplinary authority of their fathers until they married and passed {{under the control of}} their husbands. In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages. Before 1789, the majority of women lived confined to society’s private sphere, the home.|$|E
25|$|He {{gradually}} {{worked his}} way into the Leeds first team, making his professional debut against Millwall on 12 April 1986, and was part of the Leeds squad that lost the 1986–87 Division One playoff final, losing to Charlton Athletic in a replay. By the 1987–88 season he had become a regular in the side. However, when Howard Wilkinson succeeded Bremner as Leeds manager in 1988, the young centre-forward found himself surplus to requirements. Taylor believed that this was because Wilkinson wanted immediate success, and <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in established, experienced players in order to achieve this. Thus in March 1989 Taylor moved to Bristol City, with Carl Shutt moving to Leeds as part of the deal.|$|E
25|$|Pindar's odes {{typically}} {{begin with}} an invocation to a god or the Muses, followed by praise of the victor and often of his family, ancestors and home-town. Then follows a narrated myth, usually occupying the central and longest section of the poem, which exemplify a moral, while aligning the poet and his audience {{with the world of}} gods and heroes. The ode usually ends in more eulogies, for example of trainers (if the victor is a boy), and of relatives who have won past events, as well as with prayers or expressions of hope for future success. The event where the victory was gained is never described in detail, but there is often some mention of the hard work <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the victory about.|$|E

25|$|Nine of {{the sons}} {{returned}} to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father all that had happened in Egypt. They spoke of being accused of as spies and that their brother Simeon, had been taken prisoner. When Reuben, the eldest, mentioned that they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Benjamin to Egypt to prove their word as honest men, their father became furious with them. He couldn't understand how they were put {{in a position to}} tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, the City of Houston {{began the}} process to annex Kingwood. According to Texas state law, a home-rule city may annex an unincorporated area, {{without the consent of}} the residents, if the area is within the city's {{extraterritorial}} jurisdiction. Bob Lanier, then the Mayor of Houston, believed that the annexation of Kingwood would result in a $4 million annual gain for the City of Houston. Lanier argued that the city <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in Kingwood to add more to its tax base. On Wednesday August 21, 1996, the Houston City Council asked the Planning and Development Department to create service plans for Kingwood and Jacintoport, another area being annexed by Houston. The annexation of Kingwood and Jacintoport increased the city's population by about 43,000 people. The annexation meant that areas de-annexed by the city in the 1970s were being re-annexed.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E
