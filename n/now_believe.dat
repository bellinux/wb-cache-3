5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> it to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Whadjuk Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name, {{according}} to Robert Lyon, was Beeliar. Scholars <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> that the Beeliar people {{may have been a}} family subgroup (or clan) of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called Beelgar. According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers, as far south as Mangles Bay. The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte's brother succeeded {{their father}} as Emperor Wilhelm II in 1888, {{increasing}} her social influence. Throughout her brother's reign, {{she was known}} for her mischief-making, and spent her life in between bouts of illness, in frivolous and extravagant pursuits. She became Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen in 1914, only for her husband to lose his title {{with the end of}} World War I in 1918. Charlotte died the following year {{of a heart attack in}} Baden-Baden. She had suffered from a lifetime of ill-health. Most historians <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> she had porphyria, a genetic disease that afflicted other members of the British Royal Family.|$|E
5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
5|$|The Forbidden City remains {{important}} in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city failed and, due to the Crusaders' lack of resources, the siege became a stalemate. However, the arrival of {{craftsman}} and supplies transported by the Genoese to Jaffa tilted the balance in their favour. Crusaders constructed two large siege engines; the one commanded by Godfrey breached the walls on 15July 1099. For two days the Crusaders massacred the inhabitants and pillaged the city. Historians <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> the accounts of the numbers killed have been exaggerated, but this narrative of massacre did much to cement the Crusaders' reputation for barbarism. Godfrey further secured the Frankish position by surprising the Egyptian relief force commanded by the vizier of the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, at Ascalon. This relief force retreated to Egypt, with the vizier fleeing by ship. At this point most of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe, leaving behind Godfrey with a mere 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend Palestine. Of the other princes, only Tancred remained with the ambition to gain his own princedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, {{and there is no}} contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars <b>now</b> <b>believe,</b> however, that the mythical Menes may have been the pharaoh Narmer, who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette, in a symbolic act of unification. In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150BC, the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis, from which he could control the labour force and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death. The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the keep has {{attracted}} much historical interest. Traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that the castle was a transitional military design, combining both the circular features of later castles with the square angled buttresses of earlier Norman fortifications. More recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation. The {{design of the}} Orford keep is hard to justify in military terms, as the buttresses created additional blind spots for the defenders, whilst the chambers and staircase in the corners weakened the walls against attack. Square Norman keeps continued to be built after Orford, whilst Henry II was aware of fully circular castle designs before building the keep. A round keep was constructed at New Buckenham, Norfolk, in 1146, for example. Historians have therefore questioned {{to what extent the}} design can be seen as legitimately transitional. Instead, historians <b>now</b> <b>believe</b> that the design of Orford Castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism. Heslop argues that the plain, simple elegance of the architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur, who was then widely believed to have had Roman or Greek links. The banded, angular features of the keep resembled the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power, and the keep as a whole, including the roof, may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in Constantinople by John II Komnenos.|$|E
