40|$|Effects of <b>nipradilol</b> {{which is}} a new beta-adrenoceptor {{blocking}} agent endowed with nitroglycerin-like vasodilator actions, its denitrated derivative (denitro <b>nipradilol)</b> and propranolol on abnormalities of regional myocardial shortening produced by partial occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) were studied in anaesthetized open-chest dogs. In the presence of LCX stenosis, <b>nipradilol</b> (0. 1 mg kg- 1, i. v.) produced marked decreases in heart rate and LVdP/dt without {{a significant increase in}} left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). It improved impaired myocardial segment shortening and restored normal cardiac lactate metabolism. Denitro <b>nipradilol</b> (0. 2 mg kg- 1 i. v.) and propranolol (0. 2 mg kg- 1 i. v.) both caused similar haemodynamic changes to <b>nipradilol</b> but also produced a significant increase in LVEDP. However, improvement by these two agents of regional dysfunction in the ischaemic myocardium was comparable to those seen with <b>nipradilol.</b> All three agents markedly inhibited isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, but vehicle did not. Atrial pacing abolished the beneficial effect of <b>nipradilol</b> on myocardial shortening in the ischaemic region without affecting other haemodynamic parameters. These results indicate that <b>nipradilol</b> alleviates acute myocardial ischaemia produced by coronary stenosis with similar efficacy to denitro <b>nipradilol</b> and propranolol suggesting, that {{a major part of the}} beneficial effect of <b>nipradilol</b> may be attributable to its beta-adrenoceptor blocking action...|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To {{study the}} effects of topical <b>nipradilol,</b> a non-selective β blocker with α blocking and nitroglycerin-like activities, on intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) and aqueous humour dynamics in normal humans and in patients with ocular hypertension.  METHODS—Nipradilol (0. 06 %, 0. 125 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %) was applied to normal volunteers (n =  12) to test for IOP lowering effects. In a second group of normal volunteers (n =  11), <b>nipradilol</b> (0. 125 % and 0. 25 %) and timolol (0. 5 %) were compared for IOP lowering effects. After a single administration of 0. 25 % <b>nipradilol,</b> IOP, flare intensity in the anterior chamber, aqueous flow, uveoscleral outflow, tonographic outflow facility, and episcleral venous pressure were either directly measured or mathematically calculated. Topical <b>nipradilol</b> (0. 25 %) was administered to 24  patients with ocular hypertension twice daily for 8  weeks.  RESULTS—Administration of 0. 25 % <b>nipradilol</b> decreased IOP with a maximum reduction of 4. 2  mm Hg lasting 12  hours. A single instillation of both 0. 25 % <b>nipradilol</b> and 0. 5 % timolol reduced the IOP in normotensive human subjects to the same degree. A single instillation of 0. 25 % <b>nipradilol</b> decreased the aqueous flow rate in the treated eye by 20 %. <b>Nipradilol</b> produced no significant effect in tonographic outflow facility or episcleral venous pressure, but uveoscleral outflow was increased. In patients with ocular hypertension, twice daily instillation of 0. 25 % <b>nipradilol</b> decreased IOP without tachyphylaxis for the 8  week test period.  CONCLUSION—Topical <b>nipradilol</b> (0. 25 %) reduced IOP by decreasing the aqueous flow rate and probably also by increasing uveoscleral outflow. <b>Nipradilol</b> should be further investigated as a new antiglaucoma drug. ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>nipradilol,</b> an � 1,�-blocker with a nitric oxide donative action, on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) –induced retinal damage in rats and to determine whether topically instilled <b>nipradilol</b> penetrates the ipsilateral posterior retina–choroid at pharmacologically active concentrations in rabbits. METHODS. To determine effects on NMDA-induced damage, drugs were injected alone or with NMDA into the vitreous of one eye, and cell loss in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and thinning of the retinal neural cell layers were histologically evaluated. To evaluate posterior penetration, first, [14 C]-nipradilol was instilled, and its tissue concentration was measured. Second, <b>nipradilol</b> or timolol was instilled, and their effects on intravitreal injection of endothelin- 1 –induced retinal artery contraction were compared, to evaluate whether a pharmacologically active level of <b>nipradilol</b> penetrates the inner limiting layer by topical application. RESULTS. Intravitreous injection of NMDA reduced cell numbers in the GCL and {{the thickness of the}} inner plexiform layer (IPL) to 50. 4 % � 2. 6 % and 47. 8 % � 4. 9 % (n � 8) of control, respectively. <b>Nipradilol</b> alone had no effect. Coadministration of <b>nipradilol</b> with NMDA reduced cell numbers in the GCL and IPL thickness to 67. 8 % � 2. 2 % and 74. 4 % � 5. 2 % of control, respectively (P � 0. 05 – 0. 01). Sodium nitroprusside, but not timolol or bunazosin, also significantly prevented the NMDAinduced reduction of cell numbers in the GCL and IPL thickness. Radioactivity of <b>nipradilol</b> was found in the ipsilateral posterior retina–choroid at 318. 6 � 42. 9 ng/g (n � 4), which was significantly higher than in the contralateral control (107. 4 � 21. 8 ng/g). Topical application of <b>nipradilol,</b> but not timolol, significantly suppressed the endothelin- 1 –induced contraction of the retinal artery (83. 95 % � 8. 15 % and 35. 24 % � 5. 62 % of baseline vessel diameter for <b>nipradilol</b> and timolol, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. <b>Nipradilol</b> suppressed the NMDA-induced retinal damage in rats for which nitric oxide released from <b>nipradilol</b> may be responsible. Posterior penetration studies suggested that an effective concentration of <b>nipradilol</b> reached the posterior retina after topical application. (Invest Ophthalmol Vi...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nipradilol</b> is a newly {{synthesized}} beta-blocker {{which has}} a propranolol-like structure and contains a nitrate moiety. To {{examine the effect of}} <b>nipradilol</b> on venous blood flow, a single oral dose of <b>nipradilol</b> (6 mg) and propranolol (20 mg) was administered in the same 15 normal volunteers on separate days.

40|$|Ripasudil {{hydrochloride}} hydrate (K- 115), {{a specific}} Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, is {{developed for the}} treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Topical administration of ripasudil decreases intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing conventional outflow through the trabeculae to Schlemm’s canal, which is different from existing agents that suppress aqueous humor production or promote uveoscleral outflow. In this study, we demonstrated that ripasudil significantly lowered IOP in combined regimens with other glaucoma therapeutic agents in rabbits and monkeys. Ripasudil showed additional effects on maximum IOP lowering or prolonged the duration of IOP-lowering effects with combined administration of timolol, <b>nipradilol,</b> brimonidine, brinzolamide, latanoprost, latanoprost/timolol fixed combination, and dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination.

40|$|<b>Nipradilol</b> (Nip), {{which has}} α 1 - and β-adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} and nitric oxide (NO) -donating properties, has clinically {{been used as}} an anti-glaucomatous agent in Japan. NO mediates cellular signaling pathways that regulate physiological functions. The major signaling mechanisms mediated by NO are cGMP-dependent signaling and protein S-nitrosylation-dependent signalings. Nip {{has been described as}} having neuroprotective effects through cGMP-dependent pathway in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). However, the effect seems to be partial. On the other hand, whether Nip can prevent cell death through S-nitrosylation is not yet clarified. In this study, we therefore focused on the neuroprotective mechanism of Nip through S-nitrosylation. Nip showed a dramatic neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress-induced death of RGC- 5 cells. However, denitro-nipradilol, which does not have NO-donating properties, was not protective against oxidative stress. Furthermore, an NO scavenger significantly reversed the protective action of Nip against oxidative stress. In addition, we demonstrated that α 1 - or β-adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin or timolol) did not show any neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress in RGC- 5 cells. We also demonstrated that Nip induced the expression of the NO-dependent antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1). S-nitrosylation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein by Nip was shown to contribute to the translocation of NF-E 2 -related factor 2 to the nucleus, and triggered transcriptional activation of HO- 1. Furthermore, RGC death and levels of 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (4 HNE) were increased after optic nerve injury in vivo. Pretreatment with Nip significantly suppressed RGC death and accumulation of 4 HNE after injury through an HO- 1 activity-dependent mechanism. These data demonstrate a novel neuroprotective action of Nip against oxidative stress-induced RGC death in vitro and in vivo. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
