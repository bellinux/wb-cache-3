5|$|A new species, Podoserpula miranda, was {{proposed}} in 2009 {{by a group}} of <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> mycologists for a species of that South Pacific archipelago. The name was provisional (not validly published), however, as the description was in French (the code of nomenclature mandates Latin) and lacked a required designation of a type specimen. It was validly published in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Kanak {{languages}} are extremely diverse, but French {{serves as the}} official language of New Caledonia. There are 28 distinct Kanak languages, {{as well as many}} dialects, out of the 1,200 Melanesian languages spoken throughout the Pacific. They are mutually incomprehensible. All {{are a part of the}} Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family. They all belong to the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> subgroup – except for Fagauvea, which is a Polynesian language.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 2015, the <b>new</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Sleeper {{contract}} started {{since the}} takeover from DB Schenker. 86101 in February 2015 was repainted into the <b>new</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Blue livery. From 31 March 2015, 86101 shunts the empty sleeper coaching stock into London Euston alongside 87002. After a lengthy refurbishment, 86401 joined the Caledonian Sleeper fleet on 8 August 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, New Caledonia {{became an}} {{overseas}} territory. By 1953, French citizenship {{had been granted}} to all <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians,</b> regardless of ethnicity.|$|R
50|$|There {{are about}} 500 <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> of Indian descent. They {{were known as}} Malabars and orinignally arrived in the 19th century from other French Territories, namely Réunion.|$|R
50|$|The accords set up {{a ten-year}} period of development. Institutional and {{economical}} provisions were made for the Kanak community. The <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> agreed not to raise the independence issue during this period.|$|R
25|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows (Corvus moneduloides) {{are perhaps}} the most studied corvid with respect to tool-use.|$|E
25|$|The {{currency}} {{was initially}} issued in three distinct forms for French Polynesia, New Caledonia and the New Hebrides. (See French Polynesian franc, <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> franc and New Hebrides franc.) Wallis and Futuna used the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> franc. Although the banknotes of the New Hebrides bore {{the name of}} the territory, the notes of French Polynesia and New Caledonia could only be distinguished by {{the name of the}} capitals (Papeete and Nouméa, respectively) on the reverse of the notes.|$|E
25|$|Arsenicin A is a {{naturally}} occurring organoarsenic analogue {{isolated from the}} <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> marine sponge Echinochalina bargibanti and is the first known polyarsenic organic compound.|$|E
5000|$|Hinduism {{originally}} came to New Caledonia with Indians {{who worked}} as indentured servants of European settlers of the island. There are about 500 <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> of Indian Tamil descent. They were known as Malabar and originally arrived in the 19th century from other French Territories, namely Réunion.|$|R
50|$|There {{are about}} 500 <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> of Indian Tamil descent. Like in Réunion, they {{were known as}} Malabars and orinignally arrived in the 19th century from other French Territories, namely Réunion. New Caledonia has several {{descendants}} of Tamils, whose parents intermarried with the local population in the last century.|$|R
50|$|Fiji topped Pool A {{after winning}} {{all three of}} their matches, {{including}} a 362 run win against New Caledonia in their opening match. Tonga, who also beat New Caledonia by more than 300 runs, joined them in the semi-finals. Vanuatu {{finished third in the}} group ahead of the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians.</b>|$|R
25|$|Les Nouvelles calédoniennes, a <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> newspaper, {{emphasised}} his relative youth (he was 37), {{the fact}} that he was a new voice in politics, and his apparent public support.|$|E
25|$|The road has an {{abundance}} of antique (or junk) shops along part of its length. There is also Bermondsey Square which holds an 'antique' market every Friday morning, usually known as Bermondsey Market, though officially as <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Market.|$|E
25|$|As of 2009, the IUCN {{recognises}} 19 {{species of}} parrot as extinct since 1600 (the date used to denote modern extinctions). This {{does not include}} species like the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> lorikeet, {{which has not been}} officially seen for 100 years, yet is still listed as critically endangered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adoption}} of the Kanak flag proved controversial. Some <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> argued for a completely new flag for New Caledonia, which would incorporate designs from both the French tricolor and the Kanak flags. Such new flag would aim to promote a [...] "common destiny" [...] for ethnic Kanaks and ethnic French residents in New Caledonia.|$|R
25|$|The {{play-off}} stages didn't go {{much better}} for the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians,</b> starting with a 231 run loss to the Cook Islands. They came up against Vanuatu in the seventh place play-off, and batted first, scoring 97. Their opponents reached this target inside 12 overs thanks to a quick-fire innings of 66 from Richard Tatwin to win by six wickets.|$|R
50|$|The name l'Avenir Ensemble {{reflects}} the party's desire to unite <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> of all ethnic groups (White Europeans, Melanesian Kanaks, Polynesian immigrants, etc.) into a shared future, rejecting the ethnic oppositions of the hitherto dominant parties of New Caledonia (White anti-independence parties vs. Kanak pro-independence parties). L'Avenir Ensemble believes in a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural future for New Caledonia.|$|R
25|$|New Caledonia {{is home to}} the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crow, a bird {{noted for}} its tool-making abilities, which rival those of primates. These crows are renowned for their {{extraordinary}} intelligence and ability to fashion tools to solve problems, and make the most complex tools of any animal yet studied apart from humans.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 {{expedition}} {{showed the}} commitment of France, {{in conjunction with the}} <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Association Salomon, to seek further answers about Lapérouse's mysterious fate. It received the patronage of the President of the French Republic as well as the support and co-operation of the French Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and the Ministry of Culture and Communication.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{low levels}} of {{domestic}} horticulture, fresh tropical fruits feature less highly in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> cuisine than in other Pacific nations, instead relying on rice, fish and root vegetables such as taro. One way this is frequently prepared is in a buried-oven-style feast, known as Bougna. Wrapped in banana leaves, the fish, taro, banana and other seafood are buried with hot rocks to cook, then dug up and eaten.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species name}} edulis means [...] "edible" [...] in Latin. Labillardiere wrote: [...] "Les habitans de la Nouvelle-Calédonie appellent nougui cette espèce d'araignée, que je désigne sous le nom d' aranea edulis (araignée que les Calédoniens mangent)." [...] (The {{inhabitants}} of New Caledonia call this spider [...] "nougui". I have described {{it under the}} name Aranea edulis, meaning spiders that the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> eat.) ...|$|R
5000|$|One of Lini's first {{foreign policy}} moves upon {{attaining}} office {{was to provide}} open encouragement for the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), the pro-independence movement in neighbouring New Caledonia, which remained a French territory. Lini described indigenous <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> as ni-Vanuatu's [...] "Melanesian brothers", and stated, {{on the basis of}} Melanesian solidarity, that they alone should determine the political future of New Caledonia.|$|R

25|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> soils contain about 25% of the world's nickel resources. The late-2000s {{recession}} has gravely affected the nickel industry, as the sector faced a significant drop in nickel prices (−31.0% year-on-year in 2009) {{for the second}} consecutive year. The fall in prices has led a number of producers to reduce or stop altogether their activity, resulting in a reduction of the global supply of nickel by 6% compared to 2008.|$|E
25|$|The taxonomic {{history of}} the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> members of Polyscias {{subgenus}} Arthrophyllum is complex. Ten valid species names and a nomen nudum {{have been published in}} Arthrophyllum for this group. Philipson recognized only three species, treating eight of the species names as synonyms for Arthrophyllum otopyrenum. Frodin and Govaerts treated five of these eight names as a fourth species, Arthrophyllum balansae. Lowry and Plunkett (2010) split Arthrophyllum balansae, transferring four of these names to Polyscias as part of Polyscias vieillardii. The fifth name, Arthrophyllum grandifolium, was transferred to Polyscias as Polyscias mackeei.|$|E
25|$|The New Caledonia {{football}} team began playing in 1950, and was admitted into FIFA, the international association of football leagues, in 2004. Prior to joining FIFA, New Caledonia held observer status with the Oceania Football Confederation, {{and became an}} official member of the OFC with its FIFA membership. They have won the South Pacific Games five times, most recently in 2007, and have placed third on two occasions in the OFC Nations Cup. Christian Karembeu is a prominent <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> former footballer. The under-17 team is currently {{a part of the}} FIFA under 17 world cup (2017).|$|E
50|$|In 1982, {{under the}} auspices of the <b>New</b> York <b>Caledonian</b> Club, <b>New</b> York State Governor Hugh Carey, and New York City Mayor Ed Koch {{declared}} 1 July 1982, as Tartan Day, a one-time celebration of the 200th anniversary of the repeal of the Act of Proscription of 12 August 1747, the law forbidding Scots to wear tartan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the Paterson Rangers is unknown, but they entered the Metropolitan Association Football League for the 1904-1905 season and on April 25, 1905 lost to the <b>New</b> York <b>Caledonians</b> in the semifinals of the New York State Cup. [...] In 1906, the Rangers joined the {{professional}} National Association Football League and remained in that league until 1915. No records for the Rangers exist after that year.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1973 the Caledonian Steam Packet Co. {{acquired}} most of {{the ships}} and routes of David MacBrayne Ltd and commenced joint Clyde and West Highland operations under the <b>new</b> name of <b>Caledonian</b> MacBrayne, with a combined headquarters at Gourock.|$|R
25|$|Ixerba {{has been}} {{assigned}} to different families over time. Traditionally it was regarded related to Roussea and Brexia and has been combined {{with them in the}} Brexiaceae. These three have been placed in different other famililies, such as the Escalloniaceae, but doubt remained about their proper placement. After genetic analysis showed that Ixerba was not very much related to either Roussea or Brexia, it was placed in the monogeneric family Ixerbaceae. However, further testing revealed that Ixerba was closely related to the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> genus Strasburgeria and it was assigned to the Strasburgeriaceae by the APG III in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Sport is catered for in Dunedin by the {{floodlit}} rugby and cricket venues of Forsyth Barr Stadium and University Oval, Dunedin respectively, the <b>new</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Ground {{football and}} athletics stadium near the University at Logan Park, the large Edgar Centre indoor sports centre, the Dunedin Ice Stadium, and numerous {{golf courses and}} parks. There are also the Forbury Park horseracing circuit {{in the south of}} the city and several others within a few kilometres. St Clair Beach is a well-known surfing venue, and the harbour basin is popular with windsurfers and kitesurfers. Dunedin has four public swimming pools: Moana Pool, Port Chalmers Pool, Mosgiel, and St Clair Salt Water Pool.|$|E
25|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows (Corvus moneduloides) are {{notable for}} their highly {{developed}} tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, {{then use the}} hooks to pull insect larvae from tree holes. Tools are engineered according to task and apparently also to learned preference. Recent studies revealed abilities to solve complicated problems, which suggests high level of innovation of a complex nature. Other corvids that have been observed using tools include the American crow, blue jay and green jay. Diversity in tool design among corvids suggests cultural variation. Again, great apes are the only other animals known to use tools in such a fashion.|$|E
40|$|On 11 May 2014, {{voters in}} New Caledonia {{went to the}} polls to elect representatives to three provincial {{assemblies}} and the national congress. The election results reaffirmed the division between supporters and opponents of independence, as <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> move towards a self-determination referendum scheduled before the end of 2018. The election results confirmed longstanding regional and political divisions. In the rural north and outlying Loyalty Islands, the FLNKS independence movement holds sway. In spite of a united mobilisation by a pro-independence coalition in the Southern Province, three competing anti-independence parties dominate the Southern assembly. The campaign highlighted issues that will dominate political debate in coming years: electoral reforms, economic and fiscal policy, the key role of nickel mining and competing alternatives to 'exit' the 1998 Noumea Accord. In the incoming congress, 29 conservative opponents of independence face 25 members of independence parties. This balance of forces in New Caledonia's political institutions and divisions within the loyalist camp means tension will be ongoing as the country moves closer to the scheduled referendum on self-determination - especially as France seeks to maintain its status as a midsized global power...|$|R
40|$|The {{repeal of}} l'indigénat in 1946 gave the Kanak all the rights {{associated}} with French citizenship. However, {{for many years}} afterwards, there was growing unrest that {{came to a head}} with les événements of the 1980 s, when the proindependence groups clashed violently with government forces. This violence led to the signing, first, of the Matignon Accords in 1988 and the Noumea Accord in 1998. The Noumea Accord has set in motion the gradual and irreversible transfer of administrative powers to the colony {{under the supervision of the}} United Nations Decolonization Programme, culminating in a referendum (by 2018) to determine ultimate independence from France. It is critically important that the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> arrive at a functional model for such an arrangement and so, predictably, the practicalities involved have stimulated much discussion at all levels of society. Narratives are an important resource, allowing the reader to better understand cultural values and problems. Using ideas derived from critical discourse analysis, this article examines the emerging discussions in the literature written since the signing of the Accord, focusing in particular on a selection of works by Kanak authors. 15 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The {{prisoner}} population {{could be}} divided into roughly 3 groups. The 'transported' were convicts sentenced under common law, ranging from 8 years up to life, for crimes ranging from physical and sexual assault to murder. These were mostly taken to the prison at Île Nou and worked {{on the construction of}} roads and buildings in the colony. Political prisoners, or the 'deported', made up the second group. Many of these participated in the Paris Commune of 1871, 4250 of whom were sent either to Île des Pins or Ducos, including Louise Michel and Henri Rochefort. After they were all granted amnesty in 1880, less than 40 families decided to stay in New Caledonia. Another group of 'deporteds' were participants in the Mokrani Revolt of 1871-72 in Algeria, the majority of whom decided to stay in New Caledonia following the granting of amnesty in 1895 and from whom the majority of Algerian <b>New</b> <b>Caledonians</b> in Bourail are descended. Recidivists, or the 'relegated', made up the third group, 3757 of whom were sent from 1885 onwards to New Caledonia, particularly to Île des Pins, Prony or Boulouparis. The 'transported' and 'relegated' stopped being brought to New Caledonia in 1897.|$|R
