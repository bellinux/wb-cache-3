This study supports the hypothesis that the optimal nutrient thresholds are intrinsically linked to the plant material.

30|$|Our {{results support}} the {{findings}} that removal or addition of litter to the forest floor significantly affects the decrease and increase of the dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (Park and Matzner 2003). More litter corresponds to more decomposition and as result more carbon and nitrogen production/accumulation in the soil. The other {{reason is that the}} N mineralization process and decomposition process varies from forest to forest depending on {{the quantity and quality of}} litter in the forest floor. Soil N and C are affected by anthropogenic and environmental changes which can be reduced by replacing species in the forest to retain N and carbon (Finzi et al. 1989). The live and dead parts of the coniferous and deciduous forest contained higher concentrations of soluble and total C and N and higher mineralization potentials than bare soil (Halvorson and Smith 2009). Litter is considered the most important factor when determining soil nutrient content. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>production</b> and availability depends largely on the litter.

This enables us to examine the balance between manure <b>nutrient</b> <b>production</b> and nutrient need measured by crop uptake at a farm level.

The {{vast majority of the}} counties that produce excess nitrogen have adequate land in the county to spread the manure at agronomic rates. Thus, proposed policies that focus on land application have the potential to limit manure nutrient movement to waterways in most areas, if properly managed.

There were about 5 percent of counties where the manure nitrogen production levels from confined animal production exceeded half the nitrogen assimilative capacity of all the cropland and pastureland in the county.

Here we provide a plausible breakdown of global agricultural and <b>nutrient</b> <b>production</b> by farm size, and also study the associations between farm size, agricultural diversity, and <b>nutrient</b> <b>production.</b> This analysis is crucial to design interventions that might be appropriately targeted to promote healthy diets and ecosystems {{in the face of}} population growth, urbanisation, and climate change. METHODS: We used existing spatially-explicit global datasets to estimate the production levels of 41 major crops, seven livestock, and 14 aquaculture and fish products. From overall production estimates, we estimated the production of vitamin A, vitamin B 12, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, calories, and protein. We also estimated the relative contribution of farms of different sizes to the production of different agricultural commodities and associated nutrients, as well as how the diversity of food production {{based on the number of}} different products grown per geographic pixel and distribution of products within this pixel (Shannon diversity index [H]) changes with different farm sizes. FINDINGS: Globally, small and medium farms (≤ 50 ha) produce 51 - 77 % of nearly all commodities and nutrients examined here. However, important regional differences exist. Large farms (> 50 ha) dominate production in North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, large farms contribute between 75 % and 100 % of all cereal, livestock, and fruit production, and the pattern is similar for other commodity groups. By contrast, small farms (≤ 20 ha) produce more than 75 % of most food commodities in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, south Asia, and China. In Europe, west Asia and north Africa, and central America, medium-size farms (20 - 50 ha) also contribute substantially to the production of most food commodities. Very small farms (≤ 2 ha) are important and have local significance in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, and south Asia, where they contribute to about 30 % of most food commodities. The majority of vegetables (81 %), roots and tubers (72 %), pulses (67 %), fruits (66 %), fish and livestock products (60 %), and cereals (56 %) are produced in diverse landscapes (H> 1 ∙ 5). Similarly, the majority of global micronutrients (53 - 81 %) and protein (57 %) are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes (H> 1 · 5). By contrast, the majority of sugar (73 %) and oil crops (57 %) are produced in less diverse ones (H≤ 1 · 5), which also account for the majority of global calorie production (56 %). The diversity of agricultural and <b>nutrient</b> <b>production</b> diminishes as farm size increases. However, areas of the world with higher agricultural diversity produce more nutrients, irrespective of farm size. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and <b>nutrient</b> <b>production</b> that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.

The {{goal of this}} work was to develop and evaluate a simple integrated lettuce and tilapia production system suitable for this region. The system consisted of a plant growing tray and an aerated fish tank, with water exchanged manually. A literature review suggested that plant nutrient requirements must be matched by fish <b>nutrient</b> <b>production.</b> A tray of 48 lettuce plants, Lactuca sativa (red sails variety of leaf lettuce), was provided a standard nutrient formulation and nutrient uptake was quantified over time. In a follow up trial, lettuce trays were provided modified nutrient formulations. Lettuce head weights were reduced when provided one fourth nutrients, one half nutrients, or one half potassium but not when provided one half calcium and magnesium or double nitrogen. These results suggested that the nutrient amounts observed to be taken up by lettuce were required for growth. Hybrid tilapia, Oreochromis sp., were grown in a 200 L aerated tank with 20 L of water removed and replaced with tap water daily. The nutrient amounts in the water removed daily were quantified as fish biomass and daily feed consumption increased. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>production</b> appeared adequate for a tray of 48 lettuce plants using 2. 3 [...] 2. 5 kg of tilapia consuming 39 [...] 53 g of feed/day.
