It is identified the nature of the balance of payments of the country, indicating a <b>net</b> <b>debtor</b> <b>position,</b> which leads to inherent deterioration of the international investment position. A small open economy of Armenia moves to a new phase of development, in the frame of the integration processes within the Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. One of the main characteristics of the Armenian economy vulnerability remains a negative balance in foreign trade, which continues to grow, despite the export growth.

40|$|The US {{international}} investment position today {{should in}} principle be equal to the sum of past current account balances (mostly deficits). However, this is by far not the case even {{taking into account the}} balancing item ‘errors and omissions’. Between 1982 and 2004, the US has accumulated a grand total of around $ 4. 5 trillion (thousand billion). (The sum of current account deficits has been about $ 1 trillion smaller than the amount of net sales of US assets {{to the rest of the}} world because of the anomaly in reinvested earning.) Despite this accumulation of deficits the US net international debtor position (IIP) has deteriorated ‘only’ by $ 2. 7 billion (and is now estimated – at the end of 2004, end 2005 figures are not yet available for the US IIP – at ‘only’ around $ 2. 5 trillion). This implies a total of ‘unearned’ gains to the US of around $ 1. 8 trillion during 22 years. The quite detailed data available for a somewhat shorter period (1989 - 2004) show that only a very small part of this sum, around 10 - 20 %, can be explained by exchange rate and stock market changes. One must thus conclude that the US has acted like a black hole for capital from the rest of the world: one can observe a large amount of investment flowing into the US, but after some time it disappears from the statistics (and foreign investment in the US that takes the form of FDI earns almost no return). The discrepancy arises for a simple reason: the flow data are based on actual flows of payments recorded in the balance of payments. By contrast, the stock data (on the US {{international investment position}}) are based on US surveys, which tend to miss out on US assets held by foreigners. This implies that it is likely that the true US <b>net</b> <b>debtor</b> <b>position</b> is significantly larger than officially reported...|$|E

40|$|The {{income account}} of the US balance of {{payments}} has so far remained in surplus because {{of a very large}} differential in reported earnings on direct investment – US firms seem to enjoy a much higher rate of return than foreign firms in the US. There is little difference in terms of the rate of dividend payments; the difference is due to what is called ‘reinvested earnings’ (earnings minus dividends). Foreign firms report almost no reinvested earnings on their direct investment in the US whereas US firms report substantial reinvested earnings from their direct investment abroad, on average over $ 100 billion more p. a. than foreign firms report on their US investment. This anomaly is probably due to the desire of foreign firms to minimise their US taxes, whereas US firms do not face tax liabilities if they report high foreign profits to the US authorities. The procedure used to generate the data for reinvested earnings thus has a built-in bias to improve the US current account and – over time – its international investment position. The true picture is likely to be much worse. Reinvested earnings appear in the balance of payments because returns from FDI are measured in a different way than returns from portfolio investment. Returns from FDI are calculated from a mix of firm-level accounting data and broad stock market indices to infer an average capital gain. This procedure will be misleading if, because of the different tax treatment they face, foreign controlled firm in the US report earnings on a different base than other US-owned firms. A more accurate method of measuring the returns from foreign direct investment in the US, by using the same procedure as for portfolio investment (i. e. using only stock market prices), leads to the result that the deficit of the US current account increases by over $ 100 billion per annum and the US <b>net</b> international <b>debtor</b> <b>position</b> worsens by over a trillion dollars. The latter amount is the sum that, if one believes the official statistics, foreign investors have been willing to forego compared to the alternative of investing in their home country...|$|R
40|$|As {{entities}} {{where the}} production process takes place, non financial corporations deserve full attention {{in the analysis of}} the real and financial accounts. However, the examination of the financial behaviour of non financial corporations is traditionally confined to their financing : thus, the Bank’s annual report generally only considers their liabilities. Yet the formation of financial assets by non financial corporations is a significant item of information, in both statistical and economic terms. The total financial assets held by non financial corporations in Belgium are considerable, as they far exceed the total financial assets of households. A study recently revealed the historically high level of financial asset formation by non financial corporations in the main industrialised countries, a factor which could help to explain the relatively low level of long-term interest rates. In recent years, Belgian non financial corporations have formed substantially more financial assets than their counterparts in the euro area. In 2005, the financial assets held by Belgian companies were – partly for that reason – almost double the financial assets, expressed in percentages of GDP, of non financial corporations in the euro area. However, this situation certainly does not indicate any risk aversion on the part of Belgian non financial corporations. In fact the liabilities side of their balance sheets also records growth of new financial liabilities in excess of the figure for non financial corporations in the euro area, so that – in terms of liabilities, too – the outstanding total in Belgium is comparatively much higher than the outstanding total in the euro area. This paradoxical situation of Belgian non financial corporations – the fact that they hold much more substantial assets {{while at the same time}} contracting significantly greater liabilities – is due to the fact that the Belgian non financial corporations sector includes coordination centres and non financial holding companies, i. e. undertakings acting, as it were, as financial intermediaries. If the coordination centres and non financial holding companies are excluded, the overall outstanding total gross assets and liabilities of Belgian non financial corporations reverts to a level very close to the figure for the euro area. Finally, in 2005 Belgian non financial institutions recorded an outstanding total of net liabilities amounting to around 100 p. c. of GDP, i. e. slightly more than the outstanding total for non financial corporations in the euro area. It is also apparent that the exclusion of the coordination centres and non financial holding companies has hardly any effect on Belgium’s <b>net</b> <b>debtor</b> <b>position,</b> confirming that these two types of institutions perform an intermediary function. Although it is not possible to isolate the coordination centres and non financial holding companies in the case of new transactions (flows), there is no reason to think that the effect would be any different : there would be a significant decline in the gross flows of new assets and liabilities, but that would have a negligible influence on the financial balance. That balance is very similar to the one for the euro area. flow of funds, corporate finance...|$|E

40|$|Global {{current account}} (“flow”) {{imbalances}} have narrowed significantly since their peak in 2006, and their configura-tion has changed markedly in the process. The imbalances {{that used to}} be the main concern—the large deficit in the United States and surpluses in China and Japan—have more than halved. But some surpluses, especially those in some European economies and oil exporters, remain large, and those in some advanced commodity exporters and major emerging market economies have since moved to deficit. This chapter argues that the reduction of large flow imbal-ances has diminished systemic risks to the global economy. Nevertheless, two concerns remain. First, the nature of the flow adjustment—mostly driven by demand compression in deficit economies or growth differentials related to the faster recovery of emerging market economies and commodity exporters after the Great Recession—has meant that in many economies, narrower external imbalances have come at the cost of increased internal imbalances (high unemployment and large output gaps). The contraction in these external imbalances is expected to last as the decrease in output due to lowered demand has likely been matched by a decrease in potential output. However, there is some uncertainty about the latter, and there is the risk that flow imbalances will widen again. Second, since flow imbalances have shrunk but not reversed, <b>net</b> creditor and <b>debtor</b> <b>positions</b> (“stock imbal-ances”) have widened further. In addition, weak growth has contributed to increases in the ratio of net external liabili-ties to GDP in some debtor economies. These two factors make some of these economies more vulnerable to changes in market sentiment. To mitigate these risks, debtor economies will ultimately need to improve their current account bal-ances and strengthen growth performance. Stronger external demand and more expenditure switching (from foreign to domestic goods and services) would help on both accounts. Policy measures to achieve both stronger and more balanced growth in the major economies, including in surplus econo-mies with available policy space, would also be beneficial...|$|R
