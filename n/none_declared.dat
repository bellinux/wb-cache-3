40|$|Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} zoonotic diseases. Antimicrobial therapy is an important tool in reducing both the incidence and mortality associated with Salmonella infections, but the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in poultry farms can lead to the emergence of resistance and inefficacy of antimicrobials. Moreover, transmission of the resistant strains to humans through food chain could be a menace to public health. This study was conducted to determine serogroup and antibiotic resistancepatterns of Salmonella isolates recovered from 25 broiler chicken farms in Ahvaz. All isolates were examined for serogroup using commercial antiserum, and for resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics in poultry (enrofloxacin, florfenicol, fosfomycin, lincospectin, sultrim and doxycycline) and humans (gentamicin, amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, cefalexin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The Salmonella isolates belonged to serogroups B (two isolates), C (three isolates) and D (45 isolates). Out of 50 isolates, 24 (48 %) were resistant to one or more antibiotics. All isolates were sensitive to florfenicol, sultrim, cephalexin and ceftriaxone. The highest and lowest rates of resistance were observed against lincospectin (36 %) and amoxiclav (2 %), respectively. The high prevalence of resistant salmonellae among broilers indicates that the administration of antimicrobial drugs has to be made with more caution.

40|$|Introduction The {{writing of}} {{prescriptions}} {{is an important}} aspect of medical practice. Since 2006, the Swiss authorities have decided to impose incentives to prescribe generic drugs. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the evolution of the outpatient prescription practice in our paediatric university hospital during 2 periods separated by 5 years; 2) to assess the writing quality of outpatient prescriptions during the same period. Materials & Methods Design: Copies of prescriptions written by physicians were collected twice from community pharmacies in the region of our hospital for a 2 -month period in 2005 and 2010. They were analysed according to standard criteria regarding both formal and pharmaceutical aspects. Drug prescriptions were classified as a) complete when all criteria for safety were fulfilled, b) ambiguous when there was a danger of a dispensing error because of one or more missing criteria, or c) containing an error. Setting: Paediatric university hospital. Main outcome measures: Proportion of generic drugs; outpatient prescription writing quality. Results: A total of 651 handwritten prescriptions were reviewed in 2005 and 693 in 2010. They contained 1570 drug prescriptions in 2005 (2. 4 ¬± 1. 2 drugs per patient) and 1462 in 2010 (2. 1 ¬± 1. 1). The most common drugs were paracetamol, ibuprofen, and sodium chloride. A higher proportion of drugs were prescribed as generic names or generics in 2010. Formal data regarding the physicians and the patients were almost complete, except for the patients' weight. Of the drug prescriptions, 48. 5 % were incomplete, 11. 3 % were ambiguous, and 3. 0 % contained an error in 2005. These proportions rose to 64. 2 %, 15. 5 % and 7. 4 % in 2010, respectively. Discussions, Conclusion This study showed that physicians' prescriptions comprised numerous omissions and errors with minimal potential for harm. Computerized prescription coupled with advanced decision support is eagerly awaited. Disclosure of Interest <b>None</b> <b>Declare...</b>|$|R
40|$|Poster presentationThe {{abstract}} can {{be viewed}} at [URL] theme: The Intervertebral Disc - from Degeneration to Therapeutic Motion PreservationIntroduction Schmorl nodes of the thoracolumbar region {{have been associated with}} the presence and severity of disc degeneration in adults. The etiology of Schmorl nodes remains precarious; however, a unique multilevel phenotype of ‚Äúkissing‚Äù nodes seems to suggest a developmental origin. The neurocentral synchondrosis (NCS) are cartilaginous growth plates near the neural arch ossification centers in a growing vertebrae that may play a direct {{role in the development of}} endplate abnormalities, such as Schmorl nodes. This study assessed the NCSin pediatric spines to raise discussion of a developmental component of Schmorl nodes. Materials and Methods A retrospective imaging study of pediatric patients at a single institute assessed over a 5 -year period (age range: 0 - 10 years) was performed. Patients with spinal disorders (e. g., scoliosis) were excluded. A total of 102 patients (57 males and 45 females) and a total of 113 sets of MRI images were reviewed. The thoracolumbar regions (T 12 -S 1) were evaluated. Sagittal T 1 - and T 2 -weighted imageswere assessed for the presence or absence of the NCS, defined as a hypointense vertical line located between the vertebral body anteriorly and the posterior arch. The presence of Schmorl nodes was also noted. Results NCS was noted in 46 % of the MRIs. No statistically significant difference in the disappearance of the NCS between different age groups (p ¬º 0. 063) or gender (p ¬º 0. 706) was found. The NCS was noted to be completely fused at the midpoint of the vertebrae. Indentation of the vertebral endplates resembling Schmorl node at many of the rostral and caudal ends of the unfused NCS were observed (Fig. 1). Conclusion The significance of further characterizing the nature of NCS closure may lie in potential associations with failure of complete closure with endplate abnormalities, such as Schmorl nodes. Our MRI study provides a foundation that a development etiology of Schmorl nodes exists. Disclosure of Interest <b>None</b> <b>declare...</b>|$|R
