40|$|Patient dignity is {{a complex}} yet central phenomenon. Disrespect for dignity can mean {{retention}} of sick role, loss of self-care and control, decreased participation and therefore influence healing. At the same time, nurses {{have an obligation to}} respect dignity, and patients expect it. In clinical practice, with the focus on efficiency and economy, dignity can be compromised. The surgical patient may be particularly vulnerable to loss of dignity, when focus is solely on surgical procedure, efficiency, and productivity. The aim of the article is to describe the characteristics of the importance of dignity perceived by four surgical patients at a university hospital in Denmark. The hermeneutic phenomenological approach of Van Manen is used to analyse and interpret data collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews. The interviews explored the lived experience with two women and two men who had undergone a surgical intervention in a Danish vascular surgery department. The thematic analysis led to the basic theme: ‘‘To be an important person’ ’ illustrated by the themes: ‘‘Being a co-player,’ ’ ‘‘Over exposure,’ ’ and ‘‘To swallow the bitter pill. ’ ’ The findings provide a better understanding of patient’s perspective of dignity, which is characterized by a complex interaction of several factors.

Chemotherapy-induced hair loss (alopecia) is a public consequence of the non-selective action of specific antineoplastic agents on healthy tissue. The literature demonstrates a lack of research on hair loss. Nursing studies have focused on efforts to prevent hair loss or measure the impact of hair loss using body-image instruments. The {{purpose of this study was}} the detailed examination of the meanings of hair loss over time in a sample of women receiving alopecia-inducing cancer chemotherapy. ^ A qualitative descriptive design using a semi-structured multiple interview format examined the meaning of hair loss over time. A purposive sample of ten women receiving alopecia-inducing chemotherapeutic agents at a metropolitan teaching hospital was used. Each woman was interviewed prior to hair loss, at the time of hair loss, and two-three months after initial hair loss. The specific research questions described the meanings of hair loss in the lives of women receiving alopecia-inducing agents. Supporting questions explored the status of hair loss among sources of cancer-related distress, the role of past experiences and expectations, and the role of other people and social demands on the experiences. Data analysis was based upon the words, metaphors, and language patterns used by participants in describing their feelings and experiences. ^ Findings reflect the meaning and real substantive losses associated with both the threat and actual hair loss. Symptom responses are shaped by personal history, experiences as well as meanings of cancer images and one 2 ̆ 7 s hair. Analysis of the findings reflect three processes: affective anticipation rehearsal, confrontation of the hair losses, and management of the hair loss experience. The coping outcomes may be positive, regaining one 2 ̆ 7 s stride, or negative, not regaining one 2 ̆ 7 s stride. The findings are congruent with a number of theoretical frameworks, such as Lazarus, Benner, Mishel and Wright. The findings support both the significance of hair loss and its amenability to <b>nursing</b> <b>treatment</b> approaches.

40|$|Background: Australians seeking {{health care}} from any public {{hospital}} {{have the right}} to non-discriminatory safe medical assessment, treatment and nursing care. The literature clearly indicates that people presenting to public hospitals with acute alcohol- or drug-related conditions are at risk of dying by being denied medical and <b>nursing</b> <b>treatment.</b> This denial of treatment is on the basis that their presumed condition is solely drug- and alcohol-related. There is often even a greater risk for Aboriginal people who present for treatment. This literature comprises reports from coronial inquiries, police incidents, safety audits, and critical incidents in health services, and anecdotal information from specialist drug and alcohol nurses. Such violation of this vulnerable population's right to safe health care has often resulted in suicide and other preventable deaths, disability and exacerbation of physical and mental illness. Method: A critique was conducted of recent available Australian 'grey' literature comprising coronial and police reports, local critical incident alert systems in hospital reports and anecdotal information from specialist drug and alcohol nurses associated with three case studies. Findings: The reports revealed that some of the people seeking treatment for alcohol-, drug-and mental health-related crises, who were denied treatment, subsequently died in police custody, shelters, home, public places or elsewhere. The evidence showed that many who died did so because medical and nursing staff presumed they were just 'alcoholic' or 'drunk' and therefore were not seriously injured or ill. Commonly, stereotyping and racism were found to influence a health professional's decision to refuse treatment, and their unethical practice was directly linked to deaths because of missed or wrong diagnoses and poor standards of nursing assessment. Several cases, all occurring recently in South Australian country areas, were identified through a critical incident alert system and re-confirmed by local specialist drug and alcohol nurses who were aware of each case. One case was an Aboriginal man and two others were non-Aboriginal men. All were relatively young. Each man was denied proper medical assessment, treatment and safe nursing care by staff in the hospitals in which they sought help. As a consequence, the Aboriginal man developed delirium tremens requiring medical retrieval by air to a major teaching hospital for intensive care. The other two men required extensive support and intervention due to acute mental illnesses that co-existed with their drug use. Discussion: This review offers important information from which to build strategies to remediate poor policies, practices, and attitudes. Hopefully, these strategies may assist to prevent similar situations occurring in the future. Jacky Talmet, Charlotte de Crespigny, Lynette Cusack, Peter Athanaso...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cytotoxic {{chemotherapy}} destroys {{not only}} cancer cells but also normal healthy cells, {{leading to the}} occurrence of multiple side effects, {{the nature and extent}} of which depend on several factors. Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore the type and the intensity of the side effects and symptoms produced by anticancer agents. Method: The study sample comprised 153 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy who were attending a one-day clinic for the administration of their chemotherapeutic agents in a private hospital in Athens from January 2007 to January 2008. Data collection was conducted using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). Statistical analysis was performed using x -test of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 16. The statistical significance level adopted was p< 0. 05. Results: Of the 153 cancer patients who participated, 49 % were men and 51 % women. Regarding gender differences, men more frequently reported experiencing intense pain (p= 0. 031), intense nausea (p= 0. 046) and vomiting (p= 0. 010), respiratory symptoms, (p= 0. 003), memory problems (p= 0. 009), severe diarrhoea (p= 0. 001) and severe constipation (p= 0. 001), symptoms which significantly affected their ability to walk (p= 0. 004). Conversely, women reported feeling more intense sadness than men (p= 0. 007). Compared to postmenopausal women, perimenopausal female patients reported experiencing more severe pain (p= 0. 004), fatigue (p= 0. 013), nausea (p= 0. 001),anxiety (p= 0. 016), respiratory symptoms (p≤ 0. 001), anorexia (p= 0. 005), sadness (p≤ 0. 001) and diarrhoea (p= 0. 003). These symptoms exerted a negative effect on the perimenopausal women's general activity (p= 0. 001), mood (p= 0. 003), their work and housekeeping (p= 0. 002), interpersonal relationships (p= 0. 023), walking (p= 0. 003) and their capacity to enjoy life (p= 0. 003). Regarding the specific type of anticancer treatment, patients undergoing chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy more frequently reported mild pain (p= 0. 031) and intense nausea, anxiety and anorexia (p= 0. 042, p= 0. 022, p= 0. 021, respectively). Finally, regarding the type of the chemotherapy regime received, those patients receiving taxane-based regimes more often reported intense anorexia (p= 0. 032), a sense of dryness of the mouth (p= 0. 027) and severe cough (p= 0. 001). Conversely, patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy treatment reported memory deficits of greater severity (p= 0. 027). Conclusions: The most frequent side effects of chemotherapy that were reported by the respondents in the present study included fatigue, mouth dryness, nausea, constipation, anorexia, vomiting, pain, sadness and anxiety.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is: Specifics of nursing care of a child patient with oncologic pain. Childrens pain is a {{phenomenon}} surrounded by many myths and false information. It is also not sufficiently assessed and treated and often bagatelized by both nurses and doctors. Nurses play irreplaceable role in pain treatment, they are with the child patient more frequently then the doctor and are in close touch with the childs parents. The care of a suffering child is a serious task in <b>nursing.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of a patient in pains requires a complex, holistic approach. Nurses, even if they diagnose pain properly, do not set an adequate nursing care plan and do not carry it out. Nurses have to defend interests of the sick child and must not let him/her suffer. The data was obtained by quantitative and qualitative research. The quantitative research {{was carried out by}} the technique of anonymous questionnaire. The questionnaire was made for the parents of children with oncologic disease. The qualitative research was carried out by the technique of semi-structured in-depth interview. The research sample consisted of nurses working at the Department of childrens oncology One of the aims of this thesis was to outline the problems in nursing care of a child patient with oncologic pain {{from the point of view}} of the parents. We observed if the parents had been informed about their childs pain, if they know what symptoms they should watch in their child, if they know all the aspects of pain to be assessed and treatment methods to relieve the pain and also how nurses respond to their childs pain. For this aim, a following hypothesis has been set forth: The parents of children patients with oncologic pain are educated about the possibilities of nursing care focused on relieving the pain. This hypothesis was confirmed by statistic testing. Another aim of this thesis was to find out the specifics of nursing care of a child patient with oncologic pain. Nurses think that the specifics of nursing care of a child patient with oncologic pain are not different from any other care of a child in pains. They just state that an oncologic disease is associated with pains caused by the disease itself or by diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Therefore they consider a specific feature the fact that the pain is observed more intensively and the staff is more precise in relieving the pain. It is obvious from the research that it would be effective for both parties, both for the nurses and the parents, to use educational materials on pain intended for them. I suppose that if there were such materials available, the parents would not need to contact nurses repeatedly. There was also a positive finding in the research that 92. 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{chronic renal failure}} and {{cannulation}} of permanent venous accesses in patients treated at haemodialysis centres is a topical and widespread problem of these days. According to generally accessible resources the incidence of terminal stage of renal failure, and thus the necessity to treat a patient by means of elimination methods, is very high, it reaches four individuals per thousand inhabitants according to the statistics. It is obviously a widespread nursing problem. The theoretical part of the thesis is divided into a summary and description of the present situation in chronic renal failure, particularly a brief insight into the chronic renal failure and its causes and syndromes. It also deals with {{the topic of the}} present treatment possibilities with stress on patient treatment at nephrologic outpatient clinics and in haemodialysis centres. The next chapter of the thesis describes the development from haemodialysis history up to the present advanced elimination methods. The present elimination methods bring the necessity of functional provision of venous access, particularly cannulation of AV fistulas, it is a very frequent nursing operation provided by nurses treating chronically affected patients at haemodialysis centres. This chapter is concluded by general knowledge of the techniques of cannulation of permanent venous accesses, possible occurrence of complications during the cannula penetration itself in relation to the physical phase of <b>nursing</b> <b>treatment</b> about patients with chronic renal failure. The practical part of the thesis was aimed at discovering or possible confirmation of the hypotheses discussed in the theoretical part. The practical research was based on searching for problems among dialyzed patients related to the permanent venous access, on finding the approach of nurses working at dialysis centres to cannulation of permanent accesses and on mapping the access of patients with permanent venous access to nurses with short time experience at a dialysis centre. Research questions were determined for this purpose and were processed within qualitative research into case reports upon depth interviews with nurses working at the dialysis centres of České Budějovice Hospital, Český Krumlov Hospital and Písek Hospital and their patients. The research data were processed into charts, where responses from patients and those from nurses were assessed separately. Occurrence frequency of the individual answers was particularly monitored in the individual output tables, however the responses were not processed by means of standard statistic methods because of the chosen methodology and thus a low number of respondents, but the output data served for drawing conclusions and preparing recommendations for application of nursing methods. The thesis conclusion summarizes the obtained knowledge and recommends possible procedures of solving the problems of cannulation of permanent venous accesses in patients with chronic renal failure treated at haemodialysis centres...|$|E

The nurse appeared to resent every new addition to the nursery, and neglected the second son, Bertie, later King George VI, {{to the point where}} he became ill as a result. The head nurse had originally been a nursemaid to The Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, and earned a good reference. However, when Lalla expressed her concerns, it was revealed that the woman was childless after her husband deserted her, and was therefore suffering from a warped and frustrated maternal instinct. She was promptly dismissed in 1897 and Lalla was appointed in her place.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical groundwork Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP {{from now}} on) is {{nowadays}} {{referred to as}} the golden standard in diagnostics and treatment of bile duct and pancreas diseases. At the same time it is regarded as the most reliable method of modern medicine in diagnostics of most common oncogenic diseases of pancreas. This examination combines endoscopic diagnostics with X-ray screening and it is unique thanks to the direct display of bile and pancreas ducts. Final picture is made by probing of Vater papillae filled by a contrastive liquid. Other merit consists of completing eventual therapy that follows the diagnostic ERCP. Disadvantages of this examination are complications that may arise already when probing or after a certain period of time. Therefore it is essential to consider each ERCP procedure carefully. Nursering ERCP at the endoscopy section {{as well as at the}} ward block of the gastrointestinal department bears its particularities. The priority at the endoscopic section is to employ manually and technically competent nurses skilled in ERCP so they can assist the gastrointestinalist properly. The nurses must be also able to establish contact with the patient to guide him through the examination, using professional skills. Exactly the nurses moderate possible concerns of the examined person. Communication at the ward block is crucial as well ? the nurses explain particularities of the treatment and instruct the patient in basic rules of hospitalisation. They also must be professionally skilled to care for patients after ERCP. Goals of the thesis The aim of this thesis is to monitor particularities of nursing ERCP at the endoscopic section of the gastrointestinal department and to learn how the general treatment of ERCP patients is carried out at the ward block. Qualitative methodology was used for the empirical part of the thesis. Data were collected by interviewing and hidden observations. Results The research survey indicated that ERCP examination <b>nursing</b> <b>treatment</b> bears its particularities that are well known and reflected by nurses at the endoscopy section. Patients confirm that the skills of nurses minimize their stress when undergoing the treatment. The survey indicated that an ERCP examination should be assisted by a nurse with not only technical and manual skills but also empathic and anticipating qualities in order to react appropriately without confusion. Nurses should be able to explain the treatment to the patient properly and to create a comfortable ambience. The survey also indicates that nurses actively seek for courses to keep their knowledge up to date. Particular complications are managed very well by the nurses, they are familiar with specific complications and are always prepared and able to provide the patients adequate nursing. Nursing at the ward block is also at high level in the field of knowledgeableness when informing patients or preparing arrangements and regimes. The patients themselves are satisfied with the overall care after the ERCP examination. The hidden observations show that the nursing after ERCP examination follows the literature properly. Pleasant surprise was that nurses at the ward block of the gastrointestinal department fully implement the five parts of nursing process ? from reviewing the health status of the patient in the beginning to their final evaluation, and that they concurrently create up-to-date nursing diagnoses...|$|E
40|$|Theory {{background}} Compression therapy (CT) is an efficient, {{easily accessible}} and simple <b>nursing</b> <b>treatment</b> {{most frequently used}} in patient with chronic venous insufficiency and the consequently occurring venous leg ulcers. These occur often in still mobile elderly. In CT an elastic garment is applied around the leg causing increased blood circulation which helps to decrease swelling, improve venous return, narrow enlarged blood-vessels, contradict insufficient function of venous valves and promotes wound healing. Every nurse should possess the skill of correctly applying the bandage and suitably explaining {{the significance of the}} treatment to the patient. All depends on the mutual collaboration between doctor, nurse and patient. It is necessary for the nurse to be manually skilful and have sufficient knowledge on the topic of CT. Unfortunately this treatment is often underestimated by health care practitioners, especially in connection to chronic wound healing. Aim of thesis The first research aim consists of mapping the effectivity of compressional therapy for treatment of chronic wounds, where we focus on the degree to which CT helps the process. The second aim is to find out about the influence on correctly conducted technical approach to CT regarding wound healing, where the question is how correct technique of CT influences wound healing. Used methods Qualitative research was used for this thesis in the form of in-depth interviews. The majority of the interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed; the rest was transcribed directly by hand and paraphrased. First research group consisted of respondents with chronic wounds undergoing compression therapy. Second research group was comprised of nurses who treat wounds and use compression therapy as a part of treatment. Results Answers obtained during the interviews were analysed by the pen and paper method by open coding. Nine categories resulted from this analysis. The important finding are: education, its content and the way it is conducted as well as the instruction the nurse gives on applying the bandage are most significant together with positive reaction from the patient regarding protecting the wound and releasing pain. Materials for wound treatment are selected according to necessary criteria from a wide offer of products. The technique is conducted according to individual given steps based on the condition of the wound and with suitably chosen materials. The procedure steps must be correctly followed from beginning to end. The positive influence on wound healing is manifested by increased blood supply to the limb, better blood circulation, decrease of swelling and faster wound healing. The results show that nurses agree CT is an irreplaceable supporting treatment of venous insufficiency and leg ulcers. The patient learns about the effect of CT seeing the improvement in wound healing, feeling swelling decrease and by having the wound treated and bandaged by the nurse. The influence of CT on quality of life is connected to bio-psycho-social side with both positive and negative effects on the patient.. Conclusion Due to the time demanding treatment of wound healing, compression therapy method is very beneficial for the patient. It is beneficial also for the nurse as if conducted correctly and consistently, it gives very good results over which both the patient and the nurse can feel satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Current situation: Even at {{the present}} time of the 21 st century, decubitus is still {{considered}} to be a serious health complication which attacks all age groups of patients and reduce their quality of life (Boughen, 2012). Aims: The main aim of the research was {{to find out if the}} <b>nursing</b> <b>treatment</b> of patients who are at risk of pressure ulcer development or patients suffering bedsores in the Czech Republic is comparable to the treatment provided to similarly ill patients in Germany. Procedure: In order to find out necessary data, the quantitative research method was selected, during which an anonymous questionnaire both in Czech and German languages was issued and consequently submitted to general stuff nurses working at standard hospital departments. Research area: During the research survey, the general stuff nurses working in internal, surgery and rehabilitation departments in three Czech hospitals and two German hospitals. Results: The survey results showed that in the Czech Republic the Norton Scale for predicting the pressure ulcer risk is used most often, while in Germany the Braden Scale is most frequent method. The respondents, however, are equally convinced that regular inspections of skin as well as active searching for causation factors are far more suitable and helpful. Moreover, the survey revealed that the German colleagues determine the risk of developing bedsores by using the scale more frequently compared to the nurses in the Czech Republic. Significant differences in statistics were obvious in the frequency of the individual treatment interventions, especially in the areas of turning and repositioning the patient according to Bobath concept, self-dependence training, the skin assessment, as well as in the area of education. The research results showed the fact that Czech nurses statistically far more often use antiducubitus tools and materials, which are considered unsuitable or are not recommended by foreign guidelines. It was as well obvious from the research survey that the Czech nurses use compensational tools and devices when treating their patients more often compared to German hospitals. The survey results further showed that the choice of local therapeutic material used in particular working places vary considerably. While there is a more numerous utilization of materials containing silver and Tender Wet hydro-active super absorb cushions in the Czech Republic, stuff nurses in Germany prefer transparent polyurethane covers, secondary absorbing covers and polyurethane foams. Conclusions and suggestions for the practice: As far as the material availability is concerned, we are still far behind the advanced countries. However, we excel in quality as well as in the professional qualification of the nursing stuff. Prevention measures in the area of pressure ulcers are on the same level. Suggested changes and recommendations are: Suitable choice of the equipment, tools and devices. Immediately start with the self-dependence training within the rehabilitation treatment exercises and to use suitable compensational aids and utilities. It is as well advisable to create an individual body movement plan. To engage the whole multi-discipline team in the treating process for the patient. To educate the patient correctly. To ensure precise treatment documentation. Not to focus only on the assessment scale for prediction pressure ulcer risk but to carry out regular inspections of skin and search for the causation factors actively. To carry out the fading hyperaemia test in practice. Not to confuse sitting in a wheelchair and mobilisation. Verify and legalise the recommended procedures with the support of audits on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment...|$|E
40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} {{performance of}} a simplified algorithm and treatment instructions for emergency triage assessment and treatment (ETAT) of children presenting to hospital in developing countries.  METHODS—All infants aged 7 days to 5 years presenting to an {{accident and emergency department}} were simultaneously triaged and assessed by a nurse and a senior paediatrician. Nurse ETAT assessment was compared to standard emergency advanced paediatric life support (APLS) assessment by the paediatrician. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated and appropriateness of <b>nurse</b> <b>treatments</b> was evaluated.  RESULTS—The ETAT algorithm as used by nurses identified 731 / 3837 patients (19. 05 %); 98 patients (2. 6 %) were classified as needing emergency treatment and 633 (16. 5 %) as needing priority assessment. Sensitivity was 96. 7 % with respect to APLS assessment, 91. 7 % with respect to all patients given priority by the paediatrician, and 85. 7 % with respect to patients ultimately admitted. Specificity was 90. 6 %, 91. 0 %, and 85. 2 %, respectively. <b>Nurse</b> administered <b>treatment</b> was appropriate in 94 / 102 (92. 2 %) emergency conditions.  CONCLUSIONS—The ETAT algorithm and treatment instructions, when carried out by nurses after a short specific training period, performed well as a screening tool to identify priority cases and as a treatment guide for emergency conditions. ...|$|R
