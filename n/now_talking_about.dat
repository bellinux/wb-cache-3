'Edmund and his wife Catherine'--'Charles Edmund and his wife Florence'--'Maurice Edmund and his wife Dorothy.' Clara had set her foot down against 'Stanley and his wife Clara' being in the fourth; her soul was above ploughs, and she, of course, intended to be buried at Becket, as Clara, dowager Lady Freeland, for her efforts {{in regard to the}} land. Felix, who had a tendency to note how things affected other people, watched Derek's inspection of these memorials and marked that they excited in him no tendency to ribaldry. The boy, indeed, could hardly be expected to see in them what Felix saw--an epitome of the great, perhaps fatal, change that had befallen his native country; a record of the beginning of that far-back fever, whose course ran ever faster, which had emptied country into town and slowly, surely, changed the whole spirit of life. When Edmund Moreton, about 1780, took the infection disseminated by the development of machinery, and left the farming of his acres to make money, that thing was done which they were all <b>now</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> trying to undo, with their cries of: [...] "Back to the land!

Back to well-fed countrymen who could not read, with Common rights, and a kindly feeling for old 'Moretons,' who had a kindly feeling for them!" [...] Back to all that? A dream! Sirs! A dream! There was nothing for it now, but--progress! Progress! On with the dance! Let engines rip, and the little, squash-headed fellows with them!

This paper provides a brief overview of regional transport issues in the Tirana metropolitan area and in the Tirana-Durrës corridors.
