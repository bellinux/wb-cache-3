40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences. The aim of the analysis is to recognize biologically important sites, i. e. the coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>DNA</b> sequence. We introduce a novel algorithm which uses constructive induction to perform classification tasks. Each attribute <b>of</b> a <b>DNA</b> sequence {{is based on the}} definition of certain pattern. The pattern construction problem is defined as a search task in the space of all possible patterns. We briefly discuss possible application of the algorithm to domains different than DNA analysis, where processing of datastream is required. 1...|$|R
40|$|The entire {{mitochondrial}} genome of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) was sequenced {{and compared}} with that of Arabidopsis thaliana. The 221 853 bp genome contains 34 protein-coding genes, three rRNA genes and 17 tRNA genes. This gene content is almost identical to that of Arabidopsis. However the rps 14 gene, which is a pseudo-gene in Arabidopsis, is intact in rapeseed. On the other hand, five tRNA genes are missing in rapeseed compared to Arabidopsis, although the set of mitochondrially encoded tRNA species is identical in the two Cruciferae. RNA editing events were systematically investigated {{on the basis of the}} sequence of the rapeseed mitochondrial genome. A total of 427 C to U conversions were identified in ORFs, which is nearly identical to the number in Arabidopsis (441 sites). The gene sequences and intron structures are mostly conserved (more than 99 % similarity for protein-coding regions); however, only 358 editing sites (83 % of total editings) are shared by rapeseed and Arabidopsis. Non-coding regions are mostly divergent between the two plants. One-third (about 78. 7 kb) and two-thirds (about 223. 8 kb) of the rapeseed and Arabidopsis mitochondrial genomes, respectively, cannot be aligned with each other and most of these regions do not show any homology to sequences registered in the DNA databases. The results of the comparative analysis between the rapeseed and Arabidopsis mitochondrial genomes suggest that higher plant mitochondria are extremely conservative with respect to coding sequences and somewhat conservative with respect to RNA editing, but that <b>non-coding</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> plant mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> are extraordinarily dynamic with respect to structural changes, sequence acquisition and/or sequence loss...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{simulate}} {{the evolution of}} mutator strains using the aevol simulator. These strains show a striking resistance to mutational burden. Analysis of their genomes show that this resistance is obtained through two different mechanisms: contraction <b>of</b> the coding <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the genome (directly reducing the burden) and expansion <b>of</b> the <b>non-coding</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the genome (undirectly favoring the reproduction of the best individuals) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} thought that {{evolution}} {{is a slow}} process. During ecological changes in the environment, however, evolution can happen very fast. One {{of the reasons for}} this could be the role of new genes that are recruited during that adaptation. DIETHARD TAUTZ pursues the theory that these new genes come out <b>of</b> the so-called <b>non-coding</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the genome. He is interested in studying the fraction of bioactive molecules that come out of random sequences. So far, this explanation has been thought unlikely but, as he explains in this video, synthesizing random sequences and using bacteria as a test system his research group found bioactive molecules in them. This suggests that during fast adaptation processes new genes are recruited from this background of genes in the <b>non-coding</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the genome. This has important implications for our understanding of how adaptation works and offers great potential for the use of these bioactive molecules for medical and pharmaceutical purposes...|$|R

40|$|The <b>non-coding</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> our genome {{contains}} sequence motifs {{that can}} control gene transcription over distance.

We argue transcriptional control over distance can be understood when considering action {{in the context of}} the folded genome. Genome topology is expected to differ between individual cells, and this may cause variegated expression.

50|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} tandemly repeated (i.e. adjacent) DNA motifs that range in length {{from two to}} five nucleotides, and are typically repeated 5-50 times. For example, the sequence TATATATATA is a dinucleotide microsatellite, and GTCGTCGTCGTCGTC is a trinucleotide microsatellite (with A being Adenine, G Guanine, C Cytosine, and T Thymine). Repeat units of four and five nucleotides {{are referred to as}} tetra- and pentanucleotide motifs, respectively. Microsatellites are distributed throughout the genome. Many are located in <b>non-coding</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the human genome and therefore do not produce proteins, but they can also be located in regulatory regions and within the coding region.|$|R

However, a lack of efficient means to assay sufficient numbers of SNPs in non-model organisms has prevented their widespread use for conservation-related applications.

40|$|Approximately 40 human {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} expansion of repeat sequences. These expansions can reside within coding or <b>non-coding</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the genes, affecting the host gene function. The presence of such expansions results {{in the production of}} toxic RNA and/or protein or causes transcriptional repression and silencing of the host gene. Although the molecular mechanisms of expansion {{diseases are}} not well understood, mounting evidence suggests that transcription through expanded repeats plays an essential role in disease pathology. The presence of an expansion can affect RNA polymerase transcription, leading to dysregulation of transcription-associated processes, such as RNA splicing, formation of RNA/DNA hybrids (R-loops), production of antisense, short non-coding and bidirectional RNA transcripts. In the present review, we summarize current advances in this field and discuss possible roles of transcriptional defects in disease pathology...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{tremendous}} {{advances in}} the field of genomics, the amount and function <b>of</b> the large <b>non-coding</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the genome in higher organisms remains poorly understood. Here we report an observation, made for 37 fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes, which indicates that eukaryotes require a certain minimum amount <b>of</b> non-coding <b>DNA</b> (ncDNA). This minimum increases quadratically with the amount <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> located in exons. Based on a simple model of the growth of regulatory networks, we derive a theoretical prediction of the required quantity of ncDNA and find it to be in excellent agreement with the data. The amount of additional ncDNA (in basepairs) which eukaryotes require obeys Ndef = 1 / 2 (Nc / Np) (Nc - Np), where Nc is the amount <b>of</b> exonic <b>DNA,</b> and Np is a constant of about 10 Mb. This value Ndef corresponds to a few percent of the genome in Homo sapiens and other mammals, and up to half the genome in simpler eukaryotes. Thus our findings confirm that eukaryotic life depends on a substantial fraction of ncDNA and also make a prediction of the size of this fraction, which matches the data closely.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{associated with}} disease often appears in <b>non-coding</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the genome. Understanding the {{mechanisms by which}} this phenomenon leads to disease is necessary to translate results from genetic association studies to the clinic. Assigning function {{to this type of}} variation is notoriously difficult because the human genome harbours a complex regulatory landscape with a dizzying array of transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as enhancers that have unpredictable, promiscuous and context-dependent behaviour. In this Review, we discuss how technological advances have provided increasingly detailed information on genome folding; for example, genome folding forms loops that bring enhancers and target genes into close proximity. We also now know that enhancers function within topologically associated domains, which are structural and functional units of chromosomes.

40|$|The {{production}} rate of gene expression data is noth-ing less than astounding. However, {{with the benefit}} of hindsight we can assert that, since we completely ignored the <b>non-coding</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the transcriptome, we spent the last decade to study cell mechanisms hav-ing few data in our hands. In this scenario, microR-NAs, which are key post-trascriptional regulators, de-serve special attention. Given the state of knowledge about their biogenesis, mechanisms of action and the numerous experimentally validated target genes, miRNAs are also gradually appearing in the formal pathway representations such as KEGG and Reac-tome maps. However, the number of miRNAs anno-tated in pathway maps are very few and pathway analyses exploiting this new regulatory layer are still lacking. To fill these gaps, we present ‘micrographite’ a new pipeline to perform topological pathway analy-sis integrating gene and miRNA expression profiles.

We used the kinetic approach, proposed earlier by us, to measure a relative amount <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> in the comet tails as a function of time in the presence of different concentrations of chloroquine, a widely used intercalator. Results. We have shown that, at given small concentrations, intercalation of chloroquine strongly facilitates the comet tail formation.
