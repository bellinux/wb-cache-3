Objectives: This study compares {{the effects of}} nonlinear periodized exercise (NLPE) training used in athletes to traditional endurance and progressive resistance (EPR) training in patients with severe COPD. Methods: A total of 110 patients with severe COPD (FEV 1 32 % predicted) were randomized to EPR or NLPE. Exercise training was performed three times per week for 10 weeks. The primary outcomes were cycling endurance time and health-related quality of life using the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire. The difference in change between EPR and NLPE was assessed using linear mixed-effects modeling. Measurements and Main Results: NLPE resulted in significantly greater improvements in cycling endurance time compared with EPR. The difference in change was + 300. 6 seconds (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 197. 2 - 404. 2 s; P < 0. 001). NLPE also resulted in significantly greater improvements in all domains of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire compared with EPR, ranging from + 0. 48 (95 % CI = 0. 19 - 0. 78) for the domain, emotions, to + 0. 96 (95 % CI = 0. 57 - 1. 35) for dyspnea.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{gain insight}} into the trends {{in the use of}} psychostimulants among adults. DESIGN: Retrospective {{database}} study. METHODS: We selected data on adults (≥ 18 years) who had had a minimum of 2 prescriptions for a psychostimulant drug within 1 year from IADB. <b>nl,</b> a <b>Netherlands</b> database of filled prescriptions (59 public pharmacies, approximately 600, 000 patients). We calculated both the number of new users and the total number of users of psychostimulants per year in the period 2004 - 2014. We also assessed which agent was the most commonly prescribed psychostimulant drug and who had initiated treatment. RESULTS: The number of adults who were prescribed psychostimulants (methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and amphetamine) increased from 1. 5 per 1000 adults in 2004 to 7. 8 per 1000 adults in 2014. Users were mainly male (63. 0 %) and methylphenidate was the most frequently prescribed agent (85. 7 %). The number of new users of these agents increased from 0. 5 to 1. 5 per 1000 adults, and the greatest increase was observed among young adults (< 30 years). The increase in new users seems to have stabilized since 2012. Around 40 % of new treatments were initiated by the GP. CONCLUSION: The large {{increase in the number of}} adults who are prescribed psychostimulants seems mainly to be the result of an increase in the number of new users, especially among young adults. As psychostimulants are only approved for the treatment of ADHD in children from 6 years of age and in adolescents, short- and long-term effects and side effects of these drugs need to be better assessed in the adult population...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} stress-induced martensite (SIM) formation in a Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al (Ti- 1023) alloy under compressive loading has been studied. At low temperatures, the stress level at which martensite starts to form increases linearly with the deformation temperature, while the stress at which the deformation switches to regular plastic deformation is roughly temperature independent. A thermostatistical model for dislocation evolution is employed to describe deformation twinning in martensite. Combined effects of twinning induced plasticity and solid solution strengthening are considered in terms of temperature variations. The SIM effect disappears on deformation at temperatures beyond s 233 C, which {{is close to the}} predicted Ms temperature of 240 C. The thermostatistical model predicts a transition from twinned martensite to pure slip at 250 C.

Linkage maps provide a valuable tool for the unravelling of such trait-gene associations. Moreover, they give insight into recombination landscapes and between- species karyotype evolution. Here we used genotype data, generated from a 10 k SNP-chip, of over 2000 individuals to produce high-density linkage maps of the great tit (Parus major), a passerine bird, which serves as a model species for ecological and evolutionary questions. We created independent maps from two distinct populations: a captive F 2 -cross from The <b>Netherlands</b> (<b>NL)</b> and a wild population from the United Kingdom (UK). The two maps contained 6554 SNPs in 32 linkage groups, spanning 2010 cM and 1917 cM for the NL and UK populations respectively, and were similar in size and marker order. Subtle levels of heterochiasmy within and between chromosomes were remarkably consistent between the populations, suggesting that local departures from sex-equal recombination rates have evolved. This key and surprising result would have been impossible to detect if only one population was mapped.
