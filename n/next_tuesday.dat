500|$|In September, the Gold Democrats met in {{convention}} in Indianapolis. [...] Loyal to Cleveland, {{they wanted to}} nominate him. [...] However, the President ruled this out; his Cabinet members also refused to run. [...] Not even supporters thought the Gold Democrats would win; {{the purpose was to}} have a candidate who would speak for the gold element in the party, and who would divide the vote and defeat Bryan. [...] Illinois Senator John M. Palmer was eager to be the presidential candidate, and the convention nominated him with Kentucky's Simon Bolivar Buckner as his running mate. [...] Palmer was a 79-year-old former Union general, Buckner a 73-year-old former Confederate of that rank; the ticket was the oldest in combined age in American history, and Palmer the second-oldest presidential candidate (behind Peter Cooper of the Greenback Party; Bryan was the youngest). [...] The Gold Democrats received quiet financial support from Hanna and the Republicans. Palmer proved an able campaigner who visited most major cities in the East, and in the final week of his campaign, told listeners, [...] "I will not count it any great fault if <b>next</b> <b>Tuesday</b> you decide to cast your ballots for William McKinley." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting for the {{character}} was hectic, with Oberman describing the process as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] affair. The role of the second Mrs Den Watts was highly sought after with Oberman eventually beating out high-profile stars like Patsy Kensit, Cheryl Baker and Joanna Lumley for the part. In a 2004 'Star Chat' interview featured in The People, Oberman commented on her casting: [...] "I couldn't have wished for a better part. I mean the Watts family are a national institution. When I realised I was auditioning {{for the role of}} Dirty Den's wife, my jaw just dropped. I never thought I'd get it. Amazing, swanky actresses, like Joanna Lumley and Patsy Kensit, were all considered, but Leslie Grantham and I had great chemistry from the off and I think he said: 'I want her.'" [...] Oberman was on holiday when she received a call saying she had been cast in the role and was required to be on set the <b>next</b> <b>Tuesday.</b> All told the audition process had taken just two weeks, with Oberman beginning filming a mere ten days after her initial screen test. In fact the schedule was so tight that Oberman was on set and taping scenes before a contract had even been signed.|$|E
500|$|October {{began with}} a home-match against Desportivo das Aves. Benfica scored first through Paulo Jorge, but Aves {{equalized}} with a goal by Filipe Anunciação. In the second half, Benfica scored three more goals from Simão, Nuno Gomes and Katsouranis to win the match. Nuno Gomes said, [...] "I hope this win is {{a turning point for}} us." [...] After another international break, Benfica played União de Leiria at the Dr. Magalhães Pessoa on 14 September. They continued with their good momentum and won 4–0, with Miccoli bagging a double. Santos was happy with his team's display, saying, [...] "It was a great game and my team was focused, organized and dynamic, building a result that translated what happened on the pitch." [...] On the <b>next</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> Benfica visited Celtic Park for the first of a double-header against Celtic. Benfica had the upper hand in the first half, but Celtic scored two second-half goals in a ten-minute window and finished the game with a third. The win gave Celtic with a five-point lead over Benfica with three matchdays to go. Santos blamed the loss on the team's lack of composure after conceding the first goal. He said he believed Benfica could still qualify for the next round.|$|E

2500|$|During 2008, Aeon {{started to}} work on the next studio album. In January 2009, the band toured in Europe with Hate Eternal, Misery Index and See You <b>Next</b> <b>Tuesday.</b> In September, Carlberg {{departed}} and was replaced by Victor Brandt of Satyricon. The members commented Carlberg's departure: [...] "Being on tour in a not-so-known death metal band like Aeon often means really tough conditions and bad economy. We totally understand that not everyone can put up with this way of life." [...] The band subsequently recorded its third studio album, Path of Fire, at Empire Studio in Östersund, Sweden. Nilsson and Dlimi recorded also the bass, because Brandt did not have enough time to learn the songs. The album was mixed the following month at Mana Recording Studios in St, Petersburg, Florida by Erik Rutan. In January 2010, Brandt departed and was replaced by Marcus Edvardsson of Souldrainer and Sanctification.|$|E
2500|$|The footage shows {{interviewer}} Steve Murphy asking Dion the question: [...] "If {{you were}} the Prime Minister now, {{what would you have}} done about the economy, and this crisis, that Mr. Harper has not done?". [...] Dion had difficulty in understanding the question, repeatedly asking Murphy to clarify if he meant if Dion was Prime Minister now, <b>next</b> <b>Tuesday</b> on election day, last week, last month, 60 weeks ago, or two and a half years ago. [...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think this is a question of language at all. The question was very clear. It was asked repeatedly".|$|E

While the number of societies peaked during the 75-year period between 1875 and 1950, there are still six societies (Seven Society, Z Society, IMP Society, Eli Banana, T.I.L.K.A., The Thirteen Society) active that are over 100 years old, and several newer societies (the Purple Shadows, the A.N.G.E.L.S.
