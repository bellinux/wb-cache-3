5|$|Anna Komnene {{described}} the proceedings with very repetitive details, with Bohemond frequently pointing {{out his own}} mistakes and praising the benevolence of Alexios and the Empire; the proceedings must have been rather humiliating for Bohemond. On the other hand, Anna's work was meant to praise her father and {{the terms of the}} treaty may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> accurate.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the height}} of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E

5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> linear in either case.|$|E
25|$|Internalized {{bacteria}} {{may sometimes}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> {{protected from the}} outside environment, such as when the phagosome (the vacuole surrounding the bacterium inside the cell) is defective in some way. Gentamicin may kill those bacteria.|$|E
25|$|However, {{while the}} amount of {{cognitive}} improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent {{of the severity of}} folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> related to levels of folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the usual ten restoration candidates, this series included two 're-visits' to projects from the second series that had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> successful first time round.|$|R

25|$|However, consequentialism {{and virtue}} ethics need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> antagonistic. Philosopher Iain King has {{developed}} an approach which reconciles the two schools. Other consequentialists consider effects {{on the character of}} people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.|$|E
25|$|IgG {{antibody}} precipitin testing from serum is useful, {{as positive}} results {{are found in}} between 69–90% of patients, though also in 10% of asthmatics with and without SAFS. Therefore, it must be {{used in conjunction with}} other tests. Various forms exist, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA). Both are more sensitive than conventional counterimmunoelectrophoresis. IgG may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> specific for ABPA, as high levels are also found in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) alongside more severe radiological findings.|$|E
25|$|Tolkien {{wrote that}} Radagast {{gave up his}} mission {{as one of the}} Wizards by {{becoming}} too obsessed with animals and plants. He also wrote that he did not believe that Radagast's failure was as great as Saruman's. However, Christopher Tolkien notes in Unfinished Tales that the assumption Radagast failed in his task may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> accurate considering that he was specifically chosen by Yavanna, and he may have been assigned to protect the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, a task that would not end with the defeat of Sauron {{and the end of the}} War of the Ring.|$|E
60|$|On {{the whole}} the London detectives had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> a success. Mr. Macrae {{therefore}} arranged to send {{both of them}} back to Lairg, where they would strike the line, {{and return to the}} metropolis.|$|R
2500|$|These {{measures}} have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> successful; {{areas that have}} been burnt are susceptible to invasion by rosebay willowherb, Epilobium angustifolium, while crushed areas have been colonised by the alien invasive heath star moss, Campylopus introflexus.|$|R

25|$|By late 1939 {{became clear}} that the Mk. I in its current form would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> useful in the field, {{especially}} at night, {{and that it would be}} until at least early 1941 before the Mk. II was available. Leslie Bedford had formed a radar development department at Cossor to produce CH receivers and was well acquainted with both the desires of the AA gunners as well as the possibilities inherent to the radar systems. He suggested that it would be relatively easy to adapt the antenna and display systems from the Mk. II to the Mk. I system, providing many of the same advantages.|$|E
25|$|Ophelia, also, {{has been}} defended by feminists, most notably by Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia was driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture, a symbol which may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> accurate nor healthy for women.|$|E
25|$|Although {{diamonds}} were {{a significant}} motivating and sustaining factor, {{there were other}} means of profiting from the Sierra Leone Civil War. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming {{through the use of}} forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans who did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force. But the most important reason why the civil war should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. More than twenty years of poor governance, poverty, corruption and oppression created the circumstances for the rise of the RUF, as ordinary people yearned for change.|$|E

25|$|In Central Europe, {{followed}} by Great Britain and the United States, Reform (or Liberal) Judaism developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating Protestant decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. Modern Orthodox Judaism developed {{in reaction to}} Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) {{in their study of}} the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> abandoned, to form the Conservative movement. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism. After massive movements of Jews following The Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel, these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.|$|E
25|$|In retrospect, {{after it}} was {{discovered}} it turned out it had been observed many times before but not recognized, and there were others who made various calculations about its location, which {{did not lead to}} its observation. By 1847 the planet Uranus had completed nearly one full orbit since its discovery by William Herschel in 1781, and astronomers had detected a series of irregularities in its path that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> explained by Newton's law of gravitation. These irregularities could, however, be resolved if the gravity of a farther, unknown planet were disturbing its path around the Sun. In 1845 astronomers Urbain Le Verrier in Paris and John Couch Adams in Cambridge separately began calculations to determine the nature and position of such a planet. Le Verrier's success also led to a tense international dispute over priority, because shortly after the discovery George Airy, at the time British Astronomer Royal, announced that Adams had also predicted the discovery of the planet. Nevertheless, the Royal Society awarded Le Verrier the Copley medal in 1846 for his achievement, without mention of Adams.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time since A Single Man, John played synthesizers in {{addition}} to piano, since James Newton-Howard left the band. John felt that synths allowed him to write better fast rock songs, having <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> happy with such compositions performed on piano.|$|R
50|$|The Women's 100 metres L3 was a sprinting {{event in}} {{athletics}} at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It was unusual in {{that only one}} athlete took part. Although single athlete races had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> uncommon during the 1960s, they had become very rare by 1984.|$|R
50|$|Some {{traits are}} thought to be Y-linked but have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> confirmed. One example is hearing {{impairment}}. Hearing impairment was tracked in one specific family and through seven generations all males were affected by this trait. However, this trait has only occurred very rarely and has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> confirmed or disproved.|$|R
25|$|While {{the battle}} raged, {{a group of}} Ayyubid {{soldiers}} were able to outflank the Crusader army and enter Jaffa. The Genoese marines who had been entrusted with guarding the gates offered little resistance before retreating to their ships. Before the Muslims could exploit their success, however, Richard himself galloped into the town and rallied all of its fighting men. By evening, it had become clear to Saladin that his men had been soundly defeated and he gave the order to withdraw. Baha' al-Din, a contemporary Muslim soldier and historian, recorded: “I have been assured … that on that day the king of England, lance in hand, rode along the whole length of our army from right to left, {{and not one of}} our soldiers left the ranks to attack him. The Sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger…” Saladin's forces had suffered 700 dead, and lost 1500 horses; the Crusaders lost 2 dead, though many were wounded. However, as for many Medieval battles, the recorded figures for losses may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> reliable. Leaving their dead on the field, the Ayyubid force began a long, weary, march back to Jerusalem. Once back in the city Saladin strengthened its defences in case Richard were to advance against it again.|$|E
25|$|These volumes, {{traditional}} British comic {{and story}} annuals, were published {{each year in}} time for Christmas shopping. They are cloth bound with full-color painted covers and probably came with dust jackets that duplicated the illustrations on the board covers. These dust jackets, however, are seldom found. Interior contents are a mix of original British material (often by McLoughlin) and reprints from American comics, usually Quality. Primary distribution came through the Woolworth's chain where toys matching characters and vehicles from the stories were also on sale. Little {{is known about the}} original pricing of the volumes although some are thought to have been priced at 7/6. No issues were numbered or dated and the order given here may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> accurate. It is clear, however, that the order of issues presented in several British fanzines and publications is hopelessly wrong. It seems likely that the three Supercoloured Comic Annuals and the New Spaceways Comic Annual should be considered part of this series. This would give it an unbroken run of one annual a year from 1949 to 1959 which would nearly correspond with the Buffalo Bill series. Copies of each of these annuals with dated gift inscriptions confirm that the estimate of dates is fairly accurate. British collector Paul Annis' research confirms most of these dates.|$|E
500|$|When Kalmah {{began writing}} music for their melodic death metal album, their {{intent was to}} {{incorporate}} more [...] "aggressive thrash material" [...] than their previous recordings had. As a result, the songs were going to be, as vocalist Pekka Kokko described, [...] "quite straightforward", but the band {{did not want to}} lose the melodies they were known for. The album would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>entirely</b> thrash metal, since the band planned on adding acoustic guitar sections and also trumpets.|$|E
