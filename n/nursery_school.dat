40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore “ New Household Work ” {{resulting}} from socialization of childcare and who do these works. As the number of dual-earner couples increases, many family with children use <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> in daily life. However, using <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> makes extra work. I define “New Household Work” as tasks, such as the application procedure to <b>nursery</b> <b>schools,</b> picking up and dropping off the children, and preparing children's belongings. This paper focuses on the application procedure to <b>nursery</b> <b>schools,</b> and it clarifies the actual situation of working parents who have <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> children. The semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 mothers of children attending <b>nursery</b> <b>schools,</b> who live in a certain ward in Tokyo. The results showed that most of New Household Work is done by mothers. In addition, which parent performs the application procedure to <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> is influenced by gender ideology as mother. Furthermore mothers do these tasks by themselves, because whether or not children are accepted to <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> affect her ability to continue working...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focused on}} the {{proliferation}} of <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> in Gboko Metropolis of Benue State. The study adopted the descriptive survey design. Three research questions were posed; three hypotheses formulated and tested at 0. 05 level of significance. The sampled population for the study comprised 196 teachers in 85 <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> in Gboko Metropolis of Benue State. The instrument that was used for data collection was titled “proliferation of private <b>nursery</b> <b>schools</b> and quality assurance questionnaire ” (PPNSQAQ).

Workshops and seminars should be regularly organised for head teachers by Ministry of Education to help improve on its leadership...|$|R

5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him to}} believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the <b>nursery</b> <b>school,</b> and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916.

5|$|There {{were three}} schools in Middlewich in the mid-19th century: the British School in Newton Bank; the National School in Cow Lane (Brooks Lane); and the Grammar School, {{close to the}} site of the largest tesco store. A Church of England school was erected in Lewin Street in 1854 and {{extended}} in 1871. It soon became known as the National School, with the result that the earlier school was demolished. The later National School was itself demolished in the 1980s and is the site of the Salinae Day Care Centre, opened in 1995. At the turn of the 20th century two new schools were built: St Mary's Catholic school, whose keystone was laid in 1899 by Col. France-Hayhurst, and the secondary school, opened by France-Hayhurst in 1906. At the start of the 21st century there were seven schools in Middlewich: one infant, one junior, four primary schools and one secondary school. Cledford Primary School tends to accept students from the South of the town. It has now amalgamated With Cledford Infant And <b>Nursery</b> <b>School.</b> Middlewich Primary School caters for children from the older, northern, part of the town, whilst St Mary's Catholic Primary School receives Catholic children from the town. Work began on the original buildings for the secondary school, Middlewich High School, in 1906, with later additions improving the teaching areas and providing a sports hall which could also be used by the wider community. The school opened on 1 November 1906. In 2007 it was ranked 34 out of 50 by GCSE results for schools in Cheshire in the 2007 league tables. Byley Primary School and Wimboldsley Community Primary School serve children from outside the immediate bounds of the town.|$|E
