These are not only traditional groups which were restructured {{in the course of}} those reforms, but also new groups which were formed or developed in that period and which have come to have decisive weight in the national economy. This new leading role of Mexican national private groups {{is the result of the}} strategies adopted by the groups themselves in order to adapt to the conditions of competition created by an open, deregulated economy as well as of the government strategy of privatizing public enterprises, which fulfilled the aim of transferring to national private capital the economic power previously possessed by the sector of public enterprises, while at the same time seeking to secure a balanced distribution of that power among those national private groups and to promote the development of new groups. Section I of the article examines the performance of the national private groups in the period in question, in order to show their leading economic position. Section It analyses the general features of the privatization of financial and <b>non-financial</b> public <b>enterprises,</b> as well as the various effects they had on those groups, with emphasis on the restructuring aspects of them which underlie the privatization strategy.

40|$|Abstract Purpose: This book {{examines}} {{macroeconomic policy}} application in Malaysia during economic crisis. Although the 1997 - 98 financial crisis {{was the most}} severe, Malaysia has been confronted with four other major economic crises: (i) “the early commodity crisis” 1956 - 72, (ii) “the first oil crisis” of 1973 - 74, (iii) “the second commodity/oil crisis” of 1980 - 81, (iv) “the electronic/third commodity crisis” of 1985 - 86. Method: Macroeconomic data were used to examine economic policies adopted prior to the financial crisis of 1997 - 98. For instance, the economy was faced with an increasingly severe labour shortage. Unemployment was marginalised {{to such an extent}} that the exigent labour demand caused a labour shortfall, which was ameliorated by the presence of 1. 14 million registered migrant workers. The 1990 s marked a turning point in terms of employment, changing Malaysia from a labour surplus country to one of the deficit-marked nations in newly industrialising economies of the South East Asian nations Result: Malaysia learned three important lessons out of the exercise in managing crises. Firstly, policy makers recognised the importance of the role of the private sector. The private sector can be an efficient engine of growth provided appropriate incentives are given. Secondly, there was a need to reduce fiscal deficits and to control <b>Non-financial</b> Public <b>Enterprises</b> (NFPEs). Lastly, Malaysia recognised the importance of continued coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. This is important to bring about optimum if not maximum impact on the economy. In all three experiences – overcoming recession as well as moderating inflationary pressures – Malaysia were able to effectively coordinate both monetary and fiscal policies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present an {{approach}} for good practice with regards to using cost benefit analysis (CBA) as a value-adding activity in the information security investment process for large enterprises. The approach is supported by empirical data. From a MIO model perspective, this report {{is focused on the}} phase of strategic choices regarding organization, i. e. trying to find optimal investments for efficient operations. To assess, improve and monitor the operational effectiveness and management’s internal control environment is essential in today’s business execution. Executive management and boards are increasingly looking for an information security governance framework that encompasses information technology and information security: a single framework through which all information assets and activities within the organisation can be governed, to provide the optimum capability for meeting the organisation’s objectives, in terms of functionality and security. The investment decision {{is one of the most}} visible and controversial key decisions in an enterprise. Some projects are approved, others are bounced, and the rest enter the organisational equivalent of suspended animation with the dreaded request from the decision makers to “redo the business case” or “provide more information. ” The concept of cost benefit analyses of information security helps management to make decisions on which initiatives to fund with how much, as there needs to be an approach for measuring and comparing different alternatives and how they meet business objectives of the <b>enterprise.</b> <b>Non-financial</b> metrics are identified using different approaches: governance effectiveness, risk analysis, business case analysis or game theory. The financial performance metrics are driven by the main value disciplines of an enterprise. These lead to the use of formulas enabling the measurement of asset utilisation, profit or growth: ROI (ROIC), NPV, IRR (MIRR), FCF, DCF, Payback Period, TCO, TBO, EVA, and ROSI. The author shows research in the field of good corporate governance and the investment approval process, as well as case studies from two multinational enterprises. The case from Motorola demonstrates how IT governance principles are equally applicable to information security governance, while the case from Ericsson demonstrates how an information security investment decision can be supported by performing a cost benefit analysis using traditional marketing approaches of business case analysis (BCA) and standard financial calculations. The suggested good practice presented in this thesis is summarised in four steps: 1. Understand main rationale for the security investment 2. Identify stakeholders and strategic goals 3. Perform Cost Benefit Analysis (non-financial and financial performance metrics) 4. Validate that the results are relevant to stakeholders and strategic goals DISCLAIMER This report is intended for academic training only and should not be used for any other purposes.

The main goal of this thesis is an evaluation of the economic behavior of <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the ownership of the government (NPVV) in the selected sector of the national economy. The theoretical part is dealing with a short description of these enterprises and with issues with their efficiency. This was analysed in separate studies. The practical part deals with a development of the individual types of the profitability (type of an income of the production) in the context of the national economy and industry type if the of selected national accounts during the 1999 - 2010 period. The conclusions of the individual chapters are interconnected at the end of this thesis. The method is to compare the conclusions from the industry subsectors with the conclusions from the national economy subsector. The conclusions are compared with the NPVV informations extracted from the related studies. The <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> subsector indicator results are also evaluated in this thesis. The analysed branch was the ground and pipeline transportation branch due to substantial share of the public <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> NPV (13. 3 %) and the national private <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> NPS (3. 74 %) production in 2010 (these were the main subsectors of the researched <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises).</b> The production and the income have been approsimately developed at the same average as in the sector and the national economy also. Their output is comparable due to that. The comparation of the profitability by using the gross added value shows us that the NPV have better results. However the position of NPV and NPS switches and the differences become deepen when we use the net added value and other sources of income. There is even a regular negative profitability if we use the net disposable income of the NPV. There is an issue with the salary of the employees mainly in the NPV according to the research. But it is interesting that issues related to the financial crisis are not affecting the NPV as fast as the NPS. The NPS is affected by the problems almost immediately, however the NPV are affected with a delay and with a less intensity.

It is contended that a type of banking system has developed which is highly dependent on <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> and State organs. A 'depersonalisation ' of capitalism in Russia has occurred and this is demonstrated by an analysis of the ownership of financial companies. Under current Russian economic conditions, a tendency is noted for weak budget constraints to reconstitute themselves, and for banks to act as conduits for non-financial companies: they supply short-term credit and also act as intermediaries in the conduct of non-monetary exchange. A typology of banks in contemporary Russia is contrased with Anglo-American and German systems.

Empirical studies, such as Petersen and Rajan (1997), have been ambiguous about which of these two hypotheses is being tested. By using data where individual trading companies supply both loans and trade credit we examine the importance of the different financial instruments for trading company finance. By controlling for these instruments, we also examine how the differing characteristics of financial and non-financial institutions affect the flow of credit to firms.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a new accounting standard for financial instruments, has raised {{a number of issues}} related to the application of fair value principles. This paper discusses some of these issues which are generally related to the fact that "fair values" are not always easily defined or readily available. It concludes that the application of fair value for financial liabilities might present fewer complications if it is matched by similar valuation principles for financial assets. The issue of measurement error is more complicated as it can be related to whether valuations refer to exit value, as postulated by the IASB, or deprival value, which is more closely related to firm-specific valuation. Measurement error is magnified in the income statement and so will be any biases from the application of historical accounting for derivatives. Despite any measurement issues, the problem of institution-specific dimensions of value that looms so large in the case of <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> and makes the systematic application of fair value accounting fraud with difficulty there, would seem to be much more manageable for financial institutions because of their familiarity with risk measurement and management techniques for financial instruments. financial statements, institution-specific value, fair value, financial reporting...|$|E
