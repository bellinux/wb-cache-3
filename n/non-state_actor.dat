The attacks, {{launched by the}} U.S. Navy, were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda's August 7 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others.

25|$|The PRC has {{consistently}} claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC {{is no longer}} in legitimate existence. Under its One-China Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a <b>non-state</b> <b>actor.</b> Internally, the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence, though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal. The PRC has threatened {{the use of military force}} in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible.|$|E

5000|$|Violent <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> (VNSA), {{also known}} as armed <b>non-state</b> <b>actors,</b> are <b>non-state</b> <b>actors,</b> i.e. [...] "individuals or {{organizations}} that have economic, political or social power {{and are able to}} influence at a national and sometimes international level but do not belong to or ally themselves to any particular country or state," [...] who employ violence in pursuit of their objectives.

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the notion}} of civil <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Using Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d’Ivoire as cases studies, the paper identifies three kinds of civil <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> in war-torn countries: international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based NGOs, and ad hoc community organizations. In addition, it argues that civil <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> play a critical problem-solving role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding and complement the role of state actors. The paper examines the role of civil <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> through their dialectical affinity with state actors in the peacekeeping and peacebuilding processes. It further expands {{the notion of}} <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding to encompass community-based NGOs and ad hoc community organizations. Moreover, it points to the positive role of civil <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> and {{the wide range of}} activities they perform, especially in peace mediation and post-war reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|ArticleClassically, States and <b>non-State</b> <b>actors</b> were {{differentiated}} {{not only}} by disparities in legal status but also by significant imbalances in resources and capabilities. Not surprisingly, international law developed a State-centric bias to account for these imbalances. Cyberspace and cyber operations, however, have closed a number of formerly significant gaps between States’ and non-State actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. In fact, some <b>non-State</b> <b>actors</b> now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many States in this respect. Where public international law had long proved chiefly relevant to States’ interactions with other States, cyber operations by <b>non-State</b> <b>actors</b> increase {{the frequency with which}} public international law provides relevant and binding legal rules. This article surveys existing public international law for norms relevant to the cyber interactions of cyber-empowered States and <b>non-State</b> <b>actors.</b> Specifically, the article illustrates how the principles of sovereignty, State responsibility and the jus ad bellum are particularly relevant to States engaged in struggles with <b>non-State</b> <b>actors</b> for security and supremacy in cyberspace...|$|R

40|$|After an {{empirical}} {{appraisal of the}} extent to which <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> wield some law-making powers at the international level (II), this chapter will attempt to evaluate the degree to which the alleged inadequacy of the current legal system is directly affected by our respective perceptions of the role played by <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> in International Law. In doing so, this section will try to demonstrate that much of the controversy yielded by the law-making status of <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> stems from an attempt to bolster the scope, the expertise and the legitimacy of international legal scholarship (III). This chapter ends with a few remarks on the consequences of the absence of any law-making status of <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> on their overall place in the international legal system. On this occasion, it will be argued that <b>non-state</b> <b>actors,</b> instead of being seen as lawmakers, should be rather seen as law-consumers, i. e. entities which, instead of making the law, constitute great consumers of it (IV). The inquiry that is undertaken here cannot be seriously carried out without formulating an important preliminary caveat as to the relativity of any conclusion regarding the status of <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> in International Law. Indeed, it is acknowledged that the manner in which one construes the role of <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> is intrinsically relative, for it hinges on the each scholar’s respective understanding of law. This chapter accordingly starts with some introductory remarks about the necessity to clearly explain how we understand the international legal system before venturing into any examination of the status of the actors involved therein (I) ...|$|R

40|$|This book {{looks at}} the {{interaction}} between <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> and their state, in this case Germany, in terms of support, supplement and resource. It uses Germany as an instructive case study from which to draw out wider lessons. Germany has a vibrant civil society, numerous <b>non-state</b> <b>actors,</b> {{some of which are}} engaged in transnational processes, and a government that relies heavily on these actors, and thus provides a classic example of the role that <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> can play. Many <b>non-state</b> <b>actors</b> act in close cooperation with the German state to supplement or sustain government policies, especially companies, industry bodies, experts, NGOs, churches, local and regional networks and political groups. The actors are analyzed in their role as cooperating, and in many ways strengthening, the role and influence of Germany abroad and on the international stage, rather than competing with it...|$|R
