5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|Voice casting was {{managed by}} Kris Zimmerman, who chose voice actors {{that seemed to}} suit certain roles: the Matoran were voiced by young adults, while the Turaga were voiced by older actors. The voice actors and their {{performances}} were chosen so they would <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they came from a specific area of the world, instead sound like they came from and belonged in the Bionicle universe. A notable event during recording was a behind-the-scenes incident between Michas and Francis: originally cast in the respective roles of Jaller and Takua, Michas came into a recording session in a muddled state and began reading Takua's lines by mistake. When Francis came in, he read Jaller's lines: when the staff heard them and were favourably impressed, the actors permanently switched roles. Voice acting for the project was mostly done in 2002, but dialogue was re-recorded during Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR) into 2003: approximately 30% of the final film's dialogue was done during ADR. Audio and music post-production was handled by Hacienda Post. The company's president Tim Borquez served as sound supervisor. Mask of Light {{was the first time}} in any media that Bionicle characters spoke.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the topic}} of the sound of the {{comeback}} album, Dane said, [...] "This record is <b>not</b> going to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the other two. It might sound very similar to the second one ('Into The Mirror Black'). It's definitely <b>not</b> going to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the first one, because we're all a little bit older and I can't come up with a c-clamp for a scrotum and a helium tank [...] [...] [...] It's <b>not</b> going to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the old ones... it's 2011. It's still gonna be that good, I think, and there's gonna be high-pitched screaming. I'm making sure of that. With NEVERMORE, high-pitched screaming was never really called for. You know, with SANCTUARY... of course it is." ...|$|R

25|$|Jeff Tweedy {{was invited}} to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, {{and was told that}} he could {{collaborate}} with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O'Rourke based on his fascination with O'Rourke's Bad Timing album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche. Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments about how the album should sound between songs. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form. Tweedy also fired Jay Bennett around this time, believing (according to Jay Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Jay Bennett was a collective decision.|$|E

When I went into the studio I used the same passion, honesty, and approach with my vocals I channeled as Etta James. It does <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the vocals on my past albums. It's a lot rawer. It comes from a deep place." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, Hammond {{started making}} {{transistor}} organs. The first organ that bridged {{the gap between}} tonewheel and transistor was the X-66, introduced in May 1967. The X-66 contained just 12 tonewheels, and used electronics for frequency division. It contained separate [...] "vibrato bass" [...] and [...] "vibrato treble" [...] {{in an attempt to}} simulate a Leslie speaker. Hammond designed it as the company's flagship product, in response to market competition and to replace the B-3. However, it was considered expensive at $9,795 and it sold poorly. It did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a B-3.|$|E

500|$|Due to the high-pitch {{employed}} in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she [...] "never liked the original [...] for that reason. The song has seasoned over the years with my singing of it." [...] Dickson believed that she did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> herself on the song. While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but {{the experience of being}} abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. I {{think you have to be}} honest with songs and with yourself." [...] The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.|$|E
500|$|Kramon {{wrote the}} {{original}} background music {{to convey the}} film noir themes. For the pilot, Thomas wanted [...] "a really atmospheric, kind of modern noir type of vibe", and Kramon used sounds {{similar to that of}} Air and Zero 7. Kramon used [...] "traditional sounds" [...] for the series, but also processed and filtered them. Among the instruments used were piano, vibraphone and guitar. When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression so that it did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a traditional piano. Live bass and percussion was also used, as Kramon did not like to program them. The main instrument used was guitar, but Kramon felt that piano was [...] "by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you're doing everything yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Six major singles {{were issued}} from the album, led by [...] "SexyBack" [...] which was {{released}} on July 7, 2006, two {{months prior to the}} publication of the album. Regarding the song, Timberlake surmised he did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> he did before. [...] "SexyBack", which lacks his distinctive falsetto, is seen as a complete departure from Timberlake's recognized sound, and his management thought it might risk being unrecognizable as a [...] "Justin Timberlake song". But that risk nonetheless appealed to Timberlake, who reportedly insisted to have [...] "SexyBack" [...] released as the album's lead single. Jive Records executive Barry Weiss, who initially doubted the suggestion, later told in an interview in February 2007 that albeit an [...] "unusual record", it was a [...] "risk that clearly paid off".|$|E

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|The Bama Boyz almost {{intentionally}} {{left the}} instrumental for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] out, since {{they thought that}} the song did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the tracks Beyoncé was recording for her upcoming album, at that particular time. However, Jesse Rankins explained that they later decided to put the instrumental for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] in the email because they knew that Solange likes weird records, but, they made sure to send it last. Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Jonathan Wells commented: [...] "When they heard Solange's demo, we were excited because that track was more our true sound {{than any of the}} others , but we still kinda didn't believe Beyoncé would cut it...but we hoped!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Hulk was {{composed}} by Danny Elfman, who scored Spider-Man the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, {{was the original}} composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much {{of the character of}} Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> his previous superhero scores. [...] "They did leave some of my music in the movie," [...] said Danna, [...] "so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing and I guess he liked it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Not all reviews {{were entirely}} positive, though. Sputnikmusic writer Robin Smith was more {{ambivalent}} to the album, writing [...] "Parallax, unrealised masterpiece or <b>not,</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{the man in}} his bedroom with a thousand songs to leave unexplained." [...] Jonathan Donaldson of The Phoenix wrote [...] "Yet even when relying less on atmospheric synths and playing with a full-band set up ("The Shakes"), Parallax misses early rocks tautness and grit." [...] Daniel Becker of Dusted Reviews felt the album was [...] "sparer than usual, flimsier, subtler," [...] writing [...] "These songs aren’t weighty enough, individually or cumulatively, to leave an imprint — they fail to make a world out of themselves, leaving instead snatches of place, time of day, lighting conditions." ...|$|R
500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} the album's {{production}} was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating [...] "The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but they turned the album into this dancey electro-pop. A lot of it had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, {{not only did they}} change the music, they changed it into something [...] I couldn't relate.'" [...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap. They cooked up some electronic stuff, you know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson’s initial {{role was}} to provide score for Trevor’s missions, and he took {{influence}} from artists such as The Mars Volta and Queens of the Stone Age. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other’s work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. [...] "Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing", Jackson said. Froese had interpolated funk sounds with Jackson’s hip-hop influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily sampled it. The Alchemist opined, [...] "We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there...We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that". DJ Shadow then mixed the team's creations together and matched it to the gameplay. Pavlovich considered [...] "how to make the hip-hop and rock score <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score" [...] a challenge.|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave it {{four out of five}} stars and praised Rihanna's direction towards a [...] "softer and more prolific edge". Brittany Lewis of GlobalGrind called [...] "Diamonds" [...] a catchy song and felt that it had the potential to be another hit for Rihanna. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that, although it does <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> an emphatic hit, the lyrical content of the song depicts a [...] "personal shift" [...] for Rihanna. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is more positive than previous singles such as [...] "We Found Love" [...] and [...] "Where Have You Been", despite its moderate tempo. Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is stronger than ever. Contactmusic's reviewer described it as a [...] "laid-back track", and suggested that the lyrical content is related to her former boyfriend Chris Brown. In a track-by-track review of Unapologetic, Andrew Hampp of Billboard found the song inspiring and commented that it [...] "finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date". Andy Kellman of Allmusic cited the song as one of the highlights on Unapologetic, and gave it three and a half stars.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums {{to let you know that}} they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, One by One was {{considered}} the band's heaviest album, as Grohl described the sound as a darker and more aggressive approach {{as opposed to the}} band's usual work. Grohl said that the album mainly focused on the energy of live performances, which he attributed to both the extensive touring preceding the compositions, and the short period during which the re-recordings were done. The frontman added that although the previous albums had songs which were never played live, the track listing on One by One was compared to a set list where he would play all songs every night. As the results of the early recording sessions had manager John Silva complimenting the songs that did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the band's previous work, and suggesting Grohl to [...] "stop trying to write hit singles and go back to being weird", the band decided to be more experimental in addition to writing music meant to be played in full arenas. The variety included moody songs such as [...] "Have It All" [...] and [...] "Tired of You", the seven-minute [...] "epic opus" [...] album closer [...] "Come Back", and the alternating dynamics of [...] "Halo", which drew inspiration from Tom Petty, Cheap Trick and Guided by Voices. Grohl added that the sonority tried to blend dissonance and melody: [...] "We figured we're gonna get mean, we're gonna get ugly. And then I end up putting this four-part harmony on it, and all of sudden it's beautiful. Like 'wait a second, {{it was supposed to be}} gross, and now it's gorgeous'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We Used to Be Friends" [...] by The Dandy Warhols {{was used}} as the series' theme song. Composer Josh Kramon was {{originally}} going to produce a noir version of an '80s song for the theme. However, Rob Thomas was [...] "pretty much set on finding a song", and [...] "We Used to Be Friends" [...] was chosen right from the beginning. Kramon wrote the original background music to convey the film noir themes. For the pilot, Thomas wanted [...] "a really atmospheric, kind of modern noir type of vibe", and Kramon used sounds similar to that of Air and Zero 7. Kramon used [...] "traditional sounds" [...] for the series, but also processed and filtered them. Among the instruments used were piano, vibraphone and guitar. When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression so that it did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a traditional piano.

The main instrument used was guitar, but Kramon felt that piano was [...] "by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you're doing everything yourself." [...] A week before choosing the sounds for the pilot, the crew had a [...] "spotting session", where they would discuss with Thomas and the producers which type of music was going to be featured. Kramon did not decide the songs to be featured, but composed and created the whole score. Since there was little orchestral music, and Kramon could play guitar, piano, bass and drums, he played the whole score without hiring a musician.|$|E
