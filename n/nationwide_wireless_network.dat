This paper analyzes the viability of a public-private partnership that serves public safety and commercial subscribers from a for-profit provider's perspective. A model is presented that estimates the net present value (NPV) of a <b>wireless</b> <b>network</b> by calculating costs {{based on the number}} of cell sites required and revenue based on the projected number of subscribers acquired. The model is applied to both a network that serves only commercial subscribers on 10 Â MHz of 700 Â MHz spectrum and a public-private partnership that serves commercial subscribers and public safety personnel on 20 Â MHz of 700 Â MHz spectrum. It is found that NPV is greater for the public-private partnership than for the commercial-only network for any population density, which shows that the value of 10 Â MHz of spectrum exceeds the cost of meeting public safety requirements. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that NPV/cell increases with population density, so urban areas are profitable and rural areas are unprofitable. The paper demonstrates that a partnership covering 94 % of the US population breaks even because the most urban 56 % of population subsidizes coverage for the next 38 %. If initial deployment is subsidized, a financially sustainable public-private partnership can serve much more than 94 %. Additionally, it is shown that allowing urban municipalities to opt-out of the partnership can significantly increase the subsidies required.
