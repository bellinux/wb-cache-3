40|$|Research question: What is the {{nutritional}} status of infants in Varanasi? Objectives: To {{find out the}} magnitude of PEM among infants of Varanasi district. Study design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Urban slum and rural areas. Participants: 360 infants. Study variables: Age, height (length), weight. Outcome variables: Protein Energy Malnutrition. Statistical analysis: Simple proportions; Chi- square test. Results: As per the height for age criteria; only 10. 56 &#x 0025; of infants were stunted (< 90 &#x 0025; of reference standard) and according to Seoane Latham classification; 44. 96 &#x 0025;, 6. 05 &#x 0025; and 4. 03 &#x 0025; were suffering from acute malnutrition and <b>nutritional</b> <b>dwarfing</b> respectively (90 &#x 0025; of reference standard as entry point...|$|E
40|$|A recent anthropometric study ofSabah {{reported}} that 37. 1 {{percent of children}} were <b>nutritional</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> 12. 5 percent were acutely malnourished and 9. 4 percent were stunted and wasted. It was also noted that Muruts were {{among the top five}} most malnourished ethnic groups in Sabah. The present study looks at the ecological basis of malnutrition among Muruts and concludes that a variety of interrelated factors, including the lack of education, climatic and soil conditions, poverty, food habits and taboos as well as diseases from poor sanitation and malaria contribute to the presence of malnutrition among rural Muruts. It is recommended that a multidisciplinary approach be taken to control and prevent malnutrition among the Muruts and that the single most important measure aside from malaria control is education of the people and the development of marketable skills...|$|R
40|$|Napier {{grass was}} first {{introduced}} to Malaysia in the 1920 ?s {{and there were many}} cultivars introduced in Malaysia since 1950 ?s. However, {{there is a need to}} have comparative evaluation of these Napier cultivars so that definite recommendations can be made in the choice and management of the respective cultivars. The experiment was conducted to evaluate the in vitro digestibility and gas production characteristic of four Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) cultivars, namely Common, Silver, Red and Dwarf Napier. Common, Silver and Red Napier are classified as tall cultivars while Dwarf Napier is a short cultivar. Gas production was determined at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h of incubation period and its kinetics was described using the equation p = a + b (1 ? e?ct). Dwarf Napier had the highest (P 0. 05) in the rate of gas production (C) of Napier cultivars which ranged from 0. 024 to 0. 035 h- 1. The metabolisable energy (ME) was significantly higher in Dwarf and Red Napier cultivars (8. 7 MJ/kg DM) compared to Silver and Common Napier cultivars. The cumulative gas production within 32 h was highest (P 0. 05) ranged from 52 to 73 mM, 88 to 70 %, 6. 2 to 6. 8 %, respectively [...] Dwarf Napier cultivar had superior <b>nutritional</b> quality. <b>Dwarf</b> and Red Napier cultivars could be classified as high quality grasses due to their high digestibility, gas production and degradation rates compared to the other cultivars. The low quality of Common and Silver Napier cultivars is mainly reflected by the extensive lignification of their cell wall structure...|$|R
