Since assay constraints limited the data at lower doses, conventional analysis was not feasible and a ‘population approach’ was used. Bound concentrations were best {{described by a}} biexponential model and further analyses revealed a small influence of dose or weight on V 1 but <b>no</b> <b>identifiable</b> <b>effects</b> of age, body surface area, renal or hepatic function. The final model was: clearance (Q) 0. 194 l h− 1; central compartment volume (V 1) 4. 48 × (1 + 0. 00074 × dose (mg)) l; peripheral compartment volume (V 2) 7. 94 l; intercompartmental clearance 0. 685 l h− 1. Distribution and elimination half-lives had median estimates of 2. 7 h and 49 h respectively. Free doxorubicin was present at most sampling times with concentrations around 1000 times lower than bound doxorubicin values. Data were best described using a biexponential model and the following parameters were estimated: apparent clearance 180 l h− 1; apparent V 1 (l) 1450 × (1 + 0. 0013 × dose (mg)), apparent V 2 (l) 21 300 × (1 – 0. 0013 × dose (mg)) × (1 + 2. 95 × height (m)) and apparent Q 6950 l h− 1.

However, their effectiveness is unknown. We conducted a large-scale randomized {{experiment in the}} Philippines testing the impact of unilaterally facilitating international labor migration. Our most intensive treatment doubled the rate of job offers but had <b>no</b> <b>identifiable</b> <b>effect</b> on international labor migration.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} public sector employment on local labour markets. Using English data at the Local Authority level for 2003 - 2007 we find that public sector employment has <b>no</b> <b>identifiable</b> <b>effect</b> on total private sector employment. However, public sector employment does affect the sectoral composition of the private sector. Specifically, each additional public sector job creates 0. 5 jobs in the non-tradable sector (construction and services) while crowding out 0. 4 jobs in the tradable sector (manufacturing). When using data for a longer time period (1999 - 2007) we find no multiplier effect for non-tradables, stronger crowding out for tradables and, consistent with this, crowding out for total private sector employment...|$|E
40|$|The exchangeability of {{interlayer}} K in micaceous minerals {{is governed}} by the conditions imposed by the solution around the particles and the mineral properties themselves. This study focused {{on the role of}} mineral properties by relating the K extracted by NaCl-NaTPB solutions to differences in existing and thermally altered properties of selected minerals. The relevance of particle size, mixed layering and dioctahedral structures were emphasized by using size-fractions of ground muscovite, 3 ̆c 2 (mu) m fractions of Tumut and Grundite illites and four trioctahedral mica-vermiculites;When the micaceous minerals were heated, several changes in K exchangeability occurred and the minerals lost weight by dehydration and dehydroxylation. Dehydroxylation enhanced the rate and amount of K release in all the dioctahedral minerals by increasing the interlayer spacing. Mica-vermiculites with mixed layering yielded the same thermal response even though trioctahedral micas behaved otherwise and {{there was no evidence of}} dehydroxylation involvement. The minerals varied in their response to temperatures under 400 (DEGREES) C, but dehydration was not an obvious factor. These low temperatures reduced layer weathering and thereby provided a means of detecting this mechanism of K release. Layer weathering was a significant factor in ground micas, not in the illites. In the absence of dehydroxylation, reductions in edge weathering also occurred in many heated samples. The thermally induced changes in layer and edge weathering probably stemmed from a reduction in interlayer spacing. If so, a similar explanation should be considered for the limited K release in small particles because the relevance of layer weathering was eliminated by comparisons of heated illites and ground mica. X-ray diffraction studies verified the occurrence of structural alterations but not a measurable decrease in interlayer spacing. However, the small particle effect in illites was circumvented by the expanding effects of dehydroxylation. Mixed layering plays a major role in the thermal responses of mica-vermiculites but has <b>no</b> <b>identifiable</b> <b>effect</b> on K exchange in unheated minerals;The interlayer spacing and condition of the lateral edges of the mineral particles appear to dominate the exchangeability of interlayer K...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1960 s simple {{inexpensive}} cold lactated Ringers with additives {{has been}} used for short-term cold preservation of kidneys from living donors. We performed 266 living donor kidney transplantations from January 22, 2003 to October 30, 2006. Donor allografts were recovered laparoscopically and flushed with cold heparin, lactated Ringer's and procaine (HeLP) solution. Warm and cold ischemic times were typically < 45 min and < 90 min, respectively. The mean follow up was 21. 6 ± 12. 2 months. There was no delayed graft function. Actuarial 1 -year patient and graft survival were 98. 6 % and 98. 1 %, respectively. The creatinine at 1 year was 1. 46 ± 0. 51 mg/dL. The cumulative incidences of acute cellular rejection at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were 3. 0 %, 7. 1 %, 10. 2 %, and 11. 7 %. There were <b>no</b> <b>identifiable</b> side <b>effects</b> attributed to the HeLP solution. This study documents the effectiveness of cold HeLP as a flushing and short-term preservation fluid for living donor kidney transplantation with excellent results and significant cost benefit because of its low cost. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} cause of new {{blindness}} in young patients is retinal neovascularization, and in the elderly is choroidal neovascularization. Therefore, there has {{been a great deal of}} attention focused on the development of new treatments for these disease processes. Previous studies have demonstrated partial inhibition of retinal neovascularization in animal models using antagonists of vascular endothelial growth factor or other signaling molecules implicated in the angiogenesis cascade. These studies have indicated potential for drug treatment, but have left many questions unanswered. Is it possible to completely inhibit retinal neovascularization using drug treatment with a mode of administration that is feasible to use in patients? Do agents that inhibit retinal neovascularization have any effect on choroidal neovascularization? In this study, we demonstrate complete inhibition of retinal neovascularization in mice with oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy by oral administration of a partially selective kinase inhibitor that blocks several members of the protein kinase C family, along with vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. The drug also blocks normal vascularization of the retina during development but has <b>no</b> <b>identifiable</b> adverse <b>effects</b> on mature retinal vessels. In addition, the kinase inhibitor causes dramatic inhibition of choroidal neovascularization in a laser-induced murine model. These data provide proof of concept that pharmacological treatment is a viable approach for therapy of both retinal and choroidal neovascularization...|$|R

40|$|Endocrine {{modulating}} {{chemicals in}} the environment are possible causative agents {{of a number of}} human diseases. Many of these compounds act on the same molecular target, and hence risk assessment requires consideration of their possible combined effects. Here, we studied the combined effects of 17 beta-estradiol, genistein, bisphenol A and endosulfan on MCF- 7 cells. Full concentration-effect curves for cell proliferation were obtained for each compound and used to identify appropriate concentrations for investigating the effects of binary mixtures of the compounds. Protein profiling by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry was performed to identify responsive proteins. Treatment with each of the compounds produced similar protein profile changes. Prominent and consistent changes were seen in 12 protein ions. Cell proliferation and protein levels responded monotonically to the estrogens, with <b>identifiable</b> <b>no</b> observable <b>effect</b> concentrations in all cases. Binary mixtures of the compounds produced effects on cell proliferation and on each of the responsive protein ions that were fully consistent with concentration additivity. Thus, no reason to deviate from the application of the principles of dose-response and dose additivity in the risk assessment of combinations of estrogenic compounds was found in this study...|$|R
