40|$|During the Viking Age, Norse peoples {{established}} settlements {{across the}} North Atlantic, colonizing the pristine and near-pristine landscapes of the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland and the short-lived Vinland settlement in Newfoundland. Current North Atlantic archaeological research themes include efforts to understand human adaptation and impact in these environments. For example, early Icelandic settlements persisted despite substantial environmental impacts and climatic change, while the Greenlandic settlements were abandoned ca. AD 1450 {{in the face}} of similar environmental degradation. The Norse settlers utilized both imported domestic livestock and natural fauna, including wild birds and aquatic resources. The stable isotope ratios of carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> δ 13 C and δ 15 N) in archaeofaunal bones provide a powerful tool for the reconstruction of Norse economy and diet. Here we assess the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of faunal and floral samples from sites in North Iceland within the context of Norse economic strategies. These strategies had a dramatic effect upon the ecology and environment of the North Atlantic islands, with impacts enduring to the present day...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to inactivate chymosin in Cheddar-type cheese curd using equine blood serum. This blood serum was added (0. 1 - 2 %, v/v) to cheesemilk at 15 °C after completion of the first phase of renneting and before aggregation of the rennet-altered casein micelles, to inhibit the residual coagulant in Cheddar-type cheeses. Throughout ripening the level of pH 4. 6 -soluble <b>nitrogen</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> a percentage of total nitrogen was significantly higher in the control cheeses than in experimental cheeses and was about twice that of the experimental cheeses after ripening for 180 days. During ripening, there was almost no hydrolysis of α s 1 -casein in the cheeses made from milk containing 0. 25 - 2 % blood serum. Throughout ripening there were large quantitative differences between the peptide profiles of control and experimental cheeses. The results of this study suggest that the addition of equine blood serum to cheesemilk (0. 25 - 2 %) was very effective at inhibiting the residual chymosin activity in Cheddar-type cheeses during ripening; the activity of plasmin remained unaffected by the added blood serum. This study describes an easy and effective method for producing cheese curd free from residual coagulant activity, which will help to study the separate roles of the coagulant and other proteolytic enzymes in cheese ripening...|$|E

40|$|Comparisons {{are made}} among three cores taken {{in deep water}} in {{different}} parts of Lake Washington in 1958 and 1959 and two cores taken at one of the same locations in 1968 and 1970. During the interval between the two sets of cores, all the sewage effluent that had been causing eutrophication of the lake was diverted, and the lake began to regress to a relatively unproductive condition. All the cores show higher concentrations of organic matter, phosphorus, and <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> a fraction of dry weight) in the top few centimeters than deeper, but in general, the higher surface values of the earlier material have decreased somewhat now that they lie below the surface in the recent cores, Nevertheless, it appears that the high phosphorus content of the sediment laid down in the years of maximum enrichment will continue to be indicated by a clear maximum, which was at a depth of 4. 0 cm in 1970. Nitrogen, although enriched in present surface sediments, does not show a corresponding older maximum, In parts of the lake, erratic, very high concentrations of phosphorus are associated with several types of particles containing much iron. Fractionation of sedimentary phosphorus by a biochemical procedure showed that a large part (70 - 80 %) of the phosphorus con-tent of the mud is acid-soluble, but that the fraction releasable by reduction decreases with depth. These conditions may be related to events in the hypolimnion; during each summer, a dense population of an undescribed iron-depositing microorganism has been observed to form...|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1973 A {{total of}} 76 samples from 16 benthic {{stations}} over the eastern Bering Sea shelf were taken between 31 January and 17 February, 1970 {{for purposes of}} assessing the quantity and distribution of benthic macrofauna. A total of 129 species or taxa were found, with an average density of 1, 133 indiv/m^ 2 and average biomass of 127 g wet/m^ 2. Species were subjected to elemental analysis for determination of organic carbon and nitrogen content, yielding average values of 5. 1 % carbon and 1. 1 % <b>nitrogen</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> percentage wet weight, which translated into biomass values of 6. 5 g C/m^ 2 and 1. 4 g N/m^ 2 averaged over all stations. Correlation studies yielded 9 species affinity groups, and regression analysis indicated that about 40 % of the variability of distribution and density of the major species could {{be accounted for by}} salinity, sediment mode particle size, depth, temperature, or dissolved oxygen, with no one factor assuming dominance. Of the 129 species or taxa, 35 account for about 80 % of total numbers, wet weight biomass, or carbon biomass, with 8 species making up over 50 % of the totals in all categories. Of these 35 major species, 8 are known to be food species of the Pacific walrus.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to study: a) the effect of thinning and treatments consisting of pruning and multinutrient fertilization on aboveground biolnass increment, growth efficiency (GE), and foliar nutrients; b) the influence of topoedaphic variables (soil nutrients, slope, aspect, and rock content) and foliar nutrients on both leaf area increment and GE; and c) the influence of topoedaphic variables on the rate of iiJneralizable N. Studies were conducted in young Douglas-fir plantations in the western Cascades of Oregon. Net aboveground biomass increment over a 6 -year period averaged 14. 5, 7. 8, and 5. 5 Mgha- 1. yr- 1 for unthinned, noderately thinned, and heavily thinned stands, respectively. Aboveground biornass increment and GE were analyzed in three 2 -year periods. Density affected aboveground biomass increment in all periods, {{and there was an}} increasingly significant treatment effect in each period, but no significant interaction between stocking density and treatment. Stand density had the major effect on GE, {{but there was also a}} significant interaction between stocking density and treatment during the 1985 -' 87 period. Foliar analysis indicated that thinning improved N, K, and Mg nutrition, and resulted in increased translocation of K from one-year old to current year foliage. Multivariate and regression analyses suggest that relative leaf area increment is correlated most closely with one or another measure of Mg, K, and N availability, whereas GE correlates most strongly with leaf area index, mineralizable N, and foliar Mg content. Mineralizable N in two soil depths did not vary significantly by stocking density, treatment, or density-treatment interaction. The rate of mineralizable <b>nitrogen</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> concentration basis averaged 49 per cent lower at the 20 - 40 cm depth than at the 0 - 20 cm depth.

In the saline group the blood ketone concentration increased to 3. 3 mmol/l on the 5 th day after surgery, but this increase was completely abolished by a daily intake of 129 g of glucose and almost completely so by 30 g of glucose.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of ASN 3 -encoded asparagine synthetase (AS, EC 6. 3. 5. 4) during vegetative growth, seed development and germination of Arabidopsis thaliana. Phenotypic analysis of knockout (asn 3 - 1) and knockdown (asn 3 - 2) T-DNA insertion mutants for the ASN 3 gene (At 5 g 10240) demonstrated wild-type contents of asparagine synthetase protein, chlorophyll and ammonium in green leaves at 35 days after sowing. In situ hybridization localized ASN 3 mRNA to phloem companion cells of vasculature. Young siliques of the asn 3 - 1 knockout line showed a decrease in asparagine but an increase in glutamate. The seeds of asn 3 - 1 and asn 3 - 2 displayed a wild-type <b>nitrogen</b> status <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> total <b>nitrogen</b> content, indicating that the repression of ASN 3 expression had only a limited effect on mature seeds. An analysis of amino acid labeling of seeds imbibed with (15 N) ammonium for 24 h revealed that asn 3 - 1 seeds contained 20 % less total asparagine while 15 N-labeled asparagine ((2 - 15 N) asparagine, (4 - 15 N) asparagine and (2, 4 - 15 N) asparagine) increased by 12 % compared to wild-type seeds.

40|$|The {{relationships}} in seasonal variability {{of milk and}} produced Edam cheese and ripening of Edam cheese and Cheddar cheese (made from goats milk) were studied. According to small changes in lactose content in milk (fluctuation 0. 09 %), the largest changes in non-fat solids of milk (fluctuation 0. 26 %) were probably affected by changes in total protein content (fluctuation 0. 21 %). Statistically there was not found any significant relationship between milk composition and cheese dry content, only negative relationship (P > 0. 05) between fat in dry matter of cheese (FDM) and total protein of milk, or cheese dry content, respectively. The influence of the starter culture on the acidifying process of cheese was proved. Better increase of the cheese acidity was found, either for cheese with 45 % FDM or with 30 % FDM, for cheese manufactured with DVS (direct vat set, Chr. Hansen, Denmark) starter cultures than in cheeses made with standard starter mesophilic cultures. The yield of 45 % FDM Edam cheese (expressed as the consumption of milk in liters necessary for 1 kg cheese production) was calculated after weighting the whole daily production of cheese. The calculated yields showed big variability during year (0. 8 l of milk per 1 kg of cheese with 55 % of total solids), {{but there was also}} big variability during one day (0. 5 l/kg). After the recalculation of all yields to 55 % of total solids in cheese, the reduction of milk consumption was proved (P > 0. 05) during the following conditions - 0. 1 l of milk consumption reduction per 0. 1 % increase of casein content in milk. The conversion factors for fat (F) and casein (C) were used for the calculation of the yield equation Y= 0. 94 *F+ 1. 18 *C, which is sufficient for the estimation and use in the factory with approximately 2 % error. The results of the cheese ripening analysis showed increase of soluble tyrosin, tryptophan and also total soluble nitrogen with the increasing ripening time. It was proved, that the real part of relative permitivity of cheese increases (for 30 % FDM and also for 40 % FDM cheese), while the specific conductivity decreases. All dielectric characteristics correlated significantly (P > 0. 05) with the amounts of tyrosin and total soluble nitrogen and highly significantly (P > 0. 01) with the amounts of tryptophan. It was proved, that the dielectric characteristics could be used as the ripening indices. The largest changes of the sensory characteristics were found in deformability, crumbliness, adhesivity and firmness between fingers and in the mouth. Significant differences (P > 0. 05) between differently ripened cheeses were found. On the other hand, there were non-significant differences {{in the case of the}} elasticity in fingers and elasticity in the mouth and these indices were found unsuitable for Edam cheese texture assessment. There seemed to be an increasing favour of the older cheese and the most fancied cheeses were the 15 wks and the 33 wks old ones. The Cheddar type cheese made from goats milk was analyzed with the support of UCC Cork, Ireland. Three levels of rennet (0. 18, 0. 37 and 0. 55 ml per liter of goats milk) were used in the cheesemaking process. It was proved that with the increasing level of residual rennet activity in cheese increases the level of proteolysis in cheese as well. The influence of rennet level was more evident in the degradation of aS-caseins than in the b-casein degradation. The cheese made with the highest rennet level (0. 55 ml/l) showed also the highest other proteolysis indices, such as pH 4. 6 soluble <b>nitrogen</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> % of total nitrogen of cheese, the level of aS-casein region degradation in terms of Urea-PAGE analysis and also the peaks of 70 % ethanol insoluble fraction of cheese as showed by RP-HPLC.

40|$|Frankia sp., the actinomycetous {{endophyte}} in nitrogen-fixing actinorhizal nodules, may differentiate {{two forms}} from its hyphae: vesicles and sporangia. In root nodules of Comptonia peregrina (L.) Coult. and Myrica gale L., sporangia may be either absent or present. Nitrogenase activity and symbiotic efficiency were contrasted in spore(+) and spore(−) nodules {{of these two}} host genera. Seedlings of C. peregrina nodulated with the spore(+) inoculum showed only 60 % of the nitrogenase activity and 50 % of the net size of their spore(−) counterparts after 12 weeks of culture. Measurements of acetylene reduction (i. e., nitrogenase activity) were coordinated with samplings of nodules for structural studies. Significant differences in acetylene reduction rates were discernible between spore(+) and spore(−) nodules commencing 4 weeks after nodulation, concomitant with the maturation of sporangia in the nodule. Spore(+) nodules ultimately reached {{less than half of}} the rate of nitrogenase activity of spore(−) nodules. Both types of nodules evolved only small amounts of molecular hydrogen, suggesting that both were equally efficient in recycling electrons lost to the reduction of hydrogen ions by nitrogenase.

Four tillage methods were used, namely conventional tillage (CT), tine tillage (TT), minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT). Crop rotation systems used were continuous wheat (WW) and wheat/ lupine/wheat/canola (WLWC). Three rates of nitrogen fertiliser (60, 100 and 140 kg N ha- 1) were applied as sub-plots. Wheat plants were sampled at tillering stage (S 1), stem elongation (S 2), flag leaf (S 3) (2000 growing season only) and anthesis (S 4). In general {{nitrogen content}} (% of plant component) decreased as the plant reached maturity. <b>Nitrogen</b> content <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> g plant- 1 and kg ha- 1 was affected by tillage method in both growing seasons, but the response depended on the amount of precipitation during the growing season. During the low rainfall year, highest N contents were found in the NT treatment. In contrast to this, CT resulted in the highest N content during high rainfall years. Significant differences in total nitrogen content in the plant (g plant- 1) due to crop rotation were observed only at the tillering and flag leaf stages. At both stages, plants from the wheat/lupine/wheat/canola system resulted in significantly higher values than those from the monoculture (wheat/wheat) plots.

This experiment investigated effects of four forage combinations being, grass silage (G); 67 g/ 100 g grass silage + 33 g/ 100 g maize silage (GGM); 67 g/ 100 g maize silage + 33 g/ 100 g grass silage (MMG); maize silage (M). All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (22. 4 g N/kg dry matter [DM]) using a concentrate mixture. Ration digestibility and N balance was determined using 7 Holstein Friesian steers (mean body weight 411. 0 +/- 120. 9 kg) in a cross-over design. Inclusion of maize silage in the diet had a positive linear effect on forage and total DM intake (P = 0. 001), and on apparent DM and organic matter digestibility (both P = 0. 048). Regardless of the silage ratio used, the metabolisable energy concentration of maize silage was calculated {{to be higher than}} that of grass silage (P = 0. 058), and linearly related to the relative proportions of the two silages in the forage mixture. Inclusion of maize silage in the diet resulted in a linear decline in the apparent digestibility of starch (P = 0. 022), neutral detergent fibre (P < 0. 001) and acid detergent fibre (P = 0. 003). <b>Nitrogen</b> retention, <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> amount retained per day or in terms of body weight (g/ 100 kg) increased linearly with maize inclusion (P = 0. 047 and 0. 046, respectively).

Objective: We investigated whether low-level exposure to air pollution is associated with gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Methods: High-quality registry information on 81, 110 singleton pregnancy outcomes in southern Sweden during 1999 - 2005 was linked to individual-level exposure estimates with high spatial resolution. Modeled exposure to <b>nitrogen</b> oxides (NOx), <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> mean concentrations per trimester, and proximity to roads of different traffic densities were used as proxy indicators of exposure to combustion-related air pollution. The data were analyzed by logistic regression, with and without adjusting for potential confounders.

The adjusted OR for acquiring preeclampsia after exposure during the third trimester was 1. 51 (1. 32, 1. 73) in the highest quartile of NOx compared with the lowest.

We used stable isotope analysis to investigate the foraging behaviour of critically endangered Mediterranean monk seals (Monachus monachus) in Greece. We measured carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> isotope ratios (<b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> δ 13 C and δ 15 N values, respectively) derived from the hair of deceased adult and juvenile seals and the muscle of their known prey to quantify their diets. We tested the hypothesis that monk seals primarily foraged for prey that occupy coastal habitats in Greece. We compared isotope values from seal hair to their coastal and pelagic prey (after correcting all prey for isotopic discrimination) and used these isotopic data and a stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportion of coastal and pelagic resources consumed by seals. As predicted, we found that seals had similar δ 13 C values as many coastal prey species and higher δ 13 C values than pelagic species; these results, in conjunction with mean dietary estimates (coastal = 61 % vs. pelagic = 39 %), suggest that seals have a diverse diet comprising prey from multiple trophic levels that primarily occupy the coast.

Their rations were fed to four Spanish goats in a 4 x 4 Latin square sequence. Relationships between fecal nitrogen and the dry matter intake, total nitrogen intake, and dry matter digestibility were evaluated. Daily feed intake, fecal output, and nitrogen balance were determined for each ration. In vivo percentage digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter and nitrogen were calculated. In vitro digestibility coefficients for ration organic matter were also determined. Feed and detergent fiber NDF, acid detergent fiber ADF, and acid detergent fiber nitrogen ADFN. Fecal <b>nitrogen</b> output <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> either grams per day or percentage nitrogen, exhibited no significant (p<. 05) relationship to either percentage digestibility, dietary nitrogen, total nitrogen intake or organic matter intake. However, percentage dietary nitrogen PDN, total nitrogen intake (TNI), and percentage nitrogen digested (PND) decreased significantly (P<. 05) as {{the level of}} liveoak leaves in the diets increased. Urinary nitrogen (UN) in g/d varied among treatments and decreased with increase in the level of liveoak leaves (P<. 05). Digestibility values differed among treatments; in vitro methods gave higher digestibility values for rations on (0 % liveoak) and two (25 % Liveoak) and significantly (P<. 05) lower value for ration four (75 % liveoak). Treatment effects for in vivo organic matter digestibility were only significant at P=. 3 level. OMI was similar for rations one, two and three; however, addition of more than 50 % liveoak leaves to the diets resulted in a significant (P< 0. 05) decrease in OMI. NDF and ADF of feed and feces were positively related to the level of liveoak leaves. However, ADEN showed a positive relationship to OMD.

Significant increase in body weight gain and feed conversion efficiency were achieved by 260 micrograms/day of IGF-I or 650 micrograms/day of IGF-II. These treatments were associated with increased nitrogen retention and increases in the fractional weights of kidneys, spleen, total gut and individual gut regions. There was an increase in the size of villi and muscularis lining the jejunum, suggesting an increased absorptive capacity of the gut. However there was no significant change in the amount of faecal <b>nitrogen</b> excretion when <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> a percentage of nitrogen intake. Interestingly, IGF-II was at least as potent as IGF-I in increasing the depth of jejunal crypts. Infusion of equivalent doses of either IGF-I or IGF-II resulted in similar increases in circulating concentrations of the respective peptides, though IGF-II infusion dose-dependently decreased plasma IGF-I concentrations from those of the controls. Plasma IGF-binding protein levels were increased by both IGF-I and IGF-II treatments, though IGF-I elicited greater responses. In summary, IGF-II can promote the growth of young female rats, although generally less potently than IGF-I. Conlon, M A; Francis, G L; Tomas, F M; Wallace, J C; Howarth, G S; Ballard, F...|$|R

The effect of roasting on feed intake, growth, dry matter and nitrogen digestibility, nitrogen utilization, carcass weight and fat thickness were determined. For both legumes, CP solubility decreased with increasing temperature and time of roasting. The decrease was slightly lower in narbon than in lupin. CP solubility of lupin was decreased from 84. 7 % (raw) to 17. 3 % (160 C, 45 min) and that of narbon from 68. 0 % (raw) to 18. 3 % (160 C, 45 min). Dry roasting had no significant (P 0. 05) by roasting. <b>Nitrogen</b> retention, <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> a percentage of nitrogen intake or {{as a percentage of}} nitrogen absorbed, was significantly (R< 0. 05) higher for lambs fed diets containing roasted narbon than for lambs fed diets containing raw narbon (as % of intake 20. 3 is 12. 3; as % of absorbed 25. 6 vs 15. 4), but was lower for lambs fed diets containing roasted lupin than those fed diets containing raw lupin (as % of intake 23. 1 vs 30. 9; as % of absorbed 27. 3 vs 37. 4). Dry roasting of lupin and narbon bean seeds decreased in vitro CP solubility and reduced ruminai disappearance of CP. Nitrogen utilization in lambs fed diets containing roasted narbon seeds was improved. Roasted lupin significantly (R 0. 05) effect on growth.

40|$|Rebound {{kinetics}} of β 2 -microglobulin after hemodialysis. BackgroundEvaluation of β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 m) removal during hemodialysis using predialysis {{and immediate}} postdialysis plasma concentrations {{is only valid}} {{in the absence of}} postdialysis rebound. Postdialysis rebound of β 2 m has not been studied extensively, and its importance in the determination of β 2 m clearance is unknown. MethodsWe evaluated the kinetics of urea and β 2 m in a crossover study of 10 chronic hemodialysis patients using dialyzers with similar urea mass transfer-area coefficients containing either low-flux cellulose acetate or high-flux cellulose triacetate membranes. Kinetics were examined during and following a 210 minute treatment by measuring plasma concentrations predialysis at regular intervals during therapy and at 0, 2, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes postdialysis. Clearances of urea and β 2 m were also determined directly from the arterial and venous concentration differences across the dialyzer at 60 minutes after starting dialysis. ResultsBy design, urea removal was similar for both low-flux and high-flux dialyzers as assessed by the urea reduction ratio and Kt/V. Postdialysis urea rebound was similar for low- and high-flux dialyzers; the rebound in the plasma urea <b>nitrogen</b> concentration (<b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> a percentage of the intradialytic decrease in plasma concentration) was 9. 2 ± 1. 9 % (mean ± SEM) at 30 minutes postdialysis and 13. 0 ± 1. 4 % at 60 minutes postdialysis for a single pool urea Kt/V of 1. 16 ± 0. 05. The plasma β 2 m concentration increased by 11. 1 ± 3. 0 % during the treatment using the low-flux dialyzer but decreased by 27. 1 ± 4. 0 % during the treatment using the high-flux dialyzer. When using the high-flux dialyzer, the rebound of β 2 m was 44. 8 ± 21. 4 % at 30 minute postdialysis and 45. 9 ± 15. 9 % at 60 minutes postdialysis. The clearance of β 2 m for the high-flux dialyzer calculated from predialysis and immediate postdialysis plasma concentrations using a single-compartment model (28. 2 ± 4. 4 ml/min) was higher (P < 0. 05) than that determined directly across the dialyzer (18. 3 ± 2. 0 ml/min). If either the 30 - or 60 -minute postdialysis plasma β 2 m concentration was used instead, the calculated β 2 m clearance (16. 5 ± 4. 8 ml/min or 15. 6 ± 2. 8 ml/min, respectively) was similar to that determined directly across the dialyzer. ConclusionsPostdialysis rebound of β 2 m when using high-flux dialyzers is substantial; neglecting postdialysis rebound results in an overestimation of β 2 m clearance when calculated using a single-compartment model...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of roughage to the concentrate ratio of complete diets containing sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB), an agro-industrial by product, as sole roughage source on nutrient utilization in ram lambs. Twenty-four Nellore × Deccani cross ram lambs aged about 3 months (average body wt. 10. 62 [*]±[*] 0. 03 kg) were randomly allotted into four groups fed with CR-I (60 R: 40 C), CR-II (50 R: 50 C), CR-III (40 R: 60 C), and CR-IV (30 R: 70 C) complete diets. The roughage to concentrate ratio {{did not affect the}} dry matter intake (in grams/day or grams/kilogram weight 0. 75). The crude protein (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) and ether extract (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) digestibility of ration CR-IV was higher than CR-I and CR-II rations, whereas, the digestibility of nitrogen-free extract and fiber fractions was similar among all the rations. Experimental diets were different (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) in digestible crude protein (DCP) content, in which the CR-I ration contained lower DCP value whereas CR-IV ration contained higher DCP value. The total digestible nutrients (TDN) and metabolizable energy (ME) values were comparable among all the experimental rations. The daily DCP intake (in grams/day) was lower (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) in lambs fed with CR-I ration compared to CR-III and CR-IV rations and it was comparable with CR-II ration. The TDN intake (in grams/day), digestible energy, and ME intakes (in megajoules/day) were similar among the lambs fed experimental rations with different SSB to concentrate ratios. The average daily DCP intake of lambs fed with CR-II, CR-III, and CR-IV rations met the requirements whereas, the daily TDN and ME intake was met by all the lambs. The lambs on all the diets were in positive nitrogen retention. The <b>nitrogen</b> balance <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> grams/day was higher (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) in lambs fed with CR-III and CR-IV ration than those fed with CR-I ration. The daily calcium and phosphorus intake and balance were comparable on all the experimental rations. The total purine derivatives (in millimoles/day) were higher (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) in CR-III than CR-I and comparable with CR-II and CR-IV diets. The higher (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) microbial N supply (in grams/day) was observed in CR-III ration compared to other three rations and the efficiency of microbial synthesis was comparable among all the rations. It is concluded that sweet sorghum bagasse can be included in the complete rations at maximum level of 50 % as roughage source for rearing of ram lambs...|$|R
40|$|Deforestation {{and forest}} {{degradation}} {{in the tropics}} may substantially alter soil N-oxide emissions. It is particularly relevant to accurately quantify those changes to properly account for them in a REDD+ climate change mitigation scheme that provides financial incentives to reduce the emissions. With this study we provide updated land use (LU) -based emission rates (104 studies, 392 N 2 O and 111 NO case studies), we determine the trend and magnitude of flux changes with land-use change (LUC) using a meta-analysis approach (44 studies, 135 N 2 O and 37 NO cases) and evaluate biophysical drivers of N 2 O and NO emissions and emission changes for the tropics. The average N 2 O and NO emissions in intact upland tropical forest amounted to 2. 0 ± 0. 2 (n = 90) and 1. 7 ± 0. 5 (n = 36) kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, respectively. In agricultural soils annual N 2 O emissions were exponentially related to N fertilization rates and average water-filled pore space (WFPS) whereas in non-agricultural sites a Gaussian response to WFPS fit better with the observed NO and N 2 O emissions. The sum of soil N 2 O and NO fluxes and the ratio of N 2 O to NO increased exponentially and significantly with increasing <b>nitrogen</b> availability (<b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> NO 3 − / [NO 3 − +NH 4 +]) and WFPS, respectively; following the conceptual Hole-In-the-Pipe model. Nitrous and nitric oxide fluxes did not increase significantly overall {{as a result of}} LUC (Hedges's d of 0. 11 ± 0. 11 and 0. 16 ± 0. 19, respectively), however individual LUC trajectories or practices did. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased significantly after intact upland forest conversion to croplands (Hedges's d = 0. 78 ± 0. 24) and NO increased significantly following the conversion of low forest cover (secondary forest younger than 30 years, woodlands, shrublands) (Hedges's d of 0. 44 ± 0. 13). Forest conversion to fertilized systems significantly and highly raised both N 2 O and NO emission rates (Hedges's d of 1. 03 ± 0. 23 and 0. 52 ± 0. 09, respectively). Changes in nitrogen availability and WFPS were the main factors explaining changes in N 2 O emissions following LUC, therefore it is important that experimental designs monitor their spatio-temporal variation. Gaps in the literature on N oxide fluxes included geographical gaps (Africa, Oceania) and LU gaps (degraded forest, wetland (notably peat) forest, oil palm plantation and soy cultivation) ...|$|R
