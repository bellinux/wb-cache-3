25|$|The tee {{shots on}} Holes 1, 3, 8, 15 and 17 are blind, {{and there are}} several blind {{approach}} shots on Holes 2, 6 and 14. The second and third shots at Hole 9 are blind, depending on length. There also are several holes that are semi-blind; the surface of the green cannot be seen when playing approach shots on Holes 5, 10, 18, and on 15 (for the long hitter). These blind shots are only blind once. Still, they do make Wykagyl difficult to play for a golfer who has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> Wykagyl is unique in its mix of par threes, par fours and par fives. Most 18-hole courses have four par threes, four par fives and ten par fours, but Wykagyl has five par fives, five par threes and eight par fours.|$|E
2500|$|Planet Earth: As You've <b>Never</b> <b>Seen</b> <b>It</b> <b>Before,</b> {{written by}} Alastair Fothergill with a {{foreword}} by David Attenborough, {{was published in}} hardback on 5 October 2006 (...) [...]|$|E
6000|$|... "Indians skulking on {{the harbor}} island!" [...] the good woman exclaimed, when Mark had hurriedly told his story {{and her face}} paled as the lads had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] Ralph exclaimed to himself. [...] "She loves me! Why did I <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>before?</b> She's {{going to}} cry; no, but she can't speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know. I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> open <b>before.</b> I think <b>it</b> {{must have}} been left unclosed by accident. We will <b>see</b> where <b>it</b> leads to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Tom, I-- I----" [...] Twice Dick {{tried to}} go on and failed. He looked at both of his brothers, and his face showed {{something}} that they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> in <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You villain," [...] she said, and {{her face}} was transfigured with passion as he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> horrible. [...] "You villain!" [...] she said thickly. [...] "What have you come here for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't be," [...] he cried, tearing {{himself from}} the piano to make a hasty march {{across the room and}} stand contemplating the Keith on the {{opposite}} wall as if he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
60|$|The run to Ithaca {{took several}} hours, and they lunched at noon {{in the dining}} car. It was a {{beautiful}} day, and the boys enjoyed the scenery as much {{as if they had}} <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now this {{bringing}} {{in of the}} mummy was a very ancient rite, but one that had fallen into general disuse, so that as it chanced Tua, who had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> practised <b>before,</b> looked on <b>it</b> with curiosity not unmingled with disgust.|$|R
60|$|I took Van Sweller {{to my own}} rooms--to my room. He had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{anything}} like <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{those words}} he {{suddenly}} checked himself. His face flushed, his eyes brightened; he pushed away the cup which {{had just been}} filled for him, and rose from his seat. The landlady started back a step. There was something in her lodger's face that she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> in <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was a long}} walk, but a {{pleasant}} one, {{and they did not}} mind it a bit. Late in the afternoon they drew near to the wonderful tin castle of the Emperor of the Winkies, and Ojo and Scraps, who had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> were filled with amazement.|$|E
60|$|And {{the hill}} near us was Mount Eryx. I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> So I had {{imagined}} a {{mountain in the}} sky. But {{it was only a}} hill, with undistinguishable cluster of a village on the summit, where even now cold wisps of vapour caught. They say it is 2,500 feet high. Still it looks only a hill.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{night of}} the murder he had gone out at about nine o'clock. That was the last his {{servants}} had seen of him. With regard to the revolver, all four servants swore positively that they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> and that, unless Mr. Cohen had bought it that very day, it did not belong to their master.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, what {{a lovely}} bonnet," [...] said that lady, in false ecstasy. [...] "What a perfect beauty! Iâ€™ve <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{anything}} like <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> Never!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{engaged to}} Minnie," [...] whispered {{the latter to}} the Rovers at the first opportunity. [...] "We {{are going to be}} married just as soon as my income will permit. And what do you think? I've sold four more poems--got eighty dollars for them," [...] and his face beamed as they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> shine <b>before.</b>|$|R
60|$|Drexley looked up. There was {{the dull}} {{hopelessness}} of despair in his bloodshot eyes. Douglas, who had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything like <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> felt an unaccountable sense of depression sweep in upon him.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood looking}} at her, after he dropped the pear-bough, and seeing her mere beauty as he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> The bees hummed in the blossoms, which gave out a dull, sweet smell; the {{sunshine}} had the luxurious, enervating warmth of spring. He started suddenly from his reverie: Marcia had said something. [...] "I beg your pardon?" [...] he queried.|$|E
60|$|Of all the enigmas which ever confronted a girl {{there can}} have been seldom one like that which {{followed}} Henchard's announcement of himself to Elizabeth as her father. He {{had done it}} in an ardour and an agitation which had half carried the point of affection with her; yet, behold, from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained as she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "A minute passed, {{and then}} he entered. He was wearing a new suit of a louder pattern, if possible, than before. I think he must have {{designed}} it himself. He looked hot and greasy. He did not offer to shake hands, but sat down awkwardly on the extreme edge of a small chair, and gaped about the room {{as if he had}} <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many of the 1.5 million patrons wore {{white to}} symbolize peace. The BBC's Michael Voss, {{who was at}} the five-and-a-half hour concert, said there was a mood of {{excitement}} as many residents of the isolated, music-loving island had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything like <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{anything}} like <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> Mrs. Malony," [...] she said. [...] "It was quite quiet {{where we lived}} in London, and here, with the street cars and the elevated railways and the clanging of bells, there never {{seems to be a}} moment's peace." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no token {{that the}} storm might be losing its force; {{in fact it}} seemed to me as if it {{increased}} momentarily, if indeed such could be the case when the wind was raging, the rain falling and the thunder pealing as I had <b>never</b> heard or <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] she cried, {{picking up}} the pocket-handkerchief, [...] "if that don't make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!" [...] Mrs. Pocket {{received}} her property, at first {{with a look of}} unutterable surprise as if she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> and then with a laugh of recognition, and said, [...] "Thank you, Flopson," [...] and forgot me, and went on reading.|$|E
60|$|That {{night the}} {{champagne}} appeared, and, feeling his wife's eyes upon him, Morris swallowed two whole glasses, and in consequence was quite cheerful, {{for he had}} eaten little--circumstances under which champagne exhilarates--for a little while. Then {{they went into the}} drawing-room and talked themselves into silence about nothing in particular, after which Morris began to wander round the room and contemplate the furniture as though he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gallilee {{moistened}} his dry lips. [...] "I think I'll take a chair, if {{you will}} allow me," [...] he said. Having taken his chair (at a respectful distance from his wife), he looked all round {{the room with the}} air of a visitor who had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> [...] "How very pretty!" [...] he remarked softly. [...] "Such taste in colour. I think the carpet was your own design, wasn't it? How chaste!" ...|$|E
60|$|Trevor {{caught it}} neatly in one hand, and stood {{staring at it}} {{as if he had}} <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{anything}} like <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> And yet he had--often. For what he had caught was a little golden bat, about an inch long by an eighth of an inch wide.|$|R
2500|$|I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{anything}} like <b>it</b> <b>before</b> or since, and I {{have spent a}} lot of time where the night sky could be seen well. [...] This suggests that the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an interstellar visitation.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, {{after the}} end of World War II, the mysterious {{organization}} C.A.N.Y. emerged to conquer the world using superweapons <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> <b>It</b> is composed by high-ranking international military officials. Six best fighters, who together form a team called Strikers, have been chosen secretly by United Military Headquarters for a mission against this threat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if there's a {{story we}} must have it," [...] said Anne. [...] "Let's sit right down here among the {{narcissi}} and Diana will tell it. Why, girls, {{there are hundreds of}} them [...] . they've spread over everything. It looks as if the garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined. This is a discovery worth making. To think that I've lived within a mile of this place for six years and have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before!</b> Now, Diana." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps. We were in {{the front}} row, an' 'Home an' Friends' came on early. Vickery touched me on the knee when the number went up. 'If you see {{anything}} that strikes you,' he says, 'drop me a hint'; {{then he went on}} clicking. We saw London Bridge an' so forth an' so on, an' it was most interestin'. I'd <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> You 'eard a little dynamo like buzzin', but the pictures were the real thing--alive an' movin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of {{a sudden}} the house they had bought for a whim stood up as she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> low-fronted, broad-winged, ample, {{prepared}} by course of generations for all such things. As it had steadied her when it lay desolate, so now that it had meaning from their few months of life within, it soothed and promised good. She went alone and quickly into the hall, and kissed either door-post, whispering: [...] "Be good to me. You know! You've never failed in your duty yet." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{date was}} then rescheduled from June 2010 to September of that year, and Rihanna {{revealed}} to Daily Mail some {{details about the}} book: [...] "It's gonna be a book {{with all of these}} images that people have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> <b>It's</b> like a backstage pass, like a fashion book." [...] To MTV, she reiterated those comments: ...|$|R
60|$|The lid was {{fastened}} down {{by several}} twists of wire; Dolph loosened {{them with a}} trembling hand, and on lifting the lid, behold! the vessel was filled with broad golden pieces, of a coinage which he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before!</b> <b>It</b> was evident he had lit on the place where Killian Vander Spiegel had concealed his treasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a very {{delicate}} thing," [...] said he. [...] "One does not like to speak of one's domestic affairs to strangers. It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one's wife with two men whom I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> <b>It's</b> horrible {{to have to do}} it. But I've got to the end of my tether, and I must have advice." ...|$|R
