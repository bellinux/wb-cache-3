40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{treating}} 35 humeral shaft fractures with antegrade nailing in patients {{between the ages of}} 25 and 92 (mean 64. 5) : 14 patients were aged between 25 and 59, and 21 between 66 and 92. The <b>nail</b> was <b>set</b> in place proximally with a spiral blade and distally with 1 or 2 screws. In the first 14 cases, uncannulated humeral nailing (UHN) was carried out, and in the next 21 cannulated humeral nailing (CHN). The latter technique uses a guide wire which, in cases of an error in the length of the nail, is useful in that it allows another <b>nail</b> to be <b>set</b> in place. Main outcome parameters were fracture healing, shoulder discomfort, and radial nerve recovery. The DASH functional scoring system, modified according to Beaton et al. for subjective assessment was used, and range of motion was checked with the constant score. X-rays were used to assess fracture healing time and cases of malunion. Two patients developed non-union, one caused by a UHN which was too short, and the other by a nail blocked distally by a single screw. In 7 patients, consolidation was achieved, but with varus between 3 and 8 degrees (mean 5 degrees), without aesthetic or functional damage. In 33 out of 35 patients, shoulder functionality had mean DASH score results of 21. 9, whereas shoulder range of motion reached a mean constant score (CS) of 26. 5 (78. 8 %) with respect to the opposite shoulder. In 5 cases of stiffness, the UHN turned out to be insufficiently buried. Results improved with the CHN. Much better results were seen in the group of patients aged between 25 and 59 (mean age 43), but worse in older ones (66 – 92 years, mean age 78). Radial nerve palsy after surgery occurred in 2 cases, and the nerve was immediately examined. It {{did not appear to be}} trapped in the fracture in either case, and recovery was complete 6 months later. CHN appears to be a valid solution, both in younger patients, thanks to excellent results, and in older ones, who have fewer functional requirements...|$|R
40|$|Blue {{light is}} emitted {{from a variety}} of light sources and can damage the retinal {{photoreceptor}} cells, potentially exacerbating age-related macular degeneration. A widening array of bright energy‐efficient sources are available, particularly white LED lamps. However, few systematic occupational health studies of blue light exposure and effects have been carried out. Assessment of blue light exposure in the occupational visual field (OVF) is complex and most hygienists are unfamiliar with the methodological issues. This exploratory study briefly examines published work on occupational blue light exposure and describes a methodology for a workplace case scenario. A narrative literature review was undertaken using a hazard/exposure/control framework. Worker and public exposure to blue light in a <b>nail</b> salon <b>setting</b> were explored, {{in order to understand the}} various exposure factors, including directionality. Worst case and typical situations were considered. Integrated effective spectral radiances from the nail resin curing lamp in the occupational visual field were recorded with a spectroradiometer, modified with a customised imaging attachment. This preliminary review indicates that most previous exposure studies have been screening in nature, based on source characteristics and simple task assessment. What is required now is the gathering of robust exposure data that will support future epidemiology and risk communication. A key consideration is the initial determination of the OVF, and whether or not blue light is present in a significant region of the field, for how long and at what radiance.

40|$|Presently, no {{guidelines}} {{exist as}} to whether or not a surgeon should extract implanted tibial intramedullary nails after fracture healing; this article offers useful information to help surgeons decide which factors correlate to removing intramedullary nails. Methods: This study involved a retrospective chart analysis of 1 physician’s office over 9 years; 130 patients were examined with 134 traumatic tibial fractures. Pathological fractures were excluded, as were patients younger than 16, and those older than 70. A titanium locked reamed tibial nail (DePuy ACE or Synthes) was utilized, and each patient was tracked until fracture union. 2 patients required removal of the intramedullary nail secondary to infection and non-union and were excluded. Symptoms after healing included anterior knee pain, tibial pain, and pain over the locking bolts.

40|$|Intramedullary (IM) nailing is {{currently}} the most common method for treating patients with impending pathologic humeral fractures; however, this treatment is associated with known complications primarily owing to violation of the rotator cuff during insertion. A better option is needed. To determine if a humeral segmental replacement prosthesis would provide a stronger construct compared with an IM <b>nail</b> in this <b>setting,</b> we compared the mechanical properties of these two devices in a cadaver model simulating an impending pathologic fracture. In each of nine matched pairs of fresh human humeri one was randomly selected to undergo a 50 % lateral middiaphyseal defect simulating an impending pathologic fracture and subsequent fixation with an IM nail and bone cement. The contralateral humerus underwent fixation using a humeral segmental defect prosthesis. We determined T-scores using DEXA. Each specimen subsequently was tested in torsion to failure. Peak torque and peak rotation at failure were greater for the prosthesis specimens whereas torsional stiffness was greater for the IM nail specimens. We found a linear relationship between peak torque and T-score for each device with {{the slopes of the}} lines suggesting the construct with the prosthesis can withstand greater forces than the IM nail and the differences between devices were greater in weaker bones...|$|R
5000|$|The Dutch Informal Group, {{preceding}} {{the formation of}} the Nul group, was founded in 1958. Until early 1961 its members showed works in oils or pigments mixed with plaster and sand, usually on panels, linen or jute. The group replaced the expression of emotions in paint with an attempt at an absence of 'personal signature', resulting in colourless and monochrome works virtually devoid of form or composition. In 1958 Henk Peeters saw the work of Lucio Fontana and Alberto Burri for the first time, at the Venice Biennale. Fontana’s escape ‘from the prison of the flat surface’ by piercing or slicing up the canvas and Burri’s material, burnt plastic, made a big impression on him. [...] Burri and Fontana played a vital role in the transition from paint on canvas or panel to the use of industrial materials and the abandonment of the flat surface. Barely a year later, in 1959, Henk Peeters burned two rows of holes in a painting, 1959-03, and Armando <b>set</b> <b>nails</b> in the ends of a panel, Espace Criminal (10 zwarte spijkers op zwart; 10 Black Nails on Black). These works marked a transitional phase from the informal painting to Nul work; they are iconoclastic intermediate steps Peeters and Armando were taking on their new path. Henderikse also turned his back on painting in 1959, with assemblages of everyday objects, and toward 1960 Schoonhoven strived, in frozen, increasingly whiter reliefs, ‘by avoiding intentional form [...] [...] [...] for a much greater organic reality of the artificial in and of itself.’ These are works that, according to Schoonhoven, offer the possibility ‘to arrive at an objectively neutral expression of the generally applicable.’ ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nail biting (NB) is a {{very common}} {{unwanted}} behavior. The majority of children are motivated to stop NB and have already tried to stop it, but are generally unsuccessful in doing so. It is a difficult behavior to modify or treat. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence of co-morbid psychiatric disorders in a clinical sample of children with NB who present at a child and adolescent mental healthcare outpatient clinic and the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in their parents. Method A consecutive sample of 450 referred children was examined for NB and 63 (14 %) were found to have NB. The children and adolescents with nail biting and their parents were interviewed according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. They were also asked about lip biting, head banging, skin biting, and hair pulling behaviors. Results Nail biting is common amongst children and adolescents referred to a child and adolescent mental health clinic. The most common co-morbid psychiatric disorders in these children were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (74. 6 %), oppositional defiant disorder (36 %), separation anxiety disorder (20. 6 %), enuresis (15. 6 %), tic disorder (12. 7 %) and obsessive compulsive disorder (11. 1 %). The rates of major depressive disorder, mental retardation, and pervasive developmental disorder were 6. 7 %, 9. 5 %, 3. 2 %, respectively. There was no association between the age of onset of nail biting and the co-morbid psychiatric disorder. Severity and frequency of NB were not associated with any co-morbid psychiatric disorder. About 56. 8 % of the mothers and 45. 9 % of the fathers were suffering from at least one psychiatric disorder. The most common psychiatric disorder found in these parents was major depression. Conclusion Nail biting presents in a significant proportion of referrals to a mental healthcare clinic <b>setting.</b> <b>Nail</b> biting should be routinely looked for and asked for in the child and adolescent mental healthcare setting because it is common in a clinical population, easily visible in consultation and relatively unintrusive to ask about. If present, its detection can then be followed by looking for other more subtle stereotypic or self-mutilating behaviors. </p...|$|R
40|$|The beamline E 4 is {{equipped}} with a double-crystal monochromator (Si [111]) of a fixed exit type running windowless in the UHV. It {{is one of the few}} available XAFS spectrometers in Europe allowing measurements of extended absorption fine structures in the “middle ” energy range from 2. 8 to 5 KeV, usually cut off by a thick protective beryllium window at the front end. The continous spectral distribution emitted at a bending magnet, and the optics combining a flat C, Ni, or Au mirror with a focussing Au mirror provide optimal conditions for smooth and rapid EXAFS scans up to k 22 Å− 1 essentially free from spectral contamination by harmonics (< 10 − 6). The recent installation of a digitally controlled piezo drive (DMOSTAB) <b>nailing</b> reliably the <b>set</b> point at the rocking curve within 0. 2 % to the preset value improves substantially the quality of extended scans up to 2 KeV or more beyond the threshold. The thus achieved precision of the instrument allows to reveal the effect of the so-called worm error inherent to the mechanical goniometer drives on extended absorption spectra. The manufacturer of the goniometers (Huber type 410) guarantees that the unavoidable angular error is minimized to ≤ 10 ” with a periodicity of 1 ◦. Since the Bragg angle of the monochromator is read from the mechanical drive (via the number of steps moved by the stepper motor drives) the worm error of goniometers enters into the energy scale of the spectrometer. This well known problem has been so far considered to be relevant only for the accurate determination of the absolute energy scale, and is usually solved by the implementation of a optical encoder (Heidenhain, δΘ/Θ ≤ 10 − 5), or much less precise diffractive energy calibrators. The designers of the spectrometer E 4 [1],[2] were convinced that the absolute energy scale may be precisely calibrated using absorption edges, and thus decided to read the relative variation of the Bragg angle only from the number of motor steps. However, the periodic worm error of the goniometer has also a significant effect on the relative energy scale, i. e. its linearity. It may be so strong that it is detrimental to the “true ” energy dependence of the absorption. - 2. 2 - 2 - 1. 8 - 1. ...|$|R
