40|$|The article {{presents}} modern methods of hydraulic design of an innovative small diameter gravity sewerage system. In this system, domestic wastewater is preliminary treated in septic tanks equipped with outlet filters, thus the effluent features {{are similar to}} those of clear water. Innovative <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> at the <b>outlets</b> eliminate introduction of air to the system and thus the flows can be treated as one-phase ones. Computer codes EPANET 2 and SWMM 5. 0 were applied and compared. Two flow schemes typical for the sewerage system were implemented in EPANET 2, and the third - in a slightly modified SWMM 5. 0. Simulation results were validated on empirical data obtained on a laboratory physical model, consisting of four tanks of minimum volumes 600 dm 3 each, connecting PE pipelines of diameters 25 mm and 36 mm and relevant sanitary fittings. Water inflows, typical for domestic wastewater outflows from single homesteads, were provided by a pump. Water flows were measured using water meters with pulse outputs, and water levels in tanks by pressure transducers. Hydraulic characteristics of filters and <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> were provided. Simulation results showed good agreement with the empirical data. Ranges of values of design parameters, needed for successful application of both codes, were established and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Humphrey's pump {{consists}} of a large U-shaped tube, filled with water. One end is sealed by a heavy cast iron 'combustion head'. The combustion head contains the inlet and exhaust valves, the ignition source and withstands {{the pressure of the}} combustion chamber. Water enters the pump through sprung inlet valves below the combustion chamber. A distinctive feature of the Humphrey pump, compared to others, is that the water only has to flow through this single set of valves: there are no <b>non-return</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>valves,</b> only the inertia of the delivered water within the outlet pipe is used to control its flow. As there are no delivery valves opening and closing suddenly, the water flow changes smoothly, avoiding water hammer and the usual problems for this type of pump.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> are {{installed}} below ground {{and can be}} used to pneumatically lock the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> closed thus containing a site {{in the event of a}} spill.|$|R
50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to lock sites using pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> during the loading or transferring of chemicals or hazardous waste. Pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> {{have a longer}} service life when compared to pneumatic bladder systems.|$|R
50|$|A {{pneumatic}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inhalation {{closes the}} {{mouthpiece}} exhalation <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> and draws gas through the inhalation <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b> The pressure drop draws {{the contents of}} the outer bellows through the scrubber, inhalation hose, <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> and mouthpiece to the diver. As the concentric bellows contract, the pressure in the inner bellows increases and first closes the internal <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> then pushes its contents through the outer <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> discharging to the surroundings.When the bellows is fully contracted, the bottom cover triggers the gas addition valves which inject gas until the diver stops inhaling and the bottom cover no longer presses against the addition valve actuator.If the gas in the breathing circuit has been compressed by an increase in depth, the gas volume will be even less and the addition valves will be triggered for longer, bringing the volume back to the appropriate level. The RB80 uses two addition valves in parallel, so that if one fails, the other will provide the required gas.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} where a normal <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> would be ineffective. This is for example {{where there is}} a risk of flood water {{entering}} a site but an equal risk of pollution or a chemical spills leaving a site and polluting the environment.|$|R
50|$|The loop {{configuration}} uses a one directional {{circulation of}} the breathing gas which on exhalation leaves the mouthpiece, {{passes through a}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> into the exhalation hose, and then through the counterlung and scrubber, {{to return to the}} mouthpiece through the inhalation hose and another <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> when the diver inhales.|$|R
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|R
5000|$|A check <b>valve,</b> clack <b>valve,</b> <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> reflux valve, or one-way valve is a valve that {{normally}} allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it {{in only one}} direction.|$|R

25|$|Later helmets {{include a}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> where the airline is connected, which {{prevents}} potentially fatal helmet squeeze if {{the pressure in}} the hose is lost.|$|R
5000|$|Air {{was drawn}} from outside the smokebox through a pair of <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> into the exhaust ports, from where it was {{compressed}} into the steam chests.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{technical}} developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on 5 Stuart Turner patents which include sealing crankcases, padding crankcases to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> into the transfer port, with ball races for the main bearings and deflector type piston. The inlet <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> {{is the subject of}} another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.|$|R

2500|$|Sutton Wick air crash, {{in which}} a wrongly-fitted <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> caused fuel {{starvation}} on an RAF Blackburn Beverley transport aircraft in 1957, leading it to crash and burst into flames near Abingdon-on-Thames ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is a long}} {{tube with}} a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> running subcutaneously from the {{peritoneum}} to the internal jugular vein in the neck, which allows ascitic fluid to pass directly into the systemic circulation.|$|R
50|$|The exhaled {{gas expands}} the counterlungs, {{and some of}} it flows into the inner bellows. On inhalation, the diver only {{breathes}} from the outer counterlung - return flow from the inner bellows is blocked by a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b> The inner bellows also connects to another <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> opening to the outside environment, and thus the gas from the inner bellows is dumped from the circuit in a fixed proportion of the volume of the inhaled breath. If the counterlung volume is reduced sufficiently for the rigid cover to activate the feed gas demand valve, gas will be added until the diver finishes that inhalation.|$|R
25|$|A {{main supply}} <b>valve</b> with <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> which {{supplies}} gas {{to the main}} gas supply hose of the umbilical. This is usually a quarter-turn valve, as it must be quick to operate and obvious whether it is open or closed.|$|R
500|$|In {{response}} to the disaster at Sutton Wick, the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> was redesigned to make such an error impossible. Aviation author Graham Perry wrote that, after the crash, [...] "airworthiness design standards were changed so that the threads {{at either end of}} all such valves manufactured since are now made totally different from each other. Items like a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> simply cannot now be assembled in the wrong sense." [...] Nevertheless, Perry wrote, [...] " [...] would be amazed how many people have still tried {{to do so in the}} forty-seven years since, most realising their mistake after looking in the manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who had gone before them and made it impossible." ...|$|R
50|$|Exhalation {{closes the}} {{mouthpiece}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> in the inhalation hose and pushes gas through the exhalation hose to the bellows counterlungs which will expand {{to accommodate the}} exhaled volume. If there is an excess beyond {{the capacity of the}} fully expanded bellows, as will occur if the gas expands due to a decrease in ambient pressure during ascent, the excess gas will simply pass out through the inner counterlung's <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> to the surroundings. The design of internal ducting leads water in the exhalation side of the loop into the inner counterlung bellows, and from there it is discharged to the surroundings along with the gas during the inhalation stage of the cycle.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{reorientation}} of interfaces is key to efficient distributive mixing. However, how to achieve reorientation is not well known. This paper describes how interfaces can be reoriented in screw extruders and which method leads to the most effective reorientation. A new mixing device was developed to achieve highly efficient reorientation. This mixer can produce excellent mixing quality over a short axial length, as short as one diameter. This makes it possible to incorporate this new mixer into the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> of an injection molding screw. Results will be presented from injection molding studies that compare the mixing action of the new mixing <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> to other mixing devices...|$|R

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of the twin hose regulator is packaged in a usually circular metal housing mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver's neck. The demand valve component of a two-stage twin hose regulator is thus mounted in the same housing as the first stage regulator, {{and in order to}} prevent free-flow, the exhaust valve must be located at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of corrugated rubber hoses to and from the mouthpiece. The supply hose is connected {{to one side of the}} regulator body and supplies air to the mouthpiece through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> and the exhaled air is returned to the regulator housing on the outside of the diaphragm, also through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> on the other side of the mouthpiece and usually through another <b>non-return</b> exhaust <b>valve</b> in the regulator housing - often a [...] "duckbill" [...] type.|$|R
50|$|<b>Non-return</b> <b>valves</b> were fitted which, {{under certain}} conditions, caused {{both ends of}} the {{high-pressure}} cylinder to be in communication, with the result that the piston would be floating and the low-pressure cylinders would be receiving high-pressure steam, thus converting the engine to simplex working.|$|R
50|$|The breathing/buoyancy bag is {{fitted with}} a <b>non-return</b> release <b>valve</b> which allows air {{to escape from the}} bag as the user ascends towards the surface and the water {{pressure}} decreases. The wearer can close this valve on reaching the surface, the air in the breathing/buoyancy bag then serving as a life preserver. If the bag becomes deflated while the wearer is on the surface awaiting rescue, it can be refilled (for use as a lifejacket) by opening the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> and blowing through the mouthpiece.|$|R
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is the Fluidyne engine (Fluidyne heat pump), which uses hydraulic pistons {{to implement the}} Stirling cycle. The work produced by a Fluidyne engine goes into pumping the liquid. In its simplest form, the engine contains a working gas, a liquid, and two <b>non-return</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{supplying}} {{air to the}} bag is through blowing into a blowpipe, or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover {{the tip of the}} blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> that eliminates this need.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} in pressure between {{the surface and}} the diver can be so great that if the air line is cut at the surface {{and there is no}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> the diver would be partly squeezed into the helmet by the external pressure, and injured or possibly killed.|$|R
50|$|Valve {{positions}} are operating conditions {{determined by the}} position of the disc or rotor in the valve. Some valves are made to be operated in a gradual change between two or more positions. Return <b>valves</b> and <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> allow fluid to move in 2 or 1 directions respectively.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the crank}} and {{connecting}} rod system, all elements for constructing a steam engine (invented in 1712) — Hero's aeolipile (generating steam power), the cylinder and piston (in metal force pumps), <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> (in water pumps), gearing (in water mills and clocks) — were known in Roman times.|$|R
25|$|Between the {{regulator}} and hose, and ideally between hose and torch on both oxygen and fuel lines, a flashback arrestor and/or <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> (check valve) should be installed to prevent flame or oxygen-fuel mixture being pushed back into either cylinder and damaging the equipment or causing a cylinder to explode.|$|R
50|$|The Vespa ET2 scooter had a 50 cc {{two-stroke}} engine in which air was admitted through the transfer port and a rich fuel mixture was {{injected into the}} cylinder near the spark plug just before ignition. The injection system was purely mechanical, using a timed pumping cylinder and a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|Managing {{fire water}} {{frequently}} {{requires that the}} water be contained on site and then removed from site for specialised treatment. One of the recognised techniques is to contain the fire water in the drainage system using pneumatic bladders or lockable <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> which can be activated either automatically or manually.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine oil}} system {{is of the}} dry sump type, a {{combined}} pressure and scavenge oil pump {{is driven by the}} inlet camshaft gear, later versions of the T140 employed additional integral <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent oil draining into the sump. The frame of the T140 serves as the engine oil reservoir.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{locomotive}} is coupled to the vehicles, the driver moves the brake {{control to the}} [...] "release" [...] position and air is exhausted from the train pipe, creating a partial vacuum. Air in {{the upper part of}} the brake cylinders is also exhausted from the train pipe, through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
