When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E

40|$|This CRADA has {{combined}} {{the resources of}} a national laboratory and an innovative small company to evaluate and refine a revolutionary system for testing aspheric optics. This system uses special computer-generated holograms (CGHs), known as diffractive <b>null</b> <b>correctors</b> (DNCs), to achieve versatile and reliable measurements of aspheric optical components. The hardware is specifically designed to be compatible with existing test equipment common to most optical manufacturers. Traditionally, the high costs associated with testing aspheric components have significantly limited their use. Through the activities of this CRADA Diffraction International {{has been able to}} commercialize a novel testing system that enables optics manufacturers to test aspheric optical components using their existing interferometric test equipment. As a result, the benefits of aspheric optical systems (high performance, compact size, and light weight) can be realized in new applications where cost has previously been prohibitive. The Diffraction International ``CGH Null Adapter`` is available to the optics manufacturing industry at an attractive price. This product effectively reduces the entry level cost of testing aspheric optics with CGHs by an order of magnitude. The low cost hardware is backed with the support of world class expertise in the design and application of CGHs for aspheric testing. The combination will significantly advance {{the state of the art}} in aspheric optical testing equipment available to optics manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 39 Optical systems {{known as}} "null correctors" are often {{required}} to test certain aspheric optical surfaces. This report classifies these systems {{on the basis}} of their first -order geometry and analyzes the merits of each type. The behavior of optical aberrations, especially spherical aberration, in these systems is examined in the context of computer optimization techniques, particular attention being given to some design problems unique to null correcting systems. Orthonormal concepts are applied to the problem of reducing spherical aberration in <b>null</b> <b>correctors.</b> It is shown that exceedingly simple merit functions may be constructed to streamline the optimization process. These merit functions are composed of simple linear sums of the angular spherical aberration coefficients B 1, B 3, B 5, and B 7. Thus, minimizing the following sums will improve nearly diffraction - limited systems: (- 13 B 1 + 1 B 3 - g' B 5 - B 7), (4. 131 - B 3 - B 5), (- 2 B 1 - B 3), and (- B 1) / 1 - 5 - 3 / 7 3 or (120 B 3 + 960 B 5 + 840 B 7), (840 B 5 + 2520 B 7), and (840 B 7) Non -diffraction - limited systems may be optimized by minimizing the sums (6 B 3 + 5 B 5 + 5 B 7), (p B 5 + 3 B 7), and (1 0 B 7) To demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques discussed, the process of designing a specific null correcting system is followed in detail...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the mirror}} will be ground {{to what the}} <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> reports as the right prescription, it is {{critical}} that the <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> be itself correct. An error in building the <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> led to the mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope being ground to the wrong shape. [...] Less famously, this has happened in other cases as well, such as the New Technology Telescope. [...] Originally, there was no easy way to test a <b>null</b> <b>corrector,</b> so mirror fabricators needed to take extra care that the lenses were correct and spaced correctly (this second part, spacing, was the source of the Hubble <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> failure). With the advent of computer-generated holograms, it is now possible to create a hologram with the phase response of an arbitrary mirror. Such a hologram can be made to analytically duplicate the phase response of the desired mirror, then be tested with the <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> just as the real mirror would be tested. If the combination looks like a spherical mirror to the interferometer, then both the <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> and the hologram are correct with high probability, since the <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> and the hologram are constructed independently by different procedures.

40|$|There are {{two basic}} areas of {{interest}} for diffractive optics. In the first, the property of wavefront division is exploited for achieving optical fanout, analogous to the more familiar electrical fanout of electronic circuitry. The basic {{problem here is that}} when using a simple uniform diffraction grating the energy input is divided unevenly among the output beams. The other area of interest is the use of diffractive elements to replace or supplement standard refractive elements such as lenses. Again, local grating variations can be used to control the amount of bending imparted to optical rays, and the efficiency of the diffractive element will depend on how closely the element can be matched to the design requirements. In general, production restrictions limit how closely the element approaches the design, and for the common case of photolithographic production, a series of binary masks is required to achieve high efficiency. The actual design process is much more involved than in the case of elements for optical fanout, as the desired phase of the optical wavefront over some reference plane must be specified and the phase alteration to be introduced at each point by the diffraction element must be known. This generally requires the utilization of a standard optical design program. Two approaches are possible. In the first approach, the diffractive element is treated as a special type of lens and the ordinary optical design equations are used. Optical design programs tend to follow a second approach, namely, using the equations of optical interference derived from holographic theory and then allowing the introduction of phase front corrections in the form of polynomial equations. By using either of these two methods, diffractive elements can be used not only to compensate for distortions such as chromatic or spherical aberration, but also to perform the work of a variety of other optical elements such as <b>null</b> <b>correctors,</b> beam shapers, etc. The main focus of the project described in this report is how the design information from the lens design program is incorporated into the photolithographic process. It is shown that the MANN program, a photolithographic mask generator, fills the need for a link between lens design programs and mask generation controllers. The generated masks can be used to expose a resist-coated substrate which is etched and then must be re-coated, re-exposed, and re-etched for making copies, just as in the electronics industry...|$|R
50|$|It is {{used for}} {{measuring}} small tilting angles of the mirror, see autocollimator, or for testing {{the quality of the}} optical system or of a part of it. Large-aperture optics, however, are tested with a <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> avoiding the production of a large plane mirror.|$|E
50|$|The New Technology Telescope {{initially}} had {{the same}} problem as the Hubble Space Telescope - the mirror was ground to the wrong shape due to a mis-calibrated <b>null</b> <b>corrector.</b> However, the active optics system of the NTT was able to correct that error without refiguring the mirror.|$|E
50|$|The use of interferometers {{has become}} a {{standard}} method of testing optical surfaces. Typical interferometer testing is done for flat and spherical optical elements. The use of a <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> in the test can remove the aspheric component of the surface and allow testing using a flat or spherical reference.|$|E

50|$|The {{fabrication}} {{error in}} the Hubble Space Telescope main mirror is the classic example that shows {{the need for such}} testing. In this case, a test facility such as LOTIS was not easily available, so the completed optics were not tested as a unit, and instead relied on careful testing of the individual components. Unfortunately, due to a mis-assembled <b>null</b> <b>corrector,</b> one of the tests was wrong, and a mis-figured mirror was not discovered until the telescope was placed into service. This is exactly the type of problem that LOTIS can detect, since it is designed to test large optical systems as a unit by creating realistic inputs and operating conditions for them.|$|E
50|$|The {{hyperbolic}} curvatures {{are difficult}} to test, especially with equipment typically available to amateur telescope makers or laboratory-scale fabricators; thus, older telescope layouts predominate in these applications. However, professional optics fabricators and large research groups test their mirrors with interferometers. A Ritchey-Chrétien then requires minimal additional equipment, typically a small optical device called a <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> that makes the hyperbolic primary look spherical for the interferometric test. On the Hubble Space Telescope, this device was built incorrectly (a reflection from an un-intended surface leading to an incorrect measurement of lens position) leading to the error in the Hubble primary mirror. Incorrect null correctors have led to other mirror fabrication errors as well, {{such as in the}} New Technology Telescope.|$|E
50|$|A <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> is {{an optical}} device {{used in the}} testing of large {{aspheric}} mirrors. A spherical mirror of any size can be tested relatively easily using standard optical components such as laser, mirrors, beamsplitters, and converging lenses. One method of doing this using a Shack cube is shown at the right, and many other setups are possible. An interferometer test {{such as this one}} generates a contour map of the deviation of the surface from a perfect sphere, with the contours in units of half the wavelength used. This is called a null test because when the mirror is perfect, the result is null (no contours at all). If the result is not null, then the mirror is not perfect, and the pattern shows where the optician should polish the mirror to improve it.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the mirrors}} used in modern telescopes are not spherical - they are {{rotations}} of parabolas or hyperbolas, since these more complex shapes reduce optical aberrations {{and give a}} larger field of view. (See, for example, Ritchey-Chrétien telescope or LSST.) Non-spherical mirrors such as these will not give a null result when tested as above, and null results are strongly preferred (they are very clean tests that require little interpretation, and the results translate directly to polishing requirements). One solution is to introduce a <b>null</b> <b>corrector,</b> {{as shown in the}} second figure. This consists of one or more lenses and/or mirrors introduced into the optical path that make the desired mirror look like a perfectly spherical mirror. Using this device, the measured contour map now shows difference from the desired shape instead of difference from a sphere. Now measurement and polishing can proceed just as in the spherical case. This method is used in the manufacture of almost all large mirrors for modern telescopes.|$|E

Due to a miscalibrated <b>null</b> <b>corrector,</b> the primary mirror was also {{found to have a}} significant spherical aberration after reaching orbit on STS-31. Perkin-Elmer's own calculations and measurements revealed the primary mirror's surface discrepancies, but the company chose to withhold that data from NASA. A NASA investigation heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for management failings, disregarding written quality guidelines, and ignoring test data that revealed the miscalibration. Corrective optics were installed on the telescope during the first Hubble service and repair mission STS-61. The correction, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, was applied entirely to the secondary mirror and replaced existing instrumentation; the aberration of the primary mirror remained uncorrected.|$|E

The dissertation also addresses advancements in <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> certification. Truncated-series solutions for diamond turned mirrors and computer generated hologram certifiers for aspheric surfaces that can be modeled in lens design code are derived. The truncated-series solutions are general and can be applied to most aspheric surfaces with only simple changes in coefficients. These equations are implemented in lens design code via the user defined surface (UDS). The process of implementing a UDS is outlined in the dissertation. Once a UDS is identified, a two-step design process is used to create the certifier. First, the corresponding Shack surface of the aspheric surface or surfaces under test must be defined. Second, a point source illuminates the mirrored Shack surface and a certifier is placed at, in, or outside the center of curvature of the Shack surface. Because the rays go back to a point source after reflection from the Shack surface, a standard merit function that minimizes RMS spot radius can be used to find the coefficients. Certifier surface solutions are presented at the center of curvature and inside the center of curvature of the Shack surface for a broad range of aspheric optics. The solution for a certifier outside of the center of curvature of a parabola's Shack surface is also provided...|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} of the Hubble Space Telescope Optical Systems Board of Investigation are reported. The Board was formed to {{determine the cause of}} the flaw in the telescope, how it occurred, and why it was not detected before launch. The Board conducted its investigation to include interviews with personnel involved in the fabrication and test of the telescope, review of documentation, and analysis and test of the equipment used in the fabrication of the telescope's mirrors. The investigation proved that the primary mirror was made in the wrong shape (a 0. 4 -wave rms wavefront error at 632. 8 nm). The primary mirror was manufactured by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation (Hughes Danbury Optical Systems, Inc.). The critical optics used as a template in shaping the mirror, the reflective <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> (RNC), consisted of two small mirrors and a lens. This unit had been preserved by the manufacturer exactly as it was during the manufacture of the mirror. When the Board measured the RNC, the lens was incorrectly spaced from the mirrors. Calculations of the effect of such displacement on the primary mirror show that the measured amount, 1. 3 mm, accounts in detail for the amount and character of the observed image blurring. No verification of the reflective null corrector's dimensions was carried out by Perkin-Elmer after the original assembly. There were, however, clear indications of the problem from auxiliary optical tests made at the time. A special optical unit called an inverse <b>null</b> <b>corrector,</b> designed to mimic the reflection from a perfect primary mirror, was built and used to align the apparatus; when so used, it clearly showed the error in the reflective <b>null</b> <b>corrector.</b> A second <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> was used to measure the vertex radius of the finished primary mirror. It, too, clearly showed the error in the primary mirror. Both indicators of error were discounted at the time as being themselves flawed. The Perkin-Elmer plan for fabricating the primary mirror placed complete reliance on the reflective <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> as the only test to be used in both manufacturing and verifying the mirror's surface with the required precision. This methodology should have alerted NASA management to the fragility of the process and the possibility of gross error. Such errors had been seen in other telescope programs, yet no independent tests were planned, although some simple tests to protect against major error were considered and rejected. During the critical time period, there was great concern about cost and schedule, which further inhibited consideration of independent tests...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{measurement}} of primary mirrors for astronomical telescopes {{has become increasingly}} challenging for two reasons. The mirrors, {{in addition to being}} larger, are faster and more aspheric in order to shorten the length of the telescope, and the required accuracy of the optical surfaces is more stringent. This dissertation presents improved methods for measuring these mirrors in the laboratory to the required accuracy. The wire test and the scanning pentaprism test, which measure surface slope errors, were designed and run under computer control. The wire test was used to measure the conic constant of a 3. 5 -m f/ 1. 75 primary mirror to an accuracy of ± 0. 003 and the scanning pentaprism test measured the conic constant of a 1. 8 -m f/ 1 primary to ± 0. 003. Improvements in these tests were identified that could increase the accuracy significantly. Interferometric optical testing with null correctors is widely used for measuring aspheric surfaces to high accuracy. A system-level analysis of the null test is given. The test is optimized for wavefront accuracy, imaging distortion, and measurement noise from ghost reflections and diffraction. The optical design and analysis of null correctors, including designs for testing 6. 5 -m f/ 1. 25 and 8. 4 -m f/ 1. 14 primary mirrors are given. Several new <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> designs and a method for performing tolerance analysis using structure functions are given. An error in the <b>null</b> <b>corrector,</b> if not detected, would cause the primary mirror to be polished to the wrong shape. (The primary mirrors for the Hubble Space Telescope and the European New Technology Telescope were misshapen because of faulty null correctors.) A new test of null correctors is presented that uses a computer-generated hologram (CGH) to synthesize a perfect primary mirror. When the CGH is measured through the <b>null</b> <b>corrector,</b> it appears as a perfect primary mirror. Apparent surface errors in this measurement can be attributed to errors in the <b>null</b> <b>corrector.</b> A complete error analysis of this test is given.

40|$|The {{necessity}} to align a multi component <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> {{that is used}} to test the 8. 4 [m] off axis parabola segments of the primary mirror of the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) initiated this work. Computer Generated Holograms (CGHs) are often a component of these null correctors and their capability to have multiplefunctionality allows them not only to contribute to the measurement wavefront but also support the alignment. The CGH can also be used as an external tool to support the alignment of complex optical systems, although, for the applications shown in this work, the CGH is always a component of the optical system. In general CGHs change the shape of the illuminating wavefront that then can produce optical references. The uncertainty of position of those references not only depends on the uncertainty of position of the CGH with respect to the illuminating wavefront but also on the uncertainty on the shape of the illuminating wavefront. A complete analysis of the uncertainty on the position of the projected references therefore includes the illuminating optical system, that is typically an interferometer. This work provides the relationships needed to calculate the combined propagation of uncertainties on the projected optical references. This includes a geometrical optical description how light carries information of position and how diffraction may alter it. Any optical reference must be transferred to a mechanically tangible quantity for the alignment. The process to obtain the position of spheres relative to the CGH pattern where, the spheres are attached to the CGH, is provided and applied to the GMT <b>null</b> <b>corrector.</b> Knowing the location of the spheres relative to the CGH pattern is equivalent to know the location of the spheres with respect to the wavefront the pattern generates.

40|$|A subaperture {{stitching}} interferometer {{system provides}} near-nulling of a subaperture wavefront reflected from {{an object of}} interest over {{a portion of a}} surface of the object. A variable optical element located in the radiation path adjustably provides near-nulling to facilitate stitching of subaperture interferograms, creating an interferogram representative of the entire surface of interest. This enables testing of aspheric surfaces without null optics customized for each surface prescription. The surface shapes of objects such as lenses and other precision components are often measured with interferometry. However, interferometers have a limited capture range, and thus the test wavefront cannot be too different from the reference or the interference cannot be analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of the interferometer is usually best when the test and reference wavefronts are nearly identical (referred to as a null condition). Thus, it is necessary when performing such measurements to correct for known variations in shape to ensure that unintended variations are within the capture range of the interferometer and accurately measured. This invention is a system for nearnulling within a subaperture stitching interferometer, although in principle, the concept can be employed by wavefront measuring gauges other than interferometers. The system employs a light source for providing coherent radiation of a subaperture extent. An object of interest is placed to modify the radiation (e. g., to reflect or pass the radiation), and a variable optical element is located to interact with, and nearly null, the affected radiation. A detector or imaging device is situated to obtain interference patterns in the modified radiation. Multiple subaperture interferograms are taken and are stitched, or joined, to provide an interferogram representative of the entire surface of the object of interest. The primary aspect of the invention is the use of adjustable corrective optics in the context of subaperture stitching near-nulling interferometry, wherein a complex surface is analyzed via multiple, separate, overlapping interferograms. For complex surfaces, the problem of managing the identification and placement of corrective optics becomes even more pronounced, to the extent that in most cases the <b>null</b> <b>corrector</b> optics are specific to the particular asphere prescription and no others (i. e. another asphere requires completely different null correction optics). In principle, the near-nulling technique does not require subaperture stitching at all. Building a near-null system that is practically useful relies on two key features: simplicity and universality. If the system is too complex, {{it will be difficult to}} calibrate and model its manufacturing errors, rendering it useless as a precision metrology tool and/or prohibitively expensive. If the system is not applicable to a wide range of test parts, then it does not provide significant value over conventional null-correction technology. Subaperture stitching enables simpler and more universal near-null systems to be effective, because a fraction of a surface is necessarily less complex than the whole surface (excepting the extreme case of a fractal surface description). The technique of near-nulling can significantly enhance aspheric subaperture stitching capability by allowing the interferometer to capture a wider range of aspheres. More over, subaperture stitching is essential to a truly effective near-nulling system, since looking at a fraction of the surface keeps the wavefront complexity within the capability of a relatively simple nearnull apparatus. Furthermore, by reducing the subaperture size, the complexity of the measured wavefront can be reduced until it is within the capability of the near-null design...|$|E
