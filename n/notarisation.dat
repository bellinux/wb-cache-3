50|$|The Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, the Apostille Convention, or the Apostille Treaty is an {{international}} treaty drafted by the Hague Conference on Private International Law. It specifies the modalities through which a document issued {{in one of the}} signatory countries can be certified for legal purposes in all the other signatory states. Such a certification is called an apostille (from Latin post illa and then a marginal note). It is {{an international}} certification comparable to a <b>notarisation</b> in domestic law, and normally supplements a local <b>notarisation</b> of the document.|$|E

5000|$|For a time, {{it was not}} {{uncommon}} to find paralegal corporals assigned to the legal assistance branch of a post's staff judge advocate's office, despite often having little or no actual leadership duties. Army Regulation 27-55 Notarial Services conferred (under provisions of 10 U.S.C. §§ 936, 1044a) authority to act as a notary and consul of the United States upon JAG Corps NCOs. <b>Notarisation</b> of powers of attorney and other documents is a [...] "bread-and-butter" [...] task in such offices, which necessitated the presence of either NCOs or state notaries. AR 27-55 was later amended to confer the authority on such paralegal specialists who are so designated by their respective staff judge advocate.|$|E
40|$|Guarantee of authenticity, {{integrity}} and datedness {{is necessary to}} rely on digital data objects. In literature, there are several solutions which offer these guarantees in the long term, but not much is known about their performance. This work presents implementations for two promising solutions, namely Content Integrity System and <b>Notarisation,</b> and compares them in regard to their computational performance. The comparison reveals that <b>Notarisation</b> outperforms Content Integrity System in almost every aspect, but a verifier has to make higher trust assumptions in order to trust in the protection of a data object...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the new German law on advance directives from 1 September 2009. The {{history of the}} parliamentary process of this law is described, the present regulations are explained, their relevance for medical practice discussed and shortcomings are identified. Finally, the new law is compared with other regulations in the international context. Previously established legal practice in Germany has now become largely confirmed by the new law: An advanced directive must be respected in any decision concerning medical treatment, regardless of {{the stage of the}} illness. It can be informally revoked at any time, even with limited decision-making capacity. Nobody may be obliged to issue a directive in any way. Advance directives do not need <b>notarisation</b> or routine updating after certain time intervals. Provided that the patient, who is no longer mentally competent, has issued a lasting power of attorney (Bevollmachtiger), or provided that the patient has been appointed a healthcare proxy by the courts (Betreuer), this authorised surrogate must assert the patient's will. The role of the guardianship court is clarified: it only needs to be involved in cases of disagreement as to the patient's will. The new German law thus combines more legal certainty with a liberal emphasis on patient autonomy and flexible, adaptable regulations. ...|$|E

Hence, primary data will be extracted from the people who are the critical focus point of this study. This questionnaire has six parts with the same structure and content but in two aspects. The first part is looking for interface properties of an e. transaction such as branding and usability. My case is based on a survey, comparing the websites of 3 companies 3 M,EXFO and Fujikura and based on a questionnaire consist of 23 question and in 2 major parts [Interface Properties, Informational content] as stated above I have measured available factors which are listed as below: 1. Interface Properties 1. 1 Branding 1. 2 Usability 2. Informational Content 2. 1 Company 2. 2 Products & Services 2. 3 Security 2. 4 Privacy After receiving 43 filled out questionnaire(sample size is determined by the means of relative error) from the people who has enough knowledge over the case(living in china, India, Germany, Canada, Japan and Iran) and by means of factor analysis I have reduced the total number of questions to 15. Finally after all my investigations, clearly “USABILITY” is recognized as the most important factor among others. For your more information, my thesis draft is available in PDF format and English language and immediately I can send it to you upon your request. Above topic is based on my personal interest and I have really work/search on that by reading different papers and interviewing with different people in china/Japan/Germany/Sweden/Iran and searching through different channel and sources. The reason to select this topic for my thesis could be: The Internet is growing at a phenomenal pace. The importance of Metcalfe s Law "The value of a network increases exponentially with the number of nodes. " is becoming more evident. Emerging digital mobile terrestrial services and technologies are bringing data services to hundreds of millions of users on worldwide basis. E. commerce will decrease expenses which are necessary for doing a transaction like, transportation. It provides new business opportunities, reduces costs and facilitates exchanges with business partners and consumers (Gartner Group, 2000). Despite the advantageous available for the e. commerce, lack of some important factors like trust, security, inappropriate use of technology, wrong or extraordinary information, privacy, categorizing the customers and make them satisfied in different levels will cause great barriers for developing it, in the society/world.

40|$|The medieval {{settlement}} on the Rudnik Mountain was established, most probably, {{in the final}} decades of the 13 th century. Soon it evolved {{into one of the}} best known mining and commercial centres in the Serbian state and reached its peak during the 14 th and {{in the first half of}} the 15 th century. The importance of Rudnik in the medieval period is confirmed by numerous material traces in the field. The most important discoveries in the course of archaeological investigations carried out since 2009 have been encountered in the area called Drenje, not far from the centre of the town of Rudnik (figs. 1, 2). Three churches (two Orthodox and one Roman Catholic), as well as many profane structures dated to the time of a thriving medieval Rudnik have so far been discovered. It indicates that in that area are the remains of the main settlement and the medieval market place of Rudnik, known from written sources. Among other structures at the site of Drenje, in the garden of S. Markovi}, the remains of rather a large building consisting, according to present data, of at least two rooms, have been investigated during the past three years (fig. 3). Important for dating the structure is a coin of the Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxembourg (1387 - 1437), discovered on the floor. Traces of an earlier phase of life were encountered under the structure (fig. 5). Coins have been found in two earlier pits. In the soil inside pit 11 a coin of the Hungarian king Charles Robert (1308 - 1342) was found, while in the top level of pit 2 a coin attributed to Prince Lazar (around 1370 - 1389) was found. Also from pit 2 came a, so far, unique archaeological find in our territory. It has been explained as a seal-die used for producing seals (fig, 7, 8). The representation in the central field and the contents of the inscription bear witness to the fact that the seal-die belonged to Prince Lazar. A helmet with bull horns engraved on the front side is understood to be the coat of arms of Prince Lazar, also used by his successors. The central field is surrounded by two concentric circles and between them is a circular inscription (fig. 9) : + SI È HARB GDNA KNEZA LAZARA SVE SRBSKE ZEMLE Translation of the inscription: + this is the grace of Lord Prince Lazar of the whole Serbian lands A seal stamped using the seal-die from Rudnik has not yet been found. The content of the inscription on the Rudnik sealdie is also quite unusual and unique. The word harý is translated to mean grace, a word that has not been recorded on any other stamp to date. On the other hand, the word grace has a distinct meaning in Serbian charters, denoting the legal activity of specific contents by which the ruler awarded nobles, the Church, market-towns, etc. The ruler’s grace as a legal act of distinct content must have been apparent and public and, as evidence of this grace, there would have been a distinct document. The very word grace is used in the documents as the name for a legal public document by which rulers ‘created grace’, ‘made grace’ or allowed something by their grace. Taking this into account, it could be concluded that any seal stamped with the Rudnik sealdie as a means of <b>notarisation</b> of the document confirmed that the document represented the ruler’s grace in the sense of a valid legal public document. Considering the shape and size of the seal-die, it could be ascribed to the seal-die group for which it is characteristic that the seal was obtained not by impressing the seal-die in wax but by pressing the wax onto the seal-die, disregarding whether it was an applied or hanging seal. Supporting this assumption is the existence of small notches in the bottom corners of the Rudnik seal-die that were most probably used for connecting to the top part, making possible a better stamping of the seal, possibly even allowing the seal to have representations on both sides. The seal-die is dated from the time of Lazar’s rule over Rudnik, between 1373 and 1389. Mentioned in the inscription is the rule of Prince Lazar over all Serbian lands, suggesting that the date of the seal-die could be fixed in the final decade of Lazar’s life. It was most probably buried in 1390, during the time of King Sigismund’s attack on Serbia. One of the most important theatres of war in that campaign was the Rudnik region...|$|E
