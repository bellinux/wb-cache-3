40|$|Abstract- During {{the past}} century, many {{efforts were made}} to develop {{processes}} for producing iron for steel making without the use of coke. This becomes vital where country like India has limited reserve of coking coal. Coke making is extremely problematic from environmental point of view. The reduction of iron ore with <b>non</b> <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> or gas below the melting point of the iron produced is classified as Direct Reduction process and product referred to as Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). The iron making reactions in iron oxide plus carbon involve the disappearance of two solid phases (iron oxide and carbon) and formation of two phases (metallic iron and gases). The location of the regions where the production of DRI is concentrated is determined by two factors: the availability of cheap natural gas or <b>non</b> <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> plus the availability of high quality iron bearing raw material (65 % Fe content or more). In the present investigation an attempt has been made to study the direct reduction behaviour of iron ore fines with non-coking coal fines. For this purpose the effect of reduction time,temperature and Fe 2 O 3 : C ratio on degree of reduction has been studied. It is observed that degree of reduction increases with increase in Fe 2 O 3 : C ratio, temperature and time. The value of activation energy in the temperature range 1173 - 1323 K is 203. 2 KJ/mole. Key words: Degree of reduction, Fe 2 O 3 : C ratio,Activation energy...|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{industries}} in this world are now producing iron, either by the root of directly or indirectly. India is now not only producing iron ore pellets but also exporting it to other countries. Use of iron ore pellets not only increase the productivity of the plant but also produce good quality iron. So {{it is essential to}} know about the various factors which affect the reducibility of the iron ore pellet. In our project we aim at studying the effect of size of iron ore pellet on its reduction kinetics {{and in the course of}} our experimentation we aim at arriving at particular pellet size that gives both increases in productivity and decrease coke rate. Pellets are approximately spherical lumps formed by agglomeration of the crushed iron ore fines in presence of moisture and binder, on subsequent induration at 1300 °C. In these times with the areas of iron ore use increasing, it is very important to use raw materials that not only increase the productivity of plant but also produce a better quality iron. Blast furnace raw materials have changed in character greatly in the last 2 or 3 decades. Formerly, they used to be raw iron ores, raw lime stone and coke. There are now being increasingly being replaced by pre fluxed sinter and pellets and liquid and gaseous fuels. Few examples of revolutionary changes brought to the present day iron making industries by use of pellets are Essar steel, TATA steel, Jindal Steel etc. Reduction of various sizes of iron ore pellets were carried out with <b>non</b> <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> in a stainless steel reactor of size 10 * 5 cm. The stainless steel reactor was half filled with <b>non</b> <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> powder of size - 72 # and the weighed oven dried pellet was placed centrally on this <b>non</b> <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> powder bed and then the remaining portion of the reactor was filled with coal powder then it was covered with an air tight cover having a hole for escape of gases. The reactor was introduced into a muffle furnace and soaked there for 1 hour. The reactor was then cool inside the muffle furnace up to 1500 C and then taken out and cooled in air and weight loss was calculated by electronic balance and hence % of reduction was calculated as [(Weight loss in iron ore pellet X 100) / (Total initial O 2 present in iron ore pellet with iron) ] We can conclude that as we increase the size of iron ore pellet, this results in decrease in the reducibility of iron ore pellets. The most optimal size range for reducibility to be effective in industrial application is 10 mm to 20 mm...|$|E

Studies {{on the effect of}} different carbonization temperatures (400, 600, 800, 900 °C), chemical and physical properties (proximate analysis, reactivity, ash fusion temperatures and caking characteristics), and calorific or heating value of different coal samples, procured from different mines in India, were undertaken in the present project work for their judicial selection in Indian sponge iron plants.

It is found that the fixed carbon content, ash content increases while volatile matter and calorific value reduced with increase in carbonization temperature. Reactivity of the coal chars towards CO 2 was measured at these carbonization temperatures and it was investigated that with increase of carbonization temperature, the reactivity of chars towards CO 2 was reduced. It was also investigated that Mahanadi coalfield limited (MCL) coal has maximum fixed carbon content and Jharsuguda mines coal has higher calorific value while SECL, korba char has highest fixed carbon content. Idea behind this is to found good coal and match its property according to its application in sponge iron plant...|$|E

40|$|Due to low {{availability}} of coking coal and huge establishment cost of Blast Furnace plants, the predominant route of Iron making has meandered {{away from this}} conventional route to a modern route of Iron making. This route involves production of Directly Reduced Iron (DRI) using non-coking coal and gases as the reducing agent.

Since DRI can work with low quality non-coking coal, it makes the best possible usage of cheap coal available in India. High {{availability of}} low- quality and iron-ore and coal, the low establishment cost of DRI plants has over the years attracted multitude of opportunist to earn a fortune in this sector.
