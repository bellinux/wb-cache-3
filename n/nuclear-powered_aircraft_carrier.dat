40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Navy follows the five basic guiding principles for managing risk at the strategic, environmental, and operational levels before making decisions about the placement and operation of its force structureincluding the placement of <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> on the East Coast of the United States. The Navy does not conduct any unique risk assessment for its <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> at naval installations; rather, <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> are high-value assets that {{are included in the}} Navys overall risk management process. At the strategic level, Office of the Secretary of the Navy and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations headquarters staff have identified and analyzed risks, such as emerging threats from hostile nation-states, which could make demands on homeland defense capabilities. Since 2004, according to Navy officials, the Navy has been using its strategic laydown and dispersal methodology in dividing its force structure and assets between the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. In addition, officials stated that there may be adjustments to the Navys current split of assets between the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets based on direction from the President that is reflected in DODs January 2012 defense strategic guidance, which emphasizes rebalancing defense assets in the Pacific region. Furthermore, naval guidance indicates that the Navy seeks to operate around the world in an environmentally responsible manner, both ashore (installations) and afloat (ships), and work with stakeholders to ensure that it follows environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Since the terrorist attacks of 2000 and 2001, the Navys risk management at the operational level has included conducting threat assessments for areas surrounding naval installations, as well as the installations themselves, and providing increased protection for high-value assets, such as <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> In addition, since the terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard has at times been providing escorts to the Navys high-value assets. The Coast Guard officials also noted that the communication of threat information among stakeholders in the Hampton Roads Regional Threat Working Group in Virginia has been much improved during this period. ...|$|R
500|$|The Navy {{gradually}} {{developed a}} reputation for having the most highly developed technology of all the U.S. services. The 1950s saw the development of nuclear power for ships, {{under the leadership of}} Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the development of missiles and jet aircraft for Navy use and the construction of supercarriers. The [...] was the world's first <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> and was followed by the Nimitz-class supercarriers. Ballistic missile submarines grew ever more deadly and quiet, culminating in the Ohio-class submarines. Rickover had a strong base of support in Congress and in public opinion, and he forced nuclear power to be a high Navy priority, especially for submarines. Combined with [...] missile technology, this gave the United States the assured second-strike capability that was the foundation of deterrence against the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In June 1953, he assumed command of the escort carrier , and was involved in the rescue of a baby who was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. In June 1954, he became [...] the first naval aviator to command the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, where he was involved with the development of the Mark 52 naval mine and the [...] Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge.

500|$|From a naval career {{point of}} view, Hayward's most notable {{drawback}} was {{his lack of}} time in command of a ship at sea. Admiral Arleigh Burke, now Chief of naval Operations, arranged for Hayward to be given command of the aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt in February 1956. This would normally be the climax of [...] naval aviator's career, but that year he was selected for promotion to rear admiral.

On 7 January 1957, {{he was assigned to}} the office of the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Operations. In October, he became Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Research and Development. The very public failure of Project Vanguard resulted in Hayward being called to appear before a Congressional Committee, where he was grilled by its chairman, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. The post was upgraded to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Development in 1959, and he was promoted to vice admiral. He pushed the development of a number of new weapons systems, including the Lockheed P-3 Orion and the <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> [...] Between 1959 and 1961, Defense expenditure on research and development grew from $525 million (roughly equivalent to $ in 20) to $4 billion (roughly equivalent to $ in 20).|$|E
