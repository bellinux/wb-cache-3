2500|$|Extensive {{worldwide}} {{tests have}} proved that uncoated copper and copper alloys (e.g., brass, bronze, copper nickel, copper-nickel-zinc) have strong intrinsic antimicrobial properties with efficacies against {{a wide range}} of disease-resistant bacteria, molds, fungi and viruses. After years of testing, the U.S. approved the registration of over 300 different copper alloys (copper, brasses, bronzes, copper-nickels, and <b>nickel-silvers)</b> as antimicrobial materials. These developments are creating markets for antimicrobial copper and copper alloys in interior architecture. To meet the design needs for building surfaces, structures, fixtures, and components, antimicrobial copper-based products are available in {{a wide range of}} colors, finishes, and mechanical properties. Copper handrails, counter tops, hallways, doors, push plates, kitchens, and bathrooms are just some of the antimicrobial products approved for hospitals, airports, offices, schools, and army barracks to kill harmful bacteria. [...] See: a list of products approved in the U.S.|$|R

25|$|Rods for {{travelers}} {{were made with}} <b>nickel-silver</b> metal joints, or ferrules, that could be inserted into one another forming the rod. Some of them were made {{to be used as}} a walking cane until needed for sport. Since the 1980s, with the advent of flexible, yet stiff graphite ferrules, travel rod technology has greatly advanced, and multi-piece travel rods that can be transported in a suitcase or backpack constitute a large share of the market.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{from the}} Kitasato University School of Medicine {{conducted}} antimicrobial studies of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa on various Japanese copper alloy coins and on copper alloy plates. The microbes were strains from hospital environments. Copper and its <b>nickel-silver,</b> cupronickel, and brass alloys {{were found to}} kill the bacteria within a short time. In another experiment, bacterial colonies were investigated on ball point pens made with and without copper alloys. Total bacterial colonies on the copper pens were much lower than on the non-copper pens: 2.1 CFU versus 47.8 CFU. Staphyloccocus counts on copper ball point pens were also much lower: 0.7 CFUs versus 20.8 CFUs on non-copper pens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tradition}} of creating buckles was carried {{on by the}} museum he founded, the Lawrence L. Lee Scouting Museum, in cooperation with his daughter, Natalie Weil of Southport, North Carolina, and artist Rob Hoitt, formerly of Manchester. They produced two official [...] "Max" [...] buckles (2005, 2007). Starting in the 1990s (though there are some earlier examples), Silber started the {{tradition of}} offering two versions of each buckle. One version was made from a <b>nickel-silver</b> bronze, and issued as a collector's edition of the buckle. The second, was generally offered in red bronze and issued as a contingent version of the buckle, which for national and world jamborees are given to the contingent of the Daniel Webster Council, any buckles left over after this are also {{made available to the}} public in a limited edition. In 2007, Hoitt proposed a one-time change in the tradition of red bronze buckles to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Scouting's founding. The contingent buckle for the 21st World Scout Jamboree was made of polished naval brass with a royal blue lacquer.|$|E
60|$|The {{energetic}} young Mr. Cashell snorted within, and Shaynor settled {{himself up}} in his chair over which he had thrown a staring red, black, and yellow Austrian jute blanket, rather like a table-cover. I cast about, amid patent medicine pamphlets, for something to read, but finding little, returned to the manufacture of the new drink. The Italian warehouse took down its game and went to bed. Across the street blank shutters flung back the gaslight in cold smears; the dried pavement seemed to rough up in goose-flesh under the scouring of the savage wind, and we could hear, long ere he passed, the policeman flapping his arms to keep himself warm. Within, the flavours of cardamoms and chloric-ether disputed those of the pastilles and a score of drugs and perfume and soap scents. Our electric lights, set low down in the windows before the tunbellied Rosamund jars, flung inward three monstrous daubs of red, blue, and green, that broke into kaleidoscopic lights on the facetted knobs of the drug-drawers, the cut-glass scent flagons, and the bulbs of the sparklet bottles. They flushed the white-tiled floor in gorgeous patches; splashed along the <b>nickel-silver</b> counter-rails, and turned the polished mahogany counter- panels to the likeness of intricate grained marbles--slabs of porphyry and malachite. Mr. Shaynor unlocked a drawer, and ere he began to write, took out a meagre bundle of letters. From my place by the stove, I could see the scalloped edges of the paper with a flaring monogram {{in the corner and}} could even smell the reek of chypre. At each page he turned toward the toilet-water lady of the advertisement and devoured her with over-luminous eyes. He had drawn the Austrian blanket over his shoulders, and among those warring lights he looked more than ever the incarnation of a drugged moth--a tiger-moth as I thought.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{a copper}} cannon cascabel, however, the armour steel {{of a battle}} tank is too hard to be struck into medals, using {{hardened}} steel tooling. The tank itself was therefore not suitable to use to strike medals from. However, since the medal was to be struck in <b>nickel-silver,</b> an alloy of nickel, copper and zinc, several kilograms of copper was recovered from burnt cables in the Xangongo tank, melted, mixed in with molten <b>nickel-silver</b> and then used to manufacture {{a limited number of}} the Southern Africa Medal, including the specimen medal depicted.|$|E
