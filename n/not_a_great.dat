5|$|Although {{the four}} {{brothers}} all played for Victoria, there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of overlap {{in their careers}} at first-class level, due {{to a combination of}} age, interstate moves, international duty and omissions from the team. The most Harveys in one first-class team occurred twice in 1947-48, when Merv, Ray and Neil all played for Victoria in successive Shield matches.|$|E
5|$|Between Gielgud's {{first two}} Oxford seasons, the {{producer}} Barry Jackson cast him as Romeo to the Juliet of Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies at the Regent's Theatre, London, in May 1924. The production was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success, {{but the two}} performers became close friends and frequently worked together throughout their careers. Gielgud made his screen debut during 1924 as Daniel Arnault in Walter Summers's silent film Who Is the Man? (1924).|$|E
5|$|His next film, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, {{was another}} gangster movie, {{which was the}} first by Cagney Productions since its acquisition. While {{compared}} unfavorably to White Heat by critics, it was fairly successful at the box office, with $500,000 going straight to Cagney Productions' bankers to pay off their losses. Cagney Productions was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, A Lion Is in the Streets, the company came to an end.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa officially joined Marseille on 1 July 2008 for €12million, {{with future}} {{incentives}} {{to be included}} later, after an agreement was reached between Marseille and Lyon in a meeting organized by the Ligue de Football Professionnel. As {{a result of the}} disagreement over the transfer, in December 2008, Ben Arfa told the local Lyon newspaper Le Progrès that his former team lacked class and was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> team. Ben Arfa was presented to the media and had his first training session with the club the same day. He was given the number 20 shirt. On 16 July, Ben Arfa was involved in another training session bust-up, this time with striker and France international Djibril Cissé. Cissé later joined English club Sunderland on loan.|$|E
5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head against the wall of his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E

5|$|Systematic {{interest}} in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of letters for use in package labels. In {{an extension of the}} studies, subjects were asked to rank the English alphabet by the pleasantness of the appearance of capital letters. While there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.|$|E
5|$|The BT49 {{was created}} by South African {{designer}} Gordon Murray for the Brabham team during the 1979 season of the Formula One motor racing World Championship. The Brabham team had been competing in partnership with engine supplier Alfa Romeo since 1976 and won races in the 1978 season. However, the team's 1979 car, the BT48, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success. Alfa Romeo entered their own Type 177 and Type 179 cars in Formula One Grands Prix that summer, helping to convince the Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone that the partnership was over. Motorsport author Alan Henry writes that Ecclestone did not want his team to take second place to an Alfa Romeo works team, and that the team designing Alfa Romeo's cars was drawing on Brabham knowledge.|$|E

25|$|As {{military}} weapons, the Paris Guns were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success: the payload was small, {{the barrel}} required frequent replacement, and the guns' accuracy {{was good enough}} for only city-sized targets.
