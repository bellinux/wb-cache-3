500|$|He also denounced Bihari MPs, {{saying they}} were [...] "spitting in the same plate from which they ate" [...] by criticising Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He also wrote, [...] "They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains". The {{outburst}} was apparently in response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted {{the proceedings of the}} Lok Sabha in protest against the attacks on North Indians. Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, upset with the remarks, demanded that the Prime Minister and the Centre intervene in the matter immediately. The Saamna editorial prompted at least 16Lok Sabha MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the RJD, JD (U), SP and the Congress, to give notice for breach of privilege proceedings against Bal Thackeray. After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said: [...] "If anybody has made any comment on our members' functioning in the conduct of business in the House, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms.

I say no time at all, Sonya. Which explains why she's gardening on her own in those opening credits." [...] When Sonya and Toadie found {{out that they were}} expecting a baby, Claire Crick from All About Soap commented [...] "At last – Sonya and Toadie are having a baby… and we can't think of a soapy couple who deserve such happy news! <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> totally love Toadie and Sonya (it's so refreshing seeing a couple who are happy together!), but they're also so clearly desperate to be parents." [...] Crick later praised Sonya for helping Lucas and Vanessa realise their feelings for each other, saying [...] "thank goodness for her meddling ways!" [...] A Newcastle Herald reporter noted that Sonya [...] "has seen more drama than most".|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, four {{sales representatives}} for Eli Lilly filed {{separate}} qui tam lawsuits {{against the company}} for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly {{for the treatment of}} dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind. [...] "That was a blemish for us," [...] John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. [...] "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."

2500|$|In August 2011 Ash {{collaborated with}} We Are Scientists {{to release a}} cover of the song [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by British {{songwriter}} Robert Manning, raising money and awareness for Multiple Sclerosis and The MS Society. The song was recorded between London and New York by the two bands and join a project already boasting releases from Ed Hardcourt and Emmy the Great. Chris Cain from We Are Scientists {{said in an interview}} [...] "We actually recorded a single [...] which {{is going to come out}} soon. It won't be too long until it's out and it's for a charity in England called the Multiple Sclerosis Society. It's a cover of a song called [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by I think Happy Monster but it's pretty sweet. The concept of the song is that if you listen to it on headphones or stereo the musicians of Ash are on the left channel and all the We Are Scientists guys are playing it in the right channel. We're playing the same song essentially but in different ways. I'm not playing the same bass line as Mark and Rick isn't playing the same drum pattern as Andy. I think Keith and Tim sing the same thing but in a different sort of harmony. What's interesting especially is that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have a unison feel going on but you can also take off one headphone and hear one band and vice versa." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the time}} when Cuvier's {{wonderful}} researches upon the extinct Mammals of the Paris gypsum first made intercalary types known, and caused them to be recognised as such, {{the number of such}} forms has steadily increased among the higher Mammalia. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> now know numerous intercalary forins of Ungulata, but M. Gaudry's great monograph upon the fossils of Pikermi (which strikes me {{as one of the most}} perfect pieces of palaeontological work I have seen for a long time) shows us, among the Primates, Mesopithecus as an intercalary form between the Semnopitheci and the Macaci; and among the Carnivora, Hyoenictis and Ictitherium as intercalary, or, perhaps, linear types between the Viverridoe and the Hyoenidoe.|$|E
60|$|If, once more, we {{say that}} science is exact prevision, we still fail to {{establish}} the supposed difference. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> find {{that much of what}} we call science is not exact, and that some of it, as physiology, can never become exact; but we find further, that many of the previsions constituting the common stock alike of wise and ignorant, are exact. That an unsupported body will fall; that a lighted candle will go out when immersed in water; that ice will melt when thrown on the fire--these, and many like predictions relating to the familiar properties of things have as high a degree of accuracy as predictions are capable of. It is true that the results predicated are of a very general character; but it is none the less true that they are rigorously correct as far as they go: and this is all that is requisite to fulfil the definition. There is perfect accordance between the anticipated phenomena and the actual ones; and no more than this can be said of the highest achievements of the sciences specially characterised as exact.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the things}} that made The Spice Trail so watchable was the enthusiasm - the effusiveness - of all involved. No one looked like they'd been kowtowed into it by some executive.

60|$|No great {{movement}} {{of the human mind}} takes place without the concurrent beat of those two wings, the imagination and the understanding. It is by the understanding that we are enabled {{to make the most of}} this world, and to use the collected material of experience in its condensed form of practical wisdom; and it is the imagination which forever beckons toward that other world which is always future, and makes us discontented with this. The one rests upon experience; the other leans forward and listens after the inexperienced, and shapes the features of that future with which it is forever in travail. The imagination might be defined as the common sense of the invisible world, as the understanding is of the visible; and as those are the finest individual characters in which the two moderate and rectify each other, so those are the finest eras where the same may be said of society. In the voyage of life, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> depend on the needle, true to its earthly instincts, but upon observation of the fixed stars, those beacons lighted upon the eternal promontories of heaven above the stirs and shiftings of our lower system.|$|E
60|$|There is a freshness, a vivacity, a zeal, a sincerity, a {{brightness}} {{of interest in}} his subject, which are perhaps unique in {{the whole history of}} criticism. He flings himself into the task with the perfection of natural abandonment to a joyous and delightful subject. His whole personality is engaged in a work that has all the air of being overflowing pleasure, and his pleasure is contagious. His criticism awakens the imagination of the reader. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> see the picture; we hear Diderot's own voice in ecstasies of praise and storms of boisterous wrath. There is such mass in his criticism; so little of the mincing and niggling of the small virtuoso. In facility of expression, in animation, in fecundity of mood, in fine improvisation, these pieces are truly incomparable. There is such an impetus animi et quædam artis libido. Some of the charm and freedom {{may be due to the}} important circumstance that he was not writing for the public. He was not exposed to the reaction of a large unknown audience upon style; hence the absence of all the stiffness of literary pose. But the positive conditions of such success lay in the resources of Diderot's own character.|$|E
60|$|In {{the matter}} of pictures, I notice, the {{correlation}} has even gone a step farther. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> usually take in the episodes of a painting from left to right, but the painter definitely and deliberately intends us so to take them in. For wherever two or three distinct episodes in succession are represented on a single plane in the same picture--as happens often in early art--they are invariably represented in the precise order of the words on a written or printed page, beginning at the upper left-hand corner, and ending at the lower right-hand angle. I first noticed this curious extension of the common principle in the mediæval frescoes of the Campo Santo at Pisa; and I have since verified it by observations on many other pictures elsewhere, both ancient and modern. The Campo Santo, however, forms an exceptionally good museum of such story-telling frescoes by various painters, as almost every picture consists of several successive episodes. The famous Benozzo Gozzoli, for example, of Noah's Vineyard represents on a single plane all the stages in that earliest drama of intoxication, from the first act of gathering the grapes on the top left, to the scandalised lady, the vergognosa di Pisa, who covers {{her face with her}} hands in shocked horror at the patriarch's disgrace in the lower right-hand corner.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{a foolish}} idea, Dick. A {{great deal of}} the {{learning}} that boys get at school is of no actual value in pounds, shillings, and pence. It is not the fact of knowing Latin, and Greek, and mathematics which benefits a man; but it is the learning of them. It is the discipline to the mind, which is of benefit. The mind is like the body. There is no use in cricket, or in boating, or in hunting, but these things strengthen the body and make it active and healthy, and able to do better everything which it undertakes, and it is exactly {{the same thing with the}} mind; besides, the days are coming when farmers must farm their land with science and intelligence, or they will be left behind in the race. We are being rivalled by the farmers of America. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have to pay rent, but by the tithes and rates and taxes they put upon us government makes the English farmer pay a heavy tax upon every bushel of corn he produces, while they allow the American corn to come into the market tax-free.

6000|$|There {{is reason}} to think that these titles were {{originally}} proper names. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> see among the Egyptians, where Pharaoh was synonymous with king, and among the Romans, where to be Cæsar meant to be Emperor, that the proper names of the greatest men were transferred to their successors, and so became class names; but in the Scandinavian mythology we may trace a human title of honour up to the proper name of a divine personage. In Anglo-Saxon bealdor, or baldor, means Lord; and Balder {{is the name of the}} favourite of Odin's sons--the gods who with him constitute the Teutonic Pantheon. How these names of honour became general is easily understood. The relatives of the primitive kings--the grandees described by Selden as having names formed on those of the gods, and shown by this to be members of the divine race--necessarily shared in the epithets, such as Lord, descriptive of superhuman relationships and nature. Their ever-multiplying offspring inheriting these, gradually rendered them comparatively common. And then they came to be applied to every man of power: partly from the fact that, in these early days when men conceived divinity simply as a stronger kind of humanity, great persons could be called by divine epithets with but little exaggeration; partly from the fact that the unusually potent were apt to be considered as unrecognised or illegitimate descendants of [...] "the strong, the destroyer, the powerful one;" [...] and partly, also, from compliment and the desire to propitiate.|$|E
60|$|At {{the present}} day, we, of the easier classes, {{are in a}} state of surfeit and disgrace after meat. Plethora has filled us with indifference; and we are covered from head to foot with the callosities of {{habitual}} opulence. Born into what is called a certain rank, we live, as the saying is, up to our station. We squander without enjoyment, because our fathers squandered. We eat of the best, not from delicacy, but from brazen habit. We do not keenly enjoy or eagerly desire the presence of a luxury; we are unaccustomed to its absence. And <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> squander money from habit, but still more pitifully waste it in ostentation. I can think of no more melancholy disgrace for a creature who professes either reason or pleasure for his guide, than to spend the smallest fraction of his income upon that which he does not desire; and to keep a carriage in which you do not wish to drive, or a butler of whom you are afraid, is a pathetic kind of folly. Money, being a means of happiness, should make both parties happy when it changes hands; rightly disposed, it should be twice blessed in its employment; and buyer and seller should alike have their twenty shillings worth of profit out of every pound. Benjamin Franklin went through life an altered man, because he once paid too dearly for a penny whistle. My concern springs usually from a deeper source, to wit, from having bought a whistle when I did not want one. I find I regret this, or would regret it if I gave myself the time, not only on personal but on moral and philanthropical considerations. For, first, in a world where money is wanting to buy books for eager students and food and medicine for pining children, and where a large majority are starved in their most immediate desires, it is surely base, stupid, and cruel to squander money when I am pushed by no appetite and enjoy no return of genuine satisfaction. My philanthropy is wide enough in scope to include myself; and when I have made myself happy, I have at least one good argument that I have acted rightly; but where that is not so, and I have bought and not enjoyed, my mouth is closed, and I conceive that I have robbed the poor. And, second, anything I buy or use which I do not sincerely want or cannot vividly enjoy, disturbs the balance of supply and demand, and contributes to remove industrious hands from the production of what is useful or pleasurable and to keep them busy upon ropes of sand and things that are a weariness to the flesh. That extravagance is truly sinful, and a very silly sin to boot, in which we impoverish mankind and ourselves. It is another question for each man’s heart. He knows if he can enjoy what he buys and uses; if he cannot, he is a dog in the manger; nay, it he cannot, I contend he is a thief, for nothing really belongs to a man which he cannot use. Proprietor is connected with propriety; and that only is the man’s which is proper to his wants and faculties.|$|E
