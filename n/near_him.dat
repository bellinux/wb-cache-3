5|$|Two weeks later, Campbell {{appeared}} on CBS Evening News {{in a live}} satellite interview with Dan Rather. While the rumors and fear of AIDS had reached a mainstream audience, the facts had not yet, so Campbell {{was placed in a}} glass booth, with technicians refusing to come <b>near</b> <b>him</b> to wire up microphones for the interview.|$|E
5|$|As of August 2015, {{access to}} see his white {{rectangular}} marble tomb slab is denied. His remains are not under the white slab, they are under a grey circular stone near his slab. Under this grey stone is a red brick staircase which leads to an underground burial chamber that was studied {{for the first time}} ever in 2004. In the chamber are many family members. Gian Gastone had a lead coffin in a wooden frame. It was replaced with a modern coffin. <b>Near</b> <b>him</b> are the remains of many De Medici children who were buried in unmarked graves. Some of them still have their garments.|$|E
5|$|Misch was {{transferred}} to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war. When not serving as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be <b>near</b> <b>him.</b> They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause Misch some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.|$|E

5|$|Presumably, he died either {{during the}} reign of William I or during the {{following}} reign of William II. Possibly, he was buried at Cirencester, where a stone tomb in the crypt of the Saxon-era church still exists and may be his. After his death, a group of his lands became the basis for the foundation of Cirencester Abbey by King Henry I of England in 1133. Regenbald's brother held land <b>near</b> <b>him</b> in Cirencester. Regenbald had a son named Edward who also held lands in Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the last}} members were signing it Doctor. Franklin looking towards the Presidents Chair, {{at the back}} of which a rising sun {{happened}} to be painted, observed to a few members <b>near</b> <b>him,</b> that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun. I have said he, often and often {{in the course of the}} Session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30, French forces reached al-'Azma's headquarters, {{unhindered}} by {{the mines}} laid en route by the Syrians. Little information {{is known about}} the battle from the Syrian side. According to one version, when French forces were about 100 meters in the distance, al-'Azma rushed to a Syrian artilleryman stationed <b>near</b> <b>him</b> and demanded him to open fire. However, before any shells could be fired, a French tank unit spotted al-'Azma and gunned him down by machine gun. In another account, al-'Azma had attempted to mine the trenches as the French forces approached his position, but was shot down by the French before he could set off the charges. Al-'Azma's death marked the end of the battle, although intermittent clashes continued until 13:30. Surviving Syrian fighters were bombed from the air and harried by the French as they retreated toward Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Olivia worries it {{will happen}} again, and though she {{attempts}} to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became so convinced her husband {{was going to leave}} her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those <b>near</b> <b>him</b> adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman <b>near</b> <b>him,</b> later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed <b>near</b> <b>him</b> and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E

50|$|He {{returned}} to Woodlark Island but the natives ambushed him there with an axe on 7 September 1855. Mazzucconi approached them but the native <b>nearest</b> <b>him</b> struck {{him on the}} head with an axe. The natives proceeded to kill him and his fellows and he died of his wounds.|$|R
5|$|Red Cloud, then a corporal, was manning {{a forward}} {{listening}} post {{in front of}} his company's command post position on the hill. In the middle of the night, he began hearing suspicious noises, before spotting a number of Chinese troops intent on surprising the Americans. Red Cloud raised an alarm and began firing on the advancing Chinese troops with an M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). The assistant BAR man with him in their foxhole was killed by the Chinese returning fire. Red Cloud was then shot twice in the chest. In spite of these wounds and after being attended to by a company platoon medic, he refused to withdraw from his post, and continued to fire accurately on the Chinese troops which caused significant casualties among their advancing force. Crucially, his actions alerted his company to the impending attack, preventing an ambush. After he was hit again and attended to by the same medic, Red Cloud propped himself against a tree and continued to fire, exposing himself to intense Chinese fire. He was shot at least eight times in the firefight. Suffering from severe injuries and too weak to support himself, he ordered a soldier <b>near</b> <b>him,</b> to tie him upright to the tree using the soldier's web belt, and then ordered these men to withdraw with the other wounded men to the main positions. Eventually, the Chinese overran Red Cloud's position and the hill.|$|E
