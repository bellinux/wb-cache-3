Though Frederick came to feel high regard for her and always treated her with kindness, however, he reportedly was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with her and continued to have affairs after their marriage.

But in spite of this his uncle Adhémar insists. However the admiral summons the commander to sea, and no sooner is he out of port and sight – presumably {{for a couple of years}} – than Antoinette, in collusion with René, marries her sweetheart Frontignac.|$|E

25|$|When Nicholas II, {{then the}} Tsarevich, broke {{off with his}} mistress, the famous {{ballerina}} Mathilde Kschessinska, he asked Sergei {{to take care of}} her. From 1894, Grand Duke Sergei, who was then 25 years old, became Kschessinska’s protector. He provided generously for his mistress. In 1895, the grand duke bought a dacha for her in Strelna. Kschessinska, who was ambitious, used her connections to the Romanovs to promote her career. Sergei, as president of the Imperial Theatres Society, took {{an active role in the}} ballet world to secure a prominent place for Kschessinska in the Imperial Ballet. Although Sergei was devoted to Mathilde, she was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with him and used him as a tool to fulfill her ambitions. He remained her devoted friend through to the end of his life. He never married and found in Mathilde’s company the substitute of a family life.|$|E

Sam refused, and the two were constantly fighting, even after Jason was assigned as Sam's bodyguard to protect her from Sonny's enemies. When Sam found out that she was pregnant with Sonny’s child, Jason asks Sam to say he's the baby's father, and let Sonny and Carly stay together for the sake of their sons, Michael (then Dylan Cash) and Morgan. Sam agrees to Jason's request and they almost marry, but Sam backs out because they are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> and she still has feelings for Sonny.|$|E

25|$|The Prince wanders {{for some}} time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat {{appointed}} by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastassya Filippovna, and they talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received. In the letters, Nastassya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin, but Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastassya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastassya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastassya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.|$|E
25|$|In February 1900, Grand Duke Andrei {{was invited}} by his brothers, Grand Dukes Kirill and Boris, {{to a dinner}} party {{at the house of}} Mathilde Kschessinska. Kschessinska, the Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Mariinsky Theatre, was the eldest among the three most {{prominent}} dancers of her generation at the Imperial Russian Ballet, along with Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina. Grand Duke Andrei sat next to his hostess during the dinner, but accidentally spilt a glass of red wine on her. Mathilde, attracted to the young grand duke, seven years her junior, took the incident as good omen. Age 28, Mathilde had been the mistress of Tsar Nicholas II when he was heir to the throne. Their two-year relationship ended with Nicholas' engagement to his future wife, Alexandra. Mathilde was ambitious and eager to maintain her close relationship with the Romanovs. She subsequently began a long time affair with Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia, Nicholas and Andrei's first cousin once removed. As she was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Sergei, but enjoyed his company and protection, Mathilde pursued a relationship with Grand Duke Andrei, the third Romanov to become involved with her. By July 1900, they became lovers, traveling together that summer to Biarritz and Paris. In the autumn 1901, they visited several Italian cities, including Venice, Padua, Florence and Rome. Grand Duke Sergei tolerated their affair, remaining a close and loyal friend to the famous ballerina, but {{the relationship between the two}} grand dukes grew tense. They tried to avoid each other and maintain civility while sharing the same woman for almost two decades.|$|E

In common with the rest of the Cabinet, except Duff Cooper, he agreed with Baldwin that the King should abdicate if he married Simpson, and on 6 December he and Baldwin both stressed that the King should make his decision before Christmas; by one account, he believed that the uncertainty was [...] "hurting the Christmas trade".
