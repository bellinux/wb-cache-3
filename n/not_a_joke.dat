5|$|Following {{in a long}} {{tradition}} of all-American teenager Archie Andrews meeting unusual celebrities and pop culture icons, this comic book shows him meeting the galaxy's deadliest hunter, the Predator. The idea was first suggested in the Archie office and then proposed to Dark Horse, who holds the license to comics featuring the Predator character owned by 20th Century Fox. The companies paired de Campi, a horror writer at Dark Horse, with Ruiz, a regular Archie artist. When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the new title was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
500|$|Archie Comics and Dark Horse Comics jointly {{announced}} Archie vs. Predator and its creative {{team at the}} 2014 New York Comic Con. Soon after, many {{media outlets}} carrying the news used a headline indicating the bizarre announcement was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> Wright described it as his [...] "most nutso project" [...] and was continually surprised by the scale of positive reaction to it.|$|E
500|$|To {{keep his}} {{campaign}} promise to fight graffiti, Harpole created a graffiti task force {{a few months}} after taking office. The city appropriated $150,000 for the group's first year, and Amarillo National Bank donated an additional $50,000. On April 24, 2012, the Amarillo City Council unanimously approved an anti-graffiti ordinance that prohibited the position of spray cans by minors under 17, and gave the city the power to fine property owners who did not clean up graffiti. Commenting on the issue, Mayor Harpole said, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> You're a criminal".|$|E

500|$|When Principal Skinner {{tells the}} {{children}} at school that Valentine's Day is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback {{in which he is}} sitting in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, [...] "Sending your chick a Valentine?", to which Johnny replies [...] "Yep", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain." [...] After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent {{in a letter to the}} show that read, [...] "I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback. Do you really think this was funny, this horrible experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening—the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran—"loved" [...] the sequence as well as the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] was {{recorded}} by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> I took a completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted to have fun with it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E

2500|$|Letterman had {{initially}} wanted O'Brien {{to be in}} the promo as well, but he turned it down: [...] "No fucking way I'm doing that. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> to me—it's real." [...] O'Brien was sure his agreement prohibited television appearances for several months, but gathered NBC would be only too happy to allow him a one-time reprieve for the ad, as it was to improve Leno's image. O'Brien, by this point, was planning a live tour with his staff that would take him on the road, and had also created a Twitter account, which flourished (NBC closely monitored the account for anti-Leno sentiments). After about one hour online, O'Brien's number of Twitter followers had rocketed past the 30,000 followers of the official Jay Leno account, and he held over 300,000 followers in under 24 hours; he surpassed the one million mark in May 2010. Many speculated that O'Brien would sign a deal with Fox for a late-night program; Comedy Central and HBO had also expressed interest in O'Brien. Fox's deal moved slowly and they eventually withdrew their offer due to station resistance, the daunting financial investment and opposition from Roger Ailes.|$|E

5000|$|Ioci is a {{word from}} Latin which can be {{translated}} as “humor”. The most important use of iocī [...] in terms of rhetoric was Cicero’s use of it in “De Oratore”.

60|$|With {{the moon}} we marched again, feeling dreadfully exhausted, and {{suffering}} tortures from thirst and prickly heat. Nobody {{who has not}} felt it can know what we went through. We walked no longer, we staggered, now and again falling from exhaustion, and being obliged to call a halt every hour or so. We had scarcely energy left in us to speak. Up to this Good had chatted and joked, for he is a merry fellow; but now he had <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> in him.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode was conceived from <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> among Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone about a fish dressed as motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually turned into <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about Kanye West <b>not</b> understanding <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about why liking fishsticks made him a gay fish.

Listen, though, to this, where I speak of Germany's historical mission on page 73,--'No nation {{on the face of the}} globe is so able to grasp and appropriate all the elements of culture as Germany is?' What do you say to that? Is it <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke?</b> Ach, Himmel, how our officers have laughed over that in Belgium! With their booted feet on the mantelpiece as they read and with bottles of appropriated champagne beside them as they laugh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{the best}} judge of that," [...] {{returned}} the consul dryly. Then suddenly changing his manner, he grasped Custer's hands with both his own. [...] "Come, Harry," [...] he said earnestly; [...] "I will {{not believe that}} this is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> but I beg of you to promise me one thing,--do not move a step further in this matter without legal counsel. I will give you a letter to a legal friend of mine--a man of affairs, a man of the world, and a Scot as typical, perhaps, as any you have mentioned. State your LEGAL case to him--only that; but his opinion will show you also, if I am not mistaken, the folly of your depending upon any sectional or historical sentiment in this matter." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{possible}} the next day I sent my story {{to the editor of}} the periodical for which I wrote most frequently, and in which my best productions generally appeared. In a few days I had a letter from the editor, in which he praised my story as he had never before praised anything from my pen. It had interested and charmed, he said, not only himself, but all his associates in the office. Even old Gibson, who never cared to read anything until it was in proof, and who never praised anything which had <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> in it, was induced by the example of the others to read this manuscript, and shed, as he asserted, the first tears that had come from his eyes since his final paternal castigation some forty years before. The story would appear, the editor assured me, as soon as he could possibly find room for it.|$|E
