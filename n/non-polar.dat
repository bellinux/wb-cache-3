5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also <b>non-polar</b> compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and <b>non-polar</b> solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|TiCl4 is soluble in toluene and chlorocarbons, as {{are other}} <b>non-polar</b> species. Evidence exists that certain arenes form {{complexes}} {{of the type}} +. TiCl4 reacts exothermically with donor solvents such as THF to give hexacoordinated adducts. Bulkier ligands (L) give pentacoordinated adducts TiCl4L.|$|E
5|$|Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide {{linkages}} during digestion of proteins. A coordinate {{covalent bond}} is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, {{which gives the}} carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the <b>non-polar</b> part of the protein being digested.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In <b>non-polar</b> solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves <b>non-polar,</b> hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower <b>non-polar</b> waters.|$|E
5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in <b>non-polar</b> organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with <b>non-polar</b> side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E
25|$|Polymer-based {{compounds}} – Are polar or <b>non-polar</b> functional {{groups in}} a porous polymer matrix.|$|E
25|$|Carbon-based {{compounds}} – Are typically hydrophobic and <b>non-polar,</b> including {{materials such}} as activated carbon and graphite.|$|E
25|$|PTFE {{sheets are}} used in the {{production}} of butane hash oil due to its non-stick properties and resistance to <b>non-polar</b> solvents.|$|E
25|$|The aqueous {{solubility}} of PH3 is slight; 0.22 mL of gas dissolve in 1 mL of water. Phosphine dissolves {{more readily}} in <b>non-polar</b> solvents than in water {{because of the}} <b>non-polar</b> P-H bonds. It is technically amphoteric in water, but acid and base activity is poor. Proton exchange proceeds via a phosphonium (PH4+) ion in acidic solutions and via PH2− at high pH, with equilibrium constants Kb = 4 × 10−28 and Kz = 41.6 × 10−29.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-polar</b> or bipolar {{tantalum}} capacitors {{are made}} by effectively connecting two polarized capacitors in series, with the anodes oriented in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|Dispersion (usually {{named after}} Fritz London), {{which is the}} {{attractive}} interaction between any pair of molecules, including <b>non-polar</b> atoms, arising from the interactions of instantaneous multipoles.|$|E
25|$|Dry ice is <b>non-polar,</b> with a {{dipole moment}} of zero, so {{attractive}} intermolecular van der Waals forces operate. The composition results in low thermal and electrical conductivity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the carbon}} {{tetrachloride}} molecule, four chlorine atoms are positioned symmetrically as corners in a tetrahedral configuration joined {{to a central}} carbon atom by single covalent bonds. Because of this symmetrical geometry, CCl4 is <b>non-polar.</b> Methane gas has the same structure, making carbon tetrachloride a halomethane. As a solvent, it is well suited to dissolving other <b>non-polar</b> compounds, fats, and oils. It can also dissolve iodine. It is somewhat volatile, giving off vapors with a smell characteristic of other chlorinated solvents, somewhat similar to the tetrachloroethylene smell reminiscent of dry cleaners' shops.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene {{may either}} be {{modified}} in the polymerization by polar or <b>non-polar</b> comonomers or after polymerization through polymer-analogous reactions. Common polymer-analogous reactions are {{in case of}} polyethylene crosslinking, chlorination and sulfochlorination.|$|E
25|$|Wax can be {{dissolved}} by a <b>non-polar</b> solvents like mineral spirits. However, some commercial wax solvents {{are made}} from citrus oil, which is less toxic, harder to ignite, and gentler on the ski base.|$|E
25|$|The {{solvents}} {{are grouped}} into <b>non-polar,</b> polar aprotic, and polar protic solvents and ordered by increasing polarity. The polarity is given as the dielectric constant. The properties of solvents that exceed those of water are bolded.|$|E
25|$|Pure sodium {{hydroxide}} is a colorless crystalline solid that melts at 318°C without decomposition. It is highly soluble in water, {{with a lower}} solubility in ethanol and methanol, but is insoluble in ether and other <b>non-polar</b> solvents.|$|E
25|$|Solvent: Hydroxyl groups (-OH), {{found in}} alcohols, are polar and {{therefore}} hydrophilic (water loving) but their carbon chain portion is <b>non-polar</b> which make them hydrophobic. The molecule increasingly becomes overall more nonpolar and therefore less soluble in the polar water as the carbon chain becomes longer. Methanol has the shortest carbon chain of all alcohols (one carbon atom) followed by ethanol (two carbon atoms.) Alcohols have applications in industry and science as reagents or solvents. Because of its relatively low toxicity {{compared with other}} alcohols and ability to dissolve <b>non-polar</b> substances, ethanol {{can be used as}} a solvent in medical drugs, perfumes, and vegetable essences such as vanilla. In organic synthesis, alcohols serve as versatile intermediates.|$|E
25|$|Activated carbon is {{a highly}} porous, {{amorphous}} solid consisting of microcrystallites with a graphite lattice, usually prepared in small pellets or a powder. It is <b>non-polar</b> and cheap. One of its main drawbacks is that it reacts with oxygen at moderate temperatures (over 300nbsp&°C).|$|E
25|$|These {{peripheral}} proteins {{function as}} carriers of <b>non-polar</b> compounds between {{different types of}} cell membranes or between membranes and cytosolic protein complexes. The transported substances are phosphatidylinositol, tocopherol, gangliosides, glycolipids, sterol derivatives, retinol, fatty acids, water, macromolecules, red blood cells, phospholipids, and nucleotides.|$|E
25|$|Van der Waals forces play a {{fundamental}} role in fields {{as diverse as}} supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, polymer science, nanotechnology, surface science, and condensed matter physics. van der Waals forces also define many properties of organic compounds and molecular solids, including their solubility in polar and <b>non-polar</b> media.|$|E
25|$|The flowing {{movement}} of flammable liquids like gasoline inside a pipe can build up static electricity. <b>Non-polar</b> liquids such as gasoline, toluene, xylene, diesel, kerosene and light crude oils exhibit significant ability for charge accumulation and charge retention during high velocity flow. Electrostatic discharges can ignite the fuel vapor.|$|E
25|$|Normal–phase {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a <b>non-polar,</b> non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g. Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in <b>non-polar</b> solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) structural isomers.|$|E
25|$|This process, polar auxin transport, is directional, very {{strictly}} regulated, {{and based}} in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins {{in the proper}} direction. While PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are vital in transporting auxin in a polar manner, the family of AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX/LAX) genes encodes for <b>non-polar</b> auxin influx carriers.|$|E
25|$|The {{determination}} of {{which of the}} two tautomeric forms is present in solution {{has been the subject of}} many publications. The energy difference appears to be very small and is dependent on the polarity of the solvent. <b>Non-polar</b> solvents favour the formation of 2-hydroxypyridine whereas polar solvents such as alcohols and water favour the formation of 2-pyridone.|$|E
25|$|The ethanol {{produced}} through fermentation acts as {{an important}} co-solvent to the <b>non-polar</b> compound that water cannot dissolve, such as pigments from grape skins, giving wine varieties their distinct color, and other aromatics. Ethanol and the acidity of wine act as an inhibitor to bacterial growth, allowing wine to be safely kept for years {{in the absence of}} air.|$|E
25|$|Butanol {{may be used}} as a fuel in an {{internal}} combustion engine. Because its longer hydrocarbon chain causes it to be fairly <b>non-polar,</b> it is more similar to gasoline than it is to ethanol. Butanol has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without modification. It has a four link hydrocarbon chain.|$|E
25|$|Some {{publications}} only focus {{one of the}} {{two possible}} patterns, and neglect the influence of the other. For example, to calculation of the energy difference of the two tautomers in a <b>non-polar</b> solution will lead to a wrong result if a large quantity of the substance {{is on the side of}} the dimer in an equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Retention time {{increases}} with hydrophobic (<b>non-polar)</b> surface area. Branched chain compounds elute {{more rapidly than}} their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single C–C bonds elute later than those with a C=C or C–C triple bond, as the double or triple bond is shorter than a single C–C bond.|$|E
25|$|Distinct phases {{may also}} exist {{within a given}} state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be {{differentiated}} based on solubility as in polar (hydrophilic) or <b>non-polar</b> (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a <b>non-polar</b> liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low solubility (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in water. Solubility is {{the maximum amount of}} a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids, i.e., solids can form solid solutions or crystallize into distinct crystal phases. Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form alloys, whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble cannot.|$|E
25|$|The {{southwest}} {{is dominated}} by the Kluane icefields in Kluane National Park and Reserve, the largest <b>non-polar</b> icefields in the world. Kluane National Park also contains eight of Canada's ten highest mountains, including the five highest, all in the Saint Elias Mountains. A number of glaciers flow out of the icefields, including the Logan Glacier, the Hubbard Glacier and the Kaskawulsh Glacier.|$|E
25|$|Ionic liquids {{are often}} {{moderate}} to poor conductors of electricity, non-ionizing (e.g., <b>non-polar),</b> highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties {{for a range}} of polar and <b>non-polar</b> compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for biocatalysis. The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have recently been found to hydrolyse, affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids are attracting increasing attention in many fields, including organic chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and engineering; see for instance magnetic ionic liquid.|$|E
25|$|A classic {{molecular}} solid {{consists of}} small, <b>non-polar</b> covalent molecules, and is {{held together by}} London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces); a classic example is paraffin wax. These forces are weak, resulting in pairwise interatomic binding energies {{on the order of}} 1/100 those of covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Binding energies tend to increase with increasing molecular size and polarity (see intermediate forms).|$|E
