However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small and isolated.|$|E
5|$|However records {{indicate}} that Lochner's talent was recognised {{from an early}} age. He may have been of Netherlandish origin or worked there for a master, possibly Robert Campin. Lochner's work seems influenced by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden; elements of their styles can be detected in the structure and colourisation of Lochner's mature works, especially in his Last Judgment, although <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to be the}} master with whom he studied.|$|E

5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. <b>Neither</b> <b>is</b> the glossy ibis, which probably had a similar history.|$|E
5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and spinach) are not associated with gout. <b>Neither</b> <b>is</b> total consumption of protein.

5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted turtles (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|E

Two other teeth {{have been identified}} as upper premolars of Ferugliotherium; as with the jaw fragment, they may also represent an indeterminate multituberculate. One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps, of which one contains four and the other at least two cusps. The other is more poorly preserved, but may represent the same tooth position. These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars.|$|E
5|$|After {{sustaining}} an injury, Phoenix {{returned to}} action in OVW on August 16, 2006, defeating Serena. Phoenix began regularly {{competing for the}} OVW Women's Championship, unsuccessfully challenging the champion ODB in a battle royal and a four-way match, which was won by Serena. At the October 4 OVW television tapings, however, Phoenix defeated Serena to win the championship. She lost the championship to Victoria Crawford in a gauntlet match on October 20, and won it back the next day; however, Crawford's title reign is not officially recognised, and as a result, <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> Phoenix's second reign. Phoenix officially dropped the championship in a gauntlet match at the November 1 television taping, after she was eliminated by Katie Lea, who eventually won the match.|$|E

5|$|Koalas {{have few}} predators; dingos and large pythons may prey on them, while {{birds of prey}} (such as {{powerful}} owls and wedge-tailed eagles) are threats to young. They are generally not subject to external parasites, other than ticks in coastal areas. Koalas may also suffer mange from the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, and skin ulcers from the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, but <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> common. Internal parasites are few and largely harmless. These include the tapeworm Bertiella obesa, commonly found in the intestine, and the nematodes Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus and Durikainema phascolarcti, which are infrequently found in the lungs. In a three-year study of almost 600 koalas admitted to the Australian Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, 73.8% of the animals were infected {{with at least one}} species of the parasitic protozoal genus Trypanosoma, the most common of which was T.irwini.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no discernible differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co.

Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

5|$|Sir William Dargie {{painted a}} {{portrait}} of Fairley in 1943, {{which is in the}} possession the Fairley family. A later 1960 portrait by Dargie, together with a 1945 one by Nora Heysen, is in the Australian War Memorial. <b>Neither</b> <b>is</b> on display, although the latter can be viewed online. A 1954 Dargie portrait of Queen Elizabeth II painted while Dargie was staying at Fairley's home at 81 Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, in London, and subsequently given to Fairley, was sold at auction to the National Museum of Australia in 2009 for $120,000. Fairley's papers are in the Basser Library at the Australian Academy of Science. He is commemorated by the Neil Hamilton Fairley Overseas Clinical Fellowship, which provides full-time training in Australia and overseas in areas of clinical research including the social and behavioural sciences.|$|E
5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E

5|$|The {{species of}} Psittacosaurus vary {{in size and}} {{specific}} features of the skull and skeleton, but share the same overall body shape. The best-knownâ€”P. mongoliensisâ€”can reach 2metres (6.5ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20kilogrammes (44lb) in P. mongoliensis. Several species approach P. mongoliensis in size (P. lujiatunensis, P. neimongoliensis, P. xinjiangensis), while others are somewhat smaller (P. sinensis, P. meileyingensis). The smallest known species, P. ordosensis, is 30% smaller than P. mongoliensis. The largest are P. lujiatunensis and P. sibiricus, although <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> significantly larger than P. mongoliensis. Psittacosaurus postcranial skeletons are more typical of a 'generic' bipedal ornithischian. There are only four digits on the manus ('hand'), {{as opposed to the}} five found in most other ornithischians (including all other ceratopsians), while the four-toed hindfoot is very similar to many other small ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri {{plan their}} next heist. As Dixit's {{analysis}} has named Rio {{the location of}} Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, and Ali immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri {{to play a game}} of Russian roulette. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots from the gun, <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> injured, because Aryan has not loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up {{on the top of a}} waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free.|$|E
