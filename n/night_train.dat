5|$|Train {{services}} {{are provided by}} the Norwegian State Railways both north- and southbound. Four services a day and one <b>night</b> <b>train</b> operate to Oslo Central Station, while there is one day and one <b>night</b> <b>train</b> to Bodø, with an additional afternoon departure to Mo i Rana. Two daily departures serve Sweden and Östersund {{as part of the}} Mittnabotåget service that connects Trondheim in Norway to Sundsvall in Sweden, in addition there are three services to Røros, with connections onwards to Østerdalen. The most frequent service is the hourly Trøndelag Commuter Rail from Steinkjer via Trondheim Airport, Værnes and Trondheim S to Lerkendal, with some extending to Oppdal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Night</b> <b>train</b> {{services}} stopped {{running from}} Victoria on 4 September 1939 after World War II was declared, {{and other services}} were terminated following the German invasion of France in May 1940. Though the station was bombed several times in 1940 and 1941, {{there was not enough}} damage to prevent operations. A plane crashed into {{the eastern side of the}} station on 15 September 1940 and a flying bomb caused partial damage on 27 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian State Railways {{operates}} both commuter {{and express}} trains to Trondheim Airport. In each direction, {{there are three}} daily express trains, one to Mo i Rana and two to Bodø. One of the Bodø-trains is a <b>night</b> <b>train.</b> Travel time to Mo i Rana is 6 hours and travel time to Bodø is 9 hours and 5 minutes. The Mo i Rana-service is operated with Class 93 trains, while the Bodø-services are operated with Di 4-hauled trains.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the second}} stage of {{expansion}} in December 2002, <b>night</b> <b>trains</b> were added to the S-Bahn. Since 2007, <b>night</b> <b>trains</b> provide a continuous 24-hour service from Friday morning until Sunday evening on some lines.|$|R
50|$|The DB still {{occasionally}} runs D-Züge in night services, {{especially to}} Germany's eastern European neighbours (D-Nacht). Some of the supposed D-Nacht-Züge comprise {{only a few}} through coaches, which are coupled to other <b>night</b> <b>trains.</b> This train category does however have the advantage {{that they are not}} bound by the fare regulations of <b>night</b> <b>trains,</b> but are treated as normal long-distance services. As a result, they are used inter alia in southern Germany as a substitute for late IC connexions that are operated by DB Autozug rather than DB Fernverkehr. Many <b>night</b> <b>trains</b> run as D-Nacht services into Germany's eastern European neighbours. One provider of <b>night</b> express <b>trains</b> is CityNightLine. However, CityNightLine was shut down and all <b>night</b> <b>trains</b> ended with the December 2016 schedule change.|$|R

5|$|The Oslo Commuter Rail {{operated}} by NSB, provides one service {{in each direction}} each hour—line 450 from Kongsberg Station via Oslo Central to Eidsvoll Station. NSB also provides one regional service in each direction per hour towards Skien Station (via Oslo Central) and Lillehammer Station. On the Dovre Line to Trondheim Central Station, five daily express trains are also offered, including one NSB <b>Night</b> <b>Train.</b> Northbound trains use track1, while southbound trains use track4.|$|E
5|$|Three bids were {{submitted}} by the deadline of 1 April 1997, and the contract with Talbot, which had just been bought by Bombardier, was finalized on 27 November 1997. By this time the order had been extended to eleven units, which are variations of the Talbot Talent. Before delivery a further four units were purchased, so the trains could operate all the services on the Nordland Line, replacing most of the locomotive-hauled day trains. Only the <b>night</b> <b>train</b> would remain locomotive-hauled.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{the line}} {{had a single}} through train from Oslo to Bergen, with an {{additional}} summer express—with {{a limited number of}} stops. In addition, there were two additional trains from Hønefoss to Oslo. From 1 May 1912, a <b>night</b> <b>train</b> was also introduced and the same year mixed passenger and freight trains were introduced from Ål on the Bergen Line to Oslo. A station was opened at Viul on 16 August 1915, and another at Kistefoss on 1 October. Because of economic impact of World War I, the <b>night</b> <b>train</b> services was reduced to only twice a week from 20 May 1917 until 7 June 1919. In 1930, new stations were established at Kalvsjø, Gunstad, Bergerfoss and Hønen. During World War II from 1940 to 1945, the frequency was reduced to no more than one train per day. During parts of 1940, the Oslo–Bergen line was instead run via the Drammen and Randsfjord Lines. However, two local trains were kept on the route from Hønefoss to Roa.|$|E

5|$|Express trains {{operated}} by NSB {{have always been}} the primary passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to Hønefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages along the line to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway's two largest cities. Expresses are locomotive-hauled trains with modernized coaches. Six nights a week there is a <b>night</b> <b>train</b> service. Several parts of the line service places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal. Operating deficits are covered by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.|$|E
5|$|NSB uses Gardermobanen for {{express and}} some {{regional}} trains north of Oslo. This includes five daily departures to Trondheim (including one NSB <b>Night</b> <b>Train).</b> The line is operated by two regional services, the R10 service between Drammen and Lillehammer, the R11 service between Skien/Larvik and Eidsvoll, {{as well as}} the local service, L12 between Kongsberg and Eidsvoll. These services is carried out with Type 74 for R10 and R11, and Type 75 for line L12. Both trains are capable of 200km/t operation. The southernmost part of the line is used by commuter trains heading to the Kongsvinger Line. These trains divert from the Gardermo Line at Lillestrøm. Also the commuter trains operating to Dal along the Hoved Line use the Gardermoen Line until Lillestrøm.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} transport to Mæl {{was performed by}} connecting passenger wagons to the freight trains. Up to ten trains were operated each direction each day, and up to five would correspond with the ferry; at Tinnoset trains would operate to Skien, and connection at Hjuksebø allowed for transport to Oslo Vestbanestasjon. In 1928 Norsk Transport and NSB agreed to operate a weekly <b>night</b> <b>train</b> service from Rjukan to Oslo; the service lasted until 1933. During the 1930s NSB and Norsk Hydro initiated an attempt to attract tourists to Rjukan, through discounted direct trains from Oslo, Drammen and Skien. They were taken up again after the war, and remained until 1969.|$|E

25|$|Buses connect Kiruna {{with major}} towns in Norrbotten {{province}} and villages nearby {{and in the}} wider region. The railway connects Luleå with Gällivare, Kiruna and Narvik. Although built to serve the mine, Swedish Rail runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a <b>night</b> <b>train</b> from Narvik to Stockholm, a day train from Narvik to Luleå (connecting with a second <b>night</b> <b>train</b> to Stockholm and Gothenburg), and trains to Luleå and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as Karven and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Björkliden and Riksgränsen, particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by Transdev in summer.|$|E
