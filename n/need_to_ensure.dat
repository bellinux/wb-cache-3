25|$|In {{criminal}} law, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), reformulated {{the standard}} for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Crawford gives enhanced protection to defendants when the hearsay offered against them is testimonial in nature. When a statement is deliberately accusatory, or when the declarant knows that the statement {{is likely to be}} used in the prosecution of the defendant for a crime, the need for face-to-face confrontation is at its highest. When statements are directly accusatory, the defense needs an opportunity to explore the accuser's motives. Where statements are the product of police interrogation, there is a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> that the testimony is not the product of improper coercion or intimidation.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{objections}} likewise held up {{the wider}} international recognition of the Republic of Macedonia. Although the Republic applied for membership of the United Nations on 30 July 1992, its application languished in diplomatic limbo for nearly a year. A few states—Bulgaria, Turkey, Slovenia, Croatia, Belarus and Lithuania—recognized the republic under its constitutional name before its admission to the United Nations. Most, however, waited {{to see what the}} United Nations would do. The delay had a serious effect on the Republic, as it led to a worsening of its already precarious economic and political conditions. With war raging in nearby Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> the country's stability became an urgent priority for the international community. The deteriorating security situation led to the UN's first-ever preventative peacekeeping deployment in December 1992, when units of the United Nations Protection Force deployed to monitor possible border violations from Serbia.|$|E

500|$|Once discovered, {{vitamins}} {{were actively}} promoted in articles and advertisements in McCall's, Good Housekeeping, {{and other media}} outlets. Marketers enthusiastically promoted cod-liver oil, a source of Vitamin D, as [...] "bottled sunshine", and bananas as a “natural vitality food". They promoted foods such as yeast cakes, a source of B vitamins, {{on the basis of}} scientifically-determined nutritional value, rather than taste or appearance. [...] World War II researchers focused on the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> adequate nutrition, especially in processed foods. Robert W. Yoder is credited with first using the term vitamania, in 1942, to describe the appeal of relying on nutritional supplements rather than on obtaining vitamins from a varied diet of foods. The continuing preoccupation with a healthy lifestyle has led to an obsessive consumption of additives the beneficial effects of which are questionable.|$|E
500|$|Several {{obstacles}} {{have been}} {{encountered in the}} development of astatine-based radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. World War II delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and {{it was not until the}} 1970s that monoclonal antibodies became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to dehalogenate from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at sp3 carbon sites (less so from sp2 sites). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a [...] "staggering" [...] number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue.|$|E

500|$|Original War Department {{estimates}} {{called for}} the Army to raise, equip, train, and deploy as many as 350 divisions. [...] Later estimates revised this number downward to between 200 and 220. [...] One factor that enabled this downward revision was that U.S. divisions were better equipped {{in some areas of}} their organizations than those of their adversaries, particularly later in the war; for example, every U.S. division was completely mechanized, while German divisions relied on as many as 4,000 horses for transporting soldiers, supplies, and artillery. [...] A variety of other factors, including the entry of the Soviet Union into the war {{on the side of the}} Allies after Adolf Hitler broke his non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin by launching Operation Barbarossa, the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> that enough farmers and agricultural workers were available for food production, and the need to maintain a U.S. workforce large enough to handle the production of weapons, vehicles, ammunition, and other equipment caused Army Chief of Staff Marshall to decide that maintaining the Army's ground combat strength at 90 divisions would strike the balance between too few soldiers to defeat the Axis powers, and so many that there were not enough civilians in the U.S. workforce.|$|E
500|$|In Great Britain, the {{philosophy}} of natural theology remained influential. William Paley's 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written {{at least in part}} {{as a response to the}} transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin. Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck, Grant, and Vestiges. Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his Principles of Geology, he criticized Lamarck's theories of development. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology, as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of [...] "archetypes" [...] in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, and the controversy surrounding Vestiges, showed him the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> that his own ideas were scientifically sound.|$|E
