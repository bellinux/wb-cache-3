25|$|Most modern typefaces set numeric digits {{by default}} as lining figures, {{which are the}} height of upper-case letters. <b>Non-lining</b> <b>figures,</b> styled to match lower-case letters, are often common in fonts {{intended}} for body text, as they {{are thought to be}} less disruptive to the style of running text. They are also called lower-case numbers or text figures for the same reason.|$|E

2500|$|Characters {{of uniform}} width are a {{standard}} feature of so-called monospaced fonts, used in programming and on typewriters. However, many fonts {{that are not}} monospaced use tabular figures. More complex font designs may include two or more combinations with one as the default and others as alternate characters. [...] Of the four possibilities, <b>non-lining</b> tabular <b>figures</b> are particularly rare {{since there is no}} common use for them.|$|R

50|$|In his writing, Majoor has {{described}} {{his work as}} being strongly influenced by {{his work as a}} book and graphic designer, including designing complex documents like classical music concert programmes. His three commercially released font families, Scala, Seria and Nexus, are all superfamilies of serif and humanist sans-serif designs intended to have the same character shapes and blend together well. Majoor's goals were to create digital fonts with many features of traditional printing, such as <b>non-lining</b> <b>figures,</b> true small caps and ligatures even in sans-serif versions, giving designers a comprehensive range of choices without having to use a mixture of fonts.|$|E
50|$|Like Eric Gill's 1927-30 design Gill Sans and Hans Eduard Meier's {{typeface}} Syntax, both {{upper and}} lower case are structurally modeled on serif old style faces. The lowercase roman a and g are two-story. FF Scala Sans italics are true italics, not sloped roman. The lowercase a, e, v and y are particularly calligraphic. FF Scala Sans is a very complete sans-serif in its inclusion of true small capitals, lining and <b>non-lining</b> (old style <b>figures)</b> and many ligatures. In 1993 an additional condensed width of the typeface was released. The typefaces are available through Font Shop International.|$|R
