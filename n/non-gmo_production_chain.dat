Further, the working capital of upstream firms are relatively {{more sensitive to the}} availability of credit. Using a large firm-level dataset for 15 European OECD countries and the United States, 2000 - 2009, combined with sector-level measures of relative position in <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> (“upstreamness”), we find strong empirical support for the model.

40|$|Firms use {{inventory}} and interruption insurance to manage disruption risk in their <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> They also take preparedness actions {{to reduce the}} expected length of disruptions. We analytically explore these three measures in a two-stage <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> We find that {{inventory and}} preparedness differ in their responses to insurance and to production-chain cost and risk characteristics. We prove that, for any fixed level of preparedness, insurance reduces both the total inventory and the downstream inventory but it can increase the upstream inventory. The total inventory, the upstream inventory, and the production-chain profit all increase (decrease) as cost (risk) shifts downstream in the <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> Downstream inventory moves in the opposite direction. If the firm adopts the preparedness measure but not inventory, we prove that insurance has {{no impact on the}} relative levels of upstream/downstream preparedness. Relative preparedness is also unaffected by the distribution of processing cost in the <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> However, when the firm can adopt both operational measures – inventory and preparedness – the relative preparedness is affected by insurance and by the distribution of processing cost across the <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> We numerically observe that the <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> profit increases as cost shifts downstream and risk shifts upstream.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the core of}} a quality management methodology for <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> optimization, applicable from early design stages of production systems to the production start-up, as well as its application in lithium-ion cell production. The entire methodology was presented before [1]. The results of the methodology's first step, which is based on process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), are briefly described since the collected correlations are the input for the further steps. This paper describes how these correlations are transferred into correlation matrices and then propagated over the entire <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> by means of multiple domain matrices (MDM). The resulting <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> MDM provides parameters with direct or indirect influences on the quality parameters of the final product. Furthermore, relevant parameters are selected by an iterative application of MDM based <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> analyses in combination with Pareto analysis and experimental investigations. Proceeding steps quantify the identified influences and derive set point values for the individual processes by means of a multivariate optimization of the final cell quality considering the entire <b>production</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

The {{goal of this}} study was to develop a model by which performance objectives for Salmonella prevalence at various points in the <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> can be determined, based on a preset final performance objective at the end of the processing line. The transmission of Salmonella through the broiler <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> was modeled. The prevalence at flock level was calculated from the measured prevalence at sample level. The transmission model is based on data on the occurrence of Salmonella collected in the Dutch broiler <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> during several years.

40|$|Spread {{of plant}} disease in <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> of {{planting}} material {{is a process}} of great economic importance, but has received little attention from plant disease epidemiologists. Disease control in <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> is therefore often based on rules of thumb and expert judgement by regulatory bodies, rather than on an explicit analysis and evaluation of the epidemiological and economic consequences of alternative strategies. This paper puts forward the idea that individual-based models may be used as a framework to simulate the spread of disease-causing organisms in plant <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> The ¿individuals¿ in this context are the trading units (e. g., batches, lots) of a <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> The quarantine disease ¿potato brown rot¿, caused by the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum, is used as an illustrative example.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{mechanism}} that links industry’s technological characteristics (i. e. quality of non-labor inputs, which is proxied by {{the length of}} industry <b>production</b> <b>chains),</b> industry-specific skill wage premium, and skill sorting across industries. It is hypothesized that high-skilled workers are sorted into industries where they can receive a higher skill wage premium, by working with better quality non-labor input. The quality of non-labor inputs {{is assumed to be}} worse in industries with longer <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> due to the increased involvement of low-skilled labor and poor infrastructure over the sequential production. By examining Indian wage and employment data for 1999 - 2000, empirical evidence to support this mechanism can be obtained: First, the skill wage premium is lower [higher] in industries with longer [shorter] <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> Second, the skill wage premium is lower [higher] in industries with a higher [lower] proportion of low-skilled workers producing inputs outside their own industry.

By utilizing industry export data on China and India from 1983 to 2000, we find that a country with a greater dispersion of skills (i. e., India, especially in the earlier years) has higher exports in industries with shorter <b>production</b> <b>chains,</b> whereas a country with a more equal dispersion of skills (i. e., China, especially in the later years) is found to have higher exports in industries with longer <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> The causal relationship is fairly robust across different specifications. This empirical evidence supports our assumption that the likely mechanism for these results is the negative impact of low-skilled workers on input quality, which accumulates and becomes larger as the length of <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> and the proportion of low-skilled workers in the economy increase.
