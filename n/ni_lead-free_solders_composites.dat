The European Union recently passed a law to ban the use of lead in electronic products. The ban will go into effect in July of 2006. The Japanese electronics industry has worked to eliminate lead from consumer electronic products for several years. Although currently there are no specific regulations banning lead in electronics devices in the United States, many companies and consortiums are working on <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> initiatives including Intel, Motorola, Agilent Technologies, General Electric, Boeing, NEMI and many others to avoid a commercial disadvantage.

In particular, accidental dropping is believed to cause substantial damage to the solder joints. The increasing occurrence of drop failure of portable electronics has been traced to the failure of the solder joints that interconnect the integrated circuit (IC) components with the printed circuit board (PCB). The increasing market pressure to replace lead based solder in electronic products has resulted in research being carried out in many areas related to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Thus, the reliability of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints under mechanical shock loading is a major concern. The main objective of this thesis is to study the failure mechanism and life prediction for lead-free ball grid array (BGA) solder joint subject to repetitive mechanical drop loading. The emphasis will be placed on the strain hardening effect of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint under repetitive mechanical drop loading. The mechanical properties of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy were first studied by the tensile test. The results showed that the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was strongly strain rate dependent. The constitutive model of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was built. Nanoindentation tests were employed to obtain the mechanical properties of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC. The nanoindentation hardness value for SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC was found to decrease with increasing aging time. The IMC layers grew in thickness during thermal aging tests, while there were no significant changes in the Young’s modulus of IMC. High speed ball pull tests were used to find the brittle fracture strength of IMC. The simulation of the high speed ball pull tests were studied and correlated with the high speed ball pull tests. Then the IMC brittle failure criterion was established. The strain hardening effects of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> were found by solder wire drop test and board level drop test (BLDT). The structure stiffening effects were also found by the strain measurement during the BLDT experiment.

The dominant strain rates of the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints were found by correlating the material properties with tensile tests.

Although PBGA packages have many advantages such as {{a larger number of}} I/Os, robust assembly process, and better thermal / electrical performance, their board level reliability is still a major concern. This is because their solder joints have a relatively short stand-off height especially for the Chip Scale Package (CSP). It is a global trend to replace today's harmful lead-containing <b>solders</b> with <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> in future electronic products. Although there are various <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> systems available in the industry, people are still unsure over the selection of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> {{due to the lack of}} reliability data.

The implementation of the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> is a challenging process. It involves lots of study of process control and reliability for the board level interconnects. This brings out the value of the current study on the experimental evaluation of board level solder joint reliability of plastic ball grid array assemblies with eutectic lead-tin and <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders.</b> Four different reliability tests, namely the accelerated temperature cycling test, three point bending test, random vibration test, and the mechanical drop test were performed to evaluate the reliability of the <b>lead-free</b> board level <b>solder</b> joint.

Issues addressed in this study include using VFM to reduce the solder reflow temperature, comparing the heating rate of different size solder particles, and comparing the reliability of VFM reflowed solder versus conventionally reflowed solder. Results comparing the effect of particle size on the heating rate of solder showed that the differences were negligible. This {{is due in part to}} the particle sizes overlapping. Many <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> pastes reflow around 250 ℃. Results indicate that when using the VFM, <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> paste will reflow at 220 ℃.

Due to the cyclic strain and stress in the materials making up the component these can cause damage and hence wear out failures. The recent move from lead to <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> by the electronics industry has necessitated the generation of material properties data that will allow accurate prediction of the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder’s</b> performance under vibration conditions. To assess the reliability of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> under vibration loading, test equipment has been designed for small solder joints. Such test equipment must be able to extract solder mechanical properties and physics of failure fatigue lifetime parameters/models for numerical model and prediction of lifetime of real electronic components. This paper focuses on the design, analysis and development of this type of test facility...|$|R
