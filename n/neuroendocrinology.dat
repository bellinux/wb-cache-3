5|$|William S. Kroger, who DeLee {{successfully}} revived as {{a newborn}} in 1906, graduated from {{medical school in}} 1930 and served a residency under DeLee in obstetrics, gynecology and <b>neuroendocrinology.</b> Since his childhood, Kroger had been urged by his mother {{to follow in the}} footsteps of the doctor who had saved his life. Kroger became a well-known authority on the use of hypnosis in obstetrics and other medical specialties.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscientific {{studies are}} {{examining}} the physiological underpinnings of observable attachment style, such as vagal tone which influences capacities for intimacy, stress response which influences threat reactivity (Lupien, McEwan, Gunnar & Heim, 2009), {{as well as}} <b>neuroendocrinology</b> such as oxytocin,. These types of studies underscore the fact that attachment is an embodied capacity not only a cognitive one.|$|E
25|$|At {{the systems}} level, the {{questions}} addressed in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce {{functions such as}} reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does vision work? How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound? How does the somatosensory system process tactile information? The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology {{address the question of}} how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. <b>Neuroendocrinology</b> and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. Despite many advancements, the way networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood.|$|E
2500|$|Depression, {{post-traumatic}} stress disorder, and chronic pain share symptoms resembling those of PCS. One {{study found that}} while people with chronic pain without TBI do report many symptoms {{similar to those of}} post-concussion syndrome, they report fewer symptoms related to memory, slowed thinking, and sensitivity to noise and light than people with mTBI do. [...] Additionally, it has been found that <b>neuroendocrinology</b> may account for depressive symptoms and stress management due to irregularities in cortisol regulation, and thyroid hormone regulation. [...] Lastly, there is evidence that major depression following TBI is quite common, but may be better accounted for with a diagnosis of dysexecutive syndrome.|$|E
