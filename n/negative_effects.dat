5|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>effects</b> of {{the coast}} trade on the native peoples of the Northwest {{included}} waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. Other health problems included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and sterility. The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. The overall number of slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these <b>negative</b> <b>effects,</b> the North West Coast natives were largely spared the additional effects that would have come had there been more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, native culture not only survived but flourished.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the role of {{corporate}} governance in reducing the <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of earnings management. The accounting data for U. S. firms during 2002 - 2010 were collected from WorldScope database and the corporate governance data were from ASSET 4, which is an affiliate of Thomson Reuter. Earnings management can be harmful to firm value if it arises from managerial opportunism, whereas {{it can also be}} beneficial if managers intend to convey some information about future earnings or reduce the volatility of reported earnings. The empirical evidence has shown that earnings management has a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on firm value. However, the <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of earnings management is neutralized by the role of corporate governance, which helps to reduce managerial opportunism. Firms with a lower CG score face the <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of earnings management, whereas firms with a higher CG score face a less-negative effect from earnings management. In other words, managerial opportunism with earnings management is lower in good-governance firms. Therefore, corporate governance provides a crucial role in reducing the <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of earnings management. </p...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> from yoga are beginners' {{competitiveness}} and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E
