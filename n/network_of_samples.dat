40|$|Network {{sampling}} {{is integral}} {{to the analysis of}} social, information, and biological networks. Since many real-world networks are massive in size, continuously evolving, and/or distributed in nature, the network structure is often sampled in order to facilitate study. For these reasons, a more thorough and complete understanding <b>of</b> <b>network</b> <b>sampling</b> is critical to support the field <b>of</b> <b>network</b> science. In this paper, we outline a framework for the general problem <b>of</b> <b>network</b> <b>sampling,</b> by highlighting the different objectives, population and units of interest, and classes <b>of</b> <b>network</b> <b>sampling</b> methods. In addition, we propose a spectrum of computational models for network sampling methods, ranging from the traditionally studied model based on the assumption of a static domain to a more challenging model that is appropriate for streaming domains. We design a family <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> methods based on the concept of graph induction that generalize across the full spectrum of computational models (from static to streaming) while efficiently preserving many of the topological properties of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how traditional static sampling algorithms can be modified for graph streams {{for each of the three}} main classes <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> methods: node, edge, and topology-based sampling. Experimental results indicate that our proposed family <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> methods more accurately preserve the underlying properties of the graph in both static and streaming domains.

Recent work in nutrient cycling has stressed the complexity and importance of the input factor, particularly when throughfall chemistry is taken into account. Frequently the differences between rates of input and output of salt in a river basin are small, suggesting that many published rates of solutional denudation, which consider outputs alone, or inputs only in part, are excessive. The input of salts, which may take place in rain, snow, fog and throughfall are most important in coastal areas.

By using our recently developed model of transport in highly heterogeneous formations {{we were able to}} predict the observed longitudinal mass distribution spreading and to compare with measurements. We found that prediction based on DPIL parameters led to agreement, while flowmeter data resulted in discrepancy.

Next, the validity of the mean square error formulas is tested by actually calculating an ensemble average of mean square estimation error.
