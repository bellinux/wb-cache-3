5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In a <b>normal</b> <b>person</b> at therapeutic doses, {{this effect is}} usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to global}} demand and the {{development}} staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to XIII. The game tackles {{the question of whether}} Lightning is happy after the events of XIII. Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character. Lightning's outfit in XIII-2 was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a science fiction-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the valkyries of Norse mythology. The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a <b>normal</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a <b>normal</b> <b>person</b> and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

When we examined the activity using non-adherent MNC instead of the whole MNC, the activities in patients with metastatic cancer rose up to almost the normal levels. In <b>normal</b> <b>persons</b> the decline of the activities after 3 days of culture were not observed after the removal of adherent cells.

These results were compared with those obtained by the conventional method using the medium composed of plasma mixed with heparin and chick embryo juice; and the author arrived at the following conclusions: 1. The average stain of mature neutrophils in the case of <b>normal</b> <b>persons</b> reaches the maximum of 1. 12 within 4 hours after the addition of neutral red solution, fading gradually thereafter. 2. In the case of leukemia mature neutrophils in the bone marrow are stained more deeply at an early stage as compared with those of normal persons; and in the acute leukemia they fade at an early stage, and in the chronic leukemia they fade more slowly than those of acute leukemia. 3. In the case of hypoplastic anemia mature neutrophils in the bone marrow are stained deeper and earlier than those is <b>normal</b> <b>persons,</b> and also they fade more quickly. 4. In the case of agranulocytosis mature neutrophils are stained more lightly than those in <b>normal</b> <b>persons.</b> 5. In the case of essential hypochromic anemia mature neutrophils in the bone marrow are stained more deeply and earlier than those in <b>normal</b> <b>persons,</b> but fading more slowly. In the case of pernicious anemia these neutrophils are stained more deeply {{both before and after the}} treatment than those in <b>normal</b> <b>persons,</b> but as for the fading before and after treatment, the former is slightly faster than the latter. 6. These results indicate that, although this method is slightly inferior to the conventional method from the standpoint of neutral red vital staining, it is rather a superior method for clinical application because of its simplicity in manipulation the same as in the study of the carbon-particle phagocytosis...|$|R

25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the <b>normal</b> <b>person</b> is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

The results are summarized as follows: When <b>normal</b> <b>persons</b> were injected intravenously with SI, its plasma concentrations became more or less stable in 20 minutes. Thereafter, the larger the amount given, the quicker was the fall in plasma concentrations. When the drugs under test were given orally to <b>normal</b> <b>persons,</b> the rise in plasma concentrations of MS 53 and SMP was considerably quick, reaching the highest levels in 3 to 4 hours. On the other hand, the plasma concentration of SDM rose very slowly, reaching the highest levels in about 10 hours. Especially small was the acetylated rate of SDM, which was only 7. 7 % in 24 hours. Of all the drugs under test, SMP and SDM excreted in 24 hour urine of <b>normal</b> <b>persons</b> were particularly small in percentage. Only 27. 0 and 19. 5 %, respectively, of the amounts given were excreted. When plasma concentrations of the unconjugated portion of SI were more than 10 mg/dl in <b>normal</b> <b>persons,</b> its renal clearance values tended to increase gradually, while they remained within a certain range when plasma concentrations were less than 10 mg/dl The clearance value in the latter cases was 19. 21 cc/min on the average.
