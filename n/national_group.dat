In 1993, he and other local AIM leaders, including Russell Means, Glenn T.

40|$|Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Prominent {{normative}} theories for accommodating minority <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> {{appeal to}} the value of national cultures and/or the psychology of group recognition. This article aims to show that an argument from political authority provides a better justification. Building on Joseph Raz's theory of authority, the article argues that members of minority <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> are disadvantaged in relation to their majority counterparts under standard democratic institutions; such institutions do not provide minority <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> with comparable access to the conditions for legitimate political authority. Constitutional arrangements for accommodating minority national groups-such as territorial self-government or power-sharing-are justified insofar as they might offset this disadvantage.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} that by redefining {{the notion of}} nationhood and by treating nations and national minorities equally with respect to self-determination, {{it is possible to}} formulate basic principles of the international legal system, which would promote territorial integrity and stability of multinational states better than the existing system. I demonstrate that theories dealing with self-determination based solely on human rights or cases of secession address the problem with inadequate tools. I also show that minority-rights approaches do not accommodate self-determination claims of <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> properly. I offer a new idea of nationhood as a political culture of self-determination with which people self-identify. It includes beliefs about co-nationals' mutual membership in a political community, which is perceived by them as having a self-determining power. Definitions of nationhood which use the notion of culture, but not political culture, are both too inclusive [...] -they fail to distinguish between <b>national</b> and ethnic <b>groups,</b> and too exclusive [...] -they overlook multicultural nations. Contested secession has received much attention in recent scholarship. Since, however, contested secession is based upon the disagreement of two or more <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> concerning their self-determination within particular boundaries, I consider secession within the scope of a systematic approach to the regulation of relations among <b>national</b> <b>groups.</b> I propose that international legal principles should be based upon the recognition of states and <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> as the two basic elements of the international system, and the equal recognition of nations as political cultures of self-determination. I interpret self-determination as a claim to equality within the boundaries a multinational state, and formulate a criterion of minimal justice for states. It requires that states respect equality of self-determination of <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> on their territory. <b>National</b> <b>groups</b> can secede from multinational states either by mutual agreement, or if their they are persistently denied a status with respect to self-determination equal to that of other <b>national</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow {{for the creation of a}} confederation with each <b>national</b> <b>group</b> exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.|$|E

The alliance between Lima and Andreotti proved beneficial to both. Although Andreotti had a strong electoral base in and around Rome, his faction had no power base in the rest of Italy. With Lima, who at some time controlled 25 percent of all party members in Sicily, the Andreotti faction turned into a truly <b>national</b> <b>group.</b> While Andreotti had been an important government minister before his alliance with Lima, he now {{became one of the most}} powerful politicians in Italy. Andreotti became prime minister for the first time in 1972. In 1974 Lima became Under-Secretary of the Budget. In 1979 Lima was elected in the European Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Akenson (1984) {{argued that}} the Canadian {{experience}} of Irish immigrants is not comparable to the American one. He contended that the numerical dominance of Protestants within the <b>national</b> <b>group</b> and the rural basis of the Irish community negated the formation of urban ghettos and allowed for a relative ease in social mobility. In comparison, the American Irish in the Northeast and Midwest were dominantly Catholic, urban dwelling, and ghettoized. There was however, the existence of Irish-centric ghettos in Toronto (Corktown, Cabbagetown, Trinity Niagara, the Ward) at the fringes of urban development, {{at least for the}} first few decades after the famine {{and in the case of}} Trefann Court, a holdout against public housing and urban renewal, up to the 1970s. This was also the case in other Canadian cities with significant Irish Catholic populations such as Montreal, Ottawa and Saint John.|$|E

25|$|Under foreign rule, the Low Countries {{were able}} to {{extensively}} develop economically and politically. However, {{the sense of a}} shared “nationality” was still non-existent. This sense of nationality was forged through conflict and was the result of opposition to a despotic governing body. This opposition grew stronger with imposed taxation and centralization by the foreign ruler. The Dutch Revolt that occurred {{as a result of this}} opposition changed forever the structure of the Netherlands. Known as the Eighty Years War, the revolt lasted between 1568 and 1648 and allowed for the beginning of the formation of a sense of nationality and at about the middle of the 16th century, people no longer described themselves as inhabitants of one of the Provinces, but simply as Belga or Flamengus both signifying Netherlander. An awareness of a common nationality started to emerge as people began to identify themselves with a <b>national</b> <b>group</b> rather than with local interests.|$|E
25|$|At the 1924 general election, McKeag, who had {{reputation}} for being a witty and able debater was the Liberal Party candidate for Durham but lost to the Labour Party candidate Joshua Ritson who had held the seat since 1922. He fought Durham again in 1929 but was again defeated by Ritson. By {{the time of the}} 1931 general election however, the national mood was swinging against Labour. The crisis in the economy over the summer of 1931 which brought about the National Government of prime minister Ramsay MacDonald meant that McKeag fought the general election in October as a Liberal in support of the National Government, enabling him {{to take advantage of the}} public support for the coalition and win the seat by the narrow majority of 270 votes. When the Liberal Party led by Sir Herbert Samuel withdrew from the coalition in November 1933, McKeag refused to cross the floor into opposition with Samuel. He then associated himself with the Liberal <b>National</b> <b>group</b> in Parliament led by Sir John Simon at least to allow him to be the nominated National candidate at the 1935 general election, which he fought under the description Liberal National in a straight fight with the former Labour MP Joshua Ritson. Labour were confident of a political revival in 1935, attacking the government on domestic policy and the armaments programme insisting that a vote for the National Government meant a vote for war. Durham went solidly Labour with the party winning every seat in the County, including the Seaham constituency represented by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.|$|E
500|$|Angelshark {{numbers have}} {{declined}} precipitously across {{most of its}} range; it is now believed to be extinct in the North Sea {{and most of the}} northern Mediterranean, and has become extremely rare elsewhere.

Fishery data compiled by the Working Group for Elasmobranch Fishes (WGEF) show that no angelsharks have been landed in the Northeast Atlantic since 1998. Fewer than a dozen angelsharks are thought to remain in Irish waters. Healthy subpopulations of angelsharks are thought to still persist in areas off North Africa and around the Canary Islands, though a more thorough assessment is urgently needed.|$|E

500|$|The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's [...] "Ragin' Cajuns" [...] are {{sometimes}} cited as counter-arguments {{to those that}} favor change.

The University of Notre Dame mascot, the UND leprechaun is a mythical being that represents the Irish, which is both an ethnic and a <b>national</b> <b>group.</b> The University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic cayenne pepper, an ingredient frequently found in Cajun cuisine.

500|$|It {{was agreed}} that RAAF {{operations}} during the Emergency would be {{directed by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) through Air Headquarters Malaya (later No.224 Group RAF). The British also wanted the Australian squadrons attached to an RAF wing. However, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal George Jones, was mindful of repeating the experience of World WarII, when RAAF units and personnel based in Britain had been absorbed by the RAF, rather than operating as a <b>national</b> <b>group</b> led by high-ranking Australian officers. He therefore decided that Nos.1 and 38 Squadrons should be formed into a [...] "composite" [...] organisation (one made up of disparate elements such as bomber, fighter, or reconnaissance units) and administered by an overarching RAAF headquarters, and put this requirement to the British Air Ministry. The Air Ministry agreed, and No.90 (Composite) Wing was duly established at Richmond on 10July 1950, {{under the command of}} Group Captain Paddy Heffernan.|$|E
500|$|According to {{economics}} professor and historian Jozo Tomasevich, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was politically weak {{from the moment}} of its creation and remained so during the interwar period mainly due to a [...] "rigid system of centralism", the strong association between each <b>national</b> <b>group</b> and its dominant religion, and uneven economic development. In particular, the religious primacy of the Serbian Orthodox Church in national affairs and discrimination against Roman Catholics and Muslims compounded the dissatisfaction of the non-Serb population with the Serb-dominated ruling groups that treated non-Serbs as second-class citizens. This centralised system arose from Serbian military strength and Croat intransigence, and was sustained by Croat disengagement, Serb overrepresentation, corruption and a lack of discipline within political parties. Until 1929, this state of affairs was maintained by subverting the democratic system of government. The domination of the rest of Yugoslavia by Serb ruling elites meant that the country was never consolidated in the political sense, and was therefore never able to address the social and economic challenges it faced.|$|E
