25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.|$|E

2500|$|Revertive pulsing is {{a method}} of {{signaling}} in which the terminating equipment sends pulses backwards to the originating equipment as it hunts for the appropriate terminal. This {{is in contrast to}} more modern forms of forward pulsing where the originating equipment will directly outpulse to the terminating side the information it needs to connect the call. In Panel offices, as the selectors were driven upwards by the motors, brushes attached to the vertical selector rods [...] wiped over commutators {{at the top of the}} frame. These commutators contained alternating segments which serve either as insulators or conductors. When the brush passed over a conductive segment, it was grounded, thereby generating a pulse which was sent back to the sender in the originating office for counting. When the sender counted the appropriate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses,</b> it cut the power to the solenoid in the terminating office, and caused the brush to stop at its current position.|$|E

50|$|The first {{advantage}} the ASR-11 offers {{is the use}} of a low-peak, {{solid state}} transmitter with pulse compression technology, replacing the ASR-9's high peak, short pulse power system. This gives the radar the ability to provide the same amount of energy to a target at long range while making the radar less sensitive at shorter ranges. Any aircraft that comes closer than six nautical miles from the radar cannot be located with the long range pulse system built into the ASR-11. Installing additional radar equipment to the same antenna is required for close range location and weather detection. The second advantage of using an ASR-11 is the radars ability to utilize a pulse sequence diversity. This gives the radar system the capability to limit processing dwells to a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses.</b> This feature becomes most important when monitoring air traffic is the primary use of the radar. Reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> sent out by the radar system also has a direct effect on the Doppler resolution, resulting in a decreased ability to process live weather conditions.|$|E
