25|$|Emphasis and {{contrast}} may override normal stress. Pronouns frequently take stress because of this. In {{a simple question}} like Ĉu vi vídis? ('Did you see?'), the pronoun hardly <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> and is unstressed; compare Né, dónu al mí and ('No, give me). Within a word, a prefix that wasn't heard correctly may be stressed upon repetition: Né, ne tíen! Iru máldekstren, mi diris! ('No, not over there! Go left, I said!'). Because stress doesn't distinguish words in Esperanto, shifting it to an unexpected syllable calls attention to that syllable, but doesn't cause confusion as it might in English.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 467 {{he was one of}} the comites who {{accompanied}} the new emperor of the West, Anthemius, to Italy with a large army. In 468 we see him with the title of patrician which was given to him by Anthemius. Some explaining <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> here, since at this time Ricimer still held magister utriusque militum and patrician according to the fasti, and it appears Atheminus wished for Marcellinus to have the similar power held by Ricimer in order to be a counterbalance to him. In the East, it was established practice for both magistri militum praesentales to be equal but in the West it had become common for one magister, (usually the magister peditum), to be superior over the other and so this may have been an attempt by Anthemius to introduce the eastern structure and rule like an eastern emperor using the successful and trustworthy Marcellinus as his second commander.|$|E

He had written of the future: [...] "I ... cannot think of a single person who could say what I believe <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> ... there is practically no one on whose judgement I could rely". The festival's uncertain outlook was aggravated by Cosima's total withdrawal from all contact except that of her daughters and her friend and adviser Adolf von Groß. Without Cosima's participation the 1883 festival, as planned by Wagner—12 performances of Parsifal—went ahead, with Emil Scaria (who sang the role of Gurnemanz in the opera) doubling as artistic director. The cast was largely that of 1882, and Levi remained as conductor.|$|E

500|$|For Rise Against, Appeal to Reason {{marked a}} musical {{shift from the}} gritty punk rock that had {{previously}} defined their career, to a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The New York Times felt the album was more tune-oriented than the band's previous works, while John Hanson of Sputnikmusic said that the album is [...] "'appealing' to a larger audience than old fans will be comfortable with". According to Bill Stewart of PopMatters, [...] "Appeal to Reason is a Rise Against album.

Atheneus remarks that [...] "For when such women change to a life of sobriety they are better than the women who pride themselves on their respectability" [...] (XIII, 38), and cites numerous great Greek men who had been fathered by a citizen and a courtesan, such as the Strategos Timotheus, son of Conon. Finally, there is no known example of a woman of the citizen class voluntarily becoming a hetaera.|$|E

According to review aggregator website Metacritic, the album received an average critic score of 72 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated, [...] "They demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album -- it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head -- that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly magazine rated the album [...] "A-" [...] {{and called it}} their best album, while Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, wrote a mixed review explaining [...] "Viva la Vidas mild tinkering with the formula represents a failure of imagination: perhaps it's hard to {{think outside the box}} when the box is the size of the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena. Equally, however, there's a genuine conviction about its contents, a huge advance both on its predecessor and their legion of imitators." [...] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that [...] "Coldplay's desire to unite fans around the world with an entertainment they can all relate to is the band's strength, and a worthy goal. But on Viva la Vida, a record that wants to make strong statements, it's also a weakness. Sometimes, to say what <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> you need to risk pissing people off." [...] Melodic magazine's critic Kaj Roth gave the album 4/5 and felt that [...] "the typical Coldplay trademark is there too with beautiful atmospheric melodies that will embrace the heart". Spin magazine's critic Mikael Wood said in a positive review of the album, [...] "For all of Coldplay's experimentation, though, there's no doubting that Viva la Vida, with its sturdy melodies and universal themes -- think love, war and peace -- is an album meant to connect with the masses (arenas have been built for less than the climax of [...] "Death and All His Friends"). The band's triumph lies in how exciting they make that prospect seem". IGN gave the album 9.3/10 and Q said [...] "...So some habits die hard, but on every other level Viva La Vida...is an emphatic success...radical in its own measured way but easy to embrace..." [...] Robert Christgau gave it a one-star honorable mention (...) , saying, [...] "Applying all his powers, Chris Martin successfully dilutes Radiohead, with--what else?--pleasant results." ...|$|E
