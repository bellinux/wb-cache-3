40|$|AbstractProtein-Protein-Interactions (PPIs) {{play the}} most {{important}} roles in most (if not all) of the biological processes. A few such examples include hormone–receptor binding, signal transduction, chaperone activity, antigen-antibody interactions. The disruptions of PPIs may therefore {{lead to the development}} of human inherited diseases. There are different analytical techniques to identify amino acid residues in protein interfaces. But they are time consuming, labour intensive and above all very expensive. As an alternative approach to the analytical methods, we have tried to develop machine learning tools to differentiate between protein interface and non-interface amino acid residues. We used sequence- and structure-based features derived from a set of protein hetero-complex structure files from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We have built supervised predictors based on Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We have evaluated them with 10 -fold cross-validations. Both of our sequence and structure based RF predictors performed better than SVM based ones. The most predictive sequence- and structure- based features are the attributes which measure sequence conservation at a specified amino acid residue and various other measurements of the amino acid residue's <b>neighbouring</b> <b>charge</b> distributions. Our sequence- and structure-based RF classifiers have been validated by evaluating them against the protein complexes with experimentally proven interaction sites. Our predictors are found to detect the protein interface residues in practice. Availability: [URL]...|$|E

We study Gibbs distribution at finite positive temperature extending recent results on the zero temperature case (ground states) with external force. We derive the asymptotic for the mean and for the variances of the distances between the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>charges.</b> We prove that depending {{on the strength of}} the external force there are several phase transitions in the local structure of the configuration of the particles in the limit when the number of particles goes to infinity...|$|R

In this paper we will present results for dust growth by ion accretion, under the combined in uence of an applied magnetic eld and the evolving electrostatic eld arising from the charged grain.

30|$|To {{study the}} phase {{stability}} and the aggregate elastic constants of SiC under high pressures, we formulate an interatomic potential. The proposed interaction potential {{is based on}} the following assumptions: variations in force constants of Si and C are small, the short-range interactions between Si and C atoms are effective up to their second-neighbour ions, and harmonic elastic forces are viable for a pair of atoms without any internal strains within the crystal. Application of mechanical pressure as external variable causes an increase in the overlap of adjacent ions in a crystal. The result is a charge transfer takes place between the overlapping electron shells of Si and C atoms. The transferred <b>charges</b> interact with <b>neighbouring</b> <b>charges</b> around the lattice via Coulomb’s law. Also, the chemical bonds in SiC are both ionic and covalent in nature and the application of pressure causes change in crystal structure (first-order structural phase transition), volume collapse and elastic properties.|$|R
25|$|Interestingly, {{the model}} does not predict {{any change in}} leaving group {{departure}} at the transition state. Instead the extent of deprotonation is expected to decrease. This {{can be explained by}} the fact that a better leaving group needs less assistance from a developing <b>neighbouring</b> negative <b>charge</b> in order to depart. The true change predicts more carbocation character at the transition state and a mechanism that is more E1-like. These observations can be correlated with Hammett ρ-values. Poor leaving groups correlate with large positive ρ-values. Gradually increasing the leaving group ability decreases the ρ-value until it becomes large and negative, indicating the development of positive charge in the transition state.|$|R

It is shown that multiple spreading is ultimately effective {{especially in the case}} when the spreading functions of <b>neighbouring</b> point <b>charges</b> overlap. In the cases of a simple exponential and a Gaussian spreading functions the effect of multiplicity of spreading on the rate of convergence is discussed along with an additional optimization of the spreading parameter in dependence on the cut-off parameters of lattice summation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} with β of the {{distributions of}} the spacing 's' between nearest-neighbour levels of unfolded spectra of random matrices from the β-Hermite ensemble (β-HE) is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. The random matrices from the β-HE are real symmetric and tridiagonal where β, which can take any positive value, is the reciprocal of {{the temperature in}} the classical electrostatic interpretation of eigenvalues. The distribution of eigenvalues coincide with those of the three classical Gaussian ensembles for β= 1, 2, 4. The use of the β-HE ensemble results in an incomparable speed up and efficiency of numerical simulations of all spectral characteristics of large random matrices. Generalized gamma distributions are shown to be excellent approximations of the nearest-neighbor spacing (NNS) distributions for any β while being still simple. They account both for the level repulsion in ˜sβ when s→ 0 and for the whole shape of the NNS distributions in the range of 's' which is accessible to experiment or to most numerical simulations. The exact NNS distribution of the GOE (β= 1) is in particular significantly better described by a generalized gamma distribution than it is by the Wigner surmise while the best generalized gamma approximation coincides essentially with the Wigner surmise for β>˜ 2. They describe too the evolution of the level repulsion between that of a Poisson distribution and that of a GOE distribution when β increases from 0 to 1. The distribution of ln (s), related to the electrostatic interaction energy between <b>neighbouring</b> <b>charges,</b> is accordingly well approximated by a generalized Gumbel distribution for any β⩾ 0. The distributions of the minimum NN spacing between eigenvalues of matrices from the β-HE, obtained both from as-calculated eigenvalues and from unfolded eigenvalues are Brody distributions which are classically used to characterize the spectral fluctuations of various physical systems...|$|R

30|$|Artificial {{low-dimensional}} nano-sized objects, like quantum dots, quantum {{wires and}} quantum wells, {{as well as}} structures based on them, are promising systems for improvement of existing devices and for development of principally new devices for opto-, micro- and nano-electronics. Besides, the investigation of physical properties of such structures is also of fundamental importance. In both regards, amazing perspectives are provided when playing around with quantum dots that {{can be considered as}} artificial atoms with a controlled number of charge carriers that have a discrete energy spectrum[1, 2]. Arrays {{of a large number of}} quantum dots including multilayer heterostructures make it possible to create artificial “solids” whose properties can be controllably changed by varying the characteristics of constituent elements (“atoms”) and/or the environment (semiconductor matrix). The rich set of exciting physical properties in this kind of systems originates from single-particle and collective interactions that depend on the number and mobility of carriers in quantum dots, Coulomb interaction between the carriers inside a quantum dot and in <b>neighbouring</b> quantum dots, <b>charge</b> coupling between <b>neighbouring</b> quantum dots, polaron and exciton effects, etc. Since characteristic energy scales of these interactions (distance between energy levels, Coulomb interaction between charges in quantum dots, one- and multiparticle exciton and polaron effects, plasmon excitations, etc.) are of order of several meV[3 – 5], an appropriate experimental tool for their study is provided by optical spectroscopy in the far-infrared and terahertz bands.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report a}} {{comprehensive}} theory {{to evaluate the}} kinetics of complex formation between metal ions and charged spherical nanoparticles. The latter consist of an ion-impermeable core surrounded by a soft shell layer characterized by a discrete axisymmetric 2 D distribution of charged sites that bind metal ions. The theory explicitly integrates the conductive diffusion of metal ions from bulk solution toward the respective locations of the reactive sites within the particle shell volume. The kinetic constant kos a for outer-sphere nanoparticle-metal association is obtained from {{the sum of the}} contributions stemming from all reactive sites, each evaluated from the corresponding incoming flux of metal ions derived from steady-state Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. Illustrations are provided to capture the basic intertwined impacts of particle size, overall particle charge, spatial heterogeneity in site distribution, type of particle (hard, core-shell or porous) and concentration of the background electrolyte on k(a) (os). As a limit, kos a converges with predictions from previously reported analytical expressions derived for porous particles with low and high charge density, cases that correspond to coulombic and mean-field (smearedout) electrostatic treatments, respectively. The conditions underlying the applicability of these latter approaches are rigorously identified in terms of (i) the extent of overlap between electric double layers around <b>charged</b> <b>neighbouring</b> sites, and (ii) the magnitude of the intraparticulate metal concentration gradient. For the first time, the proposed theory integrates the differentiated impact of the local potential around the charged binding sites amidst the overall particle field, together with that of the sofar discarded intraparticulate flux of metal ions...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{dissertation}} is {{to evaluate}} waste management policies to limit municipal solid waste (MSW) production and disposal of garbage. Understanding MSW production and disposal is of prime importance for communities to choose appropriate policy instruments to attain their garbage disposal targets. Notwithstanding the extensive interest of scholars during the last decades, {{new developments in the}} MSW market reveal important shortcomings in both empiric and theoretic research. In particular we identify three potential sources of bias when evaluating economic and political incentives for reducing MSW disposal. It is our goal to tackle these three shortcomings and demonstrate their impact by means of specific case studies. First, as indicated by Besley and Case (2000), if policy intervention is responsive to economic and political conditions within its jurisdiction, then {{it may be necessary to}} control or to correct for the forces that cause the policy to change if one wishes to obtain estimates of a policys incidence. Techniques to circumvent this endogeneity problem, such as difference-in-differences, matching, instrumental variables and, Heckmans two-stage estimator, are commonly used methods for program evaluation. However, when assessing effectiveness of waste reduction policies these statistical methods are rarely used. In the first chapter (published in waste Management, see De Jaeger and Eyckmans, 2008) we will give an introduction to one of these techniques the difference-in-differences (or DD) estimator and argue that it is a useful tool for assessing waste management policies. We start by showing that existing dynamic DD techniques can be extended to accommodate for more than one treatment group. Next, we apply this technique to a Flemish voluntary waste policy program to demonstrate its relevance for evaluating MSW management policies. In the second chapter (published in Waste Management and Research, see De Jaeger, 2009) we further extend the DD methodology in order to evaluate the real impact of weight-based pricing schedules in MSW. The main idea is to use historical observations on MSW production to determine which version of the difference-in-differences technique is most suitable to assess the impact of a policy action on MSW quantities. Second, numerous empirical studies in the field of strategic tax policy interaction among local governments have shown the existence of spatial policy interaction. Heyndels and Vuchelen (1998), for instance, show that local income and property tax policies are strongly correlated among neighbouring municipalities in Belgium. A similar principle appears to be true for MSW taxes. In chapter 3 we set up a two-stage theoretical model of consumers demand and municipalities pricing policy for residual MSW collection and processing. We test the predictions from this model using the proper techniques in spatial econometrics. The results indicate, as predicted by our model, local governments strategically interact with each other when setting the price for MSW. Based on chapter 3 we can conclude local policy makers mimic waste tax rates because they believe voters try to overcome information asymmetries by comparing the local policies with neighbouring municipalities when evaluating the performance of their incumbents. In chapter 5 we go a step further and explicitly test for political costs in terms of popularity scores. We test if voters indeed use neighbouring tax rates as a yardstick, or if other principles drive their attitude towards tax rates. As expected, voters do not engage in yardstick voting, but are rather averse to increases in MSW tax rates in general. Third, in responses to financial incentives to reduce waste, like unit based-pricing, households might be tempted to engage in illicit behaviour as an alternative to recycling, composting or adjusting purchasing habits. The possibility of increasing illegal forms of waste disposal has always been an important concern for local policy makers when deciding on the payment schemes. New (but anecdotic) evidence suggests the existence of a form of illegal waste dumping which has not yet been analysed in the literature. If <b>neighbouring</b> municipalities <b>charge</b> significantly different prices at their recycling sites, residents have an incentive to present their waste at the cheapest location. As the prices often do not reflect the true processing costs for the municipalities, waste import is perceived as problematic by the local policy makers. In chapter 4 we present a simple theoretical model of consumers demand for waste collection and processing facilities and test the predictions from the model using a set of spatial econometric tools. Our estimation results indicate that bulky household refuse levels indeed depend on the prices <b>charged</b> in <b>neighbouring</b> municipalities. For other waste fractions like demolition waste, garden waste, scrap metal and wood waste we find no proof for waste export. This is not surprising as we argue some waste fractions are more sensitive to spatial differences in prices than others. Finally chapter 6 (published in Waste Management, see De Jaeger et al., 2011) studies the impact of some local policies aimed at MSW reduction on the cost efficiency of MSW collection and disposal. We explicitly account for endogeneity of local policies by using a bootstrapped version of the Data Envelopment Analysis methodology in combination with a matching technique. Our results indicate that municipalities that are member of a waste collection joint venture, or that subscribe to a voluntary agreement to reduce MSW at the highest ambition level, collect and process MSW more efficiently than other municipalities. Weekly instead of two-weekly waste collection, or using a weight-based pricing system appears to have no impact on efficiency. Our results show that aiming at MSW reduction does not lead to lower efficiency of public service provision, even on the contrary. Key references Besley, T. J. and A. C.
