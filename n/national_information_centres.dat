Limited resources have been one main barrier to satisfying the growing informational needs of the users. Now, the Indian libraries are planning various methods of resource sharing to help meet information demands. Attitudes of library and institutional managements have undergone a change, to become more open to the benefi ts of resource sharing. A number of formal arrangements are being made for resource sharing among the libraries. A number of resource-sharing activities are discussed in this article, broadly arranged under four headings: National Information System in Science and Technology (NISSAT) <b>National</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centres</b> (NIC); library consortia; document delivery services; and interlibrary cooperation. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|To {{talk about}} {{information}} work and libraries {{in developing countries}} is perhaps presumptuous. Conditions are so different in different countries of the world. One talks of 2 ̆ 7 Africa 2 ̆ 7, {{but it is difficult}} to generalise - is one thinking of West Africa or East Africa. Even within regions, there are considerable differences: compare Francophone and Anglophone West Africa, for instance. Even within countries, of course there are differences: in Nigeria there are nineteen states, created because of local distinctions and differences. Division by religion is another factor but then a religion can be different in different ways: Christianity differs from place to place, as does Mohammedism or Buddhism. Yet it is possible to make some generalisations. The development of an infrastructure is an econornical necessity for all developing countries. It must be based on a realistic appraisal of what exists. In most countries of this type, there is a hierarchy of libraries from special libraries (frequently of a good standard) to public or school libraries (frequently non-existant). Communications amongst them will depend on the communication standards of the country. A major problem is that attraction of appropriate and qualified personnel, and education and training varies, and can also be a problem. The Unesco programmes - Unisist and Natis - now unified into the General Information Programme have influenced development. In a recent Loughborough PhD thesis, Choi Jung Sin of Korea, examined information and library systems in advanced developing countries. He found that in many countries there are national committees, but that their role (and effectiveness) varies. Information centres and services are found in most countries, starting from the general service and developing into specialised services. The concentration is on science and technology (especially agriculture and medicine). The standard of archive repositories is also variable. The mechanisation of work in <b>National</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centres</b> is in its infancy. Obstacles to development are shortage of qualified staff, lack of a national policy, insufficient funding, lack of coordination and lack of user education. Improvement of education and manpower planning is essential, as are clearer concepts of professional service. Much data needs to be collected by research workers, but the most effective work must be done by the nationals of the countries themselves...|$|E
