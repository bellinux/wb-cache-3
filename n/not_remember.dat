5|$|Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick {{alleged that}} Clinton had raped {{her in the}} spring of 1978, {{although}} she stated she did <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the exact date. In another 1998 event, Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton. Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.|$|E

5|$|Ramírez had {{difficulty}} with his vision; {{he could not}} see which pitch the catcher was calling for. He was fitted for prescription goggles, which he continued to wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time did <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez must not have been in the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him.|$|E

5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{arrives at}} the Ruskin Dam and finds a number of burned corpses, {{including}} those belonging to Quiet Willy and Dmitri.

Jeffrey Spender arrives looking for his mother, Cassandra (Veronica Cartwright), who is missing. Mulder meets with Scully about the incident, but she does <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> anything. Jeffrey sees Mulder and warns him not {{to get involved with}} his mother, who remains missing.|$|E
5|$|Images of the First and Second Doctors are {{displayed}} on the Doctor's mirror device and printout from the TARDIS' typewriter. The episode presents these trips as the Doctor's compensation to Amy for her fiancé Rory Williams' death in the previous episode, which Amy herself does <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> since Rory was consumed by {{a crack in the}} universe and thus erased from time. Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, and the Doctor later accidentally addresses Amy and Vincent as Amy and Rory, respectively.|$|E

They head to the VHA hospital in New Jersey where they discover that Cole was discharged, despite the fact that his doctor does <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> doing so.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does <b>not</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the exact location of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E

He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they said they could <b>not</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Tramp {{encounters}} {{the drunken}} millionaire {{a third time}} and is again invited to the mansion.

5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{game in the}} 2004 {{season in}} which Favre and the Packers {{finished}} 10–6 was against the New York Giants. During the game, Favre suffered a concussion. He did not receive medical clearance to re-enter the game. Despite the concussion, Favre threw a 28-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on a fourth down play. Afterwards {{it was reported that}} Favre did <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> throwing the touchdown pass. Favre also had two significant touchdown streaks of note during the season. He had completed at least one touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games over the 2002–2004 seasons which at the time was the second longest streak in NFL history. Also, during the 2004 post-season, he broke Dan Marino's record for consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass in the post season. Favre went on to throw a touchdown pass in twenty consecutive playoff games which is still an NFL record.|$|E
5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E
