5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|Mace {{discovers the}} fugitives {{and refuses to}} let them go or help find Morrow. The Ghost Rider attacks and defeats Mace, only sparing his life because of Gabe's pleading. Coulson convinces Mace that Robbie can be prosecuted later, and that they need to stop Lucy <b>now.</b> <b>When</b> they find Lucy, Robbie destroys her, but not before she reveals that Morrow wanted the Darkholds power for himself and had {{intentionally}} turned her into this ghostly state. Coulson finds Morrow, to see him attempt an experiment on himself. An energy blast from the experiment makes Coulson, Robbie, and agent Leo Fitz disappear, and Morrow successfully displays the ability to create matter.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Major Generals Shmuel Gonen and Chaim Bar-Lev, {{the heads}} of Israeli Southern Command and Sharon's superiors, {{continued}} to press Sharon to send forces to the east bank to widen the corridor to the Israeli bridgehead, while Sharon ignored these commands repeatedly, claiming that the attacks were unnecessary. Gonen finally issued a peremptory order to Sharon to transfer troops to the east bank and conduct a full-scale attack to widen the corridor. Sharon only sent five tanks as reinforcement to the armored brigade on the east bank tasked with launching the attack. Consequently, the Israelis suffered heavy losses and the assault was repulsed. Gonen and Bar-Lev were now joined by Lieutenant General David Elazar, and ordered Sharon to renew the attack, this time transferring Reshef's brigade. Sharon opposed this however, and argued that if he succeeded in his mission, the Egyptian Second Army would collapse, thereby eliminating any Egyptian threat to the Israeli corridor and bridgehead. He retorted with the claim that {{had it not been}} for Southern Command's hesitation, he could have encircled Ismailia by <b>now.</b> <b>When</b> his superiors remained adamant, Sharon bypassed the chain of command and contacted the Minister of Defense, Moshe Dayan, who called off any further attacks on the east bank. As a result, Sharon would be able to concentrate his attention and the efforts of his three brigades in the final push to capture Ismailia.|$|E

25|$|For example, a PID loop is used {{to control}} the {{temperature}} of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. <b>Now</b> <b>when</b> the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after {{the opening of the}} door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.|$|E
25|$|Liver biopsies involve {{taking a}} sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then {{quantified}} and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially cirrhosis, measured microscopically. Formerly, {{this was the only}} way to confirm a diagnosis of haemochromatosis but measures of transferrin and ferritin along with a history are considered adequate in determining the presence of the malady. Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding and infection. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> a history and measures of transferrin or ferritin point to haemochromatosis, it is debatable whether a liver biopsy is still necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron.|$|E
25|$|If Not <b>Now,</b> <b>When</b> ? is {{an album}} that expresses sincere love, peace, and happiness. Each song taps {{into its own}} theme that speaks on love and “hailing halleluiah every day.” The songs speak on life and the process and journey to {{discovering}} happiness. Although much of the album takes on a very peaceful tone, Incubus also incorporates a political perspective in their song Thieves. The song thieves speak on “the paragon of civilization.” In this song, he poses the question “why should the thieves have all the fun, selling water by the river?” He references to “god fearing white Americans” and insinuates that in America, that privilege is the ticket to happiness.|$|E

25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era.

He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a flag-to-flag {{rule for}} MotoGP was introduced. Previously, if a race started dry and rain fell, {{officials}} could red-flag (stop) {{the race and}} either restart or resume on 'wet' tyres. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> rain falls, a white flag is shown, indicating that riders can pit to swap the motorcycle on which they started the race for an identical one, {{as long as the}} tyres are different (that is, intermediates or slicks instead of wets). Besides different tyres, the wet-weather bikes have steel brake rotors and different brake pads instead of the carbon discs and pads used on the 'dry' bikes. This is because the carbon brakes need to be very hot to function properly, and the water cools them too much. The suspension is also 'softened' up somewhat for the wet weather.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{the area}} flooded {{by the river}} was more {{extensive}} and in years with high rainfall, floodwater would reach the western outskirts of Timbuktu itself. A small navigable creek {{to the west of}} the town is shown on the maps published by Heinrich Barth in 1857 and Félix Dubois in 1896. Between 1917 and 1921, during the colonial period, the French used slave labour to dig a narrow canal linking Timbuktu with Kabara. Over the following decades this became silted and filled with sand, but in 2007 as part of the dredging project, the canal was re-excavated so that <b>now</b> <b>when</b> the River Niger floods, Timbuktu is again connected to Kabara. The Malian government has promised to address problems with the design of the canal as it currently lacks footbridges and the steep unstable banks make access to the water difficult.|$|E

As the campaign got more and more attention in the media, the number of people started attending demonstrations in support of the house rapidly increased. The demonstrations grew from a couple of hundred people to numbering several thousands in just a few months. For {{the first time in its}} history, Ungdomshuset experienced massive support from people outside radical left-wing circles. Much of this support came from young people, some of whom had never even visited the house before. Many of these young people was later going to form the main bulk of protesters in the subsequent riots.|$|E
25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth.

Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. <b>Now</b> <b>when</b> splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
