This view states that price levels for <b>nontradables</b> are lower in poorer countries because of differences in endowment of labor and capital, not because of lower levels of productivity. Poor countries have more labor relative to capital, so marginal productivity of labor is greater in rich countries than in poor countries. <b>Nontradables</b> tend to be labor-intensive; therefore, because labor is less expensive in poor countries and is used mostly for <b>nontradables,</b> <b>nontradables</b> are cheaper in poor countries.

40|$|The Balassa-Samuelson model (BS hereafter) has {{achieved}} workhorse {{status in the}} analysis of trends observed in industrialized countries regarding the relative price of <b>nontradables</b> (Balassa [1964] and Samuelson [1964]). The model delivers two important testable implications. First, the relative price of <b>nontradables</b> is strictly proportional to the productivity differential between traded and non traded goods sectors. In other words, an increase by 1 % in relative productivity raises the relative price by 1 %. Second, the relative price being totally fixed by supply-side considerations, government spending shocks leave it unchanged in the long run. This paper empirically revisits the relationship between the relative price of <b>nontradables</b> and exogenous shocks to productivity and government spending. Our empirical evidence, by confirming earlier studies, casts doubt on the BS model's predictions. We find that a rise in the cross-sectoral productivity differential by 1 % raises the relative price of <b>nontradables</b> by only 0. 70 %, providing little support for the proportionality hypothesis implied by the BS model (see Canzoneri et al. [1999] and Kakkar [2003]). Importantly, we also report an increase in the relative price by around 1 % in response to a positive government spending shock equal to 1 % of output, in line with evidence documented by De Gregorio et al. [1994 b] and Balvers and Bergstrand [2002] among others. We propose an explanation for these observed effects based on variations in the composition of demand for <b>nontradables</b> which provide an incentive for firms to change markups...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} why the price of <b>nontradables</b> relative to tradables is positively correlated with income per worker. I construct a two-sector model in which agents differ with respect to managerial ability. Agents sort themselves by choosing to become a worker, a manager in <b>nontradables,</b> or a manager in tradables. A fixed cost of exporting places the most productive managers in the tradable sector, and the magnitude of the fixed cost determines the extent of this margin. Fixed costs together with trade costs determine the amount of competition across sectors which in turn determines prices across sectors. The calibrated model explains more than 60 % of the cross-country differences in the relative price of <b>nontradables,</b> due to the presence of larger fixed costs in poor countries combined with nontrivial import costs. ...|$|R

The results show that core inflation in both countries is primarily driven by the <b>nontradable</b> factor.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic and desirable properties of monetary regimes in a remittances recipient economy, {{with an emphasis}} on the effect on sectoral output and <b>nontradable</b> inflation dynamics. The findings indicate that under a fixed exchange rate regime, an increase in remittances creates increased demand for <b>nontradable</b> goods, and hence a rise in <b>nontradable</b> inflation as well as expansion in output of nontradables. Under a <b>nontradable</b> inflation targeting regime, however, a decrease in <b>nontradable</b> inflation, and an expansion in tradable goods production are observed following an increase in remittances. A near-zero <b>nontradable</b> inflation rate, and a managed variability in the nominal exchange rate typifies the optimal monetary policy, suggesting that an inflation targeting regime is preferable to a fixed exchange regime under such a scenario.

The paper discusses this hypothesis within framework of the Portuguese current account adjustment, which is the result of European financial integration in catching-up countries. The common monetary policy and common currency cannot offset the negative impact of <b>nontradable</b> price increase within the internal expenditure switching effect and also can not support exporters within the external expenditure effect [...] The Portuguese current account adjustment was not followed by the currency depreciation and the tradable price increase.

40|$|Large devaluations are {{generally}} associated with large declines in real exchange rates. Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2005) {{argue that the}} primary force causing these declines is often the slow adjustment {{in the price of}} <b>nontradable</b> goods and services. We develop a model which embodies two complementary forces that account for the large declines in the real exchange rate that occur in the aftermath of large devaluations. The first force is sticky <b>nontradable</b> goods prices. Instead of simply assuming that <b>nontradable</b> goods prices are sticky, we develop conditions under which this phenomenon can emerge as an equilibrium outcome. The second force is the impact of real shocks that often accompany large devaluations. These real shocks lead to a decline in the price of <b>nontradable</b> goods relative to traded goods. We argue that sticky <b>nontradable</b> goods prices generally {{play an important role in}} explaining post-devaluation movements in real exchange rates. However, there are cases in which sticky <b>nontradable</b> goods prices are not sustainable as an equilibrium phenomenon. In these cases real shocks are the primary driver of real exchange rate movements.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a continuous-time two-country dynamic equilibrium model, {{in which the}} real exchange rates, asset prices, and terms of trade are jointly determined {{in the presence of}} <b>nontradable</b> goods. The model determines the relation between the financial markets and real goods markets in the world economy and their responses to various shocks under the home bias assumption. A positive domestic supply shock induces a positive return on the domestic asset markets and a deterioration of terms of trade that improves the foreign output and boosts the foreign asset markets. Demand shocks act in the opposite way. This model also analyses the impact of change in the relative price of <b>nontradable</b> to tradable goods on the terms of trade and asset markets. A higher productivity growth in tradable goods than in <b>nontradable</b> goods leads to a higher relative price of <b>nontradable</b> to tradable goods, which appreciates the real exchange rate, deteriorates the terms of trade, and depresses the domestic and foreign asset markets.

In particular, episodes begin with a lending boom and a real appreciation, peak in a self-fulfilling crisis during which a real depreciation coincides with widespread bankruptcies, and end in a recession and credit crunch.

40|$|In {{all modern}} {{industrial}} countries, redistributive expenditures are a larger {{component of the}} government budget than consumption of goods and services. In this paper, we use a general equilibrium, two- country model with exportables, importables and <b>nontradables</b> to study redistribution across different types of agents in a world characterized {{by the presence of}} labor unions and distortionary taxation. We show that an increase in transfers to, say, retirees, financed by distortionary taxation, can generate a loss of competitiveness (defined as an increase in relative unit labor costs for tradable goods), an appreciation of the relative price of <b>nontradables,</b> and a decrease in employment in all sectors of the domestic economy. The same qualitative effects would also obtain {{in the case of an}} increase in transfers towards the unemployed even if financed by non-distortionary taxation. Moreover, all these effects of labor taxation depend in a nonlinear way on the degree of centralization of the wage setting process in the labor market.
