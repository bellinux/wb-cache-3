40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} the {{changes of the}} nutrition labeling of packaged food in China {{two years after the}} promulgation of the Regulation for Food Nutrition Labeling, which encourages food manufacturers to identify nutrition labeling. Methods: Investigators copied out the nutrition information panel, <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> and nutrient function claim of packaged food in a supermarket with prepared questionnaire and finished normative judgment in 2008 and 2010. Results: 4693 and 5526 kinds of packaged food were investigated separately. Nutrition information panel, <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> and nutrient function claim were found on the food label of 27. 6 %, 13. 0 % and 1. 9 % of packaged food respectively in 2008, while 35. 1 %, 7. 7 % and 2. 3 % in 2010. The nutrition information panel which labeled energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate and sodium was 597 (43. 8 %) and 1661 (85. 9 %) in 2008 and 2010, only 134 (9. 8 %) and 985 (51. 0 %) nutrition information panel were totally normalized. <b>Nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> and nutrient function claim focused on vitamin, mineral and dietary fiber.

40|$|Health and <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> {{are getting}} bigger {{attention}} in various {{countries around the}} world, since food producers have discovered their importance at achieving higher profits. Claims are source of information, which a consumer wants to get without additional research when facing packaging.

One hundred consumers evaluated the intention to purchase of images of juice bottles, which were designed by manipulating the following variables: bottle design, front-of-pack nutritional information, <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> and processing claim. They were randomly divided into two experimental conditions: control and time-constraint. Consumers with a time-constraint gave significantly higher intention to purchase scores than those in control condition, but time-constraint did not largely modify the way in which consumers evaluated their intention to purchase. In both experimental conditions consumers gave higher intention to purchase scores for bottles with traditional design, which included processing claim and front-of-pack nutritional information.

40|$|Objectives. Whether {{the role}} of <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> {{regulations}} are efficient is an important public health issue. We analyzed {{the extent to which}} nutrition claims reach at-risk consumers. Methods. We used purchase data on breakfast foods in France. We first derived product substitutions from a demand system. Second, we simulated scenarios based on several combinations of prices and nutritional quality of light dairy products. The simulations aimed to assess the impact on nutrient content. Results. Nutrition claims reach at-risk people, but their consumption is limited by prices and household income constraints. Under assumptions of price and quality modifications, we show that claim regulations that are not too stringent seem to favor a healthy diet more than very demanding claim constraints. This induces a large quality gap between standard and claimed products. Conclusions. A smaller increase in the nutritional quality of the food can be more efficient for public health than a large improvement. A quality improvement should be achieved at a price level at which such products are affordable to a large share of the population...|$|E

40|$|Health claims may {{contribute}} to better informed and healthier food choices and to improved industrial competitiveness by marketing foods that support healthier lifestyles in line with consumer preferences. With the more stringent European Union regulation of nutrition and health claims, insights into consumers' health-related goal patterns and their reactions towards such claims are needed to influence the content of lawful claims. This study investigated how consumers' explicit and implicit health-related motive orientations (HRMOs) together {{with the type of}} calcium-claim (<b>nutrition</b> <b>claim,</b> health claim and reduction of disease risk claim) influence perceived credibility and purchasing intention of calcium-enriched fruit juice. Data were collected in April 2006 through a consumer survey with 341 Belgian adults. The findings indicate that stronger implicit HRMOs (i. e., indirect benefits of calcium for personal health) are associated with higher perceived credibility, which is not (yet) translated into a higher purchasing intention. Consumers' explicit HRMOs, which refer to direct benefits or physiological functions of calcium in the body-as legally permitted in current calcium-claims in the EU-do not associate with reactions to the claims. Independently of consumers' HRMOs, the claim type significantly affects the perceived credibility and purchasing intention of the product.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nutrition</b> {{and health}} <b>claims</b> are {{permitted}} in foods marketed in the European Union under Regulation 1924 / 2006. Quality {{products such as}} traditional foods might benefit from this act, as it can highlight their nutritional richness. In this study the nutritional content of 33 traditional foods from the Black Sea Area Countries was evaluated against the thresholds of the Regulation for <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims.</b> RESULTS: Most of the foods were eligible to bear several <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims,</b> mostly related to their fat, sugar, fiber and sodium content. The average number of claims per traditional food was two, with a range between zero and nine. Overall, about 72 <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> were potentially relevant for the 33 traditional foods studied. Foods linked with the most claims were nuts and seeds. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of traditional foods under this standardized European scheme could be {{an efficient way to}} highlight their possible beneficial nutritional properties.

In New Zealand, new regulations are being implemented to restrict <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>claims</b> to products that meet certain 'healthy' criteria. This {{study investigated the}} difference in nutritional quality, labelling and promotion between 'healthy' and 'less healthy' breakfast cereals, and between breakfast cereals intended for children compared with other breakfast cereals on the New Zealand market. The cross-sectional data collection involved taking pictures of the nutrition information panel (NIP) and front-of pack (FoP) for all breakfast cereals (n[*]=[*] 247) at two major supermarkets in Auckland in 2013. A nutrient profiling tool was used to classify products into 'healthy'/'less healthy'. In total 26 % of cereals {{did not meet the}} 'healthy' criteria. 'Less healthy' cereals were significantly higher in energy density, sugar and sodium content and lower in protein and fibre content compared with 'healthy' cereals. Significantly more <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> (75 %) and health claims (89 %) featured on 'healthy' compared with 'less healthy' cereals. On the 'less healthy' cereals, <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> (65 %) were more predominant than health claims (17 %). Of the 52 products displaying promotional characters, 48 % were for 'cereals for kids', and of those, 72 % featured on 'less healthy' cereals. In conclusion, most breakfast cereals met the 'healthy' criteria; however, 'cereals for kids' were 'less healthy' and displayed more promotional characters than other cereal categories. Policy recommendations include: food composition targets set or endorsed by government, strengthening and enforcing current regulations on health and <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims,</b> considering the application of nutrient profiling for <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> in addition to health claims, introducing an interpretative FoP labelling system and restricting the use of promotional characters on 'less healthy' breakfast cereals...|$|R

A survey of health and nutrition claims on food packaging using a newly defined taxonomy of claims and internationally agreed definitions of claim types. A national UK food retailer: Tesco. Three hundred and eighty-two products randomly sampled from those available through the retailer's website. Of the products, 32 % (95 % CI 28, 37 %) carried either a health or nutrition claim; 15 % (95 % CI 11, 18 %) of products carried at least one health claim and 29 % (95 % CI 25, 34 %) carried at least one <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim.</b> When adjusted for product category, products carrying health claims tended to be lower in total fat and saturated fat than those that did not, but {{there was no significant difference}} in sugar or sodium levels.

40|$|When judging {{nutritional}} {{aspects of}} foods, perceivers tend to overgeneralize from one “healthy” <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> (e. g., “no cholesterol”) by assuming that foods feature other healthy attributes as well (e. g., low in fat). This finding {{has been discussed}} in terms of the classic halo effect in person perception, whereby impressions from strongly valenced attributes (e. g., social warmth) evoke similarly valenced evaluations of the target person on other attributes (e. g., sociability). Despite their popularity and health associations, scant research has explored whether claims like “organic” and “fair trade”—known as values-based claims—can similarly bias judgment. This dissertation explores this possibility. Specifically, despite being silent on nutrient content, values-based claims and other ethics-related production qualities (e. g., favorable worker treatment) are expected to promote unwarranted health inferences (e. g., reduced calorie estimates), especially when these qualities are personally relevant (i. e., strongly congruent or incongruent with perceivers’ personal values). Five experimental studies find support for this prediction. Describing cookies as “organic” decreases calorie judgments and thereby increases consumption recommendations, an effect that is larger among the pro-environmental (Studies 1 and 2). Extending to the social ethics domain, describing chocolate as “fairtrade” decreases calorie judgments; moreover, socially unethical production increases calorie judgments, among perceivers reporting high ethical food values (Studies 3 and 4). Exploring effects on downstream choice outcomes, exercise is deemed less important after a person chooses “organic” over conventional dessert, an effect that correlates positively with pro-environmentalism (Study 5). Overall, larger bias was observed among perceivers with strongly congruent (or incongruent) personal values, or those who likely felt especially positively (or negatively) toward the focal qualities, consistent with the logic of halo effects. Amid the ongoing obesity crisis, these findings reveal ethical health halos that lead perceivers to see nutritionally poor but ethically produced foods as healthy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{drafted a}} {{proposal}} of Regulation concerning {{the use of}} nutrition and health claims in the labelling, presentation and advertising of food products. In turn, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) through the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA Panel) has issued a scientific Opinion concerning possible nutrition claims relating to omega- 3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fat, unsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat. This is an initial response from the EFSA to a question concerning nutrition claims. The reactions in Spain regarding the nutrition claims for omega- 3 fatty acids proposed by the European Commission has been varied, mainly from entities in the food and drink industry and from associations in the sector. The Spanish Food Safety Agency (AESA) has been informed of these reactions, and {{this has led to}} the need for an Opinion from the EFSA Scientific Panel regarding various aspects of the content of the claims. These aspects refer to the minimum quantities of omega- 3 fatty acids, the way in which this content is expressed and the number of arguments favouring reference in claims to long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids separately and not merely to all omega- 3 fatty acids in general.

40|$|A {{healthy and}} {{balanced}} diet can reduce health problems, such as overweight and metabolic syndrome. In general, {{people have a}} considerably good knowledge {{of what constitutes a}} healthy diet and how they could achieve it with their food choices. Besides, people argue that health is among their top five food choice motives. Nevertheless, the prevalence of overweight is increasing and other food choice motives, such as taste, seem to conflict with the health. Liking for food does not necessarily determine acceptance alone, thus several non-sensory factors, such as brand, country of origin and <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim,</b> can also influence. Moreover, consumers are individuals in how they prioritize sensory and nonsensory factors of foods, but e. g. increasing age, female gender and health concern have been connected to a more health-oriented dietary behaviour. To sum up, identifying different factors that can increase the liking and consumption of healthy food is essential in order to develop more attractive healthful food products. Adding vitamins, minerals, fibre or other ingredients to a food product can be used to enrich the nutritional quality of the products. However, this may be difficult in practice as regards the sensory quality and pleasantness of the foods. Generally, consumers are not willing to compromise on taste in food. On the other hand, consumers are very heterogeneous in their likings, and their personal values and attitudes may interact with preferences for specific sensory characteristics. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of intrinsic product characteristics on sensory properties and hedonic responses; to determine the impact of few non-sensory factors; and to examine the interaction between sensory and non-sensory factors with consumers’ demographics, values and attitudes in liking of healthy model foods. The results showed that product composition influenced sensory quality and had an effect on hedonic responses. Adding flaxseed to bakery products showed a significant improvement in the nutritional quality without negative effects on sensory properties. On the other hand, the fortification of wellness beverages with vitamins and minerals may impart off-flavours. In general, sweetness of yoghurts, freshness of wellness beverages and low intensity of rye bread flavour appealed to consumers. Information about the domestic origin of yoghurts and claiming a specific function for wellness beverages enhanced liking. However, consumers who were more concerned about their health and considered natural content as an important food choice motive, rated sourer and less sweet yoghurts and wellness beverages as more pleasant. In addition, interest in health increased the consumption of rye breads and other whole grain breads among adolescents. The results showed that the optimal product quality in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors differs between individual consumers, and personal values and food choice motives can be connected to preferences for specific sensory characteristics of foods. This indicates that each food product needs to be considered in relation to its specific market niche, and to which segment of consumer will respond most positively to its characteristics...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE(S) Heat {{processes}} {{applied to}} foods {{are based on}} a tradeoff between microbiological safety or stability, and quality (organoleptic characteristics, nutritional value…) of the processed food. The objective of this work was to propose an approach to optimize of the canning process of green beans in accounting for both non stability due to survival and growth of the thermophilic spore-forming bacteria Geobacillus stearothermophilus (the microbiological risk) and the vitamin C concentration (the nutritional benefit), an important nutrient in fruits and vegetables, and often used as a marker of process impact on the nutritional value of foods. METHOD(S) A model predicting simultaneously the risk of microbiological non-stability at 55 °C (a requirement in the canning industry) of canned green beans due to G. stearothermophilus, and vitamin C degradation along green bean canning process and storage was built and validated with independent sets of data, such as % of no stability observed in industry or measurement of vitamin C concentrations (Rigaux, 2013). In particular, a vitamin C degradation time at 85 °C and at 80 kJ. mol- 1 DHA activation energy named F 1 and the microbiological thermal death time at 121 °C and at reference value zT = 10 °C (F 0) were introduced in the model to allow a simultaneous prediction of vitamin C degradation and bacteria inactivation for any given time and temperature during the sterilization process. Parameters of the model were fixed, variable, uncertain, or both uncertain and variable. Uncertainty and variability on parameters were separately propagated through the model within the two-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation framework. RESULTS A mean risk of non-stability due to G. stearothermophilus of 0. 5 % of green bean cans (corresponding to usual industrial observations) was estimated with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [0. 1 %, 1. 2 %], as the % of cans containing more than 12 mg vitamin C/ 100 g (i. e. exceeding the <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> limit) was estimated at 3. 2 % in mean with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [0. 1 %, 13. 2 %]. As the mean initial concentration was 17. 0 mg vitamin C/ 100 g with a 95 % variability interval of [4. 0, 30. 6], the model reports a significant degradation of vitamin C. Moreover the model predicts a relative independence between vitamin C concentration and G. stearothermophilus concentrations in canned green beans after sterilization. This offers the possibility of optimizing process parameters influencing one output without affecting the other. Then the model was used to test the consequences of some alternative process scenarios maintaining an acceptable level of microbiological non-stability, while increasing the vitamin C concentration. For instance reducing blanching time, increasing F 0, reducing waiting time before blanching and slightly acidifying the covering brine predicted simultaneously a % of non-stability decreased to 0. 1 % in mean with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [0. 0 %, 0. 7 %] and more than 30 % cans containing concentrations in vitamin C greater than 12 mg/ 100 g (33. 5 % in mean with a 95 % uncertainty interval of [7. 8 %, 52. 5 %]. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY Finding a tradeoff between risk and benefit, between food safety and quality, is a common issue in food industry. The modeling framework proposed in the present work, which considers variability and uncertainty of the modeled phenomena, is increasingly familiar to scientists developing Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment in food. We showed this framework is also adapted to model the evolution of nutrients in foods: parameters of chemical reactions, initial concentrations in nutrients for instance are also uncertain and/or variable. We could therefore consider that food microbiology predictive and probabilistic approaches are useful tools for the design of safe food processing and improvement of food quality looking at the joint distribution of the two criteria...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aim: Studies show {{frequent}} use of <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and health claims in consumers&#x 2019; choice of food products. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how consumers&#x 2019; thoughts about these claims and food products are affected by various types of food-related experiences. Material and Methods: The data collection comprised 30 individual interviews among Swedish consumers aged 25 to 64 years. Results: The results indicated that participants who expressed special concern for their own and their families&#x 2019; health were eager to find out the meaning of concepts and statements made. A lack of understanding and lack of credibility of concepts and expressions often caused suspicion of the product. However, in some cases this was counterbalanced by confidence in manufacturers, retailers, and/or the Swedish food legislation. Discussion and Conclusion: To achieve effective written communication of food products&#x 2019; health-conducive properties on food labels, there is a need to consider the importance many consumers attach to understanding the meaning of concepts and expressions used and the importance of credibility in certain expressions. Consumers&#x 2019; varying cognitive approaches are suggested as a basis for pre-tests of <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and health claims...|$|R
40|$|Much {{attention}} {{is now being}} paid to health and <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> for foods. There are already many food {{products on the market}} with claims appealing to consumers about health effects beyond provision of basic nutrients. One important basis for claims is the increasingly documented effect of dietary components on body functions. There are three main reasons for assessing the scientific substantiation of claims: to support consumer confidence in foods with claims, to satisfy regulatory requirements, and to promote fair market competition...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects on prices of <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>claims</b> for foodstuffs, in {{addition}} to other attributes, using fruit beverages as a case study. The model estimation is based on revealed purchasing behaviour for fruit beverages in the north-east of Italy. Applying an hedonic price model, the price of a product is explained as a function of product attributes. The model estimate identifies the implicit retail-market-level price of specific attributes such as <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>claims,</b> ceteris paribus. <b>Nutrition</b> and health <b>claims</b> significantly affect retail prices. Our findings suggest that retail price response to <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>claims</b> differs in relation to other product attributes, showing a strong reduction of price variation among flavours when such benefits are claimed on the label...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> {{may help}} people to adopt {{healthier}} eating habits, but {{little is known}} about the potential cognitive effects of such claims on appetite sensations. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and individual factors on perceived appetite sensations. According to a three (“healthy” versus “diet” (i. e., satiating) versus “hedonic”) by two (restrained or not restrained) by two (normal-weight or overweight/obese) by two (men versus women) factorial design, 164 males and 188 females aged 18 – 65 were invited to taste an oatmeal-raisin snack in a blinded and ad libitum context. Visual analog scales (150 [*]mm) were used to evaluate appetite sensations before and over 1 [*]h after consumption period. BMI and Restraint Scale were used to categorize participants according to their weight and restraint status. No main condition effect was observed for any of the four appetite sensations. However, subgroups analysis revealed significant differences among specific subgroups. A main effect of sex was also observed for all appetite sensations with men reporting higher levels of desire to eat, hunger and prospective food consumption, and lower levels of fullness than women. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual characteristics in interaction when studying appetite sensations...|$|R
50|$|The Food and Nutrition Board {{subsequently}} {{revised the}} RDAs every {{five to ten}} years. In 1973, the FDA introduced regulations to specify the format of nutrition labels when present, although the inclusion of such labels was largely voluntary, only being required if <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> were made or if nutritional supplements {{were added to the}} food. The nutrition labels were to include percent U.S. RDA based on the 1968 RDAs in effect at the time. The RDAs continued to be updated (in 1974, 1980 and 1989) but the values specified for nutrition labelling remained unchanged.|$|R
40|$|Use of <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> {{and health}} claims in {{labelling}} of food products is frequent, not least on food products categorised as functional foods. Studies show {{frequent use of}} such information in consumers’ choice of food products, even if many consumers find it confusing and want it reinforced by other trusted sources of information. Studies also show consumers to have a low understanding of concepts used and statements made. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how, when consumers are presented with <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and health claims on packaged food products, their thinking about such texts on food products is affected by various types of food-related experiences. An empirical study comprised a group of thirty Swedish consumers aged 25 to 64. The open and explorative form of data collection comprised individual semi-structured interviews, where the points of departure were <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and health claims found on the package of a margarine and a loaf of bread, both sold in Sweden. The analysis aimed at categorising how food-related experiences are involved in consumers' thinking about such statements. Participants who expressed special concern for their own and their families’ health situation, at present and in the long term, were found to be eager to find out the meaning of concepts and statements made, and many of them searched for more information on the packages. A lack of understanding and the credibility of concepts and expressions often caused suspiciousness of the product, which however in some cases was counterbalanced by confidence in manufacturers, retailers and/or the Swedish food legislation. Participants who expressed concern for their traditional eating habits tended to put up with their lack of understanding of concepts and statements on the packages, and rather expressed concern for palatability. To achieve fruitful written communication of food products' health-conducive properties on packaged food labels, there is a need to consider the importance many consumers attach to understand the meaning of concepts and expressions used, and the importance of credibility in certain expressions. For fruitful communication, there is also a need to meet consumers in relation to their varying food-related experiences. KLIV-projektet vid Lunds universite...|$|R
