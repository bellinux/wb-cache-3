5|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> over as {{paramount}} chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied {{and fell}} into ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E
5|$|Rain and fog {{were heavy}} {{throughout}} {{the morning of}} July 6, and visibility was limited for the emplaced troops. Just after daybreak, 13 North Korean T-34 tanks were spotted stopped at the bridge. Following them were two columns of infantry. The American forces originally believed {{that they might be}} survivors of Task Force Smith until they realized the forces were deploying in numbers too great, and began preparing to attack the unsuspecting North Koreans. The battalion's commander ordered mortar fire on the North Korean forces, causing them to disperse as the lead tank began firing on the positions of A Company, on a hill southwest of the road. Mortar fire destroyed a truck, but a round from a North Korean tank stunned the artillery observer and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> his place in the confusion, ending the American mortar attack. North Korean forces immediately began advancing on A Company's position, but the company was not able to return fire effectively, with fewer than half of its soldiers using their weapons. For several minutes only squad and platoon leaders shot back {{while the rest of the}} soldiers hid in their foxholes. Within fifteen minutes, B Company was able to return fire effectively, and by this time the North Korean forces had advanced steadily toward 1st Battalion's position. Later examinations found many American soldiers' weapons were assembled incorrectly or were dirty or broken. The Americans had nothing with which to fight the tanks, and were unable to do anything to stop them.|$|E
25|$|The Deoxidized Metal Co. of Bridgeport in 1885 {{secured a}} {{contract}} for the bronze balusters required for the wew Treasury building in Washington, D.C. These balusters were an elaborate design incorporating leaves, beads and moulding, all intended to have a bright finish, which required {{a great deal of}} hand work. Deoxidized could make, but not burnish, the balusters and sought to subcontract this work, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> them up on their offer. At that time there was no machinery for polishing metals, the usual procedure was to immerse in acid, and hand work was too costly. The contract from Washington definitely stated that acid was not to be used.|$|E

25|$|The {{outstanding}} South African {{players were}} the three best batsmen: Melville, Bruce Mitchell and Dudley Nourse. Ken Viljoen {{had a good}} tour and made six centuries but none in the Tests. The bowling was moderate as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> more than 15 wickets in the series or averaged under forty. Athol Rowan with 102 was the only tourist to take a century of wickets in the season. The team badly lacked pace bowlers and included only two medium-fast seamers, Jack Plimsoll and Lindsay Tuckett, the majority of bowlers being spinners: Rowan, Tufty Mann, Ian Smith and Leslie Payn. South Africa had three wicketkeepers in the party: Johnny Lindsay, Douglas Ovenstone and George Fullerton. Ossie Dawson was an all-rounder and the remaining batsmen were Denis Begbie, Dennis Dyer and Tony Harris. South Africa used fourteen players in the Test series: the ones who missed out were Begbie, Ovenstone and Payn.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's {{mother had a}} new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked her because she was physically attractive.|$|E

When he was traded, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> his place as supervisor. Ruth's new {{teammates}} considered him brash, and would have preferred him, as a rookie, to remain quiet and inconspicuous. When Ruth insisted on taking batting practice despite his being both a rookie who did not play regularly, and a pitcher, he arrived to find his bats sawn in half. His teammates nicknamed him [...] "the Big Baboon", a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname [...] "Niggerlips" [...] at St. Mary's, detested. Ruth had received a raise on promotion to the major leagues, and quickly acquired tastes for fine food, liquor, and women, among other temptations.|$|E

She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras.

We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
500|$|Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana {{strove to}} make Homicide more {{realistic}} than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved it because we felt {{that it would be a}} disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> responsibility." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The best {{evidence}} of Campau's speed and base-running intelligence {{may lie in}} a 1906 historical account by sportswriter Revere Rodgers. In an article on remarkable incidents in baseball history, Rodgers wrote that Campau once scored a home run on an infield pop-up. According to Rodgers, Campau hit a high pop fly about [...] in front of home plate. The pitcher and catcher converged on the ball, but in what was described by Rodgers as [...] "an Alphonse and Gaston act", <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> control.

2500|$|Commensurate {{with the}} LGBT rights {{movement}} in other arenas, LGBTQ activists began visibly advocating for greater representation in libraries in 1969. In 1970, the Task Force on Gay Liberation formed within the American Library Association. Now known as the GLBT Round Table, this organization is the oldest LGBTQ professional organization in the United States. Barbara Gittings became its coordinator in 1971.

2500|$|In 1923, Mussolini sent Italian {{forces to}} invade Corfu during the Corfu incident. In the end, the League of Nations proved powerless, and Greece {{was forced to}} comply with Italian demands. Writing of Mussolini's foreign policy, the American {{historian}} Gerhard Weinberg said: If the new regime Benito Mussolini installed in 1922 on {{the ruins of the}} old glorified war as a sign of vitality and repudiated pacifism as a form of decay, the lesson drawn from the terrible battles against Austria on the Isonzo river—in which the Italians fought far better than popular imagination often allows—was that the tremendous material and technical preparations needed for modern war were simply beyond the contemporary capacity of the country. This was almost certainly a correct perception, but, given the ideology of Fascism with its emphasis on the moral benefits of war, it did not lead to the conclusion that an Italy without a big stick had best speak very, very softly. On the contrary, the new regime drew the opposite conclusion. Noisy eloquence and rabid journalism might be substituted for serious preparations for war, a procedure that was harmless enough if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>took</b> any of it seriously, but a certain road to disaster once some outside and Mussolini inside the country came to believe that the [...] "eight million bayonets" [...] of the Duce's imagination actually existed.|$|E
2500|$|Some Anglo-Catholic parishes {{used the}} English Missal, {{a version of}} the BCP which {{included}} the prayers of the Latin Mass both in translation and in the original interspersed with prayers from the prayer book; most used either the BCP or the 1928 Prayer Book, which though it was never approved has continued in print until the present with the warning [...] "The publication of this book does not directly or indirectly imply that it can be regarded as authorized for use in churches." [...] As time passed and liturgical scholarship proceeded, it became clear that a new attempt should be made to provide orders of service for the church. In an attempt to break the deadlock, Dom Gregory Dix, in his book The Shape of the Liturgy published in 1945, proposed that his own thinking about the Eucharist, using what he called the [...] "Four Action Shape", be the basis of a rite. He suggested that such a rite be produced by a number of bishops, too many for them to be victimised but not so many so as to suggest rebellion, who would allow such a rite to be used in their own dioceses but who would not protect parish clergy from legal challenge if they used it.
