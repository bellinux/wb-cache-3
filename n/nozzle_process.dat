In this study, paste rheology of two different dispensing pastes was transferred to CFD-simulation (CFD: Computational Fluid Dynamics) to investigate different nozzle geometries and print head designs.

A prototype probe was built and placed in the shock tunnel to sample only a small section of the nozzle flow and thus make localised absorption measurements. Rudidium atoms were seeded into the flow and a diode laser operating at 780 nm scanned across the Rb absorption line repetitively at 20 kHz. Tests were performed with air and nitrogen test gases.

The steam from the first ring of moving blades enters the second ring of nozzles where its pressure is further reduced and velocity increased again.

The high altitudes at which the hypersonic vehicle must operate give rise to the concept of an airframe integrated propulsion system to provide a much larger inlet and <b>nozzle</b> to <b>process</b> the required volume of air at low density, atmospheric conditions.

40|$|Abstract – Spray drying is {{used for}} the {{manufacture}} of many consumer and industrial products such as instant dairy and food products, laundry detergents, pharmaceuticals, ceramics and agrochemi-cals. During spray drying, agglomerates of powder particles are formed, which determine the instant properties of the powder. Agglomeration during spray drying {{is considered to be a}} difficult process to control. The main cause of this is the complex interaction of the process variables: the atomization process, the mixing of spray and hot air, the drying of suspension droplets and the collision of par-ticles which might lead to coalescence or agglomeration. As a consequence, agglomeration during spray drying is operated by trial-and-error. In an EC-sponsored project, named the EDECAD pro-ject and co-ordinated by NIZO food research, an industrially validated computer model, using Com-putational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology, to predict agglomeration processes in spray drying machines is developed. An Euler-Lagrange approach with appropriate elementary models for dry-ing, collision, coalescence and agglomeration of the dispersed phase is used.

The drawing parameters - nozzle temperature, mass flow and drawing speed - are varied in a wide range. The following properties are investigated : fiber density, thermal expansion-contraction-behaviour and optical birefringence. All these properties show characteristic deviations from the bulk glass values depending strongly on the drawing parameters. The fiber structure is mainly determined by the extreme high cooling rate and by the drawing stress acting on the gob during the fiber drawing process. The cooling rate up to 105 K/s in the glass transition range causes an isotropic effect on the glass network with an open structure corresponding to high fictive temperatures. The drawing stress leads to an anisotropic frozen-in network structure in the case of silicate glass fibers; the metaphosphate glass fibers show additionally an orientation of chains indicated by the optical birefringence, which is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that of the silicate glass fibers. On the other hand, the thermal expansion and density behaviour show nearly the same dependence on the drawing parameters for both glass fiber types...|$|R
