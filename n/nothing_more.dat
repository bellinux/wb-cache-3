5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
5|$|Bessas reappears in the {{campaign}} of 554, when he was appointed joint commander in Lazica with Martin, Bouzes and Justin. Gubazes, though, soon protested to Justinian about the incompetence of the Byzantine generals. Bessas was dismissed, his property was confiscated, and he was sent in exile among the Abasgians. <b>Nothing</b> <b>more</b> is known about him thereafter.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>more</b> {{is known}} of Michael Bourtzes after that, {{and it may be}} that he died {{sometime}} around the autumn of 995. He did, however, have at least three sons, Michael, Theognostos, and Samuel, known because they conspired against Constantine VIII after he blinded Michael's son, named Constantine, in 1025/26.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of April 5, 1779, Charles Messier {{recorded}} Pallas on a star chart he used to track {{the path of a}} comet (now known as C/1779 A1 (Bode)) that he observed in the spring of 1779, but apparently assumed it was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a star.|$|E

5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were {{probably}} <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than unproven slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 20 December, Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> to be feared, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of Caesar and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house. The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E

Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a pawn for the Titans' revenge.|$|E
5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are {{already beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring.

5|$|Enterprising programmers {{were able}} to produce games for the ZX81 using <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than text {{characters}} and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark {{in the history of}} computer and video games.|$|E

5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> perfect, is its independence from any other thing. <b>Nothing</b> <b>more</b> perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
5|$|Fame {{does not}} last, however. Nestor {{is not as}} ambitious as his brother and desires <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than to own his own small club.

Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true feelings, that a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a small respite not capitalized {{as much as it}} could have been.|$|E
