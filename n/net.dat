5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets <b>net</b> of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a <b>net</b> buyer or <b>net</b> seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a <b>net</b> lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a <b>net</b> borrower (or debtor).|$|E

After an unaudited €43,411,481 <b>net</b> loss was recorded {{in the first nine}} months of 2010–11 season, the board of directors announced that a capital increase of €120million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholder's meeting in October. Eventually, the 2010–11 season <b>net</b> loss was €95,414,019. In the 2012–13 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons' <b>net</b> losses thanks to the biggest payment in UEFA's Champions League 2012–13 revenue distribution, earning €65.3million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lion's share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team making the competition's final phase, Milan. Confirming the trend of marked improvement in <b>net</b> result, the 2013–14 financial year closed with a loss of €6.7 million, but with the first positive operating income since 2006. In the 2014–15 season, by the excellent sports results achieved (the fourth year in a row of Serie A titles, the tenth Coppa Italia title and playing the Champions League final), <b>net</b> income reached €2.3million.

The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

40|$|<b>Netted</b> radar employs several {{spatially}} distributed transmitters and receivers {{for information}} retrieval. This system topology offers many advantages over traditional monostatic and bistatic systems which use a single transmitter {{and a single}} receiver. For example, it provides better utilization of reflected energy, more flexible system arrangement and enhanced information retrieval capability. Therefore, the <b>netted</b> radar system is of emerging interests among radar researchers. This work investigates several fundamental aspects that determine <b>netted</b> radar performance. This includes <b>netted</b> radar sensitivity, the <b>netted</b> radar ambiguity function and the <b>netted</b> radar ground plane effect. Mathematical models are developed to provide a mean to examine different aspects of <b>netted</b> radar performance. Software simulations examine <b>netted</b> radar performance over a range of parameter variations. Simulation results show that <b>netted</b> radar can offer better performance over traditional monnostatic and bistatic radar in many cases. Some elementary field trials have been conducted using a prototype <b>netted</b> radar system developed within the UCL radar group to examine aspects of <b>netted</b> radar performance in practice. The field trials are focused on <b>netted</b> radar range and sensitivity which are fundamental. The field trial {{results show that the}} theoretical benefits that <b>netted</b> radar can offer are generally realizable in practice. ...|$|R
