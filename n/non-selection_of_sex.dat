30|$|At {{least three}} {{methods have been}} used in the {{literature}} for scoring WAF tests. The first method, which was initially adopted by *Read (1993), scores learners’ responses based on their associate selection only. In other words, neither <b>non-selection</b> <b>of</b> any distractor would be awarded a point nor the selection of one would be penalized. The second method awards a point for selection of an associate as well as <b>non-selection</b> <b>of</b> a distractor. The third method and perhaps also the strictest of the three, awards a point for a response only if it precisely matches the answer (i.e., selection of all associates but not any distractor).|$|R

Only later did it become generally known that the selectors had been pressurised into omitting D'Oliveira {{because he was a}} 'coloured' South African and his inclusion in a team to visit the country, then under apartheid, was thought to be undiplomatic.|$|R

500|$|A young Keith Miller {{also played}} for the South Melbourne Cricket Club and gained his first wicket in {{district}} cricket from a catch by Nash. Miller later declared that the <b>non-selection</b> <b>of</b> Nash as a regular Test player was [...] "the greatest waste of talent in Australian cricket history", adding that Australian captain Don Bradman wanted Nash in the side to tour England in 1938 but that Nash [...] "suffered injustices {{at the hands of}} high-level cricket administration", who refused to consider his selection.|$|R

This score difference {{did not appear to}} be a surprise, given that semantically unrelated distractors were much easier to eliminate than related ones, and that the scoring method valued successful elimination or <b>non-selection</b> <b>of</b> distractors.|$|R

Hayes, in particular, was considered a surprise, with St Kilda team mate and All-Australian wingman Leigh Montagna saying [...] "I was very surprised Lenny wasn't in the team... I pencilled him in for a captain or vice-captain. It's a big shock".

[...] Nash continued to terrorise batsmen in district cricket, including the rare occurrence of taking all 10 wickets in an innings (for 35 runs) for South Melbourne against Prahran in 1937–38, but was not selected for Victoria throughout the season.

2500|$|The {{official}} Australian team {{toured the}} Caribbean under Bobby Simpson in March 1978. The West Indies cricket officials had {{no wish to}} buy into the ACB-Packer fight and decided to select all of their WSC players for the first two Tests, until [...] the WICB made a decision to leave out three of their WSC contracted players for the 3rd Test, ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the West Indies' tour to India and Sri Lanka later in the year, which would be at a time that World Series Cricket could not guarantee the availability of their West Indian players. The <b>non-selection</b> <b>of</b> these three players led to the resignation of Clive Lloyd as captain, and all of the WSC contracted West Indian players to declare themselves unavailable {{for the rest of the}} series.|$|R

There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100m and 200m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt {{that she had been}} overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change.

50|$|During the 1995 {{season at}} the {{commencement}} of the Super League war, Toovey again played State of Origin for NSW, though the team suffered a 3-0 loss to Queensland who were coached by his former Manly team mate Paul Vautin. With the <b>non-selection</b> <b>of</b> Super League players, Toovey was recalled to the Australian team {{for the first time}} since 1991 in the 3-0 Trans-Tasman series win over New Zealand in 1995. At the end of the season in which Manly finished as minor premiers but beaten Grand Finalists, he was selected in the Australian squad for the 1995 Rugby League World Cup, playing in the Kangaroos 16-8 win over host nation England in the World Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. Although selected at halfback for the game, coach Bob Fulton only played Toovey in the position during scrums and utilised his speed off the mark by playing him at dummy-half in general play with Andrew Johns (named at hooker) assuming the halfback role.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The current {{evolution}} of Ubiquitous Computing and of Service-Oriented Computing {{is leading to}} the development of context-aware services. Context-aware services are services whose description is enriched with context information related to the service execution environment, adaptation capabilities, etc. This information is often used for discovery and adaptation purposes. However, context information is naturally dynamic and incomplete, which represents an important issue when comparing service description and user requirements. Actually, uncertainty of context information may lead to inexact matching between provided and required service capabilities, and consequently to the <b>non-selection</b> <b>of</b> services. In order to handle incomplete context information, we propose in this paper a graph-based algorithm for matching contextual service descriptions using similarity measures, allowing inexact matches. Service description and requirements are compared using two kinds of similarity measures: local measures, which compare individually required and provided properties (represented as graph nodes), and global measures, which take into account the context description as a whole, by comparing two graphs corresponding to two context descriptions. ...|$|R
