Wonder Woman was under the control of a black ring (from being one of numerous resurrected superheroes), but she and the violet ring's power are enough to break the black ring's hold, turning Wonder Woman into a Star Sapphire.|$|E

25|$|He {{received}} the most prestigious sacred Vīrasringhala or Veerashringhala (It's a kind of Golden Bracelet, given to the greatest artist/scholar of that era) from Taliparamba Rajarajeshwara Temple (1923). He is the youngest one to receive this award, which is being given to the scholars of the supreme rank, only by the unanimous approval of a special body of temple consisting of eminent scholars.

25|$|A {{few years}} after Miró’s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he {{finished}} a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents’ summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses and described it by saying, “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that {{you feel when you}} are away and cannot go there. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> been able to paint these two very opposing things.” Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Miró’s first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.|$|E

500|$|Pearl's catchphrase [...] "Daddy!" [...] was {{developed}} early during {{production of the}} first season, but was not used in an episode until later on. A script that the main voice actors were reading from during a rehearsal had the line fully capitalized, with the first syllable extended ("daaaaddy!"), so Alan knew to put particular emphasis on the line when {{it was in a}} script. Rodger Bumpass, the voice of Squidward Tentacles, describes Alan's portrayal of Pearl as a [...] "unique and wonderful take on how this teenager should be... <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> a teenager that sounds like Pearl." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Strange Bird, unlike its brief chart history, was overwhelmingly positive. The enthusiastic response even caught the band by surprise; Williams told Rip It Up [...] "I {{could see a}} few holes in the album and I'd say, 'how come <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> picked this up?'" [...] Reviewers, however, focused on the positives; Guy Garvey of The Independent said [...] "My favourite {{of the year is}} Augie March's Strange Bird", while David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone of [...] "luxuriant melees of chiming guitars, mountain-stream voices and keyboard grandeur". Donovan said the band found it hard to take the positive reviews too seriously; [...] "if we did our heads would explode or overinflate", he told Beat.|$|E
500|$|A U.S. {{intelligence}} {{official said the}} danger of using informants was inherent but unavoidable. Intelligence agencies {{have to rely on}} unsavory individuals to penetrate terrorist groups because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> the access. Those hazards would be neither denied nor ignored by the CIA officers. Former {{intelligence official}}s said they were deeply troubled about al-Balawi's ability to get close to so many CIA officers. A former agency case officer expressed surprise that [...] "a potential hostile" [...] was able to be in immediate proximity to a large number of CIA operatives. [...] "Why the officers would show a source all their faces, that alone was a terrible decision," [...] said one former senior CIA paramilitary operative who served in Afghanistan. Larry C. Johnson, a former CIA officer and counter-terrorism agent, said that a source supposedly as significant as al-Balawi should never have been brought inside the base, because it risked exposing him.|$|E

500|$|Rain in England {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} referenced for its uniqueness and its demonstration of Lil B's {{broad range of}} styles. Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year. The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B's unpredictability; similarly, SF Weekly called it [...] "a different beast entirely" [...] {{from the rest of}} his work. In Seattle Weekly, Eric Grandy called Rain in England an [...] "oddity" [...] and said Lil B's music is better served by randomly listening to him on YouTube then in a long-form album format. In a 2012 profile of Lil B's career so far, The Wires Lisa Blanning said the album [...] "feels like a new musical expression." [...] Lil B himself described Rain in England as [...] "my favorite work ... I think that's my most powerful work, to myself. ... That's my favorite, because I know <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> done that, and that's what I'm most proud of, when I do things that I know nobody else has done before." ...|$|E
500|$|On an {{exclusive}} interview with Access Hollywood, Cyrus spoke in regards to the music video for the song, directed by Marc Webb. She said, [...] "I wanted something crazy that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> done and like really random because this song is kinda random." [...] Shot on November 16, 2007 in a suburban area of Los Angeles, California, the video included fifty background dancers, such as a middle school teacher. Cyrus said the concept was, [...] "I'm singing and dancing and like rocking out and I have no idea where these people come from." [...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray. Another concept she further explained was the appearance of a man in a [...] "prom-setting." [...] Cyrus said, [...] "Here it's gonna be the guy that I'm supposed to 'start all over' and we're at prom, so I'm just [...] not like in a dress or anything. So, it's random. It's like everything is happening all at once." [...] The ending of the music video, she explained, was when she went back to [...] "where [...] belongs" [...] after a day of [...] "torture." ...|$|E
500|$|The critics {{gave the}} work a {{generally}} kinder reception in London, where The Times called Puccini [...] "a master {{in the art}} of poignant expression", and praised the [...] "wonderful skill and sustained power" [...] of the music. In The Musical Times, Puccini's score was admired for its sincerity and [...] "strength of utterance." [...] After the 1903 Paris opening, the composer Paul Dukas thought the work lacked cohesion and style, while Gabriel Fauré was offended by [...] "disconcerting vulgarities". In the 1950s, the young musicologist Joseph Kerman described Tosca as a [...] "shabby little shocker."; in response the conductor Thomas Beecham remarked that anything Kerman says about Puccini [...] "can safely be ignored". Writing half a century after the premiere, the veteran critic Ernest Newman, while acknowledging the [...] "enormously difficult business of boiling [...] play down for operatic purposes", thought that the subtleties of Sardou's original plot are handled [...] "very lamely", so that [...] "much of what happens, and why, is unintelligible to the spectator". Overall, however, Newman delivered a more positive judgement: [...] " [...] operas are to some extent a mere bundle of tricks, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> performed the same tricks nearly as well". Opera scholar Julian Budden remarks on Puccini's [...] "inept handling of the political element", but still hails the work as [...] "a triumph of pure theatre". Music critic Charles Osborne ascribes Toscas immense popularity with audiences to the taut effectiveness of its melodramatic plot, the opportunities given to its three leading characters to shine vocally and dramatically, and the presence of two great arias in [...] "Vissi d'arte" [...] and [...] "E lucevan le stelle". The work remains popular today: according to Operabase, it ranks as fifth in the world with 540 performances given in the five seasons 2009/10 to 2013/14.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{tranquil}} setting {{offered by}} Astoria, the sessions were often {{interrupted by the}} escalating row between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had {{the rights to the}} Pink Floyd name. [...] O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued the bassist for £25,000 of back-commission. [...] In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (since 1973, Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to [...] "the new Pink Floyd project". [...] He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. [...] Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. [...] Gilmour's team responded by issuing a non-confrontational press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, the guitarist later told a Sunday Times reporter: [...] "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant." [...] Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin (the producer later suggested that he was being [...] "checked out"). [...] As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. [...] Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A Studios in Los Angeles: [...] "It was fantastic because...the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling {{in the middle of the}} night." [...] The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year. [...] The legal disputes were resolved by the end of 1987.|$|E
