5|$|In January 2007, the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed to positive {{and the film}} holds a rating of 76 on Metacritic (based on 12 reviews) and 76% on Rotten Tomatoes (based on 17 reviews). Common elements praised in the film was Moshé's choice in cast, which Variety lauded as a highlight. However, in their mostly positive review IndieWire remarked {{that the lack of}} major stars and the choice to film a Western (which they saw as a [...] "mostly defunct genre") could jeopardize commercial prospects. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>News's</b> review was more mixed, as they felt that the [...] "verbose period film has the complicated plot and tight pacing of a cable TV drama, which is then squashed into an indie-film paradigm." ...|$|R
