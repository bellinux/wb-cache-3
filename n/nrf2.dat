25|$|<b>Nrf2</b> transcriptionally regulates {{multiple}} genes that play both {{direct and indirect}} roles in producing antioxidative potential {{and the production of}} cellular energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate or ATP) within the mitochondria. Consequently, unlike exogenously administered antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E or Coenzyme Q10), which provide a specific and finite antioxidative potential, omaveloxolone, through <b>Nrf2,</b> broadly activates intracellular and mitochondrial antioxidative pathways, in addition to pathways that may directly increase mitochondrial biogenesis (such as PGC1α) and bioenergetics.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be dose-dependent {{induction}} of <b>Nrf2</b> target genes, along with induction of biomarkers of mitochondrial function in one early clinical trial. Time- and dose-dependent neurological improvements were observed. Further study {{appears to be}} ongoing.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the ester dimethyl fumarate (BG-12, Biogen) significantly reduced relapse and disability progression in a phase 3 trial. It activates the <b>Nrf2</b> antioxidant response pathway, the primary cellular {{defense against the}} cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biotransformation}} {{of arsenic}} for excretion is primarily done through the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (<b>Nrf2)</b> pathway. Under normal conditions the <b>Nrf2</b> {{is bound to}} Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) in its inactive form. With the uptake of arsenic within cells and the subsequent reactions that result {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), the <b>Nrf2</b> unbinds and becomes active. Keap1 has reactive thiol moieties that bind ROS or electrophilic arsenic species such as monomethylted arsenic (III) and induces the release of <b>Nrf2</b> which then travels through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The <b>Nrf2</b> then activates antioxidant responsive element (ARE) as well as electrophilic responsive element (EpRE) both of which contribute in the increase of antioxidant proteins. Of particular note in these antioxidant proteins is heme oxygenase 1 (...) , NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (γGCS) which work in conjunction to reduce the oxidative species such as hydrogen peroxide to decrease the oxidative stress upon the cell. The increase in γGCS causes an increased production of aresnite triglutathionine (As(SG)3) an important adduct that is taken up by either multidrug associated protein 1 or 2 (MRP1 or MRP2) which removes the arsenic out of the cell and into bile for excretion. It should be noted that this adduct can also decompose back into inorganic arsenic.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 {{a team of}} Johns Hopkins University {{scientists}} isolated a cancer-fighting phytochemical in broccoli called glucoraphanin, {{which is}} the glucosinolate precursor of sulforaphane (SGS). [...] When chewed, broccoli releases glucoraphanin and myrosinase, an enzyme found {{in another part of}} the plant cell, which work together to produce sulforaphane, which, in turn, activates a transcription factor, <b>Nrf2</b> in the cell. Once activated, <b>Nrf2</b> then translocates to the nucleus of the cell, where it aligns itself with the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of target genes. The target genes are associated with a process that assists in regulating cellular defences. [...] Such cytoprotective genes include that for glutathione. [...] Around 200 genes have been well-characterised, as many as 1700 are thought to be related to this aspect of cellular defense.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} omaveloxolone and related {{synthetic}} triterpenoid compounds {{have been documented}} in over 200 peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts. [...] The mechanism of action of omaveloxolone and its related compounds has been demonstrated to be {{through a combination of}} activation of the antioxidative transcription factor <b>Nrf2</b> and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB.|$|E
50|$|Under {{quiescent}} conditions, <b>Nrf2</b> {{is anchored}} in the cytoplasm through binding to Keap1, which, in turn, facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of <b>Nrf2.</b> Such sequestration and further degradation of <b>Nrf2</b> in the cytoplasm are mechanisms for the repressive effects of Keap1 on <b>Nrf2.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nrf2</b> {{possesses}} six highly conserved domains called Nrf2-ECH homology (Neh) domains. The Neh1 domain is a CNC-bZIP domain {{that allows}} <b>Nrf2</b> to heterodimerize with small Maf proteins (MAFF, MAFG, MAFK). [...] The Neh2 domain allows for binding of <b>Nrf2</b> to its cytosolic repressor Keap1.The Neh3 domain {{may play a}} role in <b>Nrf2</b> protein stability and may act as a transactivation domain, interacting with component of the transcriptional apparatus.The Neh4 and Neh5 domains also act as transactivation domains, but bind to a different protein called cAMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB), which possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity.The Neh6 domain may contain a degron that is involved in the degradation of <b>Nrf2,</b> even in stressed cells, where the half-life of <b>Nrf2</b> protein is longer than in unstressed conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nrf2</b> {{is kept in}} the {{cytoplasm}} by Kelch like-ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and Cullin 3 which degrade <b>Nrf2</b> by ubiquitination. Cullin 3 ubiquitinates <b>Nrf2,</b> while Keap1 is a substrate adaptor {{protein that}} facilitates the reaction. Once <b>Nrf2</b> is ubiquitinated, it is transported to the proteasome, where it is degraded and its components recycled. Under normal conditions <b>Nrf2</b> has a half-life of only 20 minutes. Oxidative stress or electrophilic stress disrupts critical cysteine residues in Keap1, disrupting the Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination system. When <b>Nrf2</b> is not ubiquitinated, it builds up in the cytoplasm, and translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, it combines (forms a heterodimer) with one of small Maf proteins (MAFF, MAFG, MAFK) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the upstream promoter region of many antioxidative genes, and initiates their transcription.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>Nrf2</b> {{activation}} {{leads to}} a coordinated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory response, and Keap1 represses <b>Nrf2</b> activation, Keap1 has become a very attractive drug target.|$|E
50|$|LifeVantage advertises Protandim as a <b>Nrf2</b> activator. A 2003 {{in vitro}} {{study showed that}} <b>Nrf2</b> and heme oxygenase 1 are induced by low doses of curcumin, (a {{chemical}} constituent of turmeric {{and one of the}} principal ingredients in Protandim) in isolated kidney epithelial cells.|$|E
50|$|Under {{normal or}} {{unstressed}} conditions, <b>Nrf2</b> {{is kept in}} the cytoplasm by a cluster of proteins that degrade it quickly. Under oxidative stress, <b>Nrf2</b> is not degraded, but instead travels to the nucleus where it binds to a DNA promoter and initiates transcription of antioxidative genes and their proteins.|$|E

5000|$|Genetic {{activation}} of <b>NRF2</b> may promote {{the development of}} [...] cancerous tumors {{as well as the}} development of atherosclerosis by raising plasma cholesterol levels and cholesterol content in the liver. It has been suggested that the latter effect may overshadow the potential benefits of antioxidant induction afforded by <b>NRF2</b> activation.|$|E

5000|$|Glutamate-cysteine ligase, {{catalytic}} (Gclc) and glutamate-cysteine ligase, modifier (GCLM) subunits form a heterodimer, {{which is}} the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a very powerful endogenous antioxidant. Both Gclc and Gclm are characteristic <b>Nrf2</b> target genes, which establish <b>Nrf2</b> as a regulator of glutathione, {{one of the most}} important antioxidants in the body.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the Ure2 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is an RNA element {{present in}} the 5' UTR of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor <b>Nrf2.</b> It contains a stem-loop structure upstream of a ribosome binding site. This stem loop inhibits ribosome binding and translation of <b>Nrf2</b> under normal conditions, but allows translation under oxidative stress conditions.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} {{synthetic}} oleane triterpenoid compounds, known as antioxidant inflammation modulators (AIMs), {{are being developed}} by Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and are potent inducers of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, blocking Keap1-dependent <b>Nrf2</b> ubiquitination and leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of <b>Nrf2</b> and subsequent induction of <b>Nrf2</b> target genes.) The lead compound in this series, bardoxolone methyl (also known as CDDO-Me or RTA 402), was in late-stage clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and showed an ability to improve markers of renal function in these patients.) However, the Phase 3 trial was halted due to safety concerns.|$|E
50|$|External (via chemicals) and {{internal}} (stress response or caloric restriction) induction of NQO1 is mediated solely through the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE. Keap1 {{acts as the}} sensor which loses its ability to target <b>Nrf2</b> for degradation upon exposure to the inducers. <b>Nrf2</b> is consequently stabilized and accumulated in the nucleus upon which it binds to the AREs and initiates expression of cytoprotective genes including NQO1.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, sMafs {{also appear}} to {{contribute}} to cancer malignancy. Certain cancers contain somatic mutations in NRF2(NFE2L2) or KEAP1 that cause constitutive activation of <b>Nrf2</b> and promote cell proliferation. It has also been reported that the Bach1-MafG heterodimer contributes to cancer malignancy by repressing tumor suppressor genes. Thus, as partners of <b>Nrf2</b> and Bach1, sMafs are expected to play critical roles in cancer cells.|$|E

50|$|The Nrf2-sMaf heterodimers are {{critical}} for oxidative and electrophilic stress response. <b>Nrf2</b> {{is known as a}} master regulator of antioxidant and xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme genes. Induction of these cytoprotective genes is impaired in <b>Nrf2</b> knockout mice. While MafG, MafK and MafF triple knockout mice die in embryonic stage, cultured cells derived from the triple knockout embryo fail to induce Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective genes in response to stimuli.|$|E
