In {{order to be}} meaningful, SSM construction requires a dense correspondence matching between {{a significant number of}} objects, which remains a very challenging task. <b>Nonrigid</b> <b>registration</b> is an essential element in the SSM construction pipeline that allows establishing correspondences between shapes and capturing their local variations. We introduce the Regional Affine Registration (RAR) that is based on object segmentation where each region is affinely registered to its counterpart. The point-based RAR process can be used to initiate a farther <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registration</b> process. Experiments are performed using fiducial metrics to compare three registration approaches: RAR, segmentation-based, and classical approach. As an application, we integrate RAR in the construction of an SSM of the human scapula. The three approaches are used to match correspondences between 85 scapulae and a validation of the SSM is carried out by evaluating its compactness, generalization and specificity. Multilevel B-Spline <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registration</b> parameter optimization is also investigated in a feedback sense using an initial version of the model.

40|$|Purpose: To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of atlas-based segmentation without compromising accuracy, and {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the proposed method on MRI-based prostate segmentation application. Methods: Accurate and efficient automatic structure segmentation is an important task in medical image processing. Atlas-based methods, as the state-of-the-art, provide good segmentation at the cost {{of a large number of}} computationally intensive <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registrations,</b> for anatomical sites/structures that are subject to deformation. In this study, the authors propose to utilize a combination of global, regional, and local metrics to improve the accuracy yet significantly reduce the number of required <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registrations.</b> The authors first perform an affine registration to minimize the global mean squared error (gMSE) to coarsely align each atlas image to the target. Subsequently, atarget-specific regional MSE (rMSE), demonstrated to be a good surrogate for dice similarity coefficient (DSC), is used to select a relevant subset from the training atlas. Only within this subset are <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registrations</b> performed between the training images and the target image, to minimize a weighted combination of gMSE and rMSE. Finally, structure labels are propagated from the selected training samples to the target via the estimated deformation fields, and label fusion is performed based on a weighted combination of rMSE and local MSE (lMSE) discrepancy, with proper total-variation-based spatial regularization. Results: The proposed method was applied to a public database of 30 prostate MR images with expert-segmented structures. The authors' method, utilizing only eight <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registrations,</b> achieved a performance with a median/mean DSC of over 0. 87 / 0. 86, outperforming the state-of-the-art full-fledged atlas-based segmentation approach of which the median/mean DSC was 0. 84 / 0. 82 when applying to their data set. Conclusions: The proposed method requires a fixed number of <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registrations,</b> independent of atlas size, providing desirable scalability especially important for a large or growing atlas. When applied to prostate segmentation, the method achieved better performance to the state-of-the-art atlas-based approaches, with significant improvement in computation efficiency. The proposed rationale of utilizing jointly global, regional, and local metrics, based on the information characteristic and surrogate behavior for registration and fusion subtasks, can be extended naturally to similarity metrics beyond MSE, such as correlation or mutual information types. © 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R

Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes {{as a result of the}} contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity.

40|$|<b>Nonrigid</b> <b>registration</b> is a {{technique}} commonly used {{in the field of}} medical imaging. A drawback of most current <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registration</b> algorithms is that they model all tissue as being nonrigid. When a <b>nonrigid</b> <b>registration</b> is performed, the rigid objects in the image, such as bony structures or surgical instruments, may also transform nonrigidly.

In this paper we propose a novel regularisation term, which is added to the cost function in order to penalise nonrigid deformations of rigid objects. This regularisation term can be used for any representation of the deformation field capable of modelling locally rigid deformations. By using a B-spline representation of the deformation field, a fast algorithm can be devised.

The prostate was manually segmented in both images and corresponding surface meshes were generated. Next, a tetrahedral volume mesh was generated from the MR image. Prostate deformations due to the TRUS probe were simulated using the surface displacements as the boundary condition. A three-dimensional thin-plate spline deformation field was calculated by registering the mesh vertices.

This thesis focuses on variational registration, which comprises a subset of <b>nonrigid</b> image <b>registration.</b> It is divided into chapters that are based on fundamental aspects of the variational registration problem: image dissimilarity measures, changing overlap regions, regularizers, and computational solution strategies. Key contributions include the development of local versions of standard dissimilarity measures, the handling of changing overlap regions {{in a manner that is}} insensitive to the amount of non-interesting background information, the combination of two standard taxonomies of regularizers, and the generalization of solution techniques based on Fourier methods and the Demons algorithm for use with many regularizers. To illustrate and validate the various contributions, two sets of example imagery are used: 3 D CT, MR, and PET images of the brain as well as 3 D CT images of lung cancer patients.

40|$|Non-rigid image {{registration}} (NIR) {{is an essential}} tool for morphologic comparisons {{in the presence of}} intra- and inter-individual anatomic variations. Many NIR methods have been developed, but are especially difficult to evaluate since point-wise inter-image correspondence is usually unknown, i. e., there is no "Gold Standard" to evaluate performance. The Non-rigid Image Registration Evaluation Project (NIREP) has been started to develop, establish, maintain, and endorse a standardized set of relevant benchmarks and metrics for performance evaluation of <b>nonrigid</b> image <b>registration</b> algorithms, This paper describes the basic framework of the project. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Voxel-based <b>nonrigid</b> image <b>registration</b> can be formulated as an optimisation problem whose goal is to minimise a cost function, consisting of a first term that characterises the similarity between both images and a second term that regularises the transformation and/or penalties improbable or impossible deformations. Within this paper, we extend previous works on <b>nonrigid</b> image <b>registration</b> {{by the introduction of}} a new penalty term that expresses the local rigidity of the deformation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the transformation to be locally rigid at a particular location is that its Jacobian matrix J(T) at this location is orthogonal, satisfying the orthogonality condition J(T) J(T) (T) = 1. So we define the penalty term as the weighted integral of the Frobenius norm of J(T) J(T) (T) - 1 integrated over the overlap of the images to be registered. We fit the implementation of the penalty term in a multidimensional, continuous and differentiable B-spline deformation framework and analytically determine the derivative of the similarity criterion and the penalty term with respect to the deformation parameters. We show results {{of the impact of the}} proposed rigidity constraint on artificial and clinical images demonstrating local shape preservation with the proposed constraint. status: publishe...|$|R
