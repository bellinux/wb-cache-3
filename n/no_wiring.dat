There were {{significant}} engine changes, including a bore and stroke change and the carburetor size reduced from 38 mm to 36 mm, resulting in an 8 lb weight savings and no more jetting problems. [...] For 2006, the US version of the 300 EXC {{was replaced by the}} XC and the XC-W. Both versions had 5-speed gearboxes and a stator for producing electricity. The 300 XC had a close-ratio gear box, <b>no</b> <b>wiring</b> for lights, and a stiffer suspension. The 300 XC-W had a wide-ratio gear box, head light, tail light and maintained the softer PDS suspension. The 2007 model had added a dual ignition mapping switch on the handlebar.|$|E

A remote wireless monitoring system is proposed for the city water supply pipe network based on Zigbee and GPRS. The Zigbee nodes are mainly used to detect and gather information and data of city water supply pipe network. The GPRS is used to upload information to monitoring center and download orders to coordinators. <b>No</b> <b>wiring</b> necessary, which makes the system very convenient...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, {{we present}} some new {{crosstalk}} avoid-ance coding schemes devoted to on-chip busses. These schemes consist in encoding sequences of bits on each {{line of a}} bus transferring a packet in order to eliminate worst-case crosstalk patterns. They permit to improve the delay on the link {{at the cost of}} doubling the number of transmitted bits. The advantage of the presented solutions is that they have <b>no</b> <b>wiring</b> overhead, so they are independent from the bus bit-width. The coding schemes allow an increase of 50 % of the data rate for a 1 -mm bus. Moreover, the proposed solutions induce a direction in deep-submicron noise {{that can be used to}} implement a noise-tolerant system. I...|$|E
40|$|Solar Wireless Networked Control Systems (SWNCS) are a {{style of}} {{distributed}} control systems where sensors, actuators, and controllers are interconnected via a wireless communication network. This system setup has the benefit of low cost, flexibility, low weight, <b>no</b> <b>wiring</b> and simplicity of system diagnoses and maintenance. However, it also unavoidably calls some wireless network time delays and packet dropout into the design procedure. Solar lighting system offers a clean environment, therefore able to continue for a long period. SWNCS also offers multi Service infrastructure solution for both developed and undeveloped countries. The system provides wireless controller lighting, wireless communications network (WI-FI/WIMAX), CCTV surveillance, and wireless sensor for weather measurement which are all powered by solar energy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{positioning}} technique {{that is based on}} transmissions from independent ultrasound beacons. These unsynchronised beacons emit narrow-band ultrasonic pulses and do not use any other medium, such as radio frequency or infra-red. A passive mobile positioning unit locates itself using the signatures of the received ultrasound signals. This unit measures shifts in the periodicities of the signals, a form of the Doppler effect, in order to estimate its location and velocity. We have initially tested the system using a simulator; the results suggest that the device is able to position itself with a 95 % accuracy of 20 cm, and a 50 % accuracy of 6 cm. Our previous experience is that these figures will degrade with the use of real hardware, but we aim for a 95 % accuracy of better than 40 cm. The advantages of our system are three-fold: the infrastructure contains <b>no</b> <b>wiring</b> and, as such, can be easily retro-fitted with minimal aesthetic impact; it scales to any number of mobile positioning units; and the beacons are low-power, cheap and simple to construct...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{efficient}} energy utilization {{becomes an}} essential requirement for data centers, especially in data centers of world-leading companies, where "Green Data Center" defines a new term for an environment-concerned data center. Solutions to change existing a data center {{to the green}} one may vary. In the big company, high-cost approaches including re-planning server rooms, changing air-conditioners, buying low-powered servers, and equipping sophisticating environmental control equipments are possible, but not for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and academic sectors which have limited budget. In this paper, we propose a novel system, SENVM, used to monitor and control air temperature in a server room to be in appropriate condition, not too cold, where very unnecessary cooling leads to unnecessary extra electricity expenses, and also inefficient in energy utilization. With implementing on an emerging technology, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Green Data Center is feasible to every small data center with <b>no</b> <b>wiring</b> installation, easy deployment, and low maintenance fee. In addition, the prototype of the system has been tested, and {{the first phase of}} the project is deployed in a real-world data center. Comment: 6 page...|$|E
