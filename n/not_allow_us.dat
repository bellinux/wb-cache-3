40|$|This paper {{presents}} a critical discussion {{of our present}} knowledge of intergalactic matter and radiation {{as it relates to}} cosmology. While there have been some observational successes and much theoretical speculation, studies of intergalactic matter and radiation have still <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>us</b> to draw certain conclusions about the origin and evolution of the universe...|$|R
30|$|Equations (1) and (2) <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to model, in {{a pretty}} much ad hoc way, {{transitions}} between informal and formal jobs. Sadly, the short time frame that each individual is observed, does <b>not</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to use a proper transition model. Finally, another element {{to keep in mind}} is that, since we are working with a non-behavioral model, we do not control for the role that Social Security might have on the choice between having a formal or informal job.|$|R
25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E
25|$|Quantum physics does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> {{to access}} all this {{information}} directly, though. A measurement will yield only one of all possible values, destroying all others. If not for the no cloning theorem, we could first measure f(x) without measuring x, and then make a few copies of the resulting state (which is a superposition of states all having the same f(x)). Measuring x on these states would provide different x values which give the same f(x), leading to the period. Because we cannot make exact copies of a quantum state, this method does not work. Therefore, we have to carefully transform the superposition to another state that will return the correct answer with high probability. This is achieved by the quantum Fourier transform.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

As matter of fact, the bulk of participants contribute only a few moves before leaving the system. Attackers with such a behavior are impossible to detect as their profile is too similar to normal users. Indeed, the only two such reported attackers were detected thanks to the acquaintance network inferred from logs.|$|R

25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

500|$|Aware of the {{violence}} {{going on in the}} Somali countryside, Ambassador Bishop felt [...] "the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances." [...] On August 1, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command—the military command for the Middle East and Northeast Africa—where he worked with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E) plan until he was [...] "satisfied...that [...] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that." [...] A few hours after his visit, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The US was mobilizing assets for a response when Ambassador Bishop arrived in Mogadishu on September 6. The primary interest of the Ambassador was to maintain the US military's permission and access to airfields and ports in Mogadishu and Berbera, which the US had negotiated in 1979. This was especially important given the mobilization for intervention in Kuwait, Somalia's strategic location near the Arabian Peninsula and the mouth of the Red Sea, and because Saudi Arabia would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>US</b> troops on their soil. The embassy was also home to a large number of USAID staff, although the spread of unrest into the countryside was making their work increasingly difficult.|$|E

The lawyer for the victims relatives, Nasser Zarafshan, was arrested for [...] "publicizing the case", for which her bail was set at the equivalent of $50,000 as opposed to $12,500 {{for some of the}} accused murderers. At least one of the victims' relatives, Sima Sahebi, the wife of Pouyandeh, was also arrested [...] "for publishing a letter criticizing them for <b>not</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> to hold a memorial of the second anniversary of their death." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2006, European {{parliamentary}} members protested to the Azerbaijani government {{when they}} were barred from inspecting the cemetery.

[...] Doctor Charles Tannock, a conservative member of the European Parliament for Greater London, and others echoed those sentiments and compared the destruction to the Buddha statues destroyed by the Taliban in Bamyan, Afghanistan in 2001.

In spite of numerous articles concerning copper-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition reactions, the major factors of such a reaction are quite difficult to elucidate. Although our experiments have <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>us</b> to define strict rules, they have highlighted some factors not to be neglected when considering the approach of the copper reagent to the double bond, such as (E) /(Z) isomerization and steric aspects, which could change the reactive conformation of the substrate.

40|$|Information {{exchange}} {{can be seen}} as {{a dynamic}} process of raising and resolving issues. The goal of this paper is to provide a logical framework to model and reason about this process.

At a static level, IDEL does <b>not</b> only <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to model the information available to a set of agents, like standard epistemic logic, but also the issues that the agents entertain. At a dynamic level, IDEL does <b>not</b> only <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to model the effects of communicative actions that provide new information, like standard DEL, but also the effects of actions that raise new issues. Thus, IDEL provides the fundamental tools needed to analyze information exchange as a dynamic process of raising and resolving issues...|$|R
