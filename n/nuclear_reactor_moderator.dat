40|$|In recent years, {{methods for}} the {{calculation}} of the thermal scattering law (i. e. S(α,β), where α and β are dimensionless momentum and energy transfer variables, respectively) were developed based on ab initio lattice dynamics (AILD) and/or classical molecular dynamics (CMD). While these methods are now mature and efficient, further advancement {{in the application of}} such atomistic techniques is possible using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. In this case, temperature effects are inherently included in the calculation, e. g. phonon density of states (DOS), while using ab initio force fields that eliminate the need for parameterized semi-empirical force fields. In this work, AIMD simulations were performed to predict the phonon spectra as a function of temperature for beryllium and graphite, which are representative <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> <b>moderator</b> and reflector materials. Subsequently, the calculated phonon spectra were utilized to predict S(α,β) using the LEAPR module of the NJOY code. The AIMD models of beryllium and graphite were 5 × 5 × 5 crystal unit cells (250 atoms and 500 atoms respectively). Electronic structure calculations for the prediction of Hellman-Feynman forces were performed using density functional theory with a GGA exchange correlation functional and corresponding core electron pseudopotentials. AIMD simulations of 1000 – 10, 000 time-steps were performed with the canonical ensemble (NVT thermostat) for several temperatures between 300 K and 900 K. The phonon DOS were calculated as the power spectrum of the AIMD predicted velocity autocorrelation functions. The resulting AIMD phonon DOS and corresponding inelastic thermal neutron scattering cross sections at 300 K, where anharmonic effects are expected to be small, were found to be in reasonable agreement with the results generated using traditional AILD. This illustrated the validity of the AIMD approach. However, since the impact of the temperature on the phonon DOS (e. g. broadening of spectral peaks) was observed in AIMD analysis, this technique may be envisioned as the approach for deriving the needed atomistic data for thermal scattering law calculations under realistic temperature and structural conditions for a given material...|$|E
50|$|Nuclear power {{relies on}} {{fissionable}} material that can sustain {{a chain reaction}} with neutrons. Examples of such materials include Uranium and Plutonium. Most <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> use a <b>moderator</b> to lower the kinetic energy of the neutrons and increase the probability that fission will occur. This allows reactors to use material with far lower concentration of fissile isotopes than are needed for nuclear weapons. Graphite and heavy water are the most effective moderators, because they slow the neutrons through collisions without absorbing them. Reactors using heavy water or graphite as the moderator can operate using natural uranium.|$|R
5000|$|While many {{fissionable}} isotopes {{exist in}} nature, the only usefully fissile isotope {{found in any}} quantity is 235U. About 0.7% of the uranium in most ores is the 235 isotope, and about 99.3% is the non-fissile 238 isotope. For most uses as a nuclear fuel, uranium must be enriched - purified so that it contains {{a higher percentage of}} 235U. Because 238U absorbs fast neutrons, the critical mass needed to sustain a chain reaction increases as the 238U content increases, reaching infinity at 94% 238U (6% 235U).Concentrations lower than 6% 235U cannot go fast critical, though they are usable in a <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> with a neutron moderator.A nuclear weapon primary stage using uranium uses HEU enriched to ~90% 235U, though the secondary stage often uses lower enrichments. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> with water <b>moderator</b> require at least some enrichment of 235U. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> with heavy water moderation can operate with natural uranium, eliminating altogether the need for enrichment and preventing the fuel from being useful for nuclear weapons; the CANDU power reactors used in Canadian power plants are an example of this type.|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{water is}} used in certain types of <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> where it acts as a neutron {{moderator}} to slow down neutrons {{so that they are}} more likely to react with the fissile uranium-235 than with uranium-238, which captures neutrons without fissioning.The CANDU reactor uses this design. Light water also acts as a moderator, but because light water absorbs more neutrons than heavy water, reactors using light water for a <b>reactor</b> <b>moderator</b> must use enriched uranium rather than natural uranium, otherwise criticality is impossible. A significant fraction of outdated power reactors, such as the RBMK reactors in the USSR, were constructed using normal water for cooling but graphite as a moderator. However, the danger of graphite in power reactors (graphite fires in part led to the Chernobyl disaster) has led to the discontinuation of graphite in standard reactor designs.|$|R

40|$|The main {{target of}} the master´s thesis is {{reviewing}} the generation III <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> in term of the nuclear safety.

Regulatory bodies, whose task is to supervise nuclear safety in the nuclear power plants, belongs to the legislative approaches. There are defined terms such as defence in depth, redundancy, diversity, etc. There are mentioned methods to assessing nuclear safety – deterministic and probabilistic methods, especially probabilistic methods, for which a simple example is provided. There are also mentioned active and passive safety systems and their significance for nuclear safety and inherent safety too. There {{is an example of the}} function of the active and passive safety systems of the EDU nuclear power plant in conclusion of this issue.

40|$|Traditional safety {{performance}} requirements for <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> {{have been developed}} for critical reactors, whose kinetics characteristics differ significantly from sub-critical, accelerator-driven <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors.</b> In a critical <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> relatively small amounts of reactivity (negative or positive) can produce large changes in the fission rate.
