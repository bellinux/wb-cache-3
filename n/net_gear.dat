40|$|Background: Minimizing fishery bycatch threats {{might involve}} {{trade-offs}} between maintaining viable populations and economic benefits. Understanding these trade-offs can help managers reconcile conflicting goals. An {{example is a}} set of bycatch reduction measures for the Critically Endangered vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus), in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. The vaquita is an endemic species threatened with extinction by artisanal net bycatch within its limited range; in this area fisheries are the chief source of economic productivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyze trade-offs between conservation of the vaquita and fisheries, using an end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model for the Northern Gulf of California. Atlantis is a spatially-explicit model intended as a strategic tool to test alternative management strategies. We simulated increasingly restrictive fisheries regulations contained in the vaquita conservation plan: implementing progressively larger spatial management areas that exclude gillnets, shrimp driftnets and introduce a fishing gear that has no vaquita bycatch. We found that only the most extensive spatial management scenarios recovered the vaquita population above the threshold necessary to downlist the species from Critically Endangered. The scenario that excludes existing <b>net</b> <b>gear</b> from the 2008 area of vaquita distribution led to moderate decrease in net present value (US $ 42 million) relative to the best-performing scenario and a two-fold increase in the abundance of adult vaquita over the course of 30 years...|$|E
40|$|In the Gulf of Maine, the {{entanglement}} of humpback {{whales in}} fishing gear {{is a substantial}} source of human-caused mortality. The current mortality and serious injury of humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine is twice the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level set for this population. Researchers and managers are challenged to reduce entanglement to below PBR without extensive information on many important factors. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe entanglement injuries and investigate whether different fishing gear types, particularly pot and net fisheries, resulted in distinctive entanglement patterns of humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine. I searched the Center for Coastal Studies' entanglement database for whales that fit the following criteria: the entanglement occurred between 1995 and 2002, the whale was photographed during the disentanglement, and the gear type or line type of the entangling gear was known. Sixteen cases were identified that fit the criteria. Three cases involved entanglements in pot fishery gear, four in <b>net</b> <b>gear,</b> and nine cases with known line type. I qualitatively analyzed photographs from these sixteen cases to describe the injuries and to investigate whether any entanglement patterns could be determined based on gear type in terms of location of entanglement on whale, presence of trailing gear, presence of buoys or high flyers, free swimming versus anchored in gear, disentanglement success, or type of injury. I was unable to find a relationship between entangling gear type and any of the factors assessed.

40|$|Fishing {{continues}} to be the main source of income in the Pearl Lagoon Basin in Nicaragua. Currently the fishermen in the area have expressed growing concern about the shrimps stocks. Over the past years it has become increasingly clear that the fish and shrimp stocks are being exhausted, severely over-fished and experiencing a serious decline. This thesis examines the catch compositions (shrimps and by-catch) of three mesh sizes of the Cast <b>net</b> <b>gear</b> employed in the fishery through sampling during the months of July and August, as well as analyzes the current situation of the shrimp inside the lagoon through primary (interviews) and secondary (books, journals, articles, reports, etc.) data. The data samples of the experiment with the different mesh sizes identified in the thesis were analyzed using standard software applying a trouser trawl method to determine the selectivity curve. Single factor ANOVA tests were use to distinguish significant differences between lengths. Significant differences were also tested combining the three different mesh sizes applying the SPSS turkey multi comparison computer program model. The findings were discussed and compared with a previous selectivity study accomplished in the lagoon. The thesis concludes that gears with ½ inch mesh size were vulnerable to the species during these months by retaining low weight and smaller length shrimp compositions (70 % of the capture is between 5 and 8 cm total length). 1 inch and 1 ½ inch mesh sizes showed a general improvement in the selective performance of the gear (approximately 90 % of the captured shrimps were between 11 and 14 cm). The main secondary findings show that local people are employing small gear mesh sizes in the lagoon, especially those whose sustainability livelihoods are significantly threatened with very few opportunities of survival; most obvious those who live in the more remote areas...|$|E
40|$|Resently, {{investigation}} {{has been made}} into the relationship between underwater noises and fish catches and into the fishing method using sounds. As {{one of the fundamental}} problems on these subjects, it is necessary to clarify the acoustical features of the noises in the spaces where fishes are distributed, for example, the frequency distribution and the sound pressure of the underwater noises which are made by fishing boats and gear. Therefore the author has measured by the aid of the underwater tape-recorder the underwater noises in course of the fishing operation with the one-boat type trawl net, the bull trawl net, and the purse seine. The analytical results of the measurement are as follows: 1) The underwater noises measured in fishing with the three types of fishing gear were different from one another. The noise from the one-boat type trawl net was pulsating, whereas that from the bull trawl net was almost continuous. The noise from the purse seine was also continuous being similar to that from the bull trawl net, though its frequency band was narrower than that for both types of trawl nets. 2) The frequency distribution of the noise was DC to 5000 Hz in the case of both trawl nets, and DC to 3000 Hz {{in the case of the}} purse seine. The most predominant frequencies in these ranges were 500 Hz to 800 Hz in the case of the one-boat type trawl net, and 400 Hz to 600 Hz, somewhat lower though not so remarkable, in the case of the bull trawl net. In the case of the purse seine, on the other hand, any especially predominant frequency was not seen, but its peculiar noise of 5400 Hz to 6000 Hz caused by the friction of the purse ring against the purse wire was perceived in bracing the sinker side. 3) The acoustic comparison of the noises in fishing among the three type of <b>netting</b> <b>gear</b> showed that the engine noise was inaudible in the case of the one-boat type trawl net because of other noise, but was clearly perceived in the cases of the bull trawl net and the purse seine. 4) concerning the fish catch with the one-boat type trawl net in the East China Sea, the weight compositions of several useful species such as the drums (sciaenid fishes) were investigated. From the mean weight the resonance frequency of the air bladder was calculated and was revealed to almost correspond with the predominant frequency of the underwater noises given forth by the <b>netting</b> <b>gear.</b> In consequence, it is well considered that these underwater noise have significant influences on the perception and behavior of fish. トロール網,以西底曳網および旋網の操業中の水中騒音を録音分析し以下に示す結果を得た. 1) 測定を行なった両底曳網の水中騒音はトロール網の場合はパルス状であるのに対し以西底曳網はほとんど連続音であった. 旋網の場合は漁法上浮網形態で主に表層近くで用いられ網の海底との摩擦が少ないためエンジンノイズ,プロペラノイズが主でパターンとしては以西底曳網に似た連続音が主であった. 2) 周波数分布は両底曳網ではDC～ 5000 Hz,またはそれ以上広帯域におよんでおり,旋網の場合はDC～ 3000 Hzと両底曳網より狭い帯域範囲であった. また最も優勢な周波数はトロール網では 500 Hz～ 800 Hz(最大 37 dB),以西底曳網はトロール網ほど顕著ではないが 400 Hz～ 600 Hz(最大 30 dB),旋網に関しては優勢な周波数は認められなかった. しかし旋網特異の騒音として環と締括綱との網裾をしぼる時に摩擦音が 5400 Hz～ 6000 Hzの周波数帯域において確認された. 3) 録音の再生時における聴覚による比較では,トロール網の場合,自船のエンジンノイズは他の騒音が大きく認められなかった. これに反し以西底曳網の方はハイドロホンまでの自船からの水平距離がトロール網のそれの約 2 倍にもかかわらず明らかにエンジンノイズを認める事ができた. 旋網の騒音は集魚中,投揚網中共にエンジンノイズとプロペラノイズがほとんど全ての騒音であった. 4) 東支那海におけるトロール網の漁獲物中よりグチ,ニベ等有用魚種数種類の体重組成を測定し,その平均体重より「うきぶくろ」の共振周波数を算出した結果,網漁具の発する水中騒音の優勢な周波数とがほぼ一致した. この事から操業中の水中騒音が魚に対する知覚行動反応に有意的な影響を与えている事は充分考えられる...|$|R
