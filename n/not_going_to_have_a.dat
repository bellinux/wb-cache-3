2500|$|The tenth {{and final}} AFL {{franchise}} {{was awarded to}} former Cleveland Browns owner and coach Paul Brown in Cincinnati. Brown had been seeking a {{way back into the}} NFL after being forced out of the Browns organization by Modell. Brown had not been a supporter of the AFL prior to the merger announcement, but quickly realized the AFL was probably his only viable path back into NFL after the older league awarded its sixteenth franchise to New Orleans. Also, Cincinnati was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 50,000 seat stadium ready until 1970. Brown paid $10 million for his franchise (400 times the 1960 franchise fee of $25,000), famously stating [...] "I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL." ...|$|E
2500|$|World War II {{brought about}} a swift end to the big band era as musicians went off {{to serve in the}} {{military}} and travel restrictions made touring difficult. When the war ended, the focus of popular music shifted towards crooners such as Frank Sinatra and Jo Stafford, so Ellington's wordless vocal feature [...] "Transblucency" [...] (1946) with Kay Davis was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> similar reach. With inflation setting in after 1945, the cost of hiring big bands went up and club owners preferred smaller jazz groups who played in new styles such as bebop. Dancing in clubs also subjected club owners to a new wartime tax which continued for many years after, which made small bands more cost-effective for club owners.|$|E
2500|$|... : On 13 April, {{the embassy}} in Madrid {{stated that the}} U.S. sees the {{question}} of Catalan independence as an internal issue of Spain. On 26 September, President Donald Trump, during his meeting with Mariano Rajoy, said that [...] "Spain is a great country and it should remain united", but expressed his doubts on whether a referendum will be held, stating that [...] "I think that nobody knows if they are gonna have a vote. The President would say they are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> vote. But I {{think that the people}} would be very much opposed to that." [...] Earlier that month, the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert insisted in that the referendum is an internal affair of Spain and that the US [...] "will work with whatever government or entity that comes out of it".|$|E

2500|$|After {{one version}} of the Charter drawn in June 1980 that lasted until September, which said in its {{preamble}} that Canadians [...] "shall always be, {{with the help of}} God, a free and self-governing people," [...] the Charter was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> preamble. [...] The current preamble only first appeared in the April 1981 draft, which came relatively late in the process. [...] It was included despite {{the fact that there was}} no call for the Charter to have a preamble by the Special Joint Committee which was reviewing the Constitution, and that according to George Egerton, the prime minister of Canada at the time, Pierre Trudeau, called it [...] "strange" [...] that some of his colleagues wanted God referenced in the Charter. [...] (Trudeau told his MPs, [...] "I don't think God gives a damn whether he's in the constitution or not.") [...] There were, however, various religious and Conservative criticisms of the Charter during its drafting, with fears that denominational schools and Canada's abortion law were threatened. [...] At this time as well, religious groups in Canada such as 100 Huntley Street and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada were growing and wanted God acknowledged in the Constitution. [...] Despite the Liberal Party of Canada's protests that a better preamble could be written after patriation was achieved, and thus there was no need for the preamble being proposed at the time by the Conservatives, religious groups increased their activism. [...] Trudeau's Justice Minister, Jean Chrétien, said it was the top issue in all of the letters the government was sent during patriation.|$|E

No, no, Mr. Audley, I'll be open with you. I saw what you were up to when I got your letter, and Fernan--Got his lesson very well, he had. And when I came down, a friend in London gave me another hint. It won't do, I can assure you. That style of thing is all very well for you spruce parsons of good family, as you call it in the old country; but we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rising young fellow like this, with a prospect of what would buy out all your squires and baronets in the old country, beslobbered and befooled {{with a lot of}} Puseyite cant.

60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I go to West Point with Twichell tomorrow, but {{shall be}} back Tuesday or Wednesday; {{and then just}} as soon {{thereafter}} as you and Mrs. Howells and Winny can come you will find us ready and most glad to see you--and the longer you can stay the gladder we shall be. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> thing to do, but you shall work if you want to. On the evening of March 10th, I am going to read to the colored folk in the African Church here (no whites admitted except such as I bring with me), and a choir of colored folk will sing jubilee songs. I count on a good time, and shall hope to have you folks there, and Livy. I read in Twichell's chapel Friday night and had a most rattling high time--but the thing that went best of all was Uncle Remus's Tar Baby. I mean to try that on my dusky audience. They've all heard that tale from childhood--at least the older members have.|$|E

You have your weak point like other people, Master Geoffrey--and it spells Beatrice. Only you must not go too far. I am not jealous, but I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> scandal for fifty Beatrices. I will not allow you to lose your reputation and position. Just imagine {{a man like that}} pining for a village girl--she is nothing more! And they talk about his being so clever. Well, he always liked ladies' society; that is his failing, and now he has burnt his fingers. They all do sooner or later, especially these clever men. The women flatter them, that's it. Of course the girl is trying to get hold of him, and she might do worse, but so surely as my name is Honoria Bingham I will put a spoke in her wheel before she has done. Bah! and they laugh at the power of women when a man like Geoffrey, with all the world to lose, grows love-sick for a pretty face; it is a very pretty face by the way. I do believe that if I were out of the way he would marry her. But I am in the way, and mean to stay there. Well, it is time to dress for dinner. I only hope that old clown of a clergyman won't do something ridiculous. I shall have to apologise for him." ...|$|E

The following week she was angry that Jeff was made team captain instead of Mikyla.|$|E

50|$|The Norwegian FA {{decided to}} rebuild {{parts of the}} stands at Ullevaal, in {{particular}} the stands where Tromsø's supporters were situated. Construction started {{a week and a}} half before the match and as a result Tromsø's supporters are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> roof during the match.

50|$|McDearmon {{went into}} {{bankruptcy}} in 1853 due to failures {{of his business}} dealings in his Clover Hill properties and other investments.

His land and business investments depended upon the railroad routing through the little village of Clover Hill.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this, the Liberal Democrat's {{coalition}} government partner, the Conservatives, {{ruled out the}} introduction of a Mansion Tax; Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in October 2012: [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mansion tax, or a new tax that is a percentage value of people’s properties. Before the election they will call it a mansion tax, but people will wake up the day after the election and discover suddenly their more modest home has been labelled a mansion." ...|$|E

It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.|$|E

5000|$|Approximately 5,000 Civil War Model 1861 rifled muskets were {{converted}} at the Springfield Armory in 1866. It soon {{became apparent that}} many of the small working parts in the breech system were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long service life, and the action was too complicated for normal service use. Therefore, before the Model 1865 production order was completed, a less complex rifle was already being tested.
