50|$|<b>Neurapraxia</b> is most {{commonly}} observed in athletes involved in collision sports, such as American football. Athletes participating in collision sports most often suffer from cervical cord <b>neurapraxia,</b> {{also known as}} transient <b>neurapraxia.</b> Cervical cord <b>neurapraxia</b> {{is the result of}} a severe collision in which a blow to the crown of the athlete’s head forcefully extends or compresses the neck. Numbness, stinging, and/or weakness in the arms, legs or both, distinguish cervical cord <b>neurapraxia.</b> Typical episodes of transient nuerapraxia only last a few seconds and symptoms dissipate entirely. Though the severity of the injury can range, transient <b>neurapraxia</b> does not lead to permanent paralysis of the affected muscles. Subsequent spinal cord injury after an episode of cervical cord <b>neurapraxia</b> has not been observed. However, athletes who experience an episode of transient cervical <b>neurapraxia</b> face an approximately 50% chance of a repeat episode if they continue to participate in collision sports.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurapraxia</b> {{results in}} {{temporary}} {{damage to the}} myelin sheath but leaves the nerve intact and is an impermanent condition; thus, Wallerian degeneration does not occur in <b>neurapraxia.</b> In order for the condition to be considered <b>neurapraxia,</b> according to the Seddon classification system of peripheral nerve injury, {{there must be a}} complete and relatively rapid recovery of motor and sensory function once nerve conduction has been restored; otherwise, the injury would be classified as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Thus, <b>neurapraxia</b> is the mildest classification of peripheral nerve injury.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases of}} <b>neurapraxia,</b> the {{function}} of the nerves are temporarily impaired or, in rare cases, completely lost. However, the prognosis for recovery from <b>neurapraxia</b> is efficient and quick. Recovery begins within two to three weeks after the injury occurs, and it is complete within six to eight weeks. There are instances when function is not completely restored until four months after the instance of injury. The recovery period of <b>neurapraxia</b> is not an entirely ordered process, but the recovery is always complete and fast.|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two-portal endoscopic carpal tunnel release. Two hundred and fifty-five consecutive hands (204 patients) were operated on by one surgeon using general or regional anaesthesia in the first 48 hands and local anaesthesia in the following 207 hands. The patients were evaluated preoperatively and 3 and 6 months postoperatively by an independent examiner. At the 6 -month follow-up, 83 % reported complete relief of symptoms and 89 % were satisfied with the results of surgery. The median time until return to work was 17 days. Complications included five postoperative digital <b>neurapraxias,</b> all occurring under general or regional anaesthesia, and four open reoperations due to persistent symptoms. Two-portal endoscopic carpal tunnel release can be effective and safe and appears to shorten the time until return to work. The use of local anaesthesia might be important in avoiding neurological complications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract】Objective: Although most {{of nerve}} in-juries {{associated}} with Monteggia fracture-dislocation in children are <b>neurapraxias</b> and will recover spontaneously after conservative treatment, surgical {{exploration of the}} in-volved nerve is always required in the cases with the en-trapment of posterior interosseous nerve (PIN). However, the necessity and time frame for surgical intervention for specific patterns of nerve dysfunction remains controversial. The aim of the report is to observe and understand the pathology of PIN injury associated with Monteggia frac-ture-dislocation in children, and to propose the possible indication for the exploration of nerve. Methods: Eight cases, six boys and two girls, with Monteggia fracture-dislocation complicated by PIN injury, managed operatively at the authors’ Hospital from 2007 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients under-went the attempted closed reduction before they received exploration of PIN, with open reduction and internal fixation or successful closed reduction. Results: The PIN {{was found to be}} trapped acutely posterior to the radiocapitellar joint in 4 out of 5 Type III Bado’s Monteggia fractures. In the remaining cases, since there were longer time intervals from injury to operation, chronic compressive changes and epineural fibrosis of ra-dial nerve were visualized. After a microsurgical neurolysis performed, the complete recovery in the nerve function was obtained in all the cases during the follow-up. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that every case of type III Monteggia fracture-dislocation with decreased or absent function of muscles innervated by PIN and an irreducible radial head in children should be viewed as an indication for immediate surgical exploration of the involved nerve to exclude a potential PIN entrapment.

40|$|Treball Final de Grau de Podologia, Escola Universitària d'Infermeria, Universitat de Barcelona, curs: 2014 - 2015, Tutor: María Cristina Manzanares CéspedesIntroduction and objectives: Advances in endoscopy, small joint arthroscopy, and instrumentation, {{have enabled}} {{surgeons}} to treat pathologies affecting the first metatarsophalangeal (MTPJ) and the plantar aponeurosis (PA). The {{aim of this}} paper is to study the used portals and its complications trough a systematic literature review, and evaluate the risk of nerve injury of each portal by means of cadaveric dissections. Material and methods: A PubMed, Scopus, Scielo and ScienceDirect search was performed, between September 2014 and May 2015, using the following keywords: “first metatarsophalangeal joint arthroscopy”. A refined search was carried out, using (“first metatarsophalangeal joint” AND “arthroscopy”) AND NOT “hallux valgus”, for first metatarsophalangeal joint arthroscopy and then, using “endoscopic” AND “plantar fasciitis”, and “endoscopic” AND “plantar fascia” for PA endoscopy. An anatomical textbook research was also performed. For the clinical anatomy experiment, ten fresh frozen feet were examined, as described by Golanó et al (2006), to evaluate the risk of nerve injury when establishing portals. Results: A total of 43 articles were selected through the search. The portals used for first metatarsophalangeal joint arthroscopy were the dorsolateral, dorsomedial, the medial and the medial proximal portals. Portals described for managing the plantar fasciosis are the medial and lateral portals. The portal’s complications cited were mainly attributed to lesion of nervous structures, being called <b>neurapraxias.</b> Other complications cited are: portal tenderness, infection, and persistent drainage. Arch collapse or lateral column pain are complications attributed to the plantar fascia release. On the cadaveric study no damage of the nervous structures surrounding the portals was observed, although some terminal branches on the calcaneal region can be minimally damaged. Conclusion: The selected portals reviewed have proven to be safe because no nervous structure was injured when reviewing the anatomo-clinical procedures on the cadaveric study...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} forms of mechanical nerve injury involving <b>neurapraxia.</b> The underlying causes of transient nerve injury typically include a brief ischemic episode or any form of compression. More persistent forms of nerve injury involve demyelination and axonal constriction. In certain circumstances, diagnosing <b>neurapraxia</b> can be uncomfortable {{because of the presence}} of severe neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is an indication that the lesion of the nerve is still in progress. Diagnosis of <b>neurapraxia</b> is almost always followed by a quick and complete recovery period.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} nerve types can be {{subjected}} to <b>neurapraxia</b> and therefore symptoms of the injury range in degree and intensity. Common symptoms of <b>neurapraxia</b> are disturbances in sensation, weakness of muscle, vasomotor and sudomotor paralysis {{in the region of}} the affected nerve or nerves, and abnormal sensitivity of the nerve at the point of injury. It has been observed that subjective sensory symptoms include numbness, tingling, and burning sensations {{at the site of the}} injury. Objective sensory symptoms are generally minimal in regards to touch, pain, heat, and cold. In cases of motor neuron <b>neurapraxia,</b> symptoms consist of flaccid paralysis of the muscles innervated by the injured nerve or nerves.Symptoms are often transient and only last for a short period of time immediately following the injury. However, in severe cases of <b>neurapraxia,</b> symptoms can persist for weeks or months at a time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurapraxia</b> is a {{disorder}} of the {{peripheral nervous system}} {{in which there is}} a temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, usually lasting an average of six to eight weeks before full recovery. <b>Neurapraxia</b> is derived from the word apraxia, meaning “loss or impairment of the ability to execute complex coordinated movements without muscular or sensory impairment”.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurapraxia</b> {{is often}} treated and cured by non-operative means. The primary goals of {{treatment}} are {{to maintain the}} proper nutrition of the paralyzed muscles, prevent contraction by the antagonists of the paralyzed muscles, and to consistently keep the joints mobile. A splint is often used in cases of <b>neurapraxia</b> because {{it is able to}} maintain a relaxed position of the paralyzed muscle. The splint prevents the paralyzed muscle from being overstretched either by the force of gravity or by other non-paralyzed antagonists. During the recovery period of <b>neurapraxia,</b> it is essential that the joints constantly undergo passive movement in order to preserve proper mobility. If joints are kept mobile, the limb has the best possible chance of benefit from the return of nervous function. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can also help to reduce swelling at the injury site. In addition to these non-operative remedies, it is suggested that muscles affected by <b>neurapraxia</b> be kept warm at all times. Circulation in the limb is stimulated with the use of heat. Once voluntary movement has returned to the muscle, recovery and treatment continues by the participation in active exercises. Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy are common sources of treatment during these early stages of restoration of active movement. Almost all cases of <b>neurapraxia</b> can be completely treated by non-operative means.|$|E
50|$|The entire nerve is {{involved}} in the response to traumatic injuries. The outcome of nerve repair is dependent on the degree of the nerve injury and the circumstances at the site of injury. Since <b>neurapraxia</b> is the least serious form of peripheral nerve injury, recovery and treatment are not extensive. Once the cause of <b>neurapraxia</b> is eliminated, recovery of the lesions in the nerve occurs within a short time span.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurapraxia</b> is {{very common}} in {{professional}} athletes, especially American football players, and is a condition that {{can and should be}} treated by a physician.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>neurapraxia</b> is a neural lesion which causes a {{temporary}} block of nerve conduction without transection of the axon. A conduction block {{is classified as}} a 40% reduction in action potential amplitude over a short distance on the nerve, or a 50% reduction for a longer distance on the nerve. In <b>neurapraxia,</b> stimulation to the injured nerve results in a greater reduction in the action potential amplitude on the proximal site of the injury {{as opposed to the}} distal site.|$|E
50|$|Cervical cord <b>neurapraxia</b> among American {{football}} players is commonly observed in athletes playing positions involving high-speed collisions and open-field tackling. Cases of <b>neurapraxia</b> in the National Football League were first described in 1986 by Joseph S. Torg, M.D., {{founder of the}} National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry (established in 1975). As a result of Dr. Torg’s findings the NFL {{as well as other}} levels of American football have outlawed the act of spearing, or the lowering of the head and hitting an opponent with the crown of the helmet. The cervical spine cannot properly absorb the force of a collision when the head is even slightly lowered {{as is the case in}} spearing. In addition to outlawing acts such as spearing, prevention of <b>neurapraxia</b> on the football field relies on instruction and reinforcement of proper tackling technique by coaches and trainers.|$|E

50|$|The Gartland {{classification}} is {{a system}} of categorizing supracondylar humerus fractures, clinically useful as it predicts the likelihood of associated neurovascular injury, such as anterior interosseous nerve <b>neurapraxia</b> or brachial artery disruption.|$|E
50|$|According {{to medical}} {{professionals}} with the Cleveland Clinic, once an athlete suffers from {{an episode of}} cervical spinal cord, team physician or athletic trainer first stabilize {{the head and neck}} followed by a thorough neurologic inspection. If the injury is deemed severe, injured parties should be taken to a hospital for evaluation. Athletes that suffer from severe episodes of <b>neurapraxia</b> are urged to consult orthopaedic or spinal medical specialists. In mild cases of <b>neurapraxia,</b> the athlete is able to remove themselves from the field of play. However, the athlete is still advised to seek medical consultation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurapraxia</b> {{occurs in}} the {{peripheral}} nervous system typically in the ulnar, median, radial and brachial plexus nerves of the upper body and in the sciatic and peroneal nerves of the lower body. Peripheral nerves are myelinated, relatively large, spatially complex cells whose size and connectivity typically make them more susceptible to damage and compromise their capacity to self-repair, although {{this is not the}} case in <b>neurapraxia.</b> Microscopic evidence has shown that there is damage to the myelin sheath, but not to the axon. Therefore, distal nerve fibers do not degenerate and the myelin damage can be repaired.|$|E
50|$|Taken together, {{these changes}} are {{intended}} to produce compliance via transitory <b>neurapraxia</b> (temporary muscle pain, spasm and paralysis due to nerve injury) instead of the bone fractures and cerebral concussion which characterized their earlier use.|$|E
50|$|The classifications {{of nerve}} damage have been {{well-defined}} by Sir Herbert Seddon and Sunderland {{and are still}} in use today. The table at the right details the forms (<b>neurapraxia,</b> axonotmesis and neurotmesis) and degrees of nerve injury that occur {{as a result of}} exposure to various temperatures.|$|E
50|$|In {{order of}} degree of severity, injury to a nerve can be {{described}} as <b>neurapraxia,</b> axonotmesis, or neurotmesis.Concussion is considered a mild form of diffuse axonal injury. The dysfunction of axons in the nervous system {{is one of the major}} causes of many inherited neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons.|$|E
50|$|The {{site and}} type of brachial plexus injury {{determine}} the prognosis. Avulsion and rupture injuries require timely surgical intervention for any chance of recovery. For milder injuries involving build-up of scar tissue and for <b>neurapraxia,</b> the potential for improvement varies, {{but there is a}} fair prognosis for spontaneous recovery, with a 90-100% return of function.|$|E
5000|$|A neuron's {{response}} to trauma {{can often be}} determined by the severity of the injury, classified by Seddon's classification. In Seddon's Classification, nerve injury is described as either <b>neurapraxia,</b> axonotmesis, or neurotmesis. Following trauma to the nerve, a short onset of afferent impulses, termed [...] "injury discharge", occurs. While lasting only minutes, this occurrence has been linked to the onset of neuropathic pain.|$|E
50|$|Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} can {{be classified}} in two different ways. Neurotmesis is classified under the Seddon system which is defined by three grades of nerve injury. The mildest grade {{is referred to as}} <b>neurapraxia</b> and is characterized by a reduction or complete blockage of conduction across a segment of nerve while axonal continuity is maintained and nerve conduction is preserved. These injuries are almost always reversed and a recovery takes place within days or weeks. The second classification of the Seddon system is referred to as axonotmesis which is a more severe case of peripheral nerve injury. Axonotmesis is classified by an interruption of the axons, but a preservation of the surrounding connective tissues around the axon. These injuries can heal themselves at about 1mm/day, therefore resulting in recovery to be possible but at a slower rate than <b>neurapraxia.</b> The last and most severe case of peripheral nerve injury is known as neurotmesis, which in most cases cannot be completely recovered from even with surgical repair.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} and {{commonly}} used system {{described by the}} late Sir Sydney Sunderland, divides nerve injuries into five degrees: first degree or <b>neurapraxia,</b> following on from Seddon, in which the insulation around the nerve called myelin is damaged but the nerve itself is spared, and second through fifth degree, which denotes increasing severity of injury. With fifth degree injuries, the nerve is completely divided.|$|E
50|$|The second {{classification}} of nerve injury {{is known as}} the Sunderland classification which is more complex and specific. This classification uses five different degrees of nerve injury, the first one being the least severe and the equivalent to <b>neurapraxia</b> and the most severe being the fifth degree and having the same classification as neurotmesis. The second through fourth degrees are dependent on the variance of axon discontinuity and are classified under Seddon’s {{classification of}} axonotmesis.|$|E
50|$|Denervation may be {{the result}} of nerve injury. The three main types of nerve injury are <b>neurapraxia,</b> axonotmesis and neurotmesis. These three types {{distinguish}} between the severity of the nerve damage and the potential for recovery after the damage. After an injury in which some nerves are damaged, the brain has shown capabilities in rewiring or rearranging neuronal circuitry. This plasticity allows for the brain to compensate for the loss in neuronal communication resulting from injury.|$|E
50|$|Classification of {{peripheral}} nerve injury assists in prognosis and determination of treatment strategy. Classification of nerve injury was described by Seddon in 1943 and by Sunderland in 1951. The lowest degree of nerve injury in which the nerve remains intact but signaling ability is damaged is called <b>neurapraxia.</b> The second degree in which the axon is damaged but the surrounding connecting tissue remains intact is called axonotmesis. The last degree in which both the axon and connective tissue are damaged is called neurotmesis.|$|E
5000|$|Axonotmesis {{involves}} loss of {{the relative}} continuity of the axon and its covering of myelin, but preservation of the connective tissue framework of the nerve ( [...] the encapsulating tissue, the epineurium and perineurium, are preserved [...] ). Because axonal continuity is lost, Wallerian degeneration occurs. Electromyography ( [...] EMG [...] ) performed 2 to 4 weeks later shows fibrillations and denervation potentials in musculature distal to the injury site. Loss in both motor and sensory spines is more complete with axonotmesis than with <b>neurapraxia,</b> and recovery occurs only through regenerations of the axons, a process requiring time.|$|E
50|$|Axonotmesis {{is usually}} {{the result of a}} more severe crush or {{contusion}} than <b>neurapraxia,</b> but can also occur when the nerve is stretched (without damage to the epineurium). There is usually an element of retrograde proximal degeneration of the axon, and for regeneration to occur, this loss must first be overcome. The regeneration fibers must cross the injury site and regeneration through the proximal or retrograde area of degeneration may require several weeks. Then the neuritis tip progresses down the distal site, such as the wrist or hand. Proximal lesion may grow distally as fast as 2 to 3 mm per day and distal lesion as slowly as 1.5 mm per day. Regeneration occurs over weeks to years.|$|E
50|$|A larger, single-center, prospective, non-randomized, {{cohort study}} to {{investigate}} the safety of IRE for tumor ablation in humans evaluated 38 subjects with advanced malignancy of the liver, kidney, or lung (69 separate tumors) which were unresponsive to alternative treatment. The authors reported no mortalities within the 30 days post-procedure. Transient ventricular arrhythmia occurred in four patients; ECG synchronized delivery was subsequently used in the remaining 30 patients, with two further arrhythmias (supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation). There was one report of obstruction of the upper ureter after IRE, in addition to one report of the unintentional electroporation of an adrenal gland, resulting in a transient, severe hypertension. Two patients developed temporary <b>neurapraxia</b> secondary to arm extension during treatment, The authors further noted that complete target tumor ablation verified by CT was achieved in 46 of the 69 tumors treated with IRE (66%), while most treatment failures occurred in renal and lung tumors. The authors concluded that IRE appears safe for clinical use if ECG-synchronized delivery is utilized to prevent arrhythmias.|$|E
