500|$|It was {{the absence}} of Symonds, sent home from the 2008–09 series against Bangladesh for {{skipping}} a team meeting to go fishing, that gave White another opportunity in the ODI team. Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a few wickets {{but it would have}} been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a few overs under the belt as well." [...] He claimed two more wickets in the second match and, after not being required to bowl in the third, finished the series with an average under 10.|$|E
500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – {{but how can you}} expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E

Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, MTV Unplugged {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Ryan Jones from Alternative Addiction gave the album four stars out of five, writing that [...] "the final product has been touched up perfectly {{and the four}} songs on the EP are the perfect selections." [...] He described both [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] and [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] as [...] "chilling", but concluded his review saying that [...] "it would have been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a few more songs." [...] Joanna Bomberg from MTV commented that [...] "Thirty Seconds to Mars have delivered a truly visual and sonically compelling performance that will inspire their fans and captivate new ones." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly praised the show and felt that the band's cover of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was [...] "stellar." [...] Alex Easton of AltSounds called the show [...] "emotional, powerful and stunning." [...] He praised Leto's vocals and wrote that the album [...] "not only brings a different element to some classic songs, but cements Thirty Seconds to Mars' place {{as one of the}} finest acts of this generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Weisman's science journalism style uses {{interviews}} with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, {{while maintaining the}} [...] "cool and dispassionate ...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some affirmation for {{whatever it is you}} believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E
500|$|Kevin Dunsmore of Hardcore Gamer {{wrote that}} the plot was much more {{grounded}} and realistic than other recent titles in the series and echoed Push Squares review by commenting on the gameplay, writing [...] "You're not a super soldier {{stuck in the middle}} of out-of-this-world set piece, but rather a regular soldier working with a squad to complete objectives." [...] However, he stated that the decision to keep many of the design choices intact from the original was both refreshing and a hindrance; he highlighted examples from the campaign, such as infinitely-spawning enemies, and similarly condemned infamous perks and a lack of killstreak-countering in the multiplayer that had not been removed or fixed, finding it [...] "extremely outdated". Despite this, he complimented the multiplayer as feeling fresh, saying [...] "After years of over-the-top killstreaks, wall-running, and other crazy antics, it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to the basics". He heavily praised the visual enhancements on display, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered is the most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet, being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster. [...] It's a stunning overhaul." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "What Raven has accomplished is impressive, but it has its limits. A few tweaks would have gone a long way to fixing some balancing issues, but for those looking for a blast from the past, this works just fine".|$|E

500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a piece of silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E
500|$|The club's poor run of form {{continued}} in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped {{to the bottom}} of the league table. Another 3–1 defeat, against Newcastle United, was followed by a second successive 1–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches. Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United, and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season. [...] "It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> three points, but now we have to build on it," [...] said Sturrock. [...] "There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again." [...] Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2–1 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper. Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2–0 at Bloomfield Road. The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle. He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway, a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. [...] "I suppose it was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better," [...] said executive director Keith Todd. [...] "We understood exactly what we are doing." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Fresh Blood" [...] was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide praised the episode, commenting that [...] "it was really <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although {{she had grown}} a [...] "tad bit weary" [...] of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still [...] "really sorry to see Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a [...] "good twist", and liked that his [...] "black-and-white beliefs" [...] remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her [...] "really sad" [...] ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the [...] "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was [...] "beyond happy" [...] that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The [...] "moment that [...] been waiting for all season long" [...] finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually listened to him instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be [...] "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for [...] "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for [...] "making us care so much and believe so fully that a scene like this can leave us gasping".|$|E

2500|$|Explaining why the {{producers}} were given co-writing credit, Gaskarth said [...] "...the {{way in which}} this album was written involved me working, in some way, {{on all of the}} songs in their respective presence, while taking their professional advice. It was only fair to give credit where credit was due." [...] Talking about the album, Gaskarth explained to Alternative Press, [...] "we tried to explore something a little bit deeper. We're exploring some new moods, which is pretty cool." [...] He added, [...] "It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the pop-punk niche we came up in ... it's nice to try to broaden your horizons. To be honest, we wrote a lot of this album with that in mind." [...] Gaskarth called his lyrics [...] "very tongue in cheek," [...] which [...] "fit the vibe" [...] of the album.

2500|$|After stumps, with Australia at 4/254, Ponting {{was happy}} with his performance, [...] "I'm as pleased with that innings as I {{probably}} have been with any innings I've ever played," [...] he said. [...] "I'd played eight Tests here before with a highest score of 60, so I had some work to do. I had a point to prove to a few people as well. It was satisfying today." [...] I've been working really hard," [...] Ponting said on his technique. [...] "I've {{made no secret of}} it, my record here has been poor. Today is one step in the right direction. It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some runs out there and put the team in a good position. But one innings doesn't make a tour. The other tours I've had here, apart from the last Test I played, I've batted at six, always coming in against spin and when the wicket has worn. One thing that stands out in my career is whenever I've been in early, with the team in a bit of trouble, I've managed to make runs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lancashire batted on {{for another}} 49 overs, scoring 195 for 6 declared, and setting Somerset a target of 247 runs in 31 overs. Paul Horton and Loye put on 94 for the first wicket. But all in all, taking 61 overs to score 195 was hardly {{declaration}} batting. Somerset did not go for the win (which would have meant scoring at well over 7 an over), and made 69 for 3 off 22.3 overs before play ended because of bad light. Lancashire's Mal Loye, who fell just short of his century on 92 in the second innings to go with his 53 in the first said, [...] "To {{get a couple of}} fifties against a pretty good attack is a good start. It was a pretty difficult pitch to bat on during the first day but it got easier as the match wore on and I was disappointed to miss out. Getting a century is a psychological thing for a batsman.

2500|$|Upon Simpson's rise {{to stardom}} {{with the success}} of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica in 2003, Simpson was seen as a [...] "ditzy blonde" [...] based on her antics and {{comments}} on the show. The show also revealed that Simpson had, in fact, waited until marriage to have sex; she recorded the song [...] "Sweetest Sin" [...] (2003) about losing her virginity to Lachey. While Simpson continued to achieve further success, she became known as a sex symbol by the media. Simpson was ranked at number fifty-three on the Maxim Hot 100 list in 2001. She topped the list in 2004, ranked at the [...] "hottest" [...] female of the year. Simpson was quoted as stating [...] "It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the stamp of approval from the boys [...] it's way better than being number 101!" [...] The following year, she ranked in at number nine on the list. In 2006, she appeared on the list at number eighteen. Simpson was {{on the cover of the}} magazine that year as well. Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke furthered her sex symbol image, most notably when she portrayed the character in her highly controversial [...] "These Boots Are Made For Walkin" [...] music video. Simpson appeared as the character in several television commercials for Pizza Hut airing during the Super Bowl in 2006 and 2007. She also portrayed the character in adverts for DirecTV.|$|E
2500|$|Sri Lanka batted {{first and}} scored 251, before Ponting—batting at number five due to Steve Waugh's absence through injury—arrived at the crease with Australia at a {{comfortable}} 3/422. He started nervously, edging his first ball past first slip for a boundary from off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. When Ponting reached 96, Chaminda Vaas hit Ponting high on his thigh and was given out leg before wicket. Many members {{of the crowd and}} media argued it was an incorrect decision due to excessive height. He combined with Stuart Law, also playing on debut, for a partnership of 121. This was only the ninth ever century partnership by debutants in Test cricket. [...] "I've got mixed emotions about my knock at the moment. 96 is a good score {{but it would have been}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a 100", Ponting said after the innings. [...] "Once I struck a few in the middle of the bat, and I spent some time in the middle I tried to relax and enjoy it, just savour the moment." [...] Australia won the match by an innings.

2500|$|Burt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party; Sondheim arrived before him, {{and knew}} {{no one else}} well.

He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from Saturday Night and he could audition for Bernstein. Sondheim met Bernstein the following day, played for him and Bernstein said he would let him know. The composer wanted to write music and lyrics; after consulting with Hammerstein, Bernstein told Sondheim he could write music later. In 1957, West Side Story opened; directed by Jerome Robbins, it ran for 732 performances. Sondheim has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. While Bernstein was working on Candide, Sondheim reportedly wrote some of [...] West Side Storys music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from West Side Story during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off. Sondheim insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list him as the sole lyricist. He described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he wanted the credit. Sondheim later said he wished [...] "someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that extra percentage".|$|E
