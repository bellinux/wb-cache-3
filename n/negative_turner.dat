For example, the valence of happiness is positive whereas the valence of fear and anger is <b>negative</b> (<b>Turner,</b> 2002). This research practice can be problematic because different processes drive each emotion, leading to different outcomes, {{and the capacity to}} tease out these differences is diminished (Gooty, Gavin, & Ashanasy, 2009).

5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related <b>negative</b> publicity, <b>Turner</b> {{accepted}} the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings of the picture and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{provides an}} overview of the multiple relationships between alcohol use, protective behavioral strategies (PBS), alcohol-related negative consequences, depression, and sleep problems among college students, as well as differences by individual level characteristics, such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Several studies have found that specific demographic groups of {{students are more likely to}} reach a higher blood alcohol content (BAC) when “partying” or socializing (Turner, Bauerle, 2 ̆ 6 Shu, 2004; Crotty, 2011). A variety of studies have also confirmed the positive relationship between high blood alcohol content and experiencing alcohol-related <b>negative</b> consequences (<b>Turner,</b> et al., 2004; Martens, Taylor, Damann, Page, Mowry, 2 ̆ 6 Cimini, 2004; Borden, Martens, McBride, Sheline, Bloch, 2 ̆ 6 Dude, 2011; Crotty, 2011). Additional studies have explored the role that protective behaviors play in the alcohol consumption-negative consequences relationship (Martens et al., 2004; Borden et al., 2011; Haines, Barker, 2 ̆ 6 Rice, 2006; Martens, Martin, Littlefield, Murphy, 2 ̆ 6 Cimini, 2011). These studies conclude that the frequency of protective behavior use and the number of these behaviors that are used when consuming alcohol are associated with the likelihood of a student experiencing negative consequences. Specifically, the negative relationship between protective behavior use and likelihood of experiencing negative consequences as a result of binge drinking is stronger for students who rarely use protective behaviors (Martens et al., 2004). Recent studies have also explored the role that depressive symptoms play in a model with alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences. The prevalence of college students who were diagnosed with depression in the last school year presents a great need to study its relationship with these constructs. Students with poor mental health or depression are also more likely to experience alcohol-related negative consequences (Weitzman, 2004), and there is a direct association between depressive symptoms and negative consequences, but not necessarily between alcohol use and depressive symptoms (Vickers, Patten, Bronars, Lane, Stevens, Croghan, Schroeder, 2 ̆ 6 Clark, 2004). One study also suggests that protective behaviors partially mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and negative consequences (Martens, Martin, Hatchett, Fowler, Fleming, Karakashian, 2 ̆ 6 Cimini, 2008). Further, students with depressive symptoms who use protective behaviors drink less and experience fewer negative consequences, as compared to students without depressive symptoms who use protective behaviors (LaBrie, Kenney, Lac, Garcia, 2 ̆ 6 Ferraiolo, 2009). Sleeping problems play an important role in the relationship between alcohol consumption and alcohol-related negative consequences. Poorer global sleep quality is associated with alcohol-related negative consequences after controlling for alcohol use. Further, among heavier drinkers, those with poorer sleep quality experienced greater levels of negative consequences than those who had better sleep quality (Kenney, LaBrie, Hummer, 2 ̆ 6 Pham, 2012). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between alcohol use measured by estimated Blood Alcohol Content (eBAC), PBS, depression, and sleep problems, as they explain the variance of alcohol-related negative consequences using the spring 2009 national aggregate data set of the American College Health Association National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA). This dataset was comprised of a random sample of undergraduate and graduate students from 117 U. S. colleges and universities (n= 53, 850). Reliability analyses, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used for model specification and evaluation. Model fit indices for the current study indicate that the model and the data in this study are a good fit, demonstrated by RMSEA=. 044, 90...|$|R
