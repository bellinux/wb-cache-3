5|$|I {{have been}} {{increasingly}} perturbed over the blatant {{disparity between the}} major role which Negro women have played and are playing in the crucial grassroots levels of our struggle and the minor role of leadership they have been assigned in the national policy-making decisions. It is indefensible to call a national march on Washington and send out a call which contains the name of <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> woman leader.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} Anomalocaris, also from the Burgess Shale. Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> phylum.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, or they die. They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E

5|$|Swete {{examined}} {{only the}} text of the Old Testament. According to him the original order of the Old Testament cannot be reconstructed; the scribe who converted the manuscript into a palimpsest used the leaves for his new text without regard to their original arrangement.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Pawnee people were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> unified tribe. At {{the middle of the}} 18th century, they consisted of two major groups. The Skidis, or Wolf Pawnees, had migrated northward with the Arikaras, and had probably been in Nebraska since 1600 or earlier. By the beginning of the 18th century, they were established on the Loup River, which flows through central Nebraska into the Platte River from the north.|$|E

However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.|$|E
5|$|U-38 would {{depart from}} Lorient {{for the last}} time on 15 October, again with Heinrich Schuch in command. Her {{eleventh}} patrol was to take place in the North Atlantic. However, during a period of five weeks, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> ship was hit. U-38 traveled to the U-boat base in Bergen, Norway on 21 November. She would later depart Bergen on the 23rd and arrive in Stettin on 29 November.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a {{member of the}} nomenklatura, the country's de facto ruling class. Nikita Khrushchev chaired the Presidium from 1955 to 1964; Leonid Brezhnev succeeded him that year and chaired until 1982. In {{contrast}} to full members, candidate members of the Presidium could not vote during Presidium sessions. It was normal that a full member of the Presidium had previously served as a candidate member, but this was not always the case. During the term 23 people held seats in the Presidium: 14 full members and 9 candidate members. One candidate member was promoted to full membership in the Presidium during the term. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Presidium member died during this period while retaining office.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> test bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though some}} of his {{soldiers}} came within 60 meters of the pillbox, after 19 of them (over a third) were killed and the sun began rising in the horizon, Kotzer decided to retreat, unable to receive official permission due to communication problems. He ordered all of his troops to collect the wounded and any weapons they could carry, helping with the task himself. The dead were left in the field, including the medics (<b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> medic survived). The injured were brought under fire into the wadi and at about 07:00 the force {{made its way to}} an unoccupied two-storey building on the east bank. After the Egyptians started shelling the building with mortars, Kotzer's company began to move towards Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{was much}} smaller than the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and its body mass is {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E

5|$|Following the attack, the German Ministry of Propaganda checked {{incoming}} {{reports from}} both London and the German Naval High command. Having {{been told by}} Kriegsmarine that there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> U-boat {{in the vicinity of}} Athenia on the day of her sinking, the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U-boat had sunk Athenia. They claimed instead that the British had torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war {{on the side of the}} Allies.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> person who was not either related to or acquainted with {{a person who had}} died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E
5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E

5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> line, but an entire texture, often {{of a popular}} song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was {{to become the most}} usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|Like {{much of the}} country, and {{particularly}} Texas, Galveston boomed in the 1920s. But even the Great Depression did not stop Galveston's run of prosperity. Despite the financial ruin that faced {{much of the country}} during the Depression, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Galveston bank failed and unemployment was almost unheard of. Key business sectors in Galveston during the Free State era were casinos and prostitution, in addition to many legitimate businesses. During much of the period, the vice industries provided the majority of employment. Two families held particular prominence on the island during this era: the Moodys controlled the largest legitimate interests, and the Maceos controlled the largest criminal enterprises. Both families were wealthy with business empires that extended beyond the island.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Columbus Panhandles {{season was}} the franchise's inaugural {{season in the}} American Professional Football Association (APFA)—later named the National Football League. The season {{concluded}} with the team going 2–7–2 and finishing 13th place in the APFA standings. The Panhandles entered the season after a 3–6–1 record in 1919. The team opened the 1920 season with a loss to the Dayton Triangles, and the Panhandles lost five straight until a victory over the Zanesville Mark Greys. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> player was on the All-Pro list.|$|E
