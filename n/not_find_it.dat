5|$|Koht's role in {{the weak}} and unorganised defense against Operation Weserübung was debated {{during and after the}} occupation. After the World War, a {{commission}} named Undersøkelseskommisjonen av 1945 ("Scrutiny Commission of 1945") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions. After receiving Undersøkelseskommisjonen analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an Impeachment trial. The Parliament of Norway did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> necessary, and no such trial took place.|$|E
5|$|At several {{stages of}} development, other actors were pursued for the film. In October 2010, Willis said that Steve Austin would reprise {{his role as}} villain Dan Paine. In November 2010, Charlie Sheen was {{reported}} to be in consideration for the role of a CIA agent hunting down Willis' Mr. Church. In August 2011, Variety reported that actor and martial artist Donnie Yen was offered a role in the film; however, Yen declined the role because he did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> intriguing.|$|E
5|$|Hay {{enrolled}} at Brown in 1855. Although he enjoyed college life, he did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> easy: his Western clothing and accent made him stand out; {{he was not}} well prepared academically and was often sick. Hay gained {{a reputation as a}} star student and became a part of Providence's literary circle that included Sarah Helen Whitman and Nora Perry. He wrote poetry and experimented with hashish. Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858, and was, like his grandfather before him, Class Poet. He returned to Illinois. Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in his firm, where he could study law.|$|E

5|$|Nels Nelsen (3 June 1894 – 3 June 1943), born Nils Johan Nilsen and {{sometimes}} referred to as Nels Nelson, was a Norwegian-born Canadian ski jumper and later ski jumping organizer. He was among the world's best ski jumpers during the 1920s, and held the world record of 73 meters from 1925 to 1930. Born in Salangen, he moved with his family to Revelstoke, British Columbia, in 1912. Credited with bringing the sport of ski jumping to Canada, he made his debut on the nearby Big Hill in 1915. He competed throughout Canada and the United States, and became Canadian champion five times. Despite holding the world record at the time, he was not allowed to participate in the 1928 Winter Olympics because the officials did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> suitable for him to have to work his way to Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In season six, it is {{revealed}} that Jenny is dead. The series then reverts {{three months before}} the incident, picking up from the previous series finale. Shane's ex-girlfriend Molly Kroll (Clementine Ford) gives Jenny a letter of apology addressed to Shane. Jenny hides the letter so Shane will <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it.</b> Tina defends Jenny after the original film reels of Lez Girls are stolen, preventing the film from being released. Jenny later starts a relationship with Shane. Jenny steals Alice Pieszecki's (Leisha Hailey) ideas for a play which sparks a feud between the pair. Alice tries to convince everyone that the ideas were hers. Jenny keeps up the pretense and convinces everyone it is an original idea. Alice tries to break Shane and Jenny up to no avail. Jenny then reveals to Dylan Moreland (Alexandra Hedison) that Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley) and the rest of their friends are setting her up to find out if she is in love with Helena or her money. Jenny starts teasing Max by buying him feminine gifts for his pregnancy. This alienates Shane and is worsened by her trust issues involving Shane's fidelity. Shane sleeps with Niki once more and their relationship reaches a breaking point. Helena later finds out that Jenny revealed the truth to Dylan. This makes Helena desperate for revenge on her old friend. Tina and Shane later find Molly's letter in the loft. Tina then finds the stolen originals of Lez Girls and she goes to confront Jenny.|$|E

After another series of bombings, on September 28, 1969, they bombed the home of Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau.

25|$|The {{whereabouts}} of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> and alleged {{that it had}} disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, {{an article in the}} Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s.

25|$|General Wheeler's {{boat had}} around sixty people aboard, and was being pursued down the riverbanks by the rebel soldiers. The boat {{frequently}} grounded on the sandbanks.

Next morning, the boat again stuck on a sandbank, resulting in another charge by Thomson and eleven British soldiers.

Altman did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct alleged by Hill, without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it. Senator Alan K. Simpson questioned why Hill met, dined, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.|$|E

25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, the audience will <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} wonder {{in the region}} which is called Ercing.

He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it {{sometimes}} six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} micropsia are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality. Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E

25|$|The Court's assumptions, some say, {{have made}} the Mackay Radio ruling {{theoretically}} unsupportable {{as a matter of}} equity. Because the Court assumed that employers must hire permanent replacements as a matter of business necessity, the Court did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> necessary to require the employer to show the need for permanent replacements. This places the burden on either the Board or unions to prove that the employer had an anti-union animus. But the Supreme Court subsequently held that replacement workers cannot be presumed to be anti-union, so their use is not enough to show animus. Indeed, courts have been reluctant to find support for anti-union animus in any except the most extreme cases. As legal scholars point out, under Mackay Radio, employers can now cloak anti-union animus under the guise of using permanent replacements. They note that it is becoming increasingly common for employers to deunionize using permanent replacements, and nearly impossible for unions to obtain legal redress. This has held to a radical shift in American labor policy which Congress did not intend.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on Empress Wu's account, {{her mother}} Lady Yang {{had been created}} the Lady of Rong, and her older sister, now widowed, the Lady of Han. Her {{brothers}} Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang and cousins Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun, despite the poor relationships that they had with Lady Yang, were promoted. At a feast that Lady Yang held for them, however, Wu Weiliang offended Lady Yang by stating that they did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> honorable {{for them to be}} promoted on account of Empress Wu. Empress Wu therefore requested to have them demoted to remote prefectures—outwardly to show modesty, but in reality to avenge the offense to her mother. Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang died in effective exile. Meanwhile, in or before 666, Lady of Han died as well, and after her death, Emperor Gaozong created her daughter the Lady of Wei and considered keeping her in the palace—possibly as a concubine—but did not immediately do so, as he feared that Empress Wu would be displeased. It was said that Empress Wu heard of this and was nevertheless displeased, and she had the Lady of Wei poisoned, by placing poison in food offerings that Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun had made, and then blaming Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun for the murder. Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun were executed.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} between Daniel and {{his parents}} began when they forbade Daniel from buying and playing the Xbox 360 game Halo 3. Petric’s sister, Heidi Petric, testified in court that Daniel never played the game until he contracted a staphylococcus infection from a jet ski injury and was housebound. Petric {{was introduced to the}} Halo franchise while at the house of his friends, the Cianciolas, leading him to wanting a copy himself. His father, Mark Petric, was a minister at the New Life Assembly of God in Wellington. Both parents objected to the idea of their son playing a violent game with adult ratings and did <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> suitable for him. In Too Young To Kill, Mark claims that he told Daniel if he were to buy any violent video games whatsoever then he would destroy them, which did not sit well with Daniel. Mark testified that Daniel would regularly sneak out of the house at night without either parent’s knowledge and purchase the violent video games that his parents didn't approve of, where he also did this method with purchasing Halo 3 not long after it released. While housebound, Daniel would sometimes play the game for up to 18 hours at a time without taking a break. Susan eventually caught him playing the game and informed Mark, which lead him to confiscating the game from Daniel for going against his parents' wishes. Mark locked the game in a safe cabinet that also concealed his 9mm Taurus PT-92 handgun. Daniel believed his father would play the game by himself.|$|E
