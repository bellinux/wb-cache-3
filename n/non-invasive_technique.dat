40|$|The {{presence}} of primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension {{is associated with}} poor prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis of this affection is necessary and explains the rapid development of many <b>non-invasive</b> <b>techniques</b> in recent years. Unfortunately, none of these techniques seems to be sensitive and specific enough for the early detection and follow-up of pulmonary hypertension. The development of new <b>non-invasive</b> <b>techniques,</b> such as those associating echocardiography and Doppler effect, and certain radionuclide techniques, may in future allow better non-invasive quantification of pulmonary hypertension.

50|$|Normal {{approach}} such {{as critical}} dimension-scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) to obtain data for pattern quality inspection takes {{too much time}} and is also labor-intensive.

5000|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (sometimes called MRS - {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy) is a <b>non-invasive</b> <b>technique</b> related to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for analyzing metabolic changes in vivo (from Latin: [...] "within the living organism"), which can potentially be used for diagnosing brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, depression, etc. It uses some magnetic properties of the relevant metabolites to measure their concentrations in the body, which are correlated with certain diseases.

50|$|This {{has led to}} {{the desire}} to view live {{biological}} cell interactions in a real time, natural environment, and the need for subwavelength imaging. Subwavelength imaging can be defined as optical microscopy with the ability to see details of an object or organism below the wavelength of visible light (see discussion in the above sections). In other words, to have the capability to observe, in real time, below 200 nanometers. Optical microscopy is a <b>non-invasive</b> <b>technique</b> and technology because everyday light is the transmission medium. Imaging below the optical limit in optical microscopy (subwavelength) can be engineered for the cellular level, and nanometer level in principle.|$|E

50|$|The paired-click {{paradigm}} {{is a common}} <b>non-invasive</b> <b>technique</b> used to measure sensory gating, a type of event-related potential. For normal sensory gating, if a person hears a pair of clicks within 500 ms of one another, the person will gate out the second click because it is perceived as being redundant. Evidence of the gating {{can be seen in}} the P50 wave, occurring in the brain 50 ms after the click. Low values of the P50 wave indicate that sensory gating has occurred. High values of the P50 wave indicate a lack of sensory gating. Individuals with schizophrenia only reduce the amplitude of S2 by 10-20%, whereas individuals without schizophrenia reduce the amplitude of S2 by 80-90%.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} instruments are available for the diagnosis of diseases and disorders affecting the retina.

Recently, adaptive optics has been used to image individual rods and cones in the living human retina and a company based in Scotland have engineered technology that allows physicians to observe the complete retina without any discomfort to patients.The electroretinogram is used to measure non-invasively the retina's electrical activity, which is affected by certain diseases. A relatively new technology, now becoming widely available, is optical coherence tomography (OCT). This <b>non-invasive</b> <b>technique</b> allows one to obtain a 3D volumetric or high resolution cross-sectional tomogram of the retinal fine structure with histologic-quality.|$|E

50|$|The Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) {{method is}} another <b>non-invasive</b> <b>technique,</b> which {{is widely used}} in {{practice}} to image the shear wave velocity profile of the soil. The SASW method relies on the dispersive nature of Raleigh waves in layered media, i.e., the wave-velocity depends on the load's frequency. A material profile, based on the SASW method, is thus obtained according to: a) constructing an experimental dispersion curve, by performing field experiments, each time using a different loading frequency, and measuring the surface wave-speed for each frequency; b) constructing a theoretical dispersion curve, by assuming a trial distribution for the material properties of a layered profile; c) varying the material properties of the layered profile, and repeating the previous step, until a match between the experimental dispersion curve, and the theoretical dispersion curve is attained. The SASW method renders a layered (one-dimensional) shear wave velocity profile for the soil.|$|E
50|$|A totally “non-invasive” {{technique}} using {{structured light}} to measure pulmonary function was developed {{as long ago}} as the mid-1980s by a London group at the Royal Brompton Hospital working in close association with IBM (1-4). The technique utilised the distortion with movement of a structured pattern of light to calculate a volume or change in volume of a textured surface. At that time structured light pattern was shone on to the anterior chest and abdominal wall surfaces, and movie camera film footage was taken and sent to IBM for processing. The digital information was used to compute automatically the volume of the trunk and the position of any point on its surface and its cross-sectional shape at any level. The group found that linear dimensions could be calculated to within 0.5mm and a cross-sectional area within 5% and volume within 3-7%. The group suggested that <b>non-invasive</b> <b>technique</b> measurements were of sufficient accuracy to be tried in clinical practice. However, probably due to technology limitations, data processing and storage, the methodology was never commercialised.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in methylation of specific DNA sequences {{between mother and}} fetus {{can be used to}} identify fetal-specific DNA in the blood circulation of the mother. In a study published in March 6, 2011 online issue of Nature journal, using this <b>non-invasive</b> <b>technique</b> a group of investigators from Greece and UK achieved correct diagnosis of 14 trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) and 26 normal cases. Using massive parallel sequencing, a study testing for trisomy 21 only, successfully detected 209 of 212 cases (98.6%) with 3 false-positives in 1,471 pregnancies (0.2%). With commercially available non-invasive (blood) testing for Down syndrome having become available to patients in the United States and already available in China, in October 2011, the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis created some guidance. Based on its sensitivity and specificity, it constitutes an advanced screening test and that positive results require confirmation by an invasive test, and that while effective in the diagnosis of Down syndrome, it cannot assess half the abnormalities detected by invasive testing. The test is not recommended for general use until results from broader studies have been reported, but may be useful in high-risk patients in conjunction with genetic counseling.|$|E
