25|$|Convulsive {{therapy was}} {{introduced}} in 1934 by Hungarian <b>neuropsychiatrist</b> Ladislas J. Meduna who, believing mistakenly that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with camphor and then metrazol (cardiazol). Meduna {{is thought to be}} the father of convulsive therapy. In 1937, the first international meeting on convulsive therapy was held in Switzerland by the Swiss psychiatrist Muller. The proceedings were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry and, within three years, cardiazol convulsive therapy was being used worldwide. Italian Professor of neuropsychiatry Ugo Cerletti, who had been using electric shocks to produce seizures in animal experiments, and his colleague Lucio Bini developed the idea of using electricity as a substitute for metrazol in convulsive therapy and, in 1938, experimented {{for the first time on}} a person. It was believed early on that inducing convulsions aided in helping those with severe schizophrenia but later found to be most useful with affective disorders such as depression. Cerletti had noted a shock to the head produced convulsions in dogs. The idea to use electroshock on humans came to Cerletti when he saw how pigs were given an electric shock before being butchered to put them in an anesthetized state. Cerletti and Bini practiced until they felt they had the right parameters needed to have a successful human trial. Once they started trials on patients, they found that after 10-20 treatments the results were significant. Patients had much improved. A positive side effect to the treatment was retrograde amnesia. It was because of this side effect that patients could not remember the treatments and had no ill feelings toward it. ECT soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient. Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a Nobel Prize but did not receive one. By 1940, the procedure was introduced to both England and the US. In Germany and Austria, it was promoted by Friedrich Meggendorfer. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the use of ECT became widespread.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{bilateral}} lobectomy {{of a human}} {{subject was}} performed by the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy in 1930. The neurologist Richard Brickner reported on this case in 1932, relating that the recipient, known as [...] "Patient A", while experiencing a flattening of affect, had suffered no apparent decrease in intellectual function and seemed, {{at least to the}} casual observer, perfectly normal. Brickner concluded from this evidence that [...] "the frontal lobes are not 'centers' for the intellect". These clinical results were replicated in a similar operation undertaken in 1934 by the neurosurgeon Roy Glenwood Spurling and reported on by the <b>neuropsychiatrist</b> Spafford Ackerly. By the mid-1930s, interest in the function of the frontal lobes reached a high-water mark. This was reflected in the 1935 neurological congress in London, which hosted as part of its deliberations, [...] "a remarkable symposium... on the functions of the frontal lobes." [...] The panel was chaired by Henri Claude, a French <b>neuropsychiatrist,</b> who commenced the session by reviewing the state of research on the frontal lobes, and concluded that, [...] "altering the frontal lobes profoundly modifies the personality of subjects". This parallel symposium contained numerous papers by neurologists, neurosurgeons and psychologists; amongst these was one by Brickner, which impressed Moniz greatly, that again detailed the case of [...] "Patient A". Fulton and Jacobsen's paper, presented in another session of the conference on experimental physiology, was notable in linking animal and human studies on the function of the frontal lobes. Thus, {{at the time of the}} 1935 Congress, Moniz had available to him an increasing body of research on the role of the frontal lobes that extended well beyond the observations of Fulton and Jacobsen.|$|E

We sought to examine whether neurologists and specialist psychiatrists concurred with this approach. Design: We used mixed methods, first surveying all the neurologists in the UK and then interviewing the <b>neuropsychiatrists</b> in a large UK region on the role of psychiatrists in diagnosing conversion disorder. Results: Of the surveyed neurologists, 76 % did not think that psychiatrists were essential for the diagnosis and 71 % thought that psychiatrists did not even consider conversion disorder when referred a case. The <b>neuropsychiatrists</b> who were interviewed held complex models of conversion disorder. They believed all cases could be explained psychosocially in theory, but the nature of the diagnostic encounter often prevented it in practice; all felt that psychosocial formulation could be very helpful and some felt that it was essential to diagnosis. Conclusion: Although neurologists do not think psychiatrists are required for diagnosing conversion disorder, specialist psychiatrists disagree, at least in some cases.

2500|$|In 1947, child <b>neuropsychiatrist</b> Lauretta Bender {{published}} {{a study on}} 98 children aged between four and eleven years old who had been treated in {{the previous five years}} with intensive courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). These children received ECT daily for a typical course of approximately twenty treatments. This formed part of an experimental trend amongst a cadre of psychiatrists to explore the therapeutic impact of intensive regimes of ECT, which is also known as either regressive ECT or annihilation therapy. In the 1950s Bender abandoned ECT as a therapeutic practice for the treatment of children. In the same decade the results of her published work on the use of ECT in children was discredited after a study showing that the condition of the children so treated had either not improved or deteriorated. Commenting on his experience as part of Bender's therapeutic program, Ted Chabasinski said that, [...] "It really made a mess of me ... I went from being a shy kid who read a lot to a terrified kid who cried all the time." [...] Following his treatment, he spent ten years as an inmate of Rockland State Hospital, a psychiatric facility now known as the Rockland Psychiatric Center.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, George's lawyers {{sought an}} appeal on fresh {{evidence}} based on medical examinations suggesting {{he was not}} capable of committing the crime because of his mental disabilities.

Kopelman testified that [...] " [...] described {{to me that he}} can be aware of what's going on around him but he just can't respond," [...] and concluded that George was not calculating enough to have committed the crime. A second defence argument was that two new witnesses say they saw armed police at the scene when George was arrested, contrary to official reports about the circumstances of his arrest – the Metropolitan Police maintain there were no armed officers present during the arrest of George. [...] There was scientific evidence linking Barry George to the murder {{in the form of a}} single microscopic particle of what was said to have been gunshot residue, together with evidence as to the character of a fibre found on his clothing.

2500|$|The first prefrontal leucotomy on American {{soil was}} {{performed}} at the George Washington University Hospital on 14 September 1936 by the <b>neuropsychiatrist</b> Walter Freeman and his friend and colleague, the neurosurgeon, James W. Watts. Freeman had first encountered Moniz at the London-hosted Second International Congress of Neurology in 1935 where he had presented a poster exhibit of the Portuguese neurologist's work on cerebral angiography. Fortuitously occupying a booth next to Moniz, Freeman, delighted by their chance meeting, formed a highly favourable impression of Moniz, later remarking upon his [...] "sheer genius". According to Freeman, {{if they had not}} met in person {{it is highly unlikely that}} he would have ventured into the domain of frontal lobe psychosurgery. Freeman's interest in psychiatry was the natural outgrowth of his appointment in 1924 as the medical director of the Research Laboratories of the Government Hospital for the Insane in Washington, known colloquially as St Elizabeth's. Ambitious and a prodigious researcher, Freeman, who favoured an organic model of mental illness causation, spent the next several years exhaustively, yet ultimately fruitlessly, investigating a neuropathological basis for insanity. Chancing upon a preliminary communication by Moniz on leucotomy in the spring of 1936, Freeman initiated a correspondence in May of that year. Writing that he had been considering psychiatric brain surgery previously, he informed Moniz that, [...] "having your authority I expect to go ahead". Moniz, in return, promised to send him a copy of his forthcoming monograph on leucotomy and urged him to purchase a leucotome from a French supplier.|$|E
