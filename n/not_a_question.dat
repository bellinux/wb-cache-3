5|$|In 1954, Bethe testified {{on behalf}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which {{was seen as a}} key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led to the successful Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince Edward Teller against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony {{played a major role in}} the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of {{an assault}} {{in the classic}} sense of the word. What does an assault on a city mean? It means the use of all the forces and weapons in the country's arsenal. It {{primarily}} means heavy rocket preparation lasting several hours. It means heavy bombing raids on the whole city {{with the aim of}} disabling 60% of the defenders and demoralizing the rest.|$|E
25|$|So it {{was more}} {{efficient}} and more moral to go for selected targets. In any case, {{it was the only}} way we could operate, because we were so small. For us it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of the professional honor of a soldier, it was the question of an idea, an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
25|$|For Michel Christol, {{the term}} Liberum must be {{understood}} in this context and in an abstract sense. This liberty derives from belonging to a city and expresses {{the end of the}} civitas’ dependence, “the elevation of a community of peregrini to the liberty of Roman citizenship”, which also served to placate the fears of the inhabitants of the pagus and to open the door to a later promotion, to the status of a colony. This promotion took place in 261 CE, during the reign of Gallienus, following an appeal from Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus in Michel Christol’s version of events. Thereafter, the defence of the libertas publica was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of defending a privilege at risk, but of requesting the “ultimate liberty” (summa libertas) - the promotion to the status of a colony. Michel Christol also points out the abstract character of terms such as libertas or dignitas; despite their abstract use, they are references to concrete and unique events.|$|E

25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E

500|$|The form of {{linguistic}} expression often does {{not correspond to}} the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, [...] "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{about the length of}} the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.|$|E

500|$|Before the Human Rights Act {{was brought}} before parliament, the government's whitepaper {{considered}} {{that it was}} necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty). However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E
500|$|Halo Wars was {{originally}} not a Halo series title. Ensemble spent 12 to 18 months {{working on the}} control scheme, using the Age of Mythology engine. The development team hacked an Age of Mythology expansion, , and {{used it as a}} prototype for control experiments. Ensemble found that managing Age of Mythologys resources, units, and buildings was too difficult with the console's controller. [...] "The answer [...] is actually hidden in the question," [...] Jason Pace, Microsoft Game Studio's lead producer, told The New Zealand Herald. [...] "It's something we believe has held strategy games back from succeeding on the console: you can't effectively bring a PC-style strategy game to the console because the fundamental game mechanic is tied to the mouse and keyboard input devices. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of just changing the control scheme to be gamepad friendly—you need to adapt the underlying strategy mechanic to make sense with the new input device." [...] Senior designer Justin Rouse said that the team kept the controls from the research they had conducted, but scrapped the rest in favor of [...] "build from the floor up what we need: the basics, the core of a strategy game." [...] With the goal of making [...] "the first great strategy game on the console", Ensemble streamlined gameplay mechanics; the game's single resource is produced at each base site, which allows players to quickly cycle through their bases instead of micromanaging multiple resources at many locations.|$|E
500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended beneficiary, a party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a half-secret trust ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a resulting trust to the residuary legatee. Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of resulting trust as required under three certainties rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one response has been to suggest that whether a resulting trust or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is a question for the courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic resulting trust, as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> for the courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E
