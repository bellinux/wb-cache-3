5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the oboe.|$|E

5|$|According to Watson, {{the most}} {{dominant}} element in the Rommel myth is Rommel the Superior Soldier, the second being Rommel the Common Man, {{and the last one}} Rommel the Martyr. Rosie Goldschmidt Waldeck, writing in 1943, also takes <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the image of the general who fought with common soldiers, with an indelible youthfulness and apparent invulnerability.|$|E
5|$|Despite the poem's {{doubt and}} darkness, a <b>note</b> <b>of</b> hope {{is struck by}} {{the first line of}} the fifth section, 'So here I am in the middle way'. This refers to the first line of Dante's Inferno, 'Midway in our life's journey, I went astray'. Although the descent is {{predicated}} on going astray, so also is persevering beyond it into the light.|$|E
5|$|Sonic & Knuckles was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews. Critics were impressed with the lock-on technology, though some made <b>note</b> <b>of</b> its similarity to its predecessor. It has since been re-released in various compilations and on digital platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade, Virtual Console, and Steam.|$|E
50|$|The {{fragrance}} {{was released}} in 1987. Uninhibited Perfume has top <b>notes</b> <b>of</b> bergamot, orange oil and aldehydic accords.

5|$|The band's live {{performances}} at large venues {{such as the}} Sydney Entertainment Centre was criticised by some fans, as the band had previously stated they disliked playing to large crowds.

5|$|The four {{denominations}} in {{this series}} {{are not the same}} by dimensions as the $25 billion note used different paper from the 500 ZWD banknote of 2001. The $100 billion ($1011) Agro Cheque was the largest of the second dollar, sharing the record for the most number of zeroes depicted on a banknote with the Yugoslav 500 billion ($5×1011) dinar <b>note</b> <b>of</b> 1993, up until January 2009.|$|E
5|$|When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby {{discussing}} {{plans to}} sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son.

Eliza departs that night, leaving a <b>note</b> <b>of</b> apology to her mistress.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{styles of}} Furmint are {{characterized}} by their aroma <b>notes</b> <b>of</b> smoke, pears and lime. Dessert style wines can develop <b>notes</b> <b>of</b> marzipan, blood orange, apricots and barley sugar. As these dessert styles of Furmint age they will often develop more smokey and spicy <b>notes</b> <b>of</b> tobacco, tea, cinnamon and even chocolate.|$|R

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making <b>note</b> <b>of</b> any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} {{before a}} low radar cross-section (RCS) and other stealth factors were ever a consideration, a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical <b>note</b> <b>of</b> 1957 stated {{that of all}} the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: only one or two components contributed significantly to the echo at any aspect, compared with three or more on most other types.|$|E
50|$|Lewis Thomas {{published}} multiple books {{throughout his}} career, the first being The Lives <b>of</b> a Cell: <b>Notes</b> <b>of</b> a Biology Watcher. In 1979 he published The Medusa and the Snail: More <b>Notes</b> <b>of</b> a Biology Watcher. He wrote an autobiographical book in 1983, The Youngest Science: <b>Notes</b> <b>of</b> a Medicine-Watcher. Also in 1983 he published Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler’s Ninth Symphony followed by Could I Ask You Something? in 1985. In 1990 and 1992 Thomas published Et Cetera Et Cetera: <b>Notes</b> <b>of</b> a Word Watcher and The Fragile Species respectively.|$|R
25|$|Later, highest {{denominations}} were added. The 200 hryvnia <b>notes</b> <b>of</b> {{the second}} series {{were introduced in}} 2001, followed by the 500 hryvnia <b>notes</b> <b>of</b> the third series in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{fragrance}} {{released on}} 16 September 2006 to selected European countries and then released the United States in January 2007.

5|$|Following the United States' win at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Rapinoe and her {{teammates}} {{became the first}} women's sports team to be honored with a ticker tape parade in New York City. Each player received {{a key to the}} city from Mayor Bill de Blasio. In October of the same year, the team was honored by President Barack Obama at the White House, and the president made <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the Northern California farm that had built a corn maze in the shape of Rapinoe's face.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the work in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E

5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a <b>note</b> <b>of</b> personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|He {{began playing}} for Surrey County Cricket Club's second XI in 1977, but Surrey {{made no move}} to sign him as a player. Leicestershire County Cricket Club did however take <b>note</b> <b>of</b> Agnew's {{impressive}} performances in local club cricket and for Uppingham School, for whom he took 37 wickets at a bowling average of 8 in 1977, and signed him while he was still a schoolboy in time for the 1978 season.|$|E
