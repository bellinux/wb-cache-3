5000|$|The cookie is {{especially}} popular around, and usually associated with, Christmas in communities {{with a strong}} Moravian background such as Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which still maintain the two largest Moravian communities in the United States. Traditionally, prominent homes in the community hosted open houses which contained elaborate Nativity scenes. These scenes were often built around large tree stumps which {{were found in the}} woods near the town. People opened their homes for viewings of these scenes, and offering cookies to guests was {{an important part of the}} tradition. The spice cookies were central to the occasion, but many families also made a sugar cookie which was made with butter and flavored heavily with <b>nutmeg.</b> <b>Families</b> made their own cookie cutters and handed them down to family members. The shapes were primarily farm animals, as part of the Nativity tradition. Families often had a few cookie cutters which were large and intricate and took real skill to cut out and bake. Although there are a few bakeries that still roll and cut the cookies by hand, some now use a mechanized process for making the cookies in order to meet the demand. While this does not affect the taste, the machine-made cookies have been criticized for not being as thin as their handmade counterparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} 98.3 FM in Willimantic began in 1971, with two {{competing}} proposals for {{the allocation of}} 98.3 in Connecticut: A proposal for the allocation to go to Willimantic submitted by Colin K. Rice and his <b>family’s</b> <b>Nutmeg</b> Broadcasting, and a competing proposal from a group headed by Randal Mayer of WWUH and WHCN-FM and Kenneth N. Dawson of WKND to allocate the frequency to Enfield. In early 1972, the FCC allocated the frequency to Willimantic, making 98.3 the only FM in Windham County.|$|R

5000|$|The type species (holotype) of Mercurana was {{collected}} on 18 May 2012 from bushes at {{the periphery of}} a temple compound, Arippa, near Kulathupuzha Reserve Forest, Kollam district, Kerala, India. It was a single adult male. Other two adult males (paratypes) were found from the same locality on 12 July 2012. The formal description was published on 17 April 2013 in the journal Zootaxa. The generic name was derived from ‘Mercury’ {{as a tribute to}} Freddie Mercury, the late singer and lyricist of the British rock band Queen, in combination with the genus name Rana, the most common frog taxa. The scientists chose 'Mercury' because Mercury's [...] "vibrant music was inspiring", in the author's own account. Further, Mercury was of an Indian-Parsi origin and spent majority of his childhood in Panchgani, which is located {{in the northern part of}} the mountain range from where the frog was discovered. The specific name is a combination of the words Myristica (a genus of the <b>nutmeg</b> <b>family</b> of trees), and palustris, which is Latin for [...] "swampy", to indicate the swamp forest habitat dominantly represented by Myristica trees in which the frog lives. The forest is particularly noted for its fragile and threatened habitat type in the Western Ghats.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept and}} {{practice}} of DNA barcoding have been designed as a system to facilitate species identification and recognition. The primary challenge for barcoding plants has been to identify a suitable region on which to focus the effort. The slow relative nucleotide substitution rates of plant mitochondria and the technical issues {{with the use of}} nuclear regions have focused attention on several proposed regions in the plastid genome. One of the challenges for barcoding is to discriminate closely related or recently evolved species. The Myristicaceae, or <b>nutmeg</b> <b>family,</b> is an older group within the angiosperms that con-tains some recently evolved species providing a challenging test for barcoding plants. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the relative utility of six coding (Universal Plastid Amplicon — UPA, rpoB, rpoc 1, accD, rbcL, matK) and one noncoding (trnH-psbA) chloro-plast loci for barcoding in the genus Compsoneura using both single region and multiregion approaches. Five of the regions we tested were predominantly invariant across species (UPA, rpoB, rpoC 1, accD, rbcL). Two of the regions (matK and trnH-psbA) had significant variation and show promise for barcoding in nutmegs. We demonstrate that a two-gen...|$|E
40|$|The {{interplay between}} genetic and {{demographic}} processes has major consequences on population viability. Population size affects demographic trends, while genetic diversity insures viability by reducing risks of inbreeding depression and by maintaining adaptive potential. Yet, {{the consequences of}} increases in census size (as opposed to effective size) on genetic diversity of forest populations are poorly known. We have studied the structure of genetic diversity in populations of saplings of the light-responsive tree, Virola michelii (Myristicaceae, the <b>nutmeg</b> <b>family),</b> in two plots having undergone different levels of canopy-gap opening disturbance. This allowed us to test the “intermediate disturbance” hypothesis, which generally applies to species diversity, at the intra-specific scale. Levels and distribution of genetic diversity were compared between plots and between life stages. Sapling parentage was analysed to infer each adult tree’s contribution to regeneration. Genetic diversity was higher, and spatial genetic structure was stronger in the post-disturbance than in the control seedling population. Parentage analysis suggested that {{a limited number of}} parents contributed to most of the regeneration, but that efficient mixing of their progeny may have enhanced the diversity of saplings occupying canopy gaps. A mixture of demo-genetic processes may contribute to maintain genetic diversity in spite of, or possibly due to, ecosystem disturbance in V. micheli...|$|E
40|$|International audienceKey message: Genetic {{diversity}} {{appears to}} be unaffected by disturbance in a stand of the light-demanding Neotropical treeV. michelii. Although spatial genetic structure is modified in post-disturbance cohorts, mixing of seeds from different mother trees in canopy gaps appears to efficiently maintain genetic admixture. Context: The interplay between genetic and demographic processes has major consequences on population viability. Population size affects demographic trends, while genetic diversity insures viability by reducing risks of inbreeding depression and by maintaining adaptive potential. Yet, the consequences of increases in census size (as opposed to effective size) on genetic diversity of forest populations are poorly known.

30|$|DNA barcoding is {{currently}} used effective tool that enables rapid and accurate identification of plant (Li et al. 2015). The Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) recommended rbcL + matK {{as the core}} barcode. However, these core barcode further combined with the psbA-trnH intergenic non-coding spacer region which improved discrimination power of core barcode. The non-coding intergenic region psbA-trnH exhibits high rates of insertion/deletion and sequence divergence (Kress and Erickson 2007). These features make trnH-psbA highly suitable candidate plant barcode for species resolution. Later on, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region considered as supplementary barcode, though China Plant Barcode of Life claimed ITS region had higher discriminatory power than plastid core barcodes (CBOL Plant Working Group 2009; Hollingsworth et al. 2011; China Plant BOL Group 2011). Hollingsworth et al. (2011) observed ITS region has some limitations which prevent it from being a core barcode such as incomplete concerted evolution, fungal contamination and difficulties of amplification and sequencing. Plastid gene large subunit of the ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase gene (rbcL) is of 1350  bp in length and choice for DNA barcoding (Chase 1993).The maturase gene matK is about 1500  bp long and located within the trnK gene encoding the tRNALys (UUU). Substitution rate of the matK gene is highest among the plastid genes (Hilu et al. 2003). Plastid gene matK can discriminate more than 90  % of species in the Orchidaceae but less than 49  % in the <b>nutmeg</b> <b>family</b> (Kress and Erickson 2007; Newmaster et al. 2008). In another case, identification of 92 species from 32 genera using the matK barcode could achieve a success rate of 56  % (Fazekas et al. 2008). However, {{a recent study of}} the flora of Canada revealed 93  % success in species identification with rbcL and matK, while the addition of the trnH-psbA intergenic spacer achieved discrimination up to 95  % (Burgess et al. 2011). Gonzalez et al. (2009) reported that species discrimination was lower (< 50  %) for rbcL + matK combination in the study of tropical tree species in French Guiana. Lower discrimination were reported in closest and complex taxa of Lysimachia, Ficus, Holcoglossum and Curcuma using rbcL and matK (Xiang et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2015). The lowest discriminatory power was observed in closely related groups of Lysimachia with rbcL (26.5 – 38.1  %), followed by matK (55.9 – 60.8  %) and combinations of core barcodes (rbcL + matK) had discrimination of 47.1 – 60.8  % (Zhang et al. 2012).|$|E
