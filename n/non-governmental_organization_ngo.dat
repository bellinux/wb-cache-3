These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).

5|$|Living River Siam (Thai: โครงการแม่น้ำเพื่อชีวิต; {{formerly}} South East Asia Rivers Network, or SEARIN) is a Thai <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization</b> (<b>NGO)</b> which {{analyzes the}} impact of Thailand's various dam projects and coordinates the research of indigenous peoples to give Thai villagers the power to document the influence of local rivers and dams. Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam study period in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how to document {{the effects of the}} dammed river on their lives. When the Thai government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those sites as well. Today, the organization works with other NGOs in Southeast Asia to counter government-sponsored research that encourages dam construction.|$|E

25|$|PwC {{was found}} to be unethically favored by the World Bank in a bid to privatize the water {{distribution}} system of Delhi, India, an effort that was alleged as corrupt by investigators. When bidding took place, PwC repeatedly failed in each round, and the World Bank in each case pressured PwC to be pushed to the next round and eventually win the bid. The effort at privatization fell through when an investigation was conducted by Arvind Kejriwal and the <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization</b> (<b>NGO)</b> Parivartan in 2005. After submitting a Right to Information (RTI) request, Parivartan received 9000 pages of correspondence and consultation with the World Bank, where it was revealed that the privatization of Delhi's water supply would provide salaries of $25,000 a month to four administrators of each of the 21 water zones, which amounted to over $25 million per year, increasing the budget by over 60% and water taxes 9 times.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} question regarding public goods {{is whether they}} should be owned by the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as Hart (1995) argue that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete. The incomplete contracting paradigm {{has been applied to}} public goods by Besley and Ghatak (2001). They consider the government and a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization</b> (<b>NGO)</b> who can both make investments to provide a public good. Who should be the owner of the public good, the government or the NGO? Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently {{it has been shown that}} the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.|$|E
25|$|Various {{schools have}} {{implemented}} fingerprint locks or made {{a record of}} children's fingerprints. In the United Kingdom there have been fingerprint locks in Holland Park School in London, and children's fingerprints are stored on databases. There have also been instances in Belgium, at the école Marie-José in Liège, in France and in Italy. The <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization</b> (<b>NGO)</b> Privacy International in 2002 made the cautionary announcement that {{tens of thousands of}} UK school children were being fingerprinted by schools, often without the knowledge or consent of their parents. That same year, the supplier Micro Librarian Systems, which uses a technology similar to that used in US prisons and the German military, estimated that 350 schools throughout Britain were using such systems to replace library cards. By 2007, it was estimated that 3,500 schools were using such systems. Under the United Kingdom Data Protection Act, schools in the UK do not have to ask parental consent to allow such practices to take place. Parents opposed to fingerprinting may only bring individual complaints against schools. In response to a complaint which they are continuing to pursue, in 2010 the European Commission expressed 'significant concerns' over the proportionality and necessity of the practice and the lack of judicial redress, indicating that the practice may break the European Union data protection directive.|$|E

500|$|The area {{inhabited}} by the golden-crowned sifaka {{is also an}} important agricultural and economical resource for the human population. [...] Suggested conservation action aimed at protecting this species and its habitat has focused on offering varying degrees of protection to forest fragments in the region, allowing human activity and resource extraction in areas that have less conservation potential while strictly protecting areas critical to the species' survival. In 2002, none of the forested areas that the golden-crowned sifaka inhabits were part of a formally protected national park or reserve. A conservation study from 1989 called {{for the creation of a}} national park that includes the forest of Binara as well as the dry forests to the north of Daraina. A more recent study from 2002 proposed a network of protected forest areas including areas outside of the village of Daraina, forests north of the Monambato River, and the northern forests that constitute the species' northern reservoir. [...] In 2005, Fanamby, a Malagasy <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization</b> (<b>NGO),</b> teamed up with Conservation International to create a [...] protected area that both Association Fanamby and the Ministry of Water and Forests manage.
