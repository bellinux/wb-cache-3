5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the <b>non-visible</b> defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E

The evidential dimension is prototypically visible vs. <b>non-visible</b> referents; however, the <b>non-visible</b> forms {{may be used for}} visible referents which are only vaguely identified or have unclear boundaries, whereas the visible forms are used for <b>non-visible</b> referents when these are topical to the conversation.|$|E

25|$|Water {{sensitive}} {{objects are}} masked {{in plastic wrap}} to avoid getting wet. A slurry of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) calcium carbonate and deionized water is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a <b>non-visible</b> area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.|$|E
25|$|An image {{intensifier}} or {{image intensifier}} tube is a vacuum tube device for increasing the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray image intensifier), or for conversion of <b>non-visible</b> light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E
2500|$|Photograph {{classification}} involves {{determining which}} image pixels represent visible (non-obscured) versus <b>non-visible</b> (obscured) sky directions. [...] Typically {{this has been}} accomplished using interactive thresholding, whereby an appropriate threshold is selected to best match a binary classification with observed sky visibility, with pixel intensity values above the threshold classified as visible and pixel intensity values below the threshold classified as <b>non-visible.</b> [...] Recently advances {{have been made in}} developing automatic threshold algorithms, however more work is still needed before these are fully reliable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{assumption is}} that most solar radiation originates from visible (unobscured) sky directions, a strong first order effect, and that reflected radiation from the canopy or other near-ground features (<b>non-visible</b> or obscured sky directions) is negligible, a small second order effect. [...] Another {{assumption is that}} the geometry of visible (non-obscured) sky does not change over the period for which calculations are performed.|$|E
2500|$|Observations {{from some}} of the {{instruments}} can be formatted as images, most of which are also readily available on the internet for either public or research use (see [...] ). Others such as spectra and measurements of particles in the solar wind do not lend themselves so readily to this. These images range in wavelength or frequency from optical (Hα) to extreme ultraviolet (UV). Images taken partly or exclusively with <b>non-visible</b> wavelengths are shown on the SOHO page and elsewhere in false color.|$|E
2500|$|Light {{can have}} a variety of effects on {{textiles}} over time. [...] In some cases, it may contribute to fading or discoloration, but of more concern is the damage which the fibers may suffer under prolonged exposure to <b>non-visible</b> light, such as ultraviolet and infrared lighting. [...] Ideally, textiles should be stored or displayed in as little light as possible, and preferably in total darkness. [...] However, as this is impractical for display and care of the piece, knowing the limits of lighting as well as the safest amounts of lighting, become important.|$|E
2500|$|The {{balance of}} payments, {{also known as}} balance of {{international}} payments and abbreviated B.O.P., of a country is the record of all economic transactions between {{the residents of the}} country {{and the rest of the}} world in a particular period (over a quarter of a year or more commonly over a year). These transactions are made by individuals, firms and government bodies. Thus the balance of payments includes all external visible and <b>non-visible</b> transactions of a country. It is an important issue to be studied, especially in international financial management field, for a few reasons. First, the balance of payments provides detailed information concerning the demand and supply of a country's currency.|$|E

2500|$|Fort of São Sebastião (...) At {{the other}} end of the Bay of Angra, {{opposite}} the Porto de Pipas (Port of Barrels), is the Fort of São Sebastião, built in the 16th century on the order of King Sebastian. The scope of its cannons were interlocked with the ranges of the cannons on Monte Brasil and three other small forts along the coastline, creating an effective defensive system for the port, which had been a favourite target for pirates. The Castelo de São Sebastião has been transformed into a charming hotel, one of the forty-odd pousadas (inns in historic buildings) of Portugal; this transformation preserves its original historic character, but the plumbing has been modernized, and some <b>non-visible</b> structural elements have been strengthened.|$|E
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} <b>non-visible</b> {{ultraviolet}} radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E
