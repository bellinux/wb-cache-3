40|$|The book {{examines}} {{the rights of}} defendants in infringement procedures {{and those of the}} <b>notifying</b> <b>parties</b> in merger proceedings before the European Commission and the Chinese competition authorities. The initial chapters offer a general introduction to EU and Chinese competition law respectively, paying particular attention to the substantive rules of competition law. Subsequent chapters present an overview of the procedural rights of the <b>notifying</b> <b>parties</b> in merger cases in both legal systems surveyed, address the procedural rights of defendants in infringement cases, and provide an international perspective on differences in the notification and enforcement procedures between legal systems. The final chapter draws comparative conclusions and includes a number of suggestions for improvement. ...|$|R

Within the United States such spills are reported to the National Response Center (NRC), and in Canada to the Ontario Spills Action Centre. This report discusses (1) how many oil and hazardous substance spills greater than 50 gallons (or of an unknown volume) were reported in the corridor from 1994 to 2004, and how accurately reported spills reflect the extent of actual spills; (2) what processes are used to <b>notify</b> <b>parties</b> of spills, and if they contain explicit requirements for reporting times and spill magnitude; and (3) the extent of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Coast Guard's spill prevention efforts and enforcement activities in the corridor from 1994 to 2004. ...|$|R
40|$|Emergency alert systems {{typically}} demand {{push notification}} {{because of the}} infrequency of such events and the urgency of <b>notifying</b> <b>parties</b> about them. However, push notification systems like email have many limitations, such as susceptibility to SPAM and security vulnerabilities. We explore the idea of basing health alerts on RSS feeds, which are a polling-based notification system. Since emergency alerts may be restricted to parties like doctors or health administrators and may be drawn from diverse administrative domains, RSS for health alerts requires a mechanism for expressing and enforcing inter-domain access policies for feeds. In particular, we explore using Shibboleth, a federated identity system developed for use in universities, and an attribute-based policy language, to provide secure RSS for emergency alerts. We validate the approach by showing {{how it can be}} used to deliver CDC PHIN health alerts. Our experimental validation shows that, based on our design, existing server technologies can obtain acceptable throughput even with fairly complex and diverse access policies...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} effect a strict foreclosure, the {{creditor}} must transmit a proposal indicating their desire to foreclose, which must {{be sent to the}} debtor and to secondary obligors (guarantors of the debt). If the collateral is not consumer goods, the notice must also be sent to other secured parties known to the foreclosing creditor, either because they have notified the foreclosing creditor of their interest, or because they have perfected their interest by filing the appropriate documents with the state secretary of state. If any <b>notified</b> <b>party</b> objects within 20 days, irrespective of reason, then strict foreclosure will not be permitted. Instead, the creditor will have to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, and will recoup its debt from the proceeds of that sale. This prevents subordinated creditors from having their interest {{in the value of the}} property cut off, since any amount recovered in the sale over and above the amount of the foreclosing creditor's debt will go to the remaining creditors.|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} early days of European merger control, the European Commission (“Commission”) has relied heavily on {{information}} provided by the <b>notifying</b> <b>parties</b> and by relevant third parties in carrying out its review of concentrations. More recently, the Commission has added economic analyses and market surveys, as well as the review of internal documents, as major elements. Over time, it is fair to say that the depth and breadth of the information gathering and analysis has grown significantly, making European merger review a resource-intensive and sometimes very drawn-out exercise. With that in mind, and after criticism from stakeholders, the Commission has in recent months sought to streamline and simplify the process. In December 2013, it adopted a package of measures to that effect (“Merger Simplification Package”), and has proposed some further measures in its White Paper “Towards more effective EU merger control,” published in July 2014. This paper provides a high-level view of the way in which the Commission carries out a merger investigation nowadays. In particular, we focus on four areas that are key to understanding the current anatomy of the fact-finding investigation. We also discuss the process through which, in certain cases, the Commission grants access to file through a “data room” procedure...|$|R
