5|$|Riparian {{vegetation}} {{is mostly}} found along the lower {{two-thirds of the}} Kootenay {{and many of the}} tributaries that join within the United States. The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low <b>nutrient</b> <b>content,</b> shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily where the river broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture.|$|E

40|$|Seasonal wetland (dambo) {{cultivation}} in smallholder farming {{areas is}} important because it improves household food security. However, most farming practices, such as burning of vegetation and conventional tillage in dambo gardens, may reduce soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient dynamics. We evaluated the effects of simulated burning, vegetation clearing and clipping, and conventional tillage in dambo gardens on SOC, <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> and biomass production over a 3 -year period. The results showed that clearing and clipping of vegetation and conventional tillage reduced SOC, soil <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> and biomass yields, while burning increased SOC and soil <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents.</b> For the 0 – 10 cm depth, conventional tillage, clearing and clipping resulted in a 37 %, 34 % and 18 % decrease in SOC, respectively, after three seasons, burning resulted in a 25 % increase in SOC, while there were no changes in the control after 3 years. For the 0 – 40 cm depth, the average change in SOC was 32 %, 25 % and 16 % for conventional tillage, clearing and clipping, respectively. Locally and regionally, conventional tillage, clearing and clipping reduce SOC, <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> and biomass production in dambos.

Six cultivars of 'Prata' banana were used as treatments, with five replicates and four plants per plot, arranged in a completely randomized design. Nutrient levels were evaluated based on laboratorial analysis and chlorophyll indices using a portable chlorophyll meter, in the third leaf from the apex to the base. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, calculating the correlations between leaf <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> and chlorophyll indices, and the regression equations were adjusted to the associations that were significant and with greater magnitude.
