25|$|The Mauryans {{were the}} first to {{establish}} a large empire spread across ancient India, with headquarters at Pataliputra (modern Patna), which was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> from Pundranagara. According to Ashokavadana, the Mauryan empire Ashoka issued an order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana after a non-Buddhist there drew a picture showing the Gautama Buddha bowing at the feet of Nirgrantha Jnatiputra. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed {{as a result of this}} order. The end of the Maurya rule around 185 BC was followed by a period of small kingdoms and chaos till the advent of the Guptas in the 4th century AD. Copper plates of the Gupta period mentioned their eastern division as Pundravardhana bhukti (bhukti being a territorial division). The Gupta Empire faced decline in the 6th century AD and the area may have fallen to the Tibetan king Sambatson in 567-79. Subsequently, Bengal was carved into two empires, Samatata in the east and Gauda in the west. There is mention of Pundravardhana being part of Gauda in certain ancient records. It was part of Shashanka’s kingdom in the 7th century AD.|$|E

[...] In 1906, Roger Fry {{gave it a}} well-documented restoration with overpaint removed. Fry {{was at the time}} Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum and performed restorations despite a formal lack of training; the St Francis was the second restoration he undertook. He attributed the work to Hubert van Eyck, and thought the Turin version a copy. His removal of a section at the top revealed a red border; he wrote that van Eyck had [...] "conceived it as a miniature in oil on panel, and that it might indicate a date <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> removed from the drawings of the Turin Book of Hours" [...] (Milan-Turin Hours). In 1926 he recorded: [...] "When it came to me, the panel was considerably larger at the top, and dull opaque sky concealed the join where the extra piece had been added on to satisfy some owner who did not appreciate the compressed composition [...] of the original. The sky had been enlivened... with a crowd of small white-cloud like forms suggesting the presence of a cohort of angels."

2500|$|The Smart Roadster and Roadster Coupé were {{introduced}} in 2003, based on a stretched platform of the Fortwo with a full length of 3427mm. The two variants {{are meant to be}} reminiscent of the British roadster of yore, such as the Triumph Spitfire or the MG B. Both the Roadster and Roadster Coupé are available with a removable Targa roof or an electrical softtop. The Roadster is powered by 45 or 60 kW (61 or 82 PS) versions of the turbocharged 698cc 3-cylinder Suprex engine in the rear, which is engineered by Mercedes-Benz. The Roadster Coupé has only the more powerful [...] engine. A steering wheel with Formula 1-style gearpaddles, to control the semi-automatic sequential transmission, is optional.
