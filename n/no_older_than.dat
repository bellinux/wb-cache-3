Although the limestone formed about 190million years ago, the cave itself is <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections of the cave that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance.|$|E

The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina.

5|$|Job for a Cowboy {{was founded}} in Glendale, Arizona, during December 2003 by vocalist Jonny Davy, guitarists Ravi Bhadriraju and Andrew Arcurio, bassist Chad Staples, and drummer Andy Rysdam when the band members were <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> 15 and 16. In 2004, they created a MySpace profile, posted songs online, and {{immediately}} began to connect with several worldwide fans. Later that year, Staples and Rysdam left Job for a Cowboy and were replaced by Brent Riggs and Elliott Sellers, respectively, as bassist and drummer. Traffic to the band's MySpace profile increased exponentially in late 2005 when the band released their first EP, Doom. The EP {{attracted the attention of}} Arizona independent label King of the Monsters, who distributed the disc after an initial self-released pressing by the band.|$|E
5|$|The agents later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives the agents permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he will talk to Chaco.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the aqueduct has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus' son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Espérandieu, writing in 1926, linked the {{construction of}} the aqueduct with Agrippa's visit to Narbonensis in that year. Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the Nîmes aqueduct, and coins discovered in the outflow in Nîmes are <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the reign of the emperor Claudius (41–54 AD). On this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the aqueduct must have been completed around the middle of the 1st century AD. It is believed to have taken about fifteen years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.|$|E

This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum is known for his strong and independent female characters.|$|E

25|$|In Transylvania, the Celts {{shifted from}} inhumation to cremation, either through natural {{progression}} {{or because of}} Dacian influence. Almost without exception, the necropoleis so far studied are bi-ritual, although cremation {{appears to be more}} prevalent than inhumation. The Celts in Dacia certainly cremated their dead from the second La Tène period onwards but Celtic inhumations appear <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> pit-grave cremations in any of the cemeteries. It is impossible to say whether the Celts turned away from the practice of cremation as the Scythians had. Although less frequent, inhumation still occurred as a constant practice even during the final stage of Celtic inhabitation of this territory.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} fortifications on Lisbon's Castelo hill {{are known to}} be <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the 2nd century BC, recent archaeological finds have shown that iron age people {{occupied}} the site from the 8th to 6th centuries BC. This indigenous settlement maintained commercial relations with the Phoenicians, which would account for the recent findings of Phoenician pottery and other material objects. Archaeological excavations made near the Castle of São Jorge (Castelo de São Jorge) and Lisbon Cathedral indicate a Phoenician presence at this location since 1200 BC, and it can be stated with confidence that a Phoenician trading post stood on a site now the centre of the present city, on the southern slope of the Castle hill.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{appears to}} have been used by the Early Neolithic populations of Lijiacun and Yunchanyan in China. Evidence of {{possible}} rice cultivation from ca. 11,500 BP has been found, however it is still questioned whether the rice was indeed being cultivated, or instead being gathered as wild rice. Bruce Smith, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., who has written on the origins of agriculture, says that evidence has been mounting that the Yangtze was probably the site of the earliest rice cultivation. In 1998, Crawford & Shen reported that the earliest of 14 AMS or radiocarbon dates on rice from at least nine Early to Middle Neolithic sites is <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> 7000 BC, that rice from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao sites indicates that rice domestication likely began before 5000 BC, but that most sites in China from which rice remains have been recovered are younger than 5000 BC.|$|E

25|$|All LDS {{young men}} are {{expected}} to serve a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission. Missionaries do not choose where they serve or the language in which they will proselytize, {{and are expected to}} fund their missions themselves or with the aid of their families. Prospective male missionaries must be at least 18 years old and <b>no</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> 25, not yet married, have completed secondary school, and meet certain criteria for physical fitness and spiritual worthiness. Missionary service is not compulsory, nor is it required for young men to retain their church membership. Unmarried women 19 years and older may also serve as missionaries, generally for a term of 18 months. However, the LDS Church emphasizes that women are not under the same expectation to serve as male members are, and may serve solely as a personal decision. There is no maximum age for missionary service for women. Prior to October 2012, the minimum age for full-time missionary service was generally 19 for men and 21 for women. Retired couples are encouraged to serve missions, and may serve for either 6-, 12-, 18-, or 23-month terms. Unlike younger missionaries, these senior missionaries may serve in non-proselytizing capacities such as humanitarian aid workers or family history specialists. Other men and women who desire to serve a mission, but {{may not be able to}} perform full-time service in another state or country due to health issues, may serve in a service mission. They might assist at Temple Square in Salt Lake City or aide in the seminary systems in schools. Many opportunities are available.|$|E
