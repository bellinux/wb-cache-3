40|$|Permanent {{establishment}} {{has been}} used as a principle or threshold to determine whether a country has taxing rights on the business profits of a <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> That threshold, however, has raised many questions in the context of e-commerce. Many countries are now concerned of how to determine permanent establishment in an e-commerce environment. Some view that the existing rule is insufficient to cope with e-commerce. This is because the existing tax rules were not designed in the era of e-commerce. Tax authorities are also concerned about the tax revenue loss, as there are no specific tax laws relating to permanent establishment in e-commerce. This study was conducted to solicit the perceptions of tax offices and tax practitioners on the criteria used to tax business profits in an e-commerce environment. This paper discusses how permanent establishment is determined in the conventional and e-commerce environments. The findings indicate that the existing tax threshold concerning permanent establishment is applicable in taxing e-commerce business profit, however, further amendments and changes should be incorporated to cater for e-commerce environment. The subjects also perceived that additional criteria should be included in the existing tax laws on permanent establishment to ensure tax treatment on e-commerce do not leave room for tax loss...|$|E

40|$|JUDr. Petr Kotáb International Aspects of Taxation in the Czech Republic SUMMARY Economic life of {{the current}} period is marked by high level of {{globalization}} {{of the economy and}} ever growing volume of cross-border flows of labor, goods, services and capital. In this situation, issues of international taxation affect not only sporadic cross-border transactions of selected types of subjects but virtually daily tax relations of large numbers of tax subjects, legal entities and individuals. Principles and regularities of international taxation are spreading in an ever growing extent into the intrastate level and are influencing the production of tax laws and everyday application practice of tax administrators. International aspects of taxation project into intrastate tax relations when there is a certain foreign element present in the tax relation. Such foreign element can show on the level of the subject of a tax relation (e. g. a <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> permanent establishment, etc.), or the object (e. g. foreign-sourced income), or as the case may be, the tax relation content (e. g. tax liability imposed by a foreign state and the necessity to reflect it in the inland for the purposes of prevention of double taxation, e. g. by a credit method). A foreign element in the tax relation usually indicates the danger of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|E-commerce {{provides}} {{a new way}} of conducting commercial transactions in today’s global market. E-commerce has made the world a one big marketplace. However, e-commerce also poses challenges to the existing tax rules in determining permanent establishment of businesses. Permanent establishment has been used as the criteria to determine whether a country has taxing rights on the business profits of a <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> Most tax experts view the current concept of permanent establishment as insufficient to cope with e-commerce, as it is seen to be more suitable for traditional business transactions rather than internet trading. This paper investigates the application of current tax laws in Malaysia on the determination of permanent establishment in an e-commerce environment. Implications of existing policy to establish the source of income in e-commerce are also explored. Interviews were conducted to solicit opinions of tax officers and tax professionals in Malaysia. The respondents agree that the criteria used to determine permanent establishment should be applicable to both types of transactions: conventional and e-commerce. However, the respondents perceived that additional criteria should be included to determine permanent establishment in e-commerce transactions and some modifications to its definition are necessary to suit the modern form of trading over the internet...|$|E
40|$|The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) {{appears to}} have been {{successful}} in convincing tax havens and countries with strict bank secrecy laws to exchange information on non-resident taxpayers, investors and businesses using their financial services. As at 18 August 2010, the OECD have confirmed that more than 320 Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) and 150 Double Taxation Conventions that incorporate the new transparency standards have been signed between OECD member countries and non-OECD member states since 2006. 1 While this situation may be good for tax administrators in the pursuit of their goal of maximising the collection of tax revenue, the main question examined in this paper is where does it leave the <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayer</b> and foreign investor in terms of their right to privacy and the right to maintain the confidentiality of their financial and banking details? The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has statutory powers that provide an extensive right to access information about a taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s dealings both within Australia and overseas. 2 ̆ 7 Operation Wickenby 2 ̆ 7, a joint operation between the ATO, the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police and a number of government agencies is trying to detect Australian taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s operating foreign bank accounts and evading income tax through the use of tax havens. 2 One of the major concerns about the exchange of information agreements is that tax authorities may be able to access information about their resident taxpayers without restriction and without the taxpayer being given the right to intervene or be consulted. This paper will commence with a brief examination of the existing rights that the domestic taxpayer possesses to maintain the confidentiality of their financial affairs, as well as the powers of the ATO to obtain information from taxpayers and third parties. The paper will then assess whether the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 model exchange of information agreements 2 ̆ 7 and the new Article 26 of the Double Taxation Agreements will adversely affect the rights that the taxpayer currently possesses...|$|E

40|$|The European Commission (EC) {{called on}} Austria to amend rules that require <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> to appoint fiscal representatives, since these rules {{discriminate}} {{on the grounds}} of nationality.

Should Austria refuse to change these rules, the EC will possibly initiate an infraction proceeding. Since Austria is not the only member state requiring a fiscal representative in certain cases, this request of the EC might well set a precedent. It is a pity though, that the EC did not substantiate their opinion that these rules violate EU-law. Especially since this supposed violation is not given, even though these rules distinguish between residents and non-residents.

40|$|In {{this article}} we wanted to achieve a {{comprehensive}} analysis of corporate profit tax for non-residents, {{from the standpoint of}} the issues that it creates on the double taxation of income and capital. Taxing the corporate profits of non-residents is a particularly important aspect in terms of revenue growth, encouraging foreign investment, and strengthening cross-border trade. The “source” state will decide the legitimate right to tax the profits of businesses that operate within its jurisdiction. Tax treaties do not impose limits on these types of taxing rights, other than those stemming from the obligation to impose profits, since the issue of taxation is “satisfied”. Moreover, the source of tax revenue belongs to the source state. Thus, we can see that it is unlikely that the state of residence of a <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayer</b> should want to “share” such tax revenue. It can be observed that the state of residence also has the right to tax the profits, but in general it gives credit in respect of taxes of the source state or deducts them for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of double taxation. If the state of residence provides a credit for taxes paid within the source state, taxes which have not been collected and owed to the source state will constitute a tax transfer to the state of residence, from which the taxpayer will not have any benefit. As regards Romania, in terms of the treatment of enterprises, this article represents a real quid pro quo, as it tackles both the international and national taxation of corporate profits, through the provisions found in the new Fiscal Code and the Code of Fiscal Procedure, as well as the new proposals on the taxation of turnover in companies, all of this extrapolated with the new proposals for turnover tax from IT giants. The article ends with the presentation, comment and analysis of a case of international double taxation, more specifically the taxation of corporate profits, a topic of great importance and current interest regarding jurisprudence in Romania, having the aim to observe, mutadis mutandis, the way in which business profits are taxed in practice. The conclusion of this article is intended as a genuine caveat to meet the needs of taxpayers and tax authorities on the need for such measures, both nationally and internationally, in terms of corporate profits, measures that have to take into account the international framework of the contemporary business environment, which is constantly changing and evolving...|$|E

40|$|On 13 March 2009 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{announced}} that Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland {{had agreed to}} introduce laws {{to allow for the}} exchange of information on tax evaders. The OECD has been actively trying to protect the national tax bases of its member states and this has now become an imperative with the global financial crisis and government deficits. The OECD 2 ̆ 7 s harmful tax competition project has been actively pursued for the past 12 years and appears to be receiving worldwide acceptance. On this basis it can be strongly argued that it now has the status of 2 ̆ 7 soft 2 ̆ 7 international law and appears to have all of the hallmarks of being part of the range of OECD initiatives that have been accepted as constituting international taxation law; such as the transfer pricing rules, Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules, and the model double tax agreement, to name just a few.

40|$|The main {{question}} raised {{in this thesis}} is whether tax havens and Offshore Financial Centre’s (OFCs) will survive in the new international legal environment. The conclusion supports the contention that tax havens will survive, although with a reduced volume of business. The main reasons for this conclusion are that tax havens do provide many legitimate uses for their banking and financial services that are used by foreign governments as well as individuals and Multi-National Enterprises (MNEs). The thesis then examines four subsidiary research questions that have a direct bearing on the survival of tax havens. The first question asks whether the international income of Australian residents should be taxed on a ‘worldwide’ or ‘territorial’ basis. The simple basis for this question was {{that if it was}} so difficult for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to detect Australian resident taxpayers that were using tax havens then why spend millions of dollars trying to achieve an almost impossible task. The research indicated that a territorial system of taxation was inherently inequitable. Therefore, the conclusion contended that the current Australian system was good in that it was equitable and yet exempted active foreign business income from further tax in Australia. The second subsidiary research question asked whether the OECD’s ‘harmful tax competition project’ was now part of the current international taxation law. In this context the issue was that if it is ‘soft’ international law {{is that one of the}} main reasons why many tax havens and OFCs were complying with the guidelines on transparency and exchange of information. This issue is important because many tax havens may not be able to convince their own Parliament to amend their bank secrecy laws. If the bank secrecy laws are not amended to allow for the exchange of information on <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> then tax havens and OFCs will continue to operate unfettered. The third subsidiary research question concerned the reason why the Australian government has deliberately blurred the distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion; the former being a legal activity and the later being unlawful. The conclusion was that one of the main reasons for the blurring of the distinction was to overcome any concerns on the part of tax havens and OFCs that all banking activities by Australian taxpayers constituted criminal conduct. This issue has implications for the future of tax havens and taxpayers wishing to use foreign banking services. The fourth subsidiary research question focuses on the rights of taxpayers that use tax havens and OFCs to hold their wealth when these nations are now entering into information exchange agreements (TIEAs). It became clear from the research that taxpayers are able to protect the confidentiality and privacy of their financial details only if they are able to show that the information is protected by legal professional privilege. The future of tax havens and OFCs is arguably dependent upon them being able to protect the confidentiality of <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> through their bank secrecy laws. This impacts on the survival of tax havens...|$|R
40|$|Professor Slemrod’s IFS annual lecture (2006) {{concerning}} recent fiscal {{development in}} the U. S. is an interesting, thoughtful piece of high level taxation theory. However, I believe a couple of remarks ought to be made here. One is that the lecture sounded somewhat “American” to the ears of a continental European tax scholar. The U. S. Supreme Court is increasingly committed towards defending individuals’ privacy rights, unlike its Europe counterparts. Some Buchanan’s wind blows all around. Furthermore, {{it is difficult to}} imagine that tax administrations, which in many countries are rather poor at performing the simplest everyday tasks, could be transformed into well-organised, efficiently run, Big Brother-like organisations. Professor Slemrod expects Oceania to be with us with a decade or two. However, in the long run, globalisation will constrain the modelling of tax systems to a far greater degree than it already does. Several forces are going to shape tax designs consisting of simple, barely progressive taxes, largely applied in a shedular way in the source countries,,while global income tax will be abandoned. all together. There is going to be an increase in the proportion of taxes based on the benefit principle. The restoration of the residence principle, and the rebuilding of a global, personalised income tax, could result from a rapid rise in the sharing of information among countries concerning revenue earned and taxes paid in different countries by the same tax payers. Back in 1999, Tanzi and Zee had already warned us that a country providing tax information on <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> would become a less attractive option in a world of increasing tax competition. Tanzi and Zee also produced a long list of factors which may make information-sharing ineffective. Similar conclusions were recently drawn by Keen and Ligthart (2006). ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty prescribe most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment. The right to MFN treatment concerns the issue whether taxpayers resident in one Member State can “cherry-pick” the most beneficial tax treaty available to other taxpayers. Two issues of fundamental impor-tance are {{examined in this}} thesis. First, whether a resident of a Member State (A) who receives income in another Member State (B), can claim from that state, the most beneficial tax treaty available to a resident of a third Member State (C). Second, whether a resident can claim from his state of residence (A), the same tax treatment as provided in a tax treaty concluded by his state of residence and another Member State (C), when this tax treaty provides better treatment in terms of avoiding double taxa-tion {{in the state of}} residence than the tax treaty applicable to the source of income (B). The ECJ has held that discrimination arises only through the application of different rules to comparable situations or the application of the same rule to different situa-tions. The current state of EC law prohibits unequal treatment of residents and non-residents as well as residents who have exercised their rights to free movement in comparison to residents who have not. The condition is that they must be considered to be in comparable situations and that there is no objective difference to justify the difference in treatment. The ECJ has so far not ruled on the MFN issue. It is there-fore uncertain as to whether Member States are obligated to treat; 1) different <b>non-resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> equally and, 2) whether Member States are prohibited from treat-ing their own residents differently when they exercise their rights to free movement in different Member States. This thesis identifies the requirements for the application of MFN treatment and ex-amines in which tax treaty provisions it is possible to apply MFN treatment. The ECJ, has in its case law, concluded that the application of tax treaties must be exer-cised in accordance EC law. It can be argued that a well-functioning internal market cannot allow bilateral tax treaties to provide preferential tax treatment to residents of one Member State, while denying it to residents of the remaining Member States. However, the application of MFN treatment could have far-reaching ramifications on the Member States’ existing tax treaty network. It is therefore fair to assume, as has been stated in other doctrinal opinions, that the ECJ will approach this issue care-fully when providing its interpretation on the matter...|$|R
