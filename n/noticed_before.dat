25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken dock worker, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had <b>noticed</b> <b>before,</b> managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Although {{statistically}} {{not significant}} enough sample size to be a nationwide projection, {{a study on}} 246 unrelated male individuals from eight provinces of three Argentinean regions using ancestry-sensitive DNA showed a large fraction of European genetic heritage in their Y-chromosomal (94.1%) and autosomal (78.5%) DNA, but their mitochondrial gene pool is mostly of Native American ancestry (53.7%); African heritage was small in all three genetic systems (<4%). Another clustering analyses performed on data from autosomal ancestry-sensitive SNPs – providing somewhat approximate representation of the bi-parentally inherited part of the genome – demonstrated a major European component (overall 78.5%) in the pooled Argentinean sample, whereas the Native American component (overall 17.3%) was lower but considerable, and the African component was very small (overall 4.1%). Despite this general trend in the genetic variation, {{it should be noted}} that analyses revealed a considerable genetic heterogeneity at the individual level, also <b>noticed</b> <b>before</b> in a smaller number of Argentinean samples. About 40% of the sampled individuals attained more than 90% of European ancestry, but the Native American proportion was as high as 80% (although this was observed only in a single individual). Such findings reflect the dynamics of the recent demographic history of the extant Argentinean population, indicating that individuals retaining a higher proportion of European ancestry could be descendants from the recent newcomers to the Argentinean population, whereas those with a higher amount of Native American admixture could be descendants from the first contact between the European and Amerindian populations, starting approximately 500 years ago.|$|E
500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973. [...] "Be Here Now" [...] {{appeared as}} the second track on side two of the original LP format, following what Rodriguez describes as the [...] "funky uptempo" [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)". It marked {{the first of four}} consecutive ballads on that side, which some music critics objected to at the time. Never a fan of Harrison's solo work, Robert Christgau would comment on the album: [...] "Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little man in my head who I never <b>noticed</b> <b>before,</b> have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the damned thing off during 'Be Here Now'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ryan Nakashima of Associated Press was {{generally}} {{impressed with the}} film's 4K resolution picture quality, though the visual-effects shots that comprised {{about a third of}} the movie were done in 2K resolution to save on cost and time. Nakashima commented [...] "I could see details I've never <b>noticed</b> <b>before</b> – the actors' tiny skin imperfections, or Smith's salt-and-pepper whiskers. In a distant shot of Smith's son Jaden running down a riverbed, I was struck by how many small rocks were defined clearly from such a distance. Yet other shots that included computer-generated cityscapes or otherworldly creatures looked less sharp." [...] The cinematographer Peter Suschitzky was apologetic about that, saying [...] "The movie is only half in true 4K. I'm sad about that. It still looks good.|$|E
