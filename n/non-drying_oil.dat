50|$|A {{semi-drying oil}} is an oil which {{partially}} hardens {{when it is}} exposed to air. This is {{as opposed to a}} to drying oil, which hardens completely, or a <b>non-drying</b> <b>oil,</b> which does not harden at all. Oils with an iodine number of 115-130 are considered semi-drying.|$|E
50|$|It is used {{to prevent}} {{climbing}} on objects such as lamp posts, walls and fences. It owes its effectiveness {{to the fact that}} it is based on a <b>non-drying</b> <b>oil</b> and keeps the surface greasy and slippery. As an additional advantage, it leaves its mark on the person touching it and hence makes it possible for intruders to be identified.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of Pastels. Pastels that are made of pigment {{particles}} bound together with a binding agent, and oil pastels that have pigments mixed with wax and <b>non-drying</b> <b>oil.</b> Pastels that are pigment particles bound together take on a more chalky and loose powdery characterization, and are secured to its supports using fixative or diluted resin in solution. Oil pastels never fully dry, and are sensitive to scrapes, dust and dirt.|$|E
50|$|Furniture oils are not {{recommended}} for maintenance {{as many of them}} contain linseed oil or other drying oils, and when used repeatedly will create a gummy, insoluble surface coating that darkens and obscures the grain of the wood. Other furniture polishes contain <b>non-drying</b> <b>oils</b> such as lemon oil, but attract and entrap dirt and grime. Silicone polishes are also {{not recommended}} as they leave a film that is difficult to remove and can interfere with future finish treatments.|$|R
40|$|Vegetablp oils are {{glycerides}} {{of organic}} acids {{and are usually}} classified according to their power of "setting" or "drying" when spread in thin films exposed to the air on plates of non-absorbent material such as glass. Three main groups are recognized: <b>non-drying</b> <b>oils,</b> e. g. olive oil; semi-drying oils, e. g. cotton-eeed. oil; and drying oils, e. g. linseedoil.

40|$|Iodine {{value is}} defined as the number of centigrams of iodine per gram of oil sample. Drying {{property}} of fatty oils mainly depends on the type of unsaturated fatty acids and relative amounts of each type of fatty acid in a unit weight of oil. Iodine value of fatty oil is a quantitative measure of unsaturation and hence fatty oils are categorized into drying oil, semidrying <b>oil</b> and <b>non-drying</b> based on iodine value. Fatty oils with iodine value above 150 mgg-l are called drying oils and iodine value in between 150 mgg-l and 120 mgg-l are semi drying oils, whereas fatty oils having iodine values below 120 mgg' are classified as <b>non-drying</b> <b>oils...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Oil pastel (also called wax oil crayon) is a {{painting}} and drawing medium with characteristics similar to pastels and wax crayons. Unlike [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "Japanese" [...] pastel sticks, {{which are made}} with a gum or methyl cellulose binder, oil pastels consist of pigment mixed with a <b>non-drying</b> <b>oil</b> and wax binder. The surface of an oil pastel painting is therefore less powdery, but more difficult to protect with a fixative. Oil pastels provide a harder edge than [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "French" [...] pastels but {{are more difficult to}} blend.|$|E
40|$|Considering {{palm oil}} as <b>non-drying</b> <b>oil</b> owing to its low iodine value, an attempt {{was taken to}} {{increase}} the unsaturation in the fatty acid chains of palm oil for the preparation of alkyds. To increase the unsaturation in the palm oil, sulphuric acid (SA) and para-toluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) was used prior to alcoholysis for the dehydration process. The iodine number of the oil samples was checked for the unsaturation measurement by Wijs method. Alkyd resin was prepared using the dehydrated palm oil by following alcoholysis and esterification reaction. To improve the film properties 0. 5 wt. ...|$|E

Soxhlet extraction of the oils from the powdered seeds using n-hexane gave 3. 63 % and 10. 40 % yields for Avocado and African Pear respectively. Proximate analysis and chemical {{characterization of the}} seed oils were carried out using standard procedures according to the American Oil Chemist Society (AOCS) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The fatty acid compositions of the oils were obtained by Gas Chromatography. It showed that oleic and stearic acids are the most abundant unsaturated and saturated fatty acids respectively in both oils. Marginal differences were observed in the iodine and peroxide values of the oils. Chemical characteristics of the oils gave iodine values of 38. 35 mqI 2 /g for Avocado oil and 32. 26 mqI 2 /g for African Pear oil, both results suggestive of <b>non-drying</b> <b>oils.</b> Similarly, peroxide values of 45 meq/kg and 30 meq/kg were obtained for the seed oils respectively.

50|$|Traditional {{oil paints}} require an oil that always hardens, forming a stable, {{impermeable}} film. Such oils are called siccative, or drying, oils, and {{are characterized by}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. One common measure of the siccative property of oils is iodine number, the number of grams of iodine one hundred grams of oil can absorb. Oils with an iodine number greater than 130 are considered drying, those with an iodine number of 115-130 are semi-drying, and those with an iodine number of less than 115 are <b>non-drying.</b> Linseed <b>oil,</b> the most prevalent vehicle for artists' oil paints, is a drying oil.|$|R
50|$|Alkyd {{coatings}} {{are typically}} sold in three classes: long, medium, and short. These terms represent the oil length in the resin.Alkyds are also modified with phenolic resin, styrene, vinyl toluene, acrylic monomers (to make them dry more quickly), and polyurethanes. By adding certain modifying resins, {{it is possible}} to produce thixotropic alkyds for decorative use. The latest alkyds are short oil A/D resins where the oil length is shortened by chain stopping with benzoic acid and now para-tert-butylbenzoic acid (Alkydal M 48), these have a better controlled molecular weight distribution and better durability. Alkyds for decorative use have extra oil cooked in to lengthen them and to make them more durable. Short oil resins used in stoving enamels are made from <b>non-drying</b> saturated <b>oils</b> or fatty acids. These usually have much higher hydroxyl and acid values, to be able to react with the hydroxyl groups of the amino resins. These mixtures are usually stabilized with amines to prevent gelling on storage.|$|R
40|$|The high costs, the {{environmental}} impact and the decrease of fossil resources have intensified the global need for alternative raw material in different industrial fields. Palm oil (PO) was chosen for this study in view of its abundance and renewability. The viability of synthesizing an air drying alkyd resin through the polymerization of <b>non-drying</b> palm <b>oil</b> (PO) was studied. The oil was first analyzed to examine the physico-Chemical properties (iodine value, viscosity, refractive index, acid value, and specific gravity) and subsequently neutralized and dehydrated. The alkyd resin synthesis involves reduction of the triglycerides by alcoholysis to obtain palm oil monoglycerides (POMG) at 240 oC, followed by functional group modification with phthalic anhydride via plyesterification at 250 oC. FT-IR was used to detect the chemical structure of ester links present from the condensation polymerization reaction. Physico-chemical properties of the polyester were studied in terms of drying speed, solubility, chemical resistant, adhesion and abrasion resistant. The result obtained showed that the polyester based on palm oil have high drying speed in presence of drying agent, exhibit excellent adhesion which indicates better protection of the substrate, and very promising in paint formulation...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} clearly {{demonstrated}} {{the applicability of}} RSM in selecting extraction conditions for gmelina oil from its seed. This approach has not only resulted in the maximum oil yield through solvent extraction, but has also guaranteed the fulfillment of the properties requirements of the gmelina oil. The optimum values for yield show {{that it is an}} economic source of oil, the low saponification value means {{that it is not a}} good ingredient for soap making. The oil is very saturated and can hardly be used for paint making but when combined with other substances it can be used as a finishing agent. Time, seed particle size, temperature, solvent volume, have various effects on the yield of oil. The validation experiments and their accompany quality characteristics were not significantly different from the simulated values at P <  0.05. From spectroscopic results, it can be concluded that gmelina seed oil can be used as a source of biodiesel due to its specific gravity and saturated nature. Moreover, as a <b>non-drying</b> <b>oil,</b> it can also find variant uses in the process industry mainly when combined with some resins and compounds.|$|E
30|$|Ricinoleic acid was {{detected}} in two samples, both red paints (Ripolin rouge de Chine HP 016 and HP 030). These paints also showed unidentified components with an anthraquinone structure suggestive of an organic pigment (positively identified as PR 83, alizarin red, with Raman spectroscopy) [19, 39]. Ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated hydroxy C 18 fatty acid, is a characteristic bio-marker for castor oil. This oil {{is considered a}} slow- or <b>non-drying</b> <b>oil</b> as it is composed {{of as much as}} 95  % ricinoleic acid, with only a few percent each of oleic and linoleic acids [43]. Surprisingly, it was considered a suitable painting medium by Doerner [13], although viscous and remaining wet for a long time; other authors recommended that it be mixed with better drying oils such as linseed [29]. It is not clear at this time whether the presence of castor oil is related to the specific formulation of the Ripolin red color or to the manufactory of a specific batch of paint at a certain point in time. For example, Dredge [15] in a study of Ripolin paints used by Sidney Nolan in the context of Australian house paint production mentions castor oil as a cheap alternative to linseed oil when imports to Australia from India ceased because of World War II. Erucic acid (a monounsaturated C 22 fatty acid) {{was detected}} at low levels in Ripolin samples HP 087 (gris perle foncé), HP 013 (bleu outremer), and HP 089 (bleu turquoise). This compound is characteristic of Brassicaceae oils such as rapeseed [14], and has been observed in oil-based paints used by other 20 th century artists such as Lucio Fontana [21,  55]. It may indicate the presence of this type of oil in the paint formulation as an additive or adulterant.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{synthesis}} of oxy-polymerizable alkyd from <b>non-drying</b> palm kernel <b>oil</b> was studied. Three alkyd resins of medium oil length were prepared using phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and glycerol at stipulated ratios. The prepared alkyd resins were copolymerized with styrene using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as the free radical generator at 150 °C for 3 h. The styrenated alkyds and palm kernel oil-modified alkyds were all characterized for their physico-chemical properties following standard methods. The styrenated and unstyrenated alkyds were tested for drying schedule, solubility, adhesion, abrasion resistance and chemical resistance. All the resins showed good properties. The styrenated alkyds gave faster drying time, better adhesion, abrasion resistance, and chemical resistance. Unlike the unstyrenated alkyd {{which was only}} resistant to water, brine, and acidic media, the styrenated alkyds were also resistant to alkalis. Structural elucidation of the raw materials and their copolymers was done with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and GC–MS instrumental technique. It can be concluded that styrenated alkyds offer improved potential applications in surface coating purposes...|$|R
40|$|During the 20 th century, many {{innovative}} binders {{have been}} rapidly {{introduced to the}} art world and soon became popular as artists’ paints and pictorial media. However, despite the advantages that new synthetic materials presented, oil paints have never been entirely substituted. Indeed, this paper focuses on the results provided by the scientific analysis of a group works from the oeuvre of Lucio Fontana (1899 – 1968), all of which created between 1960 and 1964 using oil-based media, and aims to illustrate how oils contained in the pictorial media have influenced these works’ respective ageing and degradation processes. Despite the apparent coherence in the behaviour of many of Fontana's creations, some artworks revealed discrepancies {{in terms of the}} physical and mechanical behaviour of the pictorial films and in alterations resulting from degradation processes. Samples taken from case studies belonging to the Olii and Fine di Dio series were analysed using optical microscopy, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) in order to study and identify the materials employed by the artist and the products of their degradation processes. These analyses gave unexpected but useful results (such as the presence of <b>non-drying</b> or slow-drying <b>oils</b> in the paint formulations) which not only provided us with new insight into the nature of the constituent materials, but also facilitated the elaboration of correct conservation measures and suitable restoration interventions...|$|R
