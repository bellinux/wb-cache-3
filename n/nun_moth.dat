5000|$|Buch is Kirchseeon’s oldest {{constituent}} community, {{having had}} its first documentary mention in 809. In 842, {{a place called}} Sevun was mentioned for the first time. The name Chirichsewe {{first appeared in the}} 14th century. Until Secularization, the Ebersberg Monastery maintained a small branch monastery in Kirchseeon. The community grew quickly once the surrounding woodlands fell victim to a natural disaster in 1889 {{in the form of a}} <b>nun</b> <b>moth</b> infestation. The Royal Bavarian Railway decided to make use of the denuded woods by building a sleeper works at Kirchseeon in 1889 and 1890. In 1939, the community of Kirchseeon was formed out of the former community of Eglharting, which itself had been formed in 1818. Its constituent communities were the villages of Buch and Kirchseeon-Dorf as well as the hamlets of Forstseeon, Osterseeon, Neukirch, Ilching and Riedering. At the same time, the church was promoted to a parish curacy. In 1959, the community itself was raised to market town. Since Eglharting’s population had risen so sharply, the new [...] "Erlöserkirche" [...] (“Church of the Redeemer”) was consecrated there in 1973. In 1974, a new town hall was completed.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyze}} actual {{state of the}} <b>nun</b> <b>moth</b> (Lymantria monacha L.) in the Brdy region in the year 2015. The main {{objective}} was to determine its population density. For the research several sites were selected in which three monitoring methods were used: adhesive tree bands, dropping method and pheromone-baited traps. The results revealed that the <b>nun</b> <b>moth</b> only occurs in the forest in minimal numbers. Another objective was to evaluate colour forms of moths and determine connection between colour forms of caterpillars and moths. For the lack of captured caterpillars no results were acquired. The majority of moths caught on pheromone-baited traps had gray colouring and {{relatively small number of}} moths (21 %) had basic (white) colouring...|$|E
40|$|Asian gypsy and <b>nun</b> <b>moth</b> {{introductions}} {{into the}} United States, possibly arriving on imported Siberian coniferous logs, threaten domestic forests and product markets {{and could have}} global market consequences. We simulate, using the Global Forest Products Model (a spatial equilibrium model of the world forest sector), the consequences under current policies of a wide-spread, successful pest invasion, and of plausible trading partner responses to the successful invasion. We find that trade liberalization would have a negligible effect on U. S. imports of Siberian logs and, consequently, on {{the risk of a}} pest invasion. But, if it happened, possibly through trade in other commodities, a successful and widespread pest invasion would have large effects on producers and consumers over the period 2002 to 2030.

40|$|Sexual {{communication}} of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), <b>nun</b> <b>moth,</b> L. monacha (L.), pink gypsy moth, L. mathura (M.), and fumida tussock moth, L. fumida (B.) {{is known to}} be mediated by pheromones. Data presented here show that sonic and visual signals are also involved. Sound produced by flying male L. dispar induced wing-fluttering and motion in conspecific females that may guide males to their micro-location. Analyses of sounds produced by wing fanning L. monacha, L. mathura, and L. fumida revealed species- and sex-specific wing beat and associated click frequencies that may contribute to reproductive isolation or close-range communication. Evidence for close-range communication in these lymnatriids includes (i) scanning electron micrographs of functional metathoracic tympanate ears, (ii) attraction of male L. monacha and L. fumida to speakers playing back sound signals from conspecific females, and (iii) laser interferometry demonstrating particular sensitivity of tympana to frequency components of conspecific sound signals...|$|E
40|$|Multispecies sex {{pheromone}} trapping (trapping of {{more than}} one species in the same trap) for the pine shoot moth Rhyacionia buoliana, the pine moth, Dendrolimus pini, the <b>nun</b> <b>moth,</b> Lymantria monacha, the pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea and the pine sawflies Diprion pini and Neodiprion sertifer was evaluated. The catch from traps baited with the pheromone of a single species was compared with the catch from traps baited with pheromones for several species. The catch in the multispecies traps was significantly reduced in comparison with the single species traps for Dendrolimus pini, L. monacha and N. sertifer. Neodiprion sertifer was most likely inhibited by the Diprion pini pheromone. A follow-up study of Dendrolimus pini and L. monacha showed no pheromonal interference between them. Further studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of multispecies monitoring. However, for practical applications a slight decrease in catch, due to pheromonal interference, could probably be tolerated as long as the catch reflects total population density...|$|E
40|$|Gypsy moth {{is a major}} pest in Europe and North America. The {{closely related}} species, <b>nun</b> <b>moth,</b> is also a {{destructive}} pest in Europe. Both species use the pheromone cis 7 (R), 8 (52 ̆ 7) - 2 -methyl- 7, 8 -epoxyoctadecane, (+) -disparlure, for sexual communication. The alkene precursor of disparlure, 2 -methyl- 7 (Z) -octadecene, and (-) -disparlure are also of biological importance in both species. In this thesis I describe the metabolic fate of 2 -methyl- 7 (Z) -octadecene, (+) - disparlure and (-) -disparlure in the gypsy moth. Unexpectedly, I found that the incubation these odorants with moth extracts stimulates the formation of methyl and ethyl esters of linoleic and oleic acid. I hypothesize that the incubated compounds are degraded into smaller unit s and t hese units a re t hen inc orporated int o t he b iosynthesis o f o leic and linoleic acids. These fatty acids are then mterified into their corresponding fatty esters. The formation of these fatty esters fiom the incubated substrates is NADPH and FAD dependent...|$|E
40|$|Egg {{masses of}} tussock moths are {{frequently}} intercepted at the border, most commonly on imported used vehicles. These have been {{assumed to be}} of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae). However, there are six other Lymantriid pest species with similar indiscriminate oviposition and overwintering behaviour that are considered to have the potential to reach New Zealand. Unfortunately there is no accurate record of what arrives, as early immature life stages of tussock moths cannot be reliably identified morphologically to the species level. A molecular diagnostic system was therefore adopted for the identification of all interceptions. During the period 2000 – 2002, 151 specimens were intercepted on used vehicles from Japan and one on a vehicle from the USA. Of these 82 % were identified as gypsy moth, 2 % were other high-risk species (<b>nun</b> <b>moth,</b> L. monacha, and white spotted tussock moth, Orgyia thyellina), 6 % were unknown species and 10 % had no detectable DNA.

40|$|The lymantriid forest defoliators, Lymantria monacha L. (<b>nun</b> <b>moth)</b> and Lymantria dispar L. (gypsy moth) are {{particularly}} severe pests {{in other countries}} in the world, but the ability of these moths to utilise and complete development on Pinus radiata D. Don had never been established. In laboratory trials, colonies of central European L. monacha and Russian far east (flight capable) L. dispar were fed on foliage from three mature P. radiata trees originating from three different advanced-selection families from New Zealand. The results showed that both moths were capable ofcompleting their development from egg to adult on these families of P. radiata. However, P. radiata was a less suitable host for development ofL. dispar than Quercus velutina Lam. (black oak), as evidenced by higher mortality and slower growth. Lymantria monacha developed faster and survived better on P. radiata than it did on mature foliage of Picea glauca (Moench) Voss. Neonate L. monacha larvae favoured male pine cones from Pinus strobus L. as a food source, but when these were absent did complete their development on P. radiata needles. There was no difference in larval development between those on the thre...|$|E
40|$|Plant-insect {{interactions}} are a wide and diverse field of study. Abiotic and biotic factors influence the dynamic interaction between plants and their insect herbivores. Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth), Lymantria monacha (<b>nun</b> <b>moth)</b> and Tortrix viridana (green leaf oak roller) are important forest pest species. Not much {{is known about}} the extent of genetic diversity within and among these insect populations in comparison to the respective host trees. The main focus of this thesis is the genetic basis of adaptation of tree-feeding insect larvae in the genus Lymantria and Tortrix to their host trees. Gene expression at the mRNA level of insect larvae feeding on different tree species was analysed, and similarly gene expression in the host trees undergoing herbivory in the field was measured. Gene diversity at the genomic DNA level was assessed in a population genetic study of one Lymantria species. As part of an EU project (EVOLTREE - Evolution of Trees as Drivers of Terrestrial Biodiversity) patterns of adaptation were evaluated by using different molecular and ecological techniques. In general a diverse mixture of techniques and methodologies was used to generate new genetic information on plant-insect interactions. Digestive adaptations in the insects were identified from the herbivory laboratory studies and the host plant responses were identified in the field study. The cDNA-AFLP technique enabled the combination and challenge of field and laboratory experiments to be met and produced a detailed overview in respect of defense strategies {{on both sides of the}} interaction...|$|E
40|$|Biotic stress by mass {{outbreaks}} of defoliating pest insects does not only affect tree performance by reducing its photosynthetic capacity, but also changes N cycling {{in the soil}} of forest ecosystems. However, how insect induced defoliation affects soil N fluxes and, in turn, tree N nutrition is not well-studied. In the present study, we quantified N input and output fluxes via dry matter input, throughfall, and soil leachates. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of mass insect herbivory on tree N acquisition (i. e., organic and inorganic 15 N net uptake capacity of fine roots) as well as N pools in fine roots and needles in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest over an entire vegetation period. Plots were either infested by the <b>nun</b> <b>moth</b> (Lymantria monacha L.) or served as controls. Our results show an increased N input by insect feces, litter, and throughfall at the infested plots compared to controls, as well as increased leaching of nitrate. However, the additional N input into the soil did not increase, but reduce inorganic and organic net N uptake capacity of Scots pine roots. N pools in the fine roots and needles of infested trees showed an accumulation of total N, amino acid-N, protein-N, and structural N in the roots and the remaining needles as a compensatory response triggered by defoliation. Thus, although soil N availability was increased via surplus N input, trees did not respond with an increased N acquisition, but rather invested resources into defense by accumulation of amino acid-N and protein-N as a survival strategy...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change will}} affect forests in Germany {{through the end}} of this century. The impacts of climate change on forest productivity, water budget and the {{associated}} biotic and abiotic risks are relevant for the forestry sector and its decision makers. We analysed the possible impacts of climate change on Germany’s forests using a variety of climate scenarios generated with the regional statistical climate model STARS and the process-based forest growth model  4 C. The focus of our analyses was on mono-specific stands of the main tree species Norway spruce (Picea abies L.  Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), oak (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea Liebl.), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). The impacts on net primary production of forest stands are mainly positive for needle tree species and more negative at low elevation, water-limited sites for broadleaved tree species like beech, which is in contrast to the overall tendency of deterioration of the annual percolation rates independent of tree species. The application of a fire danger index and a <b>nun</b> <b>moth</b> risk species index according to Zwölfer indicates that Germany’s forests will experience, under the warmer and dryer climate described by RCP 8. 5, higher potential risks from fire and some specific pest species. An integrated evaluation reflecting the potentials and risks of forests under RCP 8. 5 for the German natural regions illustrates that the dryer (water-limited) low elevated regions reaching from southwestern to northeastern Germany will benefit less from the assumed climate change than regions in the Northwest and forest sites at higher altitudes, which are mainly temperature limited...|$|E
40|$|The insecticidal {{activity}} and receptor binding properties of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry 1 A toxins towards the forest pests Thaumetopoea pityocampa (processionary moth) and Lymantria monacha (<b>nun</b> <b>moth)</b> were investigated. Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ab, and Cry 1 Ac were highly toxic (corresponding 50 % lethal concentration values: 956, 895, and 379 pg/μl, respectively) to first-instar T. pityocampa larvae. During larval development, Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac toxicity decreased with increasing age, although {{the loss of}} activity was more pronounced for Cry 1 Ab. Binding assays with 125 I-labelled Cry 1 Ab and brush border membrane vesicles from T. pityocampa first- and last-instar larvae detected a remarkable decrease in the overall Cry 1 Ab binding affinity in last-instar larvae, although saturable Cry 1 Ab binding to both instars was observed. Homologous competition experiments demonstrated the loss {{of one of the}} two Cry 1 Ab high-affinity binding sites detected in first-instar larvae. Growth inhibition assays with sublethal doses of Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ab, and Cry 1 Ac in L. monacha showed that all three toxins were able to delay molting from second instar to third instar. Specific saturable binding of Cry 1 Ab was detected only in first- and second-instar larvae. Cry 1 Ab binding was not detected in last-instar larvae, although specific binding of Cry 1 Aa and Cry 1 Ac was observed. These results demonstrate a loss of Cry 1 Ab binding sites during development on the midgut epithelium of T. pityocampa and L. monacha, correlating in T. pityocampa with a decrease in Cry 1 Ab toxicity with increasing age...|$|E
