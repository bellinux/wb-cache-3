5|$|Few storms formed this season, but it {{was very}} eventful. Twelve {{tropical}} cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar.|$|E

5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In {{the eastern half}} of the <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>ocean</b> and north Indian ocean, the formation of a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E

Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of all Pacific typhoons {{that have}} had their names retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency. A total of 38typhoon names have been retired since the start of {{official}} tropical cyclone naming in the western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> in 2000. Tropical cyclone names are retired by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in a meeting in January or February. Those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms. Several names were removed or altered naming list for various reasons other than retirement. Collectively, retired typhoons have caused over $68billion in damage (USD), as well as over 12,000deaths.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Two-E was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico. It {{was the only}} cyclone during the month in the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> forming on June3 from a tropical wave. The depression initially moved northeastward, threatening the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero with a potential of it attaining tropical storm status. It remained a tropical depression, weakening due to land interaction and wind shear, and on June5 it dissipated just off the coast. Rainfall from the depression peaked at 19.1inches (486mm) in Acapulco, which resulted in mudslides and flooding. A total of 42houses were flooded, and 72people were forced {{to leave their homes}} due to the storm; no deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|Two {{subspecies}} of walrus {{are widely}} recognized: the Atlantic walrus, O. r. rosmarus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the Pacific walrus, O. r. divergens (Illiger, 1815). Fixed genetic {{differences between the}} Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated at 500,000 and 785,000 years ago. These dates coincide with the hypothesis derived from fossils that the walrus evolved from a tropical or subtropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic. From there, it presumably recolonized the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> during high glaciation periods in the Pleistocene via the Central American Seaway.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the impetus to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined. It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E

5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover from the <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{than the rest}} of the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
5|$|During the El Niño of 1991–92, as typical {{with other}} such events, the monsoon trough {{extended}} {{into the central}} <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> which is the body of water between the International Date Line and 140°W. At the same time, sea surface temperatures near the equator were anomalously warm, and wind shear values were low. At the end of January, a large area of convection persisted for several days near {{the north side of}} the equator. By January 23, several ships reported squalls and strong southwesterly winds in the region. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the system on January 26, while it was located about 950miles (1530km) south of Ka Lae, the southernmost point in Hawaii. The disturbance organized further as it tracked westward, and on January 28 it developed into Tropical Depression One-C, located a short distance north of Kiritimati and east of Tabuaeran.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ioke {{became one}} of five hurricanes to reach Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in the Central <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> {{and the only one}} {{originating}} in the basin. With an estimated minimum central pressure of 915mbar (27.019inHg), the cyclone attained the lowest estimated surface pressure for any hurricane within the basin, surpassing the previous minimum set by Hurricane Gilma in 1994. Ioke maintained at least Category4 status for 198consecutive hours, which was the longest continuous time period at that intensity ever observed for any tropical cyclone anywhere on Earth. Additionally, the cyclone remained at the equivalence of a super typhoon for 174consecutive hours, which was also a record. As a result of its extended duration and intensity, Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke accrued an Accumulated cyclone energy index of 82, which set a new worldwide record.|$|E

5|$|This season had a {{quick start}} but a slow end. Overall {{activity}} was below average, with twelve named systems in total. Of these, five were tropical storms, seven were hurricanes, of which three were major (Category 3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale). Just one storm formed in August, {{one of the least}} active Augusts ever in the east Pacific. The season officially started May 15, 1973, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1973, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1973. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> often off the coast of Mexico. As is usual in the northern hemisphere, most traveled generally westward or northwestward, and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Vera {{developed}} on September20 between Guam and Chuuk State, and initially tracked westward {{before taking a}} more northerly course, reaching tropical storm strength the following day. By this point Vera had assumed a more westerly direction of movement and had begun to rapidly intensify, and reached its peak intensity on September23 with maximum sustained winds equivalent {{to that of a}} modern-day Category5 hurricane. With little change in strength, Vera curved and accelerated northward, resulting in a landfall on September26 near Shionomisaki on Honshu. Atmospheric wind patterns caused the typhoon to briefly emerge into the Sea of Japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore Honshu for a second time. Movement over land greatly weakened Vera, and after reentering the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> later that day, Vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September27; these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across South America and the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the wave entered the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> on June 1. A low-level circulation developed on June 2, while it was about 230miles (370km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side. Early on June 5, satellite imagery suggested that a tropical depression was forming in the northwest Gulf of Mexico, which was furthered by reports of wind gusts as high as 60mph (95km/h) just a few hundred feet above the surface, towards {{the east side of the}} system.|$|E
50|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, objects {{moving across}} {{or above the}} surface of the Earth tend to turn to the right because of the {{coriolis}} effect. As a result, large-scale horizontal flows of air or water tend to form clockwise-turning gyres. These are best seen in ocean circulation patterns in the North Atlantic and <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>oceans.</b>|$|R

5|$|On August 26, the {{tropical}} cyclone {{that was once}} Hurricane Ilsa degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area, about 1,200miles (1,950km) west of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The remnants of Ilsa drifted northwestward through the stratocumulus cloud field of the eastern <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> At the same time, a mid-tropospheric trough slowly intensified while gradually undergoing cyclogenesis to develop into a cold-core upper-level low. Early on August 31, a low-level circulation formed within the upper-level low about 930 miles (1,500 km) northeast of Hawaii; at that time, the circulation and the remnants of Ilsa were located within 370 miles (600 km) of each other. The cold-core low rapidly intensified as convection increased, and late on August 31 it absorbed the remnants of Ilsa, which influenced the development of the system. Convection steadily organized as it tracked westward, and it is estimated it transitioned into a subtropical depression by 18:00 UTC on September 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Kenneth are {{believed}} to have been from a tropical wave that crossed Central America into the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> on September 9. The system tracked westward within the Intertropical Convergence Zone — a belt of thunderstorm activity across the eastern Pacific Ocean — and on September 13 its associated thunderstorm activity began showing signs of organization. Despite being located only 625miles (1010km) east-southeast of the larger Tropical Depression Ten, the National Hurricane Center remarked the potential for further development of the system; as the depression was further west and moving faster than the system, little interference from Jova was anticipated. The system organized further, and at 1800UTC on September 14 the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Eleven about 900miles (1450km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The depression maintained a general westward track throughout its entire duration, due to the subtropical ridge to its north.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression continued drifting north-northeastward, {{and failed to}} strengthen significantly. It turned to the west on December 1, due {{to the presence of}} a strong anticyclone to its north with a ridge extending westward past the International Date Line. On December 2, based on satellite estimates, the CPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Paka while located about 1000km (625mi) south-southeast of Johnston Atoll. Due to the presence of high clouds across the area, forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation. After becoming a tropical storm, Paka remained nearly stationary for about two days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest. It steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures, and on December 3 the storm attained winds of 105km/h (65mph). The next day, however, it encountered dry air and began weakening; by December 6, the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12hours. Subsequently, Paka began to re-intensify, and on December 7 the storm crossed the International Date Line into the western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> with winds of 80km/h (50mph).|$|E
