500|$|Russell, {{a fan of}} English indie pop band The xx, {{proposed}} the idea of remixing I'm <b>New</b> <b>Here</b> to the band's percussionist and producer Jamie xx. Russell's production on I'm <b>New</b> <b>Here</b> was heavily influenced by the xx's self-titled debut album, which showcased Jamie xx's bassy, beat-oriented and minimalist production. LP - Gil Scott-Heron and Jamie xx]. Insound. Retrieved on 2011-07-28. After its success, Jamie xx had occupied himself with solo production work, remixing other artists, and DJing in clubs in the United Kingdom and Europe. He was a longtime fan of Scott-Heron's music, which had been introduced {{to him by his}} parents as a youth. Russell later said of his decision to enlist him, [...] "We didn't want lots of remixes by different people. That can be confusing. Gil was open to Jamie re-interpreting the whole album". According to Jamie xx, he himself had no point of reference in remixing another artist's album, and later said of taking on the project, [...] "It was a bit nerve-wracking because {{this is the first time}} I've ever done an album on my own. But I was really just eager to get at and I knew exactly what I wanted to do".|$|E
500|$|Following an {{exhausting}} tour, the xx {{went on a}} break. The band's {{producer and}} percussionist Jamie Smith pursued electronic dance styles on other musical projects, creating remixes for Radiohead, Adele, and Florence and the Machine. He also collaborated on Gil Scott-Heron's 2011 album We're <b>New</b> <b>Here,</b> and produced Drake's 2012 song [...] "Take Care". The latter exemplified and helped popularise the xx's sound as well. A novice to DJing when starting out with the xx, he subsequently learned its technical aspects and developed a grasp on controlling the crowd through unexpected silences and drops during his live sets.|$|E
