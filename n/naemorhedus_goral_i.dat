40|$|Gorals {{belong to}} family Bovidae and Genus <b>Naemorhedus.</b> Himalayan <b>goral</b> (<b>Naemorhedus</b> <b>goral)</b> {{is one of}} three species of goral, one sub-species, the Grey <b>goral</b> (<b>Naemorhedus</b> <b>goral</b> goral) occurs in Pakistan. It is {{classified}} as Near Threatened globally (IUCN Red List) and Vulnerable in Pakistan. This subspecies is threatened primarily by illegal hunting and competition with livestock, resulting in small and fragmented populations in its current distribution range in Pakistan. Machiara National Park (MNP) falls under distribution range of grey goral in Azad Jammu and Kashmir where the present study was conducted. The objectives of the study were to determine distribution range of grey goral in the park in order to assess habitat use, population density, diet composition and grazing pressure in grey goral habitat in MNP, so that its current population status and the extent adverse impacts of grazing pressure could be assessed. Grey goral was found distributed in two sites of MNP, Machiara and Sarli Sacha on the basis of reconnaissance survey and secondary information from park staff and local people. I conducted vegetation survey in which 42 plant species were recorded in grey goral habitat in MNP. At Machiara, by vegetation sampling 40 plant species were identified, whereas at Serli Sacha only 17 plant species were recorded. At Machiara, grey goral inhabited areas between 1970 m and 2600 m elevation during winter and 2400 m and 2900 m in summer. At Serli Sacha, it occupied areas between 1970 m and 2200 m during winter and 2600 m and 2800 m during summer. During both seasons, south and southeast-facing slopes at Machiara and at Serli Sacha were used by goral relatively more frequently than other aspects. Both at Machiara and Serli Sacha, grey goral were most commonly found on moderate (30 - 40 °) slopes during winter but on steeper (40 - 60 °) slopes during summer. The vegetation type most preferred by grey goral was herbs and grasses (Ivlev Electivity Index (IEI) = 0. 14), followed by shrubs (IEI = 0. 03), while trees were avoided (IEI= - 0. 54). The overall mean population density of grey goral in MNP was 2. 66 individuals / km² based on visual scans. The range of encounter rate (No. /Scan) was 0. 00 to 2. 9. The population density of grey goral in Machiara site was higher (4. 57 / km²) than Serli Sacha site (0. 76 /km²). The minimum herd size recorded was two while maximum herd size was six.

We used slope and ruggedness of the terrain, forest type and distance to the nearest village to construct habitat suitability maps for three mountain ungulates (barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), Himalayan <b>goral</b> (<b>Naemorhedus</b> <b>goral)</b> and Himalayan serow (Capricornis thar)) in the midhills of western Nepal. We used locations of sightings and signs of presence of these mountain ungulates collected during surveys along transect to derive a suitability value for each variable using Jacob’s index.

She {{had a history of}} allergic rhinitis, and had suffered from post-herpetic neuralgia and a herniated disc for several years. To relieve her pain, she had been given epidural injections consisting of mepivacaine hydrochloride, triamcinolone acetonide, and morphine sulfate biweekly for one year. Hyaluronidase had been administered several times with these drugs before this episode of generalized urticaria. Skin prick testing showed a positive response to 1, 500 IU/mL of hyaluronidase extract, as compared to histamine.

We hypothesized that differences in fecal glucocorticoid concentrations would be related to animal density. Fecal samples were collected 3 days/ week for 1 year from 63 individuals (n = 32 males, 31 females) at two facilities that house the majority of goral in Thailand: Omkoi Wildlife Sanctuary (Omkoi), an off-exhibit breeding center that houses goral in individual pens (16 pens; n = 8 males, 8 females) and in small family groups (8 pens; n = 8 males, 8 females); and the Chiang Mai Night Safari (NS), a zoo that maintains 31 goral (n = 17 males, 14 females) in one large pen. Glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations were higher in male than female goral at Omkoi throughout the year, and there was a seasonal effect on adrenal activity (p, 0. 05).

In the flora of Primorye there are more than two thousand species of higher plants, of which about 250 species of trees, bushes and ligneous lianas. Flora of mosses and lichens is very diverse. As part of the coastal flora, there are many valuable medicinal, technical and food plants, many relict and endemic species. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List, as rare and threatened extermination.There are mountainous tundra areas, conifers and coniferous-deciduous forests, and forest-steppe, which is sometimes called the Far Eastern Prairie, where many ancient plant species have been preserved, including ferns, lotus, and the Chosenia willow. The flora of the territory contains such plants as Taxus cuspidata, Juniperus rigida, Phellodendron amurense, Kalopanax, Aralia elata, Maackia amurensis, Alnus japonica, Actinidia kolomikta, Schisandra chinensis, Celastrus orbiculatus, Thladiantha dubia, Weigela, Eleutherococcus, Flueggea suffruticosa, Deutzia, Nelumbo nucifera, Betula schmidtii, Carpinus cordata, Acer mandshuricum, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Vitis amurensis, Panax ginseng and many others.The fauna of Primorye is also diverse.

40|$|The Long-tailed <b>goral</b> (<b>Naemorhedus</b> caudatus) {{is a rare}} {{mountain}} {{ungulate animal}} species with a mosaic range. In the Sikhote-Alin Reserve, the goral {{is located at the}} northern limit of its distribution. The main part of its population is concentrated in the coastal area, in the Abrek natural landmark. In the early XX century, the goral occupied another small area along the coast – 20 km south of the Abrek natural landmark. Currently, the total area of species' habitats is only 7. 1 km 2. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the population size, population density and some demographic parameters of the goral population. Also, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the photo-trap method which is a new approach to the study and monitoring of this rare species. Accounting studies in the Abrek natural landmark were carried out in October 2014 – January 2015 (1401 trap-days); also, at the same time we worked in the second area during three seasons (2014 – 2017, 1326 trap-days). Estimation of the abundance and annual survival of the goral has been carried out using stochastic «capture – recapture» models presented in the software MARK. In the Abrek natural landmark for an effective area of 4 km 2 (63 % of this habitat's area), the average density of the goral population was 15. 4 animals per km 2 (CI 95 % = 14. 6 – 18. 2 individuals per km 2), in the second area (0. 7 km 2) completely accounted – 21. 0 individuals per km 2 (CI 95 % = 20. 1 – 28. 6 individuals per km 2). The total abundance of goral individuals in the Reserve remains, apparently, at the level of the late 1980 s. And currently it is about 110 – 140 individuals. According to our preliminary data, the total annual survival in the first year was 0. 73 (CI 95 % = 0. 41 – 0. 91), and by the end of the second year it was 0. 72 (CI 95 % = 0. 31 – 0. 93). Female animals have prevailed in the population structure, and the sex ratio for adult animals was 1 : 1. 5. The fertility rate was 0. 61. In comparison with the data obtained in the late 1970 s, currently the age and sex structure of the goral population has changed somewhat, and the rate of reproduction has decreased. The use of photo-traps significantly improves the quality of the goral population monitoring. However, photo-trap monitoring is a fairly expensive and time-consuming process. So it is advisable to apply this method in habitats which are most important for conservation of this rare species...|$|R
