5000|$|The {{group of}} metal-based anticancer drugs {{originated}} with cisplatin, {{one of the}} leading agents in clinical use. Cisplatin acts by binding to DNA, forming one or two intrastrand cross-links of the G-G adduct at 70 % and the A-G adduct at ~20 % of the major grooves of the double helix. The planer cis compound (on the same side) is composed of a square molecule with two chloride ligands on one side and two ammonia ligands on the other side, centered with the heavy platinum (Pt) which could initiate the Auger dose in situ. Entering a cell with a low NaCl concentration, the aqua-chloride ligands would detach from the compound (allowing the missing chloride to link the G-G or A-G bases and bend the DNA helixes 45 degrees, damaging them). Since its discovery in 1978, cisplatin has been modified as carboplatin, <b>nedaplatin</b> and oxaliplatin. Although platinum-based antineoplastics are used in as much as 70 percent of all chemotherapy, they are not particularly effective against certain cancers (such as breast and prostate tumors). The molecular modifications using an in situ megagray Auger dose could alter the DNA helixes in two ways: ...|$|E

The dose of <b>nedaplatin</b> is determined by body surface area, not by the area under the curve (AUC). The recommended therapeutic dose is 80 – 100 mg/m 2, although the pharmacokinetic profile of <b>nedaplatin</b> {{is similar to that}} of carboplatin. In our preliminary study, there was a favorable correlation between AUC and creatinine clearance (CL), suggesting that renal function should be considered when <b>nedaplatin</b> is administered. Ishibashi’s formula, ie, DoseNDP = AUC × CLNDP, where CLNDP = 0. 0738 × creatinine clearance + 4. 47, would be predictable and useful for estimating the individual dose of <b>nedaplatin.</b> Several Phase II studies have suggested that <b>nedaplatin</b> might be a useful second analog, especially for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, uterine cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, or urothelial cancer. Further, <b>nedaplatin</b> was reported to be a useful chemotherapeutic agent with radiosensitizing properties; however, there is no Phase III study of <b>nedaplatin,</b> neither with chemotherapy nor with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, because <b>nedaplatin</b> is not commonly used throughout the world.

This study aimed to investi-gate the role of autophagy in <b>nedaplatin</b> induced cell death in cisplatin-resistant nasopha-ryngeal carcinoma cells. Here, we showed that HNE 1 /DDP and CNE 2 /DDP cells were resistant to nedaplatin-induced cell death with reduced apoptotic activity. <b>Nedaplatin</b> treat-ment resulted in autophagosome accumulation and increased expression of LC 3 -II, indicating the induction of autophagy by <b>nedaplatin</b> in HNE 1 /DDP and CNE 2 /DDP cells. Inhibition of autophagy by Bafilomycin A 1 (Baf A 1) and 3 -Methyladenine (3 -MA) remarkably enhanced the antitumor efficacy of <b>nedaplatin</b> in HNE 1 /DDP and CNE 2 /DDP cells, suggest-ing that the resistance to nedaplatin-induced cell death was caused by enhanced autop-hagy in nedaplatin-resistant NPC cells.

40|$|Objective:We {{investigated}} the efficacy and toxicity of a docetaxel, ifosfamide and <b>nedaplatin</b> regimen as salvage therapy {{for patients with}} advanced testicular germ cell tumor. Methods: Eleven patients with advanced germ cell tumor refractory or relapsed after cisplatin-based chemotherapy were treated using docetaxel, ifosfamide and <b>nedaplatin.</b> The docetaxel, ifosfamide and <b>nedaplatin</b> regimen comprised docetaxel (75 mg/m 2) on Day 1, ifosfamide (2 g/ m 2) on Days 1 – 3 and <b>nedaplatin</b> (75 mg/m 2) on Day 2 of a 3 -week cycle. Results: Ten (91 %) of the 11 patients achieved favorable responses, including complete re-sponse in one case and partial response in nine cases. Nine (81 %) of the 11 patients have con-tinued to show no evidence of disease after docetaxel, ifosfamide and <b>nedaplatin</b> therapy followed by subsequent surgical resection, with a median follow-up period of 52 months.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of carboplatin and <b>nedaplatin</b> on the function and expression of P-glycoprotein/MDR 1 using porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK 1 cells, and to compare their characteristics with cisplatin or oxaliplatin. METHODS: The transport activity of MDR 1 was examined in LLC-PK 1 and MDR 1 -overexpressing Hvr 100 - 6 cells. The expression level of MDR 1 was analyzed with RT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses. RESULTS: Neither carboplatin nor <b>nedaplatin</b> affected the accumulation of Rho-damin 123 in Hvr 100 - 6 cells, suggesting that both drugs were not the substrates for MDR 1. In addition, LLC-PK 1 cells treated for 48 h with 1 µM carboplatin did not exhibit any change in subsequent Rhodamine 123 transport. Cellular MDR 1 mRNA and protein expression was also not altered by carboplatin. In the case of <b>nedaplatin,</b> the accu-mulation of Rhodamine 123 was significantly decreased when LLC-PK 1 cells were pre-treated with 1 µM of <b>nedaplatin</b> for 48 h, although <b>nedaplatin</b> did not affect the efflux of Rhodamine 123. <b>Nedaplatin</b> did not up-regulate both mRNA and protein levels of MDR 1.

Methods: A total of 53 advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients hospitalized between July 2013 and June 2016 with a performance status ≤ 2 were enrolled in this study. All patients received 4 – 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy comprising pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 dL) and <b>nedaplatin</b> (80  mg/m 2 dL). Each chemotherapy cycle consisted of 21 days. After {{the efficacy of the}} combination chemotherapy was assessed, patients with stable disease, partial remission, or complete remission received pemetrexed maintenance therapy (500 mg/m 2 dL) until disease progression or intolerable side effects occurred. Each pemetrexed maintenance therapy cycle was 28 days. Results: After completion of the pemetrexed and <b>nedaplatin</b> combination chemotherapy, 26 (49. 1 %), 15 (28. 3 %), and 12 (22. 6 %) patients exhibited partial remission, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. Complete remission was not achieved in any patient. Therefore, the response and disease control percentages were 49. 1 % and 77. 4 %, respectively. A total of 38 patients were further administered pemetrexed maintenance chemotherapy for an average of 9. 8 cycles. The median progression-free survival and overall survival of the 38 patients receiving the pemetrexed maintenance therapy were 9. 3 (95 % confidence interval: 8. 6 – 10) months and 16. 3 (95 % confidence interval: 14. 5 – 18. 2) months, respectively.

40|$|Human copper {{transporter}} 1 (hCTR 1) {{is a major}} copper uptake protein. Interestingly, it also mediates the uptake {{of selected}} platinum (Pt) anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. Here we studied the interactions of the N-terminus of hCTR 1 (hCTR 1 -N) with carboplatin and its analogue <b>nedaplatin</b> by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Our 2 D [1 H, 15 N] SOFAST-HMQC NMR data demonstrated that hCTR 1 -N binds to these Pt drugs through methionine residues to form ring-opened monofunctional adducts. Such a binding significantly activated these platinum drugs. High resolution ESI-MS spectra showed that a maximum of two Pt atoms bound per monomer of the protein for carboplatin and <b>nedaplatin</b> {{in a similar manner}} to cisplatin.

40|$|Despite the {{generally}} high cure rate {{in patients with}} metastatic testicular cancer, 20 % to 30 % of treated patients will become candidates for salvage chemotherapy. We reviewed the recent salvage chemotherapy trials of refractory diseases. CPT- 11 is a new derivative of camptothecin and has activity {{in a variety of}} solid tumors. We evaluated the antitumor effect of combination chemotherapy using CDDP and CPT- 11 against refractory testicular cancer. Fourteen patients who failed to achieve complete remission with salvage chemotherapy were treated with combination chemotherapy with CPT- 11 and CDDP or 254 -S (<b>nedaplatin)</b> as third line chemotherapy. Six patients remain alive and disease-free and 5 patients died of disease. The combination of CPT- 11 and either CDDP or <b>nedaplatin</b> was significantly more effective than other salvage therapy regimens such as VIP. Paclitaxel, ifosfamide, etoposide regimens were also effective in patients with refractory testicular tumors. We concluded that these combination regimens demonstrated significant activity against refractory testicular tumor and further investigation is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{advances}} {{in the management of}} cervical cancer using cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy, substantial treatment failure still occurs, especially in advanced-stage patients and early-stage cervical cancer patients with high-risk prognostic factors. Therefore, efforts to further improve the survival and quality of life of these patients are necessary. <b>Nedaplatin</b> (cis-diammine-glycoplatinum), a derivative of cisplatin, was developed with the aim of producing a treatment with a similar effectiveness to cisplatin but decreased renal and gastrointestinal toxicities. Based on the promising results of preclinical studies, the clinical efficacy of <b>nedaplatin</b> as a radiosensitizing agent was evaluated in patients with cervical cancer. Retrospective analysis of nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) against cervical cancer suggested that nedaplatin-based CCRT can be considered as an alternative to cisplatin-based CCRT in both early-stage and advanced-stage cervical cancer patients. However, {{due to the lack of}} a randomized controlled study, nedaplatin-based CCRT has not been convincingly proven to be clinically effective in patients with cervical cancer. Further investigations in randomized controlled trials are therefore needed...|$|E

Methods: In this multicenter Phase II trial, the patients were treated with intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m 2, day 1) and <b>nedaplatin</b> (80 mg/m 2, day 1), each cycle repeated every 3 weeks for two cycles at least. Results: From January 2010 to November 2013, a total of 78 patients were recruited in this trial. Among them, 73 patients were assessable for response. The treatment was well tolerated. The main hematological adverse event was neutropenia. A total of 12 patients (15. 4 %) had grade  3 or grade  4 neutropenia. Grade 3 anemia was observed in six patients (7. 7 %) and no grade  3 / 4 thrombocytopenia was observed. No Grade 3 / 4 non-hematological toxicity was observed. There were five complete response (6. 8 %), 43 partial responses (58. 9 %), and the overall response rate was 65. 8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 48. 7 %– 81. 2 %). With a median follow-up period of 18. 6 months, the median time to progression was 7. 9 months (95 % CI, 4. 2 – 10. 8 months), median overall survival was 15. 7 months (95 % CI, 11. 6 – 18. 5 months).

40|$|Abstract Background In 2006, we {{reported}} {{the effectiveness of}} chemoradiotherapy for postoperative recurrent esophageal cancer with a median observation period of 18 months. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to update the results of radiotherapy combined with <b>nedaplatin</b> and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) for postoperative loco-regional recurrent esophageal cancer. Methods Between 2000 and 2004, we performed a phase II study on treatment of postoperative loco-regional recurrent esophageal cancer with radiotherapy (60 Gy/ 30 fractions/ 6 weeks) combined with chemotherapy consisting of two cycles of <b>nedaplatin</b> (70 mg/m 2 / 2 h) and 5 -FU (500 mg/m 2 / 24 h for 5 days). The primary endpoint was overall survival rate, and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival rate, irradiated-field control rate and chronic toxicity. Results A total of 30 patients were enrolled in this study. The regimen was completed in 76. 7 % of the patients. The median observation period for survivors was 72. 0 months. The 5 -year overall survival rate was 27. 0 % with a median survival period of 21. 0 months. The 5 -year progression-free survival rate and irradiated-field control rate were 25. 1 % and 71. 5 %, respectively. Grade 3 or higher late toxicity was observed in only one patient. Two long-term survivors had gastric tube cancer more than 5 years after chemoradiotherapy. Pretreatment performance status, pattern of recurrence (worse for patients with anastomotic recurrence) and number of recurrent lesions (worse for patients with multiple recurrent lesions) were statistically significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Conclusions Radiotherapy combined with <b>nedaplatin</b> and 5 -FU is a safe and effective salvage treatment for postoperative loco-regional recurrent esophageal cancer. However, the prognosis of patients with multiple regional recurrence or anastomotic recurrence is very poor. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{standard}} {{treatment of}} unresectable stage III {{non-small cell lung cancer}} is concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients in good general condition, {{but where the}} optimal chemotherapeutic regimen has not been determined. Methods: Patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer received <b>nedaplatin</b> (80 mg/m 2) and paclitaxel on day 1 every 4 weeks for 3 – 4 cycles and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy/ 30 fractions for 6 weeks) starting on day 1. The dose of paclitaxel was escalated from 120 mg/m 2 in level 1, 135 mg/m 2 in level 2 to 150 mg/m 2 in level 3. Results: A total of 18 patients (14 males and 4 females, with a median age of 62. 5 years) were evaluated in this study. Full cycles of chemotherapy were administered in 83 % of patients in level 1, and in 50 % of patients in levels 2 and 3. No more than 50 % of patients developed grade 4 neutropenia. Transient grade 3 esophagitis and infection were noted in one patient, and unacceptable pneumonitis was noted in three (17 %) patients, two of whom died of the toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), evaluated in 15 patients, noted in one of the six patients in level 1, three of the six patients in level 2 and one of the three patients in level 3. One DLT at level 2 developed later as radiation pneumonitis. Thus, the maximum tolerated dose was determined to be level 1. The overall response rate (95 % confidence interval) was 67 % (41 – 87 %) with 12 partial responses. Conclusion: The doses of paclitaxel and <b>nedaplatin</b> could not be escalated as a result of severe pulmonary toxicity.

40|$|Abstract Background Although the {{effectiveness}} of radiotherapy with concurrent administration of several anti-tumor drugs for postoperative recurrent esophageal cancer has been demonstrated, the results are not satisfactory. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate {{the effectiveness}} and safety of radiotherapy combined with <b>nedaplatin</b> and 5 -FU for postoperative locoregional (excluding hematogenous metastasis) recurrent esophageal cancer. Methods In June 2000, we started a phase II study on treatment of postoperative locoregional recurrent esophageal cancer with radiotherapy (60 Gy/ 30 fr/ 6 weeks) combined with chemotherapy consisting of two cycles of <b>nedaplatin</b> (70 mg/m 2 / 2 h) and 5 -FU (500 mg/m 2 / 24 h for 5 days). The primary endpoint of the present study was overall survival rate, and the second endpoints were irradiated-field control rate, tumor response and toxicity. Results A total of 30 patients were included in this study. The 1 -year and 3 -year overall survival rates were 60. 6 % and 56. 3 %, respectively, with a median survival period of 39. 0 months, and the 1 -year and 3 -year irradiated-field control rates were 86. 4 % and 72 %, respectively. Complete response and partial response were observed in 13. 3 % and 60. 0 % of the patients, respectively. Grade 3 or higher leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 30 % and 3. 3 % of the patients, respectively, but renal toxicity of grade 3 or higher was not observed. The regimen was completed in 76. 7 % of the patients. In univariate analysis, the difference between survival rate in preradiotherapy performance status, recurrent pattern (worse for patients with anastomotic recurrence) and age (worse for younger patients) were statistically significant.
