Any {{investment strategy}} that maximises portfolio growth has an intuitive appeal {{for both the}} professional and <b>non-professional</b> <b>investor.</b> This paper investigates the structure and properties of growth oriented portfolios using a matrix algebra approach. Data on the returns of five Australian listed companies {{are used in the}} paper to provide specific illustrations of growth portfolio properties. This paper highlights the nexus between growth optimal portfolios and Markowitz mean-variance portfolios. Growth portfolios are shown to be Markowitz efficient portfolios. The paper contrasts the properties of maximum growth portfolios with those of minimum variance portfolios. Finally, following Long (1990) we derive the growth optimal portfolio equivalent of the capital asset pricing model with the growth optimal portfolio acting as a pricing numeraire...|$|E
40|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States and in {{particular}} its immediately past chairman, Christopher Cox, has been actively promoting an upgrade of the EDGAR system of disseminating filings. The new generation of information provision has been dubbed by Chairman Cox, "Interactive Data" (SEC, 2006). In October this year the Office of Interactive Disclosure was created([URL] The focus {{of this paper is}} to examine the way in which the <b>non-professional</b> <b>investor</b> has been constructed by various actors. We examine the manner in which Interactive Data has been sold as the panacea for financial market 'irregularities' by the SEC and others. The academic literature shows almost no evidence of researching non-professional investors in any real sense (Young, 2006). Both this literature and the behaviour of representatives of institutions such as the SEC and FSA appears to find it convenient to construct this class of investor in a particular form and to speak for them. We theorise the activities of the SEC and its chairman {{in particular}} over a period of about three years, both following and prior to the 'credit crunch'. Our approach is to examine a selection of the policy documents released by the SEC and other interested parties and the statements made by some of the policy makers and regulators central to the programme to advance the socio-technical project that is constituted by Interactive Data. We adopt insights from ANT and more particularly the sociology of translation (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 2005; Law, 1996, 2002; Law & Singleton, 2005) to show how individuals and regulators have acted as spokespersons for this malleable class of investor. We theorise the processes of accountability to investors and others and in so doing reveal the regulatory bodies taking the regulated for granted. The possible implications of technological developments in digital reporting have been identified also by the CEO's of the six biggest audit firms in a discussion document on the role of accounting information and audit in the future of global capital markets (DiPiazza et al., 2006). The potential for digital reporting enabled through XBRL to "revolutionize the entire company reporting model" (p. 16) is discussed and they conclude that the new model "should be driven by the wants of investors and other users of company information, [...] . " (p. 17; emphasis in the original). Here rather than examine the somewhat illusive and vexing question of whether adding interactive functionality to 'traditional' reports can achieve the benefits claimed for nonprofessional investors we wish to consider the rhetorical and discursive moves in which the SEC and others have engaged to present such developments as providing clearer reporting and accountability standards and serving the interests of this constructed and largely unknown group - the <b>non-professional</b> <b>investor...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} equity appraisal techniques employed by <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> from the Central European emerging stock market (CEESM) of Poland. The paper examines investment decision-making processes in the context of the current financial crisis in a pioneering attempt to shed some light on crisis-induced changes in investment strategies. In addition, the study tests the usefulness and predictive abilities of analytical tools employed by <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> when faced with unstable stock-market conditions. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaires and experiments conducted with a large group of Polish investors – trading equities in their home market – in order to gain information on the most commonly used investment strategies. Their views are contrasted with similarly obtained opinions expressed by UK <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> to highlight differences in approaches to investments. Finally, a series of semi-structured interviews was conducted to discuss how the current financial crisis has affected investment strategies among Polish and UK investors. Findings – Technical analysis (TA) is the preferred tool utilized by <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> in Poland. However, the current financial crisis caused the majority of Polish practitioners to adopt fundamental analysis which, in this case, is undertaken to support initial conclusions derived from TA. At this point, investees' financial statements coupled with analyses of the main macroeconomic indicators for CEESMs became the main source of decision-influencing information. Practical implications – The paper addresses an area which is gaining in importance and is of interest to both practitioners and service providers for <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> Further investigation is recommended of nascent challenges to investing in CEESMs with practical implications for policy makers and investors. Originality/value – The current paper refers to the global financial crisis which occurred in the years 2008 - 2010. To date, there are no previous studies devoted to an investigation of how investors' trading strategies were influenced by the international financial crisis. Moreover, there are relatively few studies which target practitioners from CEESMs. The paper focuses on the non-professionals, as this group of investors seems to be relatively under-researched. Therefore, a number of important implications can be drawn from the current paper with regard to investment strategies tailored to overcome a financial crisis.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of audit firm versus partner {{rotation}} on non-professional investors' independence-related perceptions, extending prior research on auditor rotation and independence in fact. Arguments for mandatory audit firm rotation continue to be made by regulators and investor groups based, in part, on the idea that firm rotation will incrementally strengthen independence in appearance relative to audit partner rotation. We report the results of two experiments. The first examines 5 -year audit firm versus partner rotation under relatively weak or strong audit committees. We find no statistically significant difference in beliefs about how much of an income reducing audit difference management will record, or in beliefs about auditor independence, between the two auditor rotation conditions. On the other hand, we find that <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> do believe more of the audit difference will be recorded, and the auditors will be more independent, under a strong audit committee than a relatively weak audit committee. The second experiment provides further evidence on audit firm versus partner rotation by examining a setting involving a 26 -year audit firm-client relationship. Again, no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} auditor rotation conditions were found. These findings suggest that compared to audit partner rotation, audit firm rotation does not strengthen independence in appearance among <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> and that <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> recognize the value of strong audit committees. ...|$|R
40|$|On 17 December 2008 the United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{voted in}} favour of phasing in the {{mandatory}} submission of digital reporting using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). The SEC’s interactive data project {{is the most significant}} adoption of XBRL for financial reporting purposes to date because of the proportion of the world’s capital markets affected and because the SEC has a mandate to disseminate reports for the benefit of all investors. It means that {{within the next few years}} there will be free access to large numbers of tagged company reports for a significant portion of the world’s capital market. The SEC’s stated motivation in the interactive data project is to protect <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> (Cox, 2007), who as a group are often claimed to be a focus for capital market regulators and accounting standard setters. This Briefing reports the findings of a detailed analysis of the social and technical factors that were important in the development of the SEC’s interactive data project and assesses the prospects for a similar development in Europe. We have used the perspective of <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> in a wide-ranging, multi-method study.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the efficacy of}} presenting footnotes information in alternative display formats on investors’ judgments and decisions. <b>Non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> {{play a significant role}} in the capital markets yet they do not always attend to information contained in footnote disclosures. As a result, nonprofessional investors systematically misprice firms and misallocate resources. Recognizing that increased mandatory and voluntary disclosures create additional challenges for <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors,</b> both the FASB and SEC have actively sought ways to increase the effectiveness of disclosures. I hypothesize that high display proximity, low signal-to-noise presentation formats can increase investors’ attention to and processing of footnote disclosures and hence performance on an investing task. Further I hypothesize that low display proximity, low signal-to-noise presentation formats can improve investor performance on a recognition task. Lastly, I hypothesize that <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> viewing high display proximity, low signal-to-noise footnote disclosures will rate usability higher than nonprofessional investors viewing footnote disclosures in the other three display formats. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers are used as participants in a 2 x 2 between-participants experiment using two task types: an integrative (investing) task and a non-integrative (recognition) task. I manipulate display proximity (inline or side-by-side) and signal-to-noise ratio (footnotes presented simultaneously or individually). Contrary to my hypotheses, I find that low signal-to-noise ratio increases non-professional investors’ performance on both the integrative (investing) and non-integrative (recognition) tasks. Further, although task performance increased under the low signal-to-noise presentation format, participants did not evaluate either signal-to-noise presentation format easier to use or more useful. Instead, participants found the high display proximity (side-by-side) presentation format easier to use, although it did not yield performance increases...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{proposal}} by the Group of Four Plus One {{to modify the}} accounting treatment of operating leases has attracted considerable comment. However, {{a review of the}} publicly available submissions to this proposal reveals that no one has addressed the issue in terms of the primary objective of general purpose financial reports, that is, to provide decision useful information to <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> This thesis seeks to redress this gap by providing some evidence of the ability of nonprofessional investors to evaluate operating leases as they are presented according to current accounting standards and alternative presentation formats. The thesis reports the results of an experiment carried out on surrogates for nonprofessional investors. The main finding is {{that the vast majority of}} subjects were unable to evaluate operating lease information when it was disclosed in the notes, rather than reported in the body of the Statement of Financial Position. Subjects consistently relied on reported figures and seemed unable to incorporate information presented in the notes to the financial reports, even when the links between the notes and the reported figures were made more obvious than is currently the case. The finding has a number of implications. It would appear that the existing accounting treatment of operating leases is the source of a structural information asymmetry, as a substantial proportion of users were unable to evaluate information relating to operating leases. This information asymmetry should be removed for reasons of economic efficiency. The recent withdrawal by <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> from equity markets shows that <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> will react strongly if they start to doubt the ability of general-purpose financial reports to provide them with decision useful information...|$|R
40|$|Policy {{uncertainty}} can be {{a powerful}} deterrent to immediate investments. Based on panel data of 214 licenses to construct small run-of-the-river hydropower plants, we examine whether the prospect of a common Swedish-Norwegian market for green certificates (i. e., a renewable portfolio standard scheme) affected the timing of investments. Our results show that traditional utilities and other professional investors in the energy market acted in accordance with a real options investment rule, and the prospect of possible future subsidies delayed their investment decision. On the other hand, our results do not show that farmers and other <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> incorporated timing considerations in their investment decisions. Rather, our results indicate that these investors behaved as if their investment opportunity is now-or-never, investing if the project is profitable according to a net present value investment rule, ignoring the opportunity to create additional value by waiting. The observed difference in behavior between professional and <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> is interesting given the distributed nature of many renewable energy technologies, and can help planners and policymakers better understand the forces shaping the future market for electricity. © Elsevier.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} severe {{critique}} directed at the auditing profession regarding its necessity and accuracy. Auditors {{have been accused of}} neglecting their duty to the public interest, which is overshadowed by their financial dependence on the audited companies. In light on several large audit failures, the users of the audit report have demanded more information be released regarding the company and the audit process. In response to this, several standard setting bodies have released new regulatory suggestions regarding the audit report. Among the revised regulations that are relevant to Sweden are the ISA 700 (revised) and the newly created ISA 701, both of which become effective starting December 2016. FAR, the Swedish Professional Institution for Authorized Accountants and Auditors, have expressed concerns regarding the effect of the implementation of the Key Audit Matters in combination with the Swedish confidentiality clause, by which auditors must abide. These revisions are meant to increase the informative value of the audit report for the users, where the main users of the audit report are <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> Due to this, along with lacking research on the topic of Swedish <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> in this context, we have chosen to focus our thesis on the effects of the changes to the audit report in relation to the investment behavior of this specific group. Research Question: How is the Swedish adaptation of ISA 700 (revised) and ISA 701 likely to impact the perceived value of the new audit report to young Swedish nonprofessional investors? We have conducted an online questionnaire with an attached case, derived from a listed British company that has already made similar changes to their audit report format. Based on the responses of 100 young Swedish <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors,</b> we found that the new changes to the audit report, as we presented them, had positive effect on the young <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> perception on the audit report. Of the respondents, 64 % viewed the new audit report as significantly more informative than the current Swedish audit report. Both new information, {{in the form of the}} audit resolution paragraph, and useful information, in the form of the Key Audit Matters paragraph, statement of the audit firm, and movement of the audit opinion, was perceive by the respondents. In addition to this, we found that 63 % of our sample would read the audit report in the future, as compared to 49 % today. However, we are unsure of whether these positive effects will be observe following the Swedish implementation of the changes, due to FAR and Swedish auditors hesitation toward the Key Audit Matters...|$|R
40|$|While {{non-financial}} reporting {{has been}} gaining momentum, there is limited research which addresses {{the impact of the}} credibility-enhancing mechanisms for such non-financial reports. This thesis is motivated by the need to investigate the impact of independent assurance and one of its alternative credibility-enhancing mechanisms, combined assurance, on investors’ judgments. Study One examines whether independent assurance and different assurance levels on the CSR information makes a difference to the firm’s valuation of <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors,</b> and whether there is an interaction with explicit assessment (previous research has shown that CSR information can elicit affective reactions which subsequently influence investors’ judgments, and a prompt to explicitly assess CSR information can mitigate such impact). Study Two examines whether combined assurance influences investors’ fundamental value estimates. It also examines whether limited and combined assurance together will result in a greater impact. Both studies use an experimental approach with post-graduate students serving as proxies for <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> Study One finds that independent assurance (both reasonable and limited assurance) has a significant role in enhancing the reliability of CSR information and influencing fundamental value estimates. Also, investors who receive and perceive the CSR information to be assured at a reasonable level estimate higher fundamental values than the investors who receive and perceive the CSR information to be not assured or assured at a limited level. Furthermore, the impact of CSR information in eliciting affective reactions which lead to higher fundamental value estimates is significant only when the CSR information is assured at a reasonable level. Combined assurance is proposed as a complementary or alternative mechanism to independent assurance. While Study Two finds that limited assurance has a significant role in enhancing the reliability of CSR information, it does not find evidence of the impact of either limited or combined assurance on the judgments and decision making of <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> These findings have important implications for the reporting entities and regulators about the benefits of independent assurance and combined assurance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board allow {{fair value}} {{measurement}} of liabilities. Previous {{findings from the}} literature on recognition versus disclosure indicate that recognition of fair value information better serves investors' needs, {{because it is more}} likely to facilitate the incorporation of the information into their judgment. In cases of credit risk changes for own liabilities, however, many authors doubt that fair value measurement is beneficial due to its potential counter-intuitiveness. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to gain insight into non-professional investors' processing of fair value information for liabilities. Design/methodology/approach – A between-subjects laboratory experiment was employed. Subjects received financial information on three different companies. The authors manipulated the accounting treatment of liabilities between the three groups. Subjects ranked three companies according to their economic performance. The authors then compared these rankings to the companies' actual performance. Findings – The results of the experiment indicate that <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> are less likely to acquire the information of credit risk changes when liabilities are not measured at fair value. Additionally, evidence was found that fair value measurement is to some extent counter-intuitive for <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> Research limitations/implications – A main limitation is that our experiment concentrates on liabilities and abstracts from interactions of both sides of the balance sheet.

We employ a two-dimensional utility setting in which both consumption and financial wealth fluctuations generate utility. The perception of financial wealth is modelled in an extended prospect-theory framework that accounts for both the distinction between gains and losses {{with respect to a}} subjective reference point and the impact of past performance on the current perception of the risky portfolio value. The decision problem is addressed in two distinct equilibrium settings in the aggregate market with a representative investor, namely with expected and non-expected utility. Empirical estimations performed on the basis of real market data and for various parameter configurations show that both settings similarly describe the attitude towards financial losses. Yet, the recommendations regarding wealth allocation are different. Maximizing expected utility results on average in low total-wealth percentages dedicated to consumption, but support...|$|R

40|$|The {{backdrop}} of this dissertation is one ubiquitous element of everyday life: the stock market. Traditionally, accounting and stock markets are logically coordinate entities and this thesis analyzes how accounting supports private investors in {{their role as}} shareholders – as investors in shares and owners of companies. This analysis is carried out in four independent essays. The first two essays analyze the privatization of Telia, a former state-owned Telecommunication Company in Sweden that went public in 2000. The field material for the two essays consisted of newspaper articles, government bills and interviews. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate how accounting is used among different actors to realize the privatization. Theoretically, the first two essays lend themselves to the governmentality debate as introduced to accounting research by Miller and Rose (1990). The third and fourth essays are analyses of annual general meetings (AGMs). The field material was generated from a study of participants at 36 AGMs {{during the spring of}} 2004. The choice of these two seemingly unrelated cases was done deliberately. Both cases are stock market events that typically involve an audience {{of a large number of}} <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> In the privatization of Telia over 1 million people took part in the offer. The AGMs are typically seen as the single event by which <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> have an opportunity to meet with top management. Thus, each event represents an instance in which accounting is confronted by a predominantly non-professional audience. The contribution of this study is two-fold. First, earlier work inspired by the Miller and Rose framework (1990) has favored an analysis of the programmatic. This study develops the technological aspect of the theoretical framework by means of a rich empirical description. In addition the two essays on the privatization of Telia contribute with an analysis of how once a specific technology translates to become and becomes understood at the site of intervention. Second, the two studies of AGMs contest earlier criticism against the meeting as a corporate governance mechanism detached from the overall corporate governance system. The argument here is that the AGM offers a valuable setting for private investors to discuss stewardship issues. That this opportunity is taken advantage of is suggested by the present field material...|$|R

I find that while {{there is evidence to}} uphold expectations hypothesis during the 2008 - 9 credit crisis period and before, in general ex ante forecasts of the future level of the VIX, implied by the VIX term structure, overshoot actual ex post changes, especially over shorter tenors.

The forecast bias has increased as additional capital has flowed into financial markets, a result which does not provide support for the slow-moving capital explanation of arbitrage persistence.

The main goal of our study is to analyze the effects of five well-documented behavioral biases, namely, disposition effect, herd behavior, availability heuristic, gambler's fallacy and hot hand fallacy, on the mechanism of stock market decision-making, and, in particular, the individual differences in the degrees of these effects. Employing an extensive online survey, we document that on average, active stock market investors exhibit moderate degrees of behavioral biases. Furthermore, we find that, on the one hand, more experienced investors are less affected by behavioral patterns, yet, on the other hand, professional portfolio managers do not behave, in this respect, differently (more rationally) from <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> We, therefore, infer that investor's experience in stock market matters, but not the "status" itself of being a professional, may decrease the effect of behavioral biases on her.

Finally, we document that female investors are more strongly affected by all the five behavioral biases. </p...|$|R

We looked at about 11 million messages of the finanzaonline. com online forum from 2003 to 2012 and measured user activity, the informative content of the posts and peer-to-peer communication. We also developed a ranking of forum users to measure their level of expertise. We found that market uncertainty has a dramatic effect on user population dynamics and the type of knowledge shared and that this depended on crisis evolution. While less expert user behaviour changed during the crisis evolution becoming more sensitive to external shocks, expert users typically pondered their response to shocks both before and during the crisis. Thanks to high variety of population dynamics, the forum played different roles depending on the stages of the crisis: sharing news during crisis outbreak, sharing more technical analysis during crisis progression.

40|$|U. S. and {{international}} auditing standard setters continue {{to raise questions}} about standard auditors' reports and are exploring alternatives to those reports. Government agencies and professional organizations are also raising questions about the auditor's report. These questions point to a continued existence of an “audit expectation gap. ” To investigate perceptions and misperceptions regarding the auditor's report, we conducted focus groups with five different stakeholder groups—financial statement preparers (CFOs), users (bankers, analysts, and <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors),</b> and external auditors. This approach allows detailed comparisons between {{the perceptions of the}} different stakeholder groups affected by the auditor's report. Findings include that financial statement users value the audit, but do not read the entire auditor's report. It is not clear to users, preparers, and auditors what the auditor's report is intended to communicate or the level of assurance being provided by the report. Stakeholders offered numerous suggestions to improve the auditor's report, but they also recognize those suggestions could significantly change the auditor's risk profile and increase audit fees. We suggest future research to determine if potential changes to the auditor's report would change users' behavior and if any resulting benefits outweigh the additional risks and costs. Glen L.

40|$|This study investigates whether {{financial}} education and financial literacy influence the risk taking of <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> and the diversification strategies they pursue. To this purpose, we submitted a questionnaire to 711 US residents. Our {{results show that}} {{financial education}} prevents financial illiteracy and changes the investment process of investors. On the other hand, financial literacy, measured according to the synthetic metric introduced by Lusardi and Mitchell, does not influence risk taking. Financial education indirectly exerts its influence also on a simple diversification behaviour, the so-called naïve diversification, pursued equally splitting wealth among investment classes. In fact, whereas for uneducated investors there is no relationship between risk diversification strategies with both financial literacy and the main investor features, for educated investors financial literacy fosters such diversification behaviour. These results have important policy implications showing that financial education can trigger relevant changes in the investment patterns of investors. Our study introduces a series of novelties. First, we focus on how financial education and financial literacy simultaneously affect the investment process of investors. Moreover, we attempt to disentangle their effects on the risk taking dimension and diversification strategies, which are {{the most effective way}} to contain the potentially disruptive effects of risks taken...|$|R
40|$|Human {{judgments}} are systematically affected by various biases and distortions. The main goal {{of our study}} is to analyze the effects of five well-documented behavioral biases—namely, the disposition effect, herd behavior, availability heuristic, gambler’s fallacy and hot hand fallacy—on the mechanisms of stock market decision making and, in particular, {{the correlations between the}} magnitudes of the biases in the cross-section of market investors. Employing an extensive online survey, we demonstrate that, on average, active capital market investors exhibit moderate degrees of behavioral biases. We then calculate the cross-sectional correlation coefficients between the biases and find that all of them are positive and highly significant for both professional and <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> and for all categories of investors, as classified by their experience levels, genders, and ages. This finding suggests that an investor who is more inclined to employ a certain intuitive decision-making technique will most likely accept other techniques as well. Furthermore, we determine that the correlation coefficients between the biases are higher for more experienced investors and male investors, indicating that these categories of investors are likely to behave more consistently, or, in other words, are more likely to decide for themselves whether to rely on simplifying decision-making techniques in general or to reject all of them. Alternatively, this finding may suggest that these investors develop more sophisticated “adaptive toolboxes”, or collections of heuristics, and apply them more systematically...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} utility {{participants}} derive from investing in alternative assets called “collectibles, ” which comprise wine, artwork, antiques, {{and other similar}} assets. A model of an auction market is developed that captures some key characteristics of professional and <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> who attend auctions of collectibles and generates predictions {{that are consistent with}} prior evidence. Some additional implications of the model are then developed using data derived from an experiment using human subjects. The experimental results indicate: 1. Art enthusiasts derive utility from both financial returns and the pleasure associated with holding collectibles; hence they are willing to pay a premium—called a “pleasure premium”—to own collectibles. This direct confirmation of the existence of the pleasure premium is consistent with postulates contained in prior research. 2. Heterogeneous expectations on the part of non-professionals attending auctions make it likely that at least some non-professionals overbid for collectibles. 3. Pleasure premia included in the bids of non-professionals further reduce the probability of professionals purchasing collectibles at auctions and reduce the returns that are likely to be realized by successful bidders. 4. Overbidding by non-professionals forces professionals out of the market, ensuring that investments in collectibles return less than zero net present value, and the probability of this occurring escalates rapidly as the number of non-professionals attending the auction increases, reaching virtual certainty at about ten. The results are consistent with prior studies indicating that investors who hold collectibles as investments derive {{little in the way of}} return benefits...|$|R
40|$|With the Key Investor Information Document (KID), the new UCITS IV {{framework}} {{brings a}} useful standardized and simplified scheme {{to explain the}} risk of mutual funds to <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors.</b> The Synthetic Risk and Reward Indicator (SRRI) methodology defines how to assess a volatility equivalent {{for each type of}} funds, and recognizes the specificities of various types of investment vehicles in the process. The SRRI rests upon two key principles: (i) risk-volatility mapping: the level of risk can be adequately translated by the volatility of returns; and (ii) reward to volatility: there must be a positive connection between the level of risk borne by the individual investor and the associated reward in terms of returns. We show that the SRRI methodology does not guarantee that these two principles are respected in practice. By forcing any type of risk to be translated into a volatility estimate, the approach overlooks investor’s heterogeneity in the definition of risk. The SRRI synthetic approach is powerless to adequately reflect the trade-off between normal and extreme risks the way it is perceived by individual investors. It also ignores that fund returns are not necessarily only related to volatility. We show that the KID does not replace a proper investment profiling system. The analysis of investor profiles is a necessary complement to the KID in order to provide adequate advice to investors. We provide an approach, based on the linear-exponential utility function, that enables the financial advisor to address the heterogeneity of investors when defining the risk of an investment portfolio.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The “disposition effect” {{describes}} the propensity for investors to realise gains sooner than losses through selling profit making investments {{more readily than}} loss making investments. This behaviour has been observed in financial markets across the world and across all investor classes, albeit to varying degrees. Such trading behaviour has been found not to be profit or utility maximising. I n the absence of rational motives for the disposition effect, it is concluded as being an irrational feature of investor trading behaviour. In search of the reason behind this behaviour, behavioural finance is turned to. No concrete justification for the disposition effect has been isolated as being the sole cause for this apparently irrational trading behaviour. This study tests for the disposition effect in a South African context across two classes of non-professional investors: those acting in their own capacity, and those acting {{with the assistance of}} professional investment advisors. The trade history of a sample of 4 840 investor accounts from a South African stockbroker was analysed over the five year period from October 2008 to October 2013. Three primary issues were addressed: (i) whether South African investors exhibit the disposition effect, (ii) if this behaviour is reduced by <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> through the employment of professional advice, and (iii) if this trading behaviour can be justified based on rational g rounds in a South African context. The results showed, consistent with studies elsewhere in the world, that individual investors in South Africa do exhibit the disposition effect both when acting in their own capacity and when acting with the assistance of professionals. Investors acting with the assistance of professional advisors are found, however, to show the effect to a lesser extent. Further, trading consistent with the disposition effect by investors acting with the assistance of professional advisors is found to be rationally justifiable on the grounds of portfolio rebalancing. It is therefore concluded that professional advice reduces the extent to which this irrational trading behaviour is exhibited, thereby increasing investor profits and utility...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{agents are}} not fully {{rational}} machines, but humans with limited capacities, feelings, and subjective perceptions and beliefs. Such less rational aspects of behavior can become extremely important, especially in financial markets. This dissertation aims at quantifying different behavioral aspects of financial decision making. The first behavioral aspect addressed relates {{to the implementation of}} practical trading rules. These rules are mostly simplifying and provide only imperfectly accurate information. Nevertheless, this information may induce sufficient asymmetry among market participants in order to affect prices. This holds in a market where imperfectly informed users of practical trading rules meet perfectly informed traders and uninformed liquidity traders. Both the accuracy of practical trading rules and the number of their users can change the trade conditions, primarily the gap between the two prices set for buying and selling the same asset. Particular trading rules of wide practical use appear to be successful in terms of monetary profits. Affective states, in particular emotions, represent the second behavioral aspect analyzed. They impact on traders' beliefs and actions and thus are transmitted into prices. We design a particular agent category, the emotional traders, who exclusively follow their affect and intuition in both thinking and acting. They face rational traders, who form beliefs in a traditional way and maximize the expected utility of wealth, as well as randomly acting noise traders. The presence of emotional traders clearly influences market prices. An appropriate rational strategy requires the adaption to the consequent market conditions. Emotional trade does not necessarily impede market stability and efficiency. Certain emotional profiles are apt to survive, and can even outperform, in terms of profits, rational strategies. Third, we study subjective perceptions of financial risks. These perceptions change the attitude of <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> towards financial investments and the potential losses they generate, as well as their decisions on wealth allocation. Subjective perceptions depend on different behavioral parameters. The past performance of risky investments and the revision frequency of risky portfolios impact investors' perceptions and decisions. Substantial differences result depending on whether or not consumption is regarded as a utility generator, besides financial wealth...|$|R
40|$|Bakgrund och problem: Företag ägnar idag betydande utrymme i sina årsredovisningar till berättande {{information}} som ska ge investeraren en helhetsbild av företaget och dess verksamhet, vilket ska öka användbarheten vid beslutsfattande. Investerare värderar den kontextuella informationen högt men anser samtidigt att den saknar aktualitet och objektivitet. Ett problem med den berättande informationen är att företagen kan framställa sina prestationer och framtidsutsikter på ett opportunistiskt sätt. Med utgångspunkt i att framvagnen består av berättande information och är en viktig del av företags årsredovisning är det av vikt att undersöka framvagnen. Läsbarheten av den berättande informationen har visats påverka icke-professionella investerare i en bedömnings- och beslutssituation, varför det är intressant att undersöka hur framvagnens läsbarhet påverkar investeringsbeslutet. Syfte: Syftet är att förstå hur framvagnen används som kommunikationskanal och förklara hur interaktionen mellan framvagnens läsbarhet och nivån på de finansiella nyheterna, positiva respektive negativa, påverkar icke-professionella investerares investeringsbeslut. Metod: Studien utgår från både en kvalitativ och en kvantitativ ansats. För att förstå hur framvagnen används som kommunikationskanal har vi genomfört semistrukturerade intervjuer, med en projektledare för årsredovisningen och två användare av framvagnen för få att deras syn på sambandet mellan framvagnen och de resterande delarna av årsredovisningen samt vikten av läsbarheten av och tilliten till framvagnen. Vi genomförde ett experiment på tredjeårsstudenter på civilekonomprogrammet vid Linköpings universitet där vi undersökte hur interaktionen mellan framvagnens läsbarhet och nivån på de finansiella nyheterna, positiva respektive negativa, påverkar icke-professionella investerares investeringsbeslut. Slutsats: Vi fann att framvagnen används för att kommunicera en berättelse om företaget men även för att sätta de finansiella rapporterna i ett tydligare sammanhang, vilket ska ge investeraren en känsla för varför den ska investera i företaget. En högre läsbarhet av framvagnen underlättar kommunikationen mellan företaget och dess investerare då samtliga investerare förstår informationen samtidigt som det undermedvetet ökar tilliten till informationen. Experimentet indikerade att läsbarheten i kombination med nivån på de finansiella nyheterna har en viss påverkan på icke-professionella investerares sannolikhet att investera och tillit till informationen. En framvagn med en högre läsbarhet som innehåller positiva finansiella nyheter torde öka icke-professionella investerares sannolikhet att investera i företaget. När framvagnen har en högre läsbarhet har de icke-professionella investerarna en större tillit till de positiva finansiella nyheterna. Har framvagnen däremot en lägre läsbarhet har de icke-professionella investerarna en större tillit till de negativa finansiella nyheterna. Background & Problem: Today, companies devote significant {{space in}} their annual reports to narrative information, which provide investors {{with a complete}} picture {{of the company and}} its operations. The narrative information enhances the documents’ decision usefulness. Investors consider the contextual information valuable even though it is lacking timeliness and objectivity. One problem with the narrative information is that companies can present their achievements and prospect in a favourable way. Because the-state-of-the-company report consists of narrative information and is {{a significant part of the}} annual report it is of importance to explore. The readability of the narrative information has been shown to influence non-professional investors’ investment decision, therefore it is of interest to explore how the readability of the-state-of-the-company report influences the investment decision. Aim: The aim is to understand how the-state-of-the-company report is used as a communication channel and to explain how the interaction between the readability of the state-of-the-company report and the level of financial news, positive or negative, influence investors’ decisions. Method: The study is based on both a qualitative and a quantitative method. We conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how the-state-of-the-company report is used as communication channel. Interviews were conducted with a project manager for the annual report and two users of the state-of-the-company report. The purpose with the interviews were to get their view of the relationship between the state-of-the-company report and the financial reporting part of the annual report, as well as the importance of the readability of and reliance on the state-of-the-company report. We have conducted an experiment on third grade business students at Linköping University to explain how the interaction between the readability of the state-of-the-company report and the level of financial news, positive or negative, influence non-professional investors’ investment decisions. Conclusion: We found that the state-of-the-company report is used to communicate a story about the company, but also to contextualize the numbers, which gives the investor a sense of why they should invest in the company. A higher readability of the-state-of-the-company report enhances the communication between the company and its investors, since all investors can comprehend the information at the same time as it subconsciously increases their reliance on the information. The experiment indicated that the readability, in combination with the level of financial news (positive or negative), has some influence on non-professional investors’ likelihood to invest and their reliance on the information. A state-of-the-company report with a higher readability consisting positive financial new should increase non-professional investors’ likelihood to invest. When the state-of-the-company report has higher readability, <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> have a greater reliance on the positive financial news. If the state-of-the-company report instead has lower readability, <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> have a greater reliance on the negative financial news. The readability has not the same influence on professional investors because they have a more critical perspective on the state-of-the-company report...|$|R
40|$|Chapter I {{contains}} a literature review on the forecast bias of implied volatility {{based on the}} two fundamental questions addressed in the literature. Does implied volatility evolve as suggested by its term structure? And, is ex post realized volatility consistent with ex ante implied volatility forecasts? Chapters II and III contribute to this literature by focusing on explanations for and interpretations of forecast bias persistence. Some literature review sections which deal with specific applications of bias persistence were embedded in Chapters II and III, instead of the literature review in Chapter I, {{so as not to}} disrupt the flow of this dissertation. The first strand investigates the evolution of implied volatility itself across time. Application of the expectations hypothesis suggests that the shape and slope of today's implied volatility term structure should be consistent with expected future changes of short-dated implied volatility. Analysis of the information content in VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) futures in Chapter II reveals a persistent forecast bias. I find that while there is evidence to uphold expectations hypothesis during the 2008 - 9 credit crisis period and before, in general ex ante forecasts of the future level of the VIX, implied by the VIX term structure, overshoot actual ex post changes, especially over shorter tenors. Strategies designed to profit from the bias reported have not been successful in eliminating the arbitrage opportunity. The forecast bias has increased as additional capital has flowed in, a result which does not support the slow-moving capital explanation of arbitrage persistence. Instead, I present evidence to suggest that the VIX-VIX Futures Puzzle is propagated by significant inflows of capital from <b>non-professional</b> <b>investors</b> via the proliferation of ETF (exchange-traded fund) offerings. The second fundamental question addressed in this literature investigates the extent to which implied volatilities accurately forecast the ex-post realized volatility of underlying asset prices. In other words, are option premiums justified by the subsequent payouts? Chapter III is devoted to this question, based on an expansive dataset of implied volatility for over thirty currency pairs across developed and emerging economies. I report the forecast biasness and propose that the magnitude of such may be used as a proxy for the degree of financial integration achieved for a particular country. I motivate this concept by furnishing a simple theoretical framework based on Dornbusch, Fischer, Samuelson (1977), based on the foundation that currencies with lower (greater) cross-border trading frictions would be expected to have options markets that exhibit lower (higher) levels of forecast bias. The transmission mechanism from cross-border currency trading frictions to FX implied volatility forecast bias is the hedging activity of currency option market-makers, based on the Black-Scholes approach to option-pricing. I conclude by introducing a new financial integration index which offers a number of benefits to existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|A recent Norwegian {{legislative}} proposal, {{likely to}} become law in 2014, suggests that hedge funds {{should be able to}} approach <b>non-professional,</b> private <b>investors.</b> In light of this, the objective of our thesis is to examine if hedge funds are an attractive investment opportunity for a Norwegian private investor. By defining two sub-questions, we use empirical research and relevant academic literature to study several aspects of hedge funds. Based on the Sharpe ratio and the Modified Sharpe ratio, we find support for hedge funds providing an attractive risk/reward relationship. However, these performance evaluations are insufficient due to the illiquidity of hedge funds, the leverage risks, and the returns biases. As the efficient frontiers of stocks and bonds improve when hedge funds are included, one can argue that hedge funds provide unique returns. However, the non-normality, skewness, and kurtosis may distort the efficient frontiers. In addition, the calculated correlations between hedge funds and traditional assets, as well as the similarities between the payoff structure of hedge funds and short put options, indicate that hedge funds are not providing unique exposure. In total, our recommendation for Norwegian private investors is to be cautious with regards to investing in hedge funds. This {{is due to the fact}} that the performance of hedge funds may be distorted, the risk management features may be lower than expected, and hedge funds will likely be an expensive way of obtaining an unattractive payoff structure. nhhma...|$|R
