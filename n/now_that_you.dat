Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today said [...] "it's vertical in focus and a typical-sounding power ballad, but it's {{not hard to imagine}} people latching on to its powerful Job-like expression of faith and hope.".

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive {{meanings}} hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially {{as a consequence}} of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning. The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s. Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to [...] "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" [...] (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase [...] "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" [...] (Strydom, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, and you will be crushed). Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. [...] "Thina Sizwe" [...] included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while [...] "Senzeni Na" [...] (what have we done) achieved the same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times. Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors. The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who [...] "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach". Lyrics from this period included calls such as [...] "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," [...] and [...] "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".|$|E

2500|$|Later, {{during the}} reign of Emperor Xuānzong's son Emperor Yizong, when the former {{chancellor}} Linghu Tao served successively as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanwu (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and then Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), Wang served as Linghu's secretary. [...] Wang was subsequently recalled to Chang'an to serve as You Shiyi (右拾遺), a low-level advisory official at the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), and it was said that while serving there, he submitted petitions making 23 suggestions, causing people to respect him for his insight. [...] When the chancellor Xu Shang also served as the director of salt and iron monopolies, he invited Wang to serve as an assistant. [...] Later, after Xu was relieved of his chancellor post and made the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), he wanted Wang to serve under him, but did not dare to ask, as he did not know whether Wang would be willing to leave the capital again. [...] Wang heard about this, and he stated to Xu, [...] "When I had just passed the Jinshi examination, it was you, Lord, who regarded me well. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> Lord, will be receiving a seal and a military command, how can your subordinate not follow you?" [...] Xu was pleased, and he had Wang made his assistant.|$|E
2500|$|The Shiyu {{recorded}} {{an incident}} about how Zhong Hui {{came to the}} attention of the Wei regent Sima Shi. Sima Shi instructed Yu Song (虞松), the Prefect of the Palace Writers (中書令), to draft a memorandum. He was not satisfied after reading Yu Song's draft and ordered him to rewrite. Yu Song was unable to think of a better way to write the memorandum after racking his brains and felt gloomy. Zhong Hui noticed Yu Song looked troubled, so he offered to help him and changed five words in the memorandum. Yu Song was pleased after looking through Zhong Hui's edits and he presented the revised draft to Sima Shi later. After reading it, Sima Shi asked him, [...] "You didn't make these changes. Who edited it?" [...] Yu Song replied, [...] "Zhong Hui. I've been wanting to recommend him to you, my lord. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> asked, I shan't keep him to myself anymore." [...] Sima Shi said, [...] "He's capable of shouldering greater responsibilities. Summon him." [...] When Yu Song informed Zhong Hui that Sima Shi wanted to meet him, Zhong asked him about Sima's abilities, to which Yu replied, [...] "He's learned, wise and multi-talented." [...] Zhong Hui stayed at home for about ten days, during which he refused to meet any visitors and carefully thought about what he would say to Sima Shi. On the day he met Sima Shi, he entered Sima's residence early in the morning and left only at midnight. After Zhong Hui left, Sima Shi remarked, [...] "He's truly a great talent capable of assisting rulers." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E
2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility. [...] I would feel pity if Your Imperial Majesty followed your anger and not your credibility." [...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
