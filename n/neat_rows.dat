5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin. Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The skin on the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged in <b>neat</b> <b>rows.</b> The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E

For example, in Pygoplatys tenangau, the egg clusters are distinctively hexagonal; while in Piezosternum subulatum, they are arranged in two <b>neat</b> <b>rows.</b> The eggs are usually initially white, cream, or yellow in color but can change as the embryos inside mature.|$|E

A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already {{discarded}} that piece, where players' discards {{are kept in}} <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.|$|E

25|$|In a pit {{excavated}} next {{to these}} four men were placed {{the bodies of}} {{a large group of}} young women. This mass grave contained the remains of 53 females ranging in age between 15–30 years of age, arranged in two layers separated by matting. The young women show evidence of having been strangled before being arranged in <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> in the pit. Analysis of bones and dental traits of these women have led archaeologists to believe these individuals were not from the same social class and ethnic group as other individuals interred in the mound. Non-metric dental traits have suggested that these individuals were not from the Cahokia area and were possibly immigrants new to the area. Analysis of specific carbon isotope and nitrogen isotope ratios left by maize consumption in the bones and cartilage of the women as well as pathologies indicative of poor health and nutritional stress; have led researchers to also conclude they were of a lower social status than elite burials in the mound, consuming more maize and less animal protein than elite individuals.|$|E
25|$|The first attacks {{began at}} 03:00 on 22 June. The Soviets {{had been caught}} by surprise, their {{aircraft}} bunched together in <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> which were vulnerable. The results were devastating. At Pinsk aerodrome 39 SBAP of 10 SAD lost 43 SBs and five Pe-2s on the ground after attacks by KG 3, which lost one bomber. Further to the west, 33 IAP/10 SAD lost 46 I-53 and I-16s to fighter-bombers of JG 51. Messerschmitt Bf 110s of SKG 210 destroyed 50 aircraft at Korbin airfield, near the headquarters of 10 SAD and the Soviet Fourth Army. The airfield based the 74 ShAP, which lost 47 I-15s, 5 I-153s and 8 IL-2 aircraft on 22 June. Worse was still to come. Slightly later, KG 54 attacked airfields in the area, and its 80 Ju 88s destroyed 100 Soviet aircraft. However, the Luftwaffe and its allies were far from alone in the skies. The VVS flew 6,000 sorties {{in comparison to the}} German 2,272 sorties and VVS ZOVO put 1,900 aircraft into the air. They put up bitter resistance in the air scoring a few successes.|$|E
25|$|Established in 1870, the Golden Gate Park Nursery has {{remained}} {{one of the}} few places in the park restricted to the public. This nursery began with donated plants from around the world and expanded over the years with the care of past Golden Gate Park gardeners. The nursery has moved around the park thrice; first to where McLaren Lodge stands today, then to where Kezar Stadium is currently located and finally to its current location of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. This Nursery houses over 800 species of plants, some of which are exclusive to the nursery, and are sold to the public on the third Saturday of the month. Every week over 3,000 plants are dispersed within the city and park. When the park requires repairing or is in need of empty beds filled, the Nursery provides its wide variety of plants to fill in the blank spaces. Indoors, the plants are set up in <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> and beds, showing off the nursery’s green diversity for the buyers picking. The Golden Gate Park Nursery is one of the city’s main green providers and is greatly responsible for the city’s plant life.|$|E

Each strip of ground mown by a scythe is called a swathe (pronounced : rhymes with [...] "bathe") or swath (: rhymes with [...] "Goth"). Mowing may be done by a team of mowers, usually starting at the edges of a meadow then proceeding clockwise and finishing in the middle. Mowing grass is easier when it is damp, and so hay-making traditionally began at dawn and often stopped early, {{the heat of the day}} being spent raking and carting the hay cut on previous days or peening the blades.|$|R

500|$|The asylum {{complex is}} an example of the E-plan lunatic asylums based on the model 1850s asylum in Colney Hatch, England, which itself was based on the 1830 design of Hanwell Asylum in London. [...] Kew was also {{considered}} a barracks style asylum due to its perceived resemblance to stockades or gaols. [...] The buildings are constructed from oversize bricks, made from local clay which was quarried on-site. The bricks were then rendered with cement. [...] The central administration block is three storied with a mansard roof and cupola. [...] Two storeyed ward wings extend to each side, one for each sex. [...] Each wing has a four storey, mansard-roofed tower, which contained water tanks. [...] The ward wings were surrounded by courtyards lined with iron columned verandas, many of which were retained when the complex was redeveloped. [...] Internally, the dormitories had [...] ceilings and brightly coloured walls with the beds aligned in <b>neat</b> <b>rows.</b> [...] The floors were of timber, principally so they could be scrubbed.|$|E
2500|$|Mindon Min had the pagoda {{built as}} part of the {{traditional}} foundations of the new royal city of Mandalay in 1857. He was later to convene the Fifth Buddhist Synod in 1871, but wanted to leave a great work of merit by having the Tipitaka set in stone for posterity, meant to last five millennia after the Buddha. Construction began in 1860, its hti (umbrella or crown) [...] mounted on 19 July 1862, and the inscriptions were laid open to the public on 4 May 1868. They were arranged in <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> within three enclosures, 42 in the first, 168 in the middle and 519 in the third. One more stands at the southeast corner of the first enclosure making it 730, and this stone records how it all came into being.

The swathe width depends on the blade length, the nature of the crop and the mower but is usually about 1.5 metres wide. Mowing may be done by a team of mowers, usually starting at the edges of a meadow then proceeding clockwise leaving a series of staggered swathes and finishing in the middle.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the first shell from the Boers' [...] "Long Tom" [...] on Pepworth Hill {{landed in the}} town, causing consternation. The British field guns opened fire on Pepworth Hill and Long Hill, and {{temporarily}} silenced the Boer siege gun but Colonel Ian Hamilton's frontal attack on Pepworth Hill was called off as {{it became clear that}} Grimwood was in trouble, and Hamilton's attack would not be supported. Although the main body of South African Republic Boers under Commandant-General Piet Joubert were stationed behind Pepworth Hill, there were none on Long Hill, and fire on this hill was wasted. The British artillery itself came under accurate and effective fire from the Boers' field guns, which were fought as individual gun detachments, and were quickly moved between emplacements before British guns could find their range. The British guns were deployed as they had been drilled to do, in <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> of six without using cover from artillery or even rifle fire. Their fire was not as effective as that of the Boer Staatsartillerie, and they incurred needless casualties.|$|E

50|$|Built in a <b>neat</b> <b>row,</b> the {{buildings}} {{bear witness to}} his sense of order and symmetry. Simple building methods and materials are evident, such as rough beechwood lintels, cow dung, peach pip and blood floors and roof beams fastened by dowels and leather thongs. Period furniture and authentic wallpaper have been recreated by craftsmen in Europe; Kruger's rifle is on show - possibly the one with which he killed a lion {{at the age of}} 14 - together with one of his many bibles and the bellows organ, played by his wife Gezina, plus many gifts given to him by visiting state dignitaries. Kruger occupied the Bronkhorst House, dating back to the early 1840s, while he was building his first house at Boekenhoutfontein. It is reportedly the oldest white owned dwelling in the then Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek. This property neighbours the Bafokeng nation whom Kruger befriended and persuaded to register their land rights, resulting in today's great Bafokeng wealth generated through its royalties from the platinum mines.|$|R

60|$|Imagine {{that going}} forth! In their days the {{sprawling}} suburbs of Victorian times with their vile roads, petty houses, foolish little gardens of shrub and geranium, {{and all their}} futile, pretentious privacies, had disappeared: the towering buildings of the new age, the mechanical ways, the electric and water mains, all {{came to an end}} together, like a wall, like a cliff, near four hundred feet in height, abrupt and sheer. All about the city spread the carrot, swede, and turnip fields of the Food Company, vegetables that were the basis of a thousand varied foods, and weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly extirpated. The incessant expense of weeding that went on year after year in the petty, wasteful and barbaric farming of the ancient days, the Food Company had economised for ever more by a campaign of extermination. Here and there, however, <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> of bramble standards and apple trees with whitewashed stems, intersected the fields, and at places groups of gigantic teazles reared their favoured spikes. Here and there huge agricultural machines hunched under waterproof covers.

60|$|By {{virtue of}} these marvels of the movies: Hampton ugly and sordid Hampton!--actually began for Janet {{to take on}} a romantic tinge. Were not the strange peoples of the earth {{flocking}} to Hampton? She saw them arriving at the station, straight from Ellis Island, bewildered, ticketed like dumb animals, the women draped in the soft, exotic colours many of them were presently to exchange for the cheap and gaudy apparel of Faber Street. She sought to summon up in her mind the glimpses she had had of the wonderful lands from which they had come, to imagine their lives in that earlier environment. Sometimes she wandered, alone or with Eda, through the various quarters of the city. Each quarter had a flavour of its own, a synthetic flavour belonging neither to the old nor to the new, yet partaking of both: a difference in atmosphere to which Janet was keenly sensitive. In the German quarter, to the north, one felt a sort of ornamental bleakness--if the expression may be permitted: the tenements here were clean and not too crowded, the scroll-work on their superimposed porches, like that decorating the Turnverein and the stem Lutheran Church, was eloquent of a Teutonic inheritance: The Belgians were to the west, beyond the base-ball park and the car barns, their grey houses scattered among new streets beside the scarred and frowning face of Torrey's hill. Almost under the hill itself, which threatened to roll down on it, and facing a bottomless, muddy street, was the quaint little building giving the note of foreign thrift, of socialism and shrewdness, of joie de vivre to the settlement, the Franco-Belgian co-operative store, with its salle de reunion above and a stage for amateur theatricals. Standing in the mud outside, Janet would gaze through the tiny windows in the stucco wall at the baskets prepared for each household laid in <b>neat</b> <b>rows</b> beside the counter; at the old man with the watery blue eyes and lacing of red in his withered cheeks who spoke no English, whose duty it was to distribute the baskets to the women and children as they called.|$|E

5000|$|The C7 was {{designed}} {{not only to}} provide a bold styling statement, but also to incorporate an interior makeover that would put to rest past complaints {{about the quality of}} interior fit and finish. While overall the C7 attempts to provide an evolutionary redesign to an iconic theme, the car's designers took their inspiration from the 5th generation Chevrolet Camaro's squared rear end, incorporating aggressive angular elements that disappointed many Corvette enthusiasts. The C7 received criticism for some of the more styled elements of the car. [...] "The rear contains what will surely be the C7's most controversial styling elements. It's all creases and vents back there, with aggressive trapezoidal taillights similar to those found on the current Camaro and quadruple-barreled tailpipes lined up in a <b>neat</b> <b>row</b> {{in the center of the}} rear valance", wrote Jason Kavanagh for Edmunds. Functional aerodynamic aids are tacked on or cut into every body panel of the C7, often juxtaposed against sharp creases. This is a radical departure from the prior generations of Corvettes, whose styling had no spoiler, few body panel creases, and only semi-functional gills for front brake cooling. In addition, past Corvette models minimized the size of headlamps or even hid them altogether. The C7 reverses that minimalist styling language with intricately styled headlamps with LED accents.|$|R
