However, instead of using oak barrels or stainless steel fermentation tanks, Pepe ferments and ages everything in glass (from using glass lined fermentation vessels, to storing the wine in bottles).

25|$|Wines listed with Solera {{were made}} in a style similar to sherry, with {{fractional}} blending of wines from different vintages in a solera system. The Solera method of blending is most widely practiced in the Sherry production of Spain. However, the rules for Madeira Soleras is different. When it comes to Sherry, as wine is used for bottling, <b>new</b> <b>wine</b> {{is added to the}} barrels of older wine and this continuous addition of young wine to old would result in very little wine being from the original vintage. With Madeira, approximately 50% of a bottle would likely be from the stated year because they are only allowed to add up to 10%, not more than 10 times. Another interesting peculiarity of old Solera Madeiras is that they were initially developed as a result of trying to extend the stocks of vintages when the vines had stopped being productive due to Phylloxera. Therefore, as there was no younger wine to add to the vintage, it was usually older wines which were added. In recent years, vintage Madeiras have been commanding higher prices than Soleras but, from 1966 , until {{about the end of the}} 20th Century, Solera Madeiras always fetched a premium at auction over the vintage ones.|$|E

The findings of this study will inform current and potential <b>wine</b> exporters from <b>New</b> Zealand of effective market entry procedures. A qualitative methodology was employed to identify the key elements of exporting <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wine</b> to China. Fourteen businesses, including eleven <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wine</b> exporters and three China-based wine import distributors were interviewed. The data was analysed using qualitative data methods. The study found that <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wine</b> exporters have used four market entry modes, chosen according to the different characteristics of their businesses: indirect exporting, direct exporting, joint venture, and acquisition. This study also identified key elements in successfully exporting <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wine</b> to China, including the selection of market entry modes, distribution channels, and suitable importer/distributors, the initial organisation of the wine export process, and the development of business relationships. Challenges to this success have also been identified, such as the current Chinese preference for red wines, the small scale of the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wine</b> industry, the orientation towards short-term profit by Chinese traders, and identifying suitable business partners. Recommendations are also made for the development of successful export business by <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wine</b> producers in the future.
