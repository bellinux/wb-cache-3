5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, {{that can be achieved}} only by a shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a <b>non-uniform</b> memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have <b>non-uniform</b> memory access.|$|E
5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, <b>non-uniform</b> {{motion is}} {{described}} {{as the result of}} acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things, and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a <b>non-uniform</b> fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
5|$|The RIKEN team {{produced}} a further atom on 2 April 2005, although the decay data were slightly {{different from the}} first chain, perhaps due to either {{the formation of a}} metastable state or an alpha particle escaping from the detector before depositing its full energy. In 2004, the RIKEN team also studied the 205Tl(70Zn,n)274Rg reaction, retaining the zinc beam and impinging it on a thallium rather than a bismuth target, in an effort to directly produce 274Rg in a cross-bombardment as the immediate daughter of 278Nh. However, the thallium target was weak compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets, and it deteriorated significantly and became <b>non-uniform</b> in thickness; hence no atoms of 274Rg were observed. This reaction was repeated in 2010 with upgraded equipment, but again without success. The reasons for this weakness are still unknown, given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-uniform</b> {{illumination}} correction is {{a technique}} that adjusts for <b>non-uniform</b> illumination in fundoscopic image. <b>Non-uniform</b> illumination can be a potential error in automated detection of diabetic retinopathy because of changes in statistical characteristics of image. These changes can affect latter processing such as feature extraction and are not observable by humans. Correction of <b>non-uniform</b> illumination (f') {{can be achieved by}} modifying the pixel intensity using known original pixel intensity (f), and average intensities of local (λ) and desired pixels (μ) (see formula below). Walter-Klein transformation is then applied to achieve the uniform illumination. This technique is the least used pre-processing method in the review from 2014.|$|E
25|$|Later it {{was found}} that CNT memristive {{switching}} is observed when a nanotube has a <b>non-uniform</b> elastic strain ΔL0. It was shown that the memristive switching mechanism of strained СNT is based on the formation and subsequent redistribution of <b>non-uniform</b> elastic strain and piezoelectric field Edef in the nanotube under the influence of an external electric field E(x,t).|$|E
25|$|In <b>non-uniform</b> {{circular}} motion the net acceleration (a) is along direction of Δv which is directed inside circle {{but does not}} pass through its center (see figure). The net acceleration may be resolved into two components: tangential acceleration and normal acceleration {{also known as the}} centripetal or radial acceleration. Unlike tangential acceleration, centripetal acceleration is present in both uniform and <b>non-uniform</b> {{circular motion}}.|$|E
25|$|Stream {{filtering}} {{is essentially}} a <b>non-uniform</b> reduction. Filtering involves removing items from the stream based on some criteria.|$|E
25|$|Triangles: These polyhedra {{are called}} deltahedra. There are eight convex deltahedra: {{three of the}} Platonic solids and five <b>non-uniform</b> examples.|$|E
25|$|One {{form of a}} <b>non-uniform</b> but {{flexible}} polyhedron, the Bricard octahedron, can {{be constructed}} as a double pyramid over an antiparallelogram.|$|E
25|$|Includes {{enhanced}} {{support for}} <b>Non-Uniform</b> Memory Access (NUMA) and systems with large memory pages. Windows Vista also exposes APIs for accessing the NUMA features.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} an object is not weightless, {{as in the}} above examples, a force acts non-uniformly on the object in question. Aero-dynamic lift, drag, and thrust are all <b>non-uniform</b> forces (they are applied at a point or surface, rather than acting on the entire mass of an object), and thus create the {{phenomenon}} of weight. This <b>non-uniform</b> force may also be transmitted to an object {{at the point of}} contact with a second object, such as the contact between the surface of the Earth and one's feet, or between a parachute harness and one's body.|$|E
25|$|The volume {{occupied}} by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or <b>non-uniform,</b> structured or unstructured, consisting {{of a combination of}} hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} notion of sub-exponential is <b>non-uniform</b> in terms of ε {{in the sense that}} ε {{is not part of the}} input and each ε may have its own {{algorithm}} for the problem.|$|E
25|$|For routine {{patrol and}} 'scheduled responder' duties, {{there are a}} number of marked Vauxhall Corsas in the fleet. There are also unmarked and largely unmodified Astras and Insignias for use by <b>non-uniform</b> {{departments}} such as CID.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>non-uniform</b> {{gravitational}} field: Under gravity alone, {{one part}} of the body may have a different acceleration from another part. This would tend to deform the body and generate internal stresses if the body resists deformation. Weight2 is not 0.|$|E
25|$|Condensation of Rydberg atoms forms Rydberg matter, {{most often}} {{observed}} {{in form of}} long-lived clusters. The de-excitation is significantly impeded in Rydberg matter by exchange-correlation effects in the <b>non-uniform</b> electron liquid formed on condensation by the collective valence electrons, which causes extended lifetime of clusters.|$|E
25|$|In the {{processing}} of fine ceramics, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to <b>non-uniform</b> packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled flocculation of powders due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to microstructural heterogeneities.|$|E
25|$|These results {{agree with}} those above for {{nonuniform}} circular motion. See also {{the article on}} <b>non-uniform</b> circular motion. If this acceleration is multiplied by the particle mass, the leading term is the centripetal force and the negative of the second term related to angular acceleration is sometimes called the Euler force.|$|E
25|$|This {{causes the}} output signal {{to rise and}} fall around {{the area in the}} coils. As the B–T system relies on the {{comparison}} of signal volumes, this results in a <b>non-uniform</b> output, rising and falling every 45 degrees, eight times around a full circuit. This was known as coupling error or octantal error.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{hierarchical}} architectures {{have better}} tolerance to clutter. Clutter problem arises when the target object {{is in front}} of a <b>non-uniform</b> background, which functions as a distractor for the visual task. Hierarchical architecture provides signatures for parts of target objects, which do not include parts of background and are not affected by background variations.|$|E
25|$|The {{accelerated}} {{growth in}} different body parts happens at different times, {{but for all}} adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities—the head, hands and feet—followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders. This <b>non-uniform</b> growth {{is one reason why}} an adolescent body may seem out of proportion.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{stresses}} that develop {{as a result}} of <b>non-uniform</b> drying shrinkage are directly related to {{the rate at which the}} solvent can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies, and can yield to crack propagation in the unfired body if not relieved.|$|E
25|$|Soil liquefaction. In {{the cases}} where the soil {{consists}} of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, liquefaction of those loose saturated deposits may result in <b>non-uniform</b> settlements and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the 1964 earthquake.|$|E
25|$|The {{sampling}} {{theory of}} Shannon can be generalized {{for the case}} of nonuniform sampling, that is, samples not taken equally spaced in time. The Shannon sampling theory for <b>non-uniform</b> sampling states that a band-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the average sampling rate satisfies the Nyquist condition. Therefore, although uniformly spaced samples may result in easier reconstruction algorithms, {{it is not a}} necessary condition for perfect reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|SCO {{has claimed}} {{a number of}} {{instances}} of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), Journaled File System (JFS), Read-copy-update (RCU) and <b>Non-Uniform</b> Memory Access (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel, and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix.|$|E
25|$|Fiber optic {{coatings}} {{are applied}} in concentric layers to prevent {{damage to the}} fiber during the drawing application and to maximize fiber strength and microbend resistance. Unevenly coated fiber will experience <b>non-uniform</b> forces when the coating expands or contracts, and is susceptible to greater signal attenuation. Under proper drawing and coating processes, the coatings are concentric around the fiber, continuous over {{the length of the}} application and have constant thickness.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{circular}} motion {{is a movement}} of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or <b>non-uniform</b> with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves {{circular motion}} of its parts. The equations of motion describe {{the movement of the}} center of mass of a body.|$|E
25|$|When the {{gravitational}} field is <b>non-uniform,</b> {{a body in}} free fall suffers tidal effects and is not stress-free. Near a black hole, such tidal effects can be very strong. In {{the case of the}} Earth, the effects are minor, especially on objects of relatively small dimension (such as the human body or a spacecraft) and the overall sensation of weightlessness in these cases is preserved. This condition is known as microgravity and it prevails in orbiting spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how a spatial soliton can exist, {{we have to make}} some considerations about a simple convex lens. As shown in the picture on the right, an optical field approaches the lens and then it is focused. The effect of the lens is to introduce a <b>non-uniform</b> phase change that causes focusing. This phase change {{is a function of the}} space and can be represented with , whose shape is approximately represented in the picture.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{differences}} in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces <b>non-uniform</b> phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often {{not the case for}} music recording, as the <b>non-uniform</b> response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC60268-4.|$|E
25|$|When {{the size}} of a region being {{considered}} is small relative to its distance from the gravitating mass the assumption of uniform gravitational field holds to a good approximation. Thus a person is small relative to the radius of Earth and the field for a person at {{the surface of the earth}} is approximately uniform. The field is strictly not uniform and is responsible for the phenomenon of microgravity. Objects near a black hole are subject to a highly <b>non-uniform</b> gravitational field.|$|E
25|$|Affine {{transformations of}} the plane are useful for {{studying}} equidissections, including translations, uniform and <b>non-uniform</b> scaling, reflections, rotations, shears, and other similarities and linear maps. Since an affine transformation preserves straight lines and ratios of areas, it sends equidissections to equidissections. This means that one is free to apply any affine transformation to a polygon that might give it a more manageable form. For example, {{it is common to}} choose coordinates such that three of the vertices of a polygon are (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0).|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} {{may arise from}} <b>non-uniform</b> distributions used in cryptography. For example, consider a 1000000-digit binary one-time pad using exclusive or. If the pad has 1000000 bits of entropy, it is perfect. If the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, evenly distributed (each individual bit of the pad having 0.999999 bits of entropy) it may provide good security. But if the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, where the first bit is fixed and the remaining 999999 bits are perfectly random, then the first bit of the ciphertext will not be encrypted at all.|$|E
25|$|Frequently, victims may not {{recognize}} {{what happened to}} them was rape. Some may remain in denial for years afterwards. Confusion over whether or not their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape. Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, <b>non-uniform</b> legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes. The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} small number of processors in early systems, allowed them to easily use a shared memory architecture, which allows processors to access a common pool of memory. In the early days a common approach was the use of uniform memory access (UMA), in which access time to a memory location was similar between processors. The use of <b>non-uniform</b> memory access (NUMA) allowed a processor to access its own local memory faster than other memory locations, while cache-only memory architectures (COMA) allowed for the local memory of each processor to be used as cache, thus requiring coordination as memory values changed.|$|E
