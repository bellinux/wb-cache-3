In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores than the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, there were <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in the verbal domain.|$|E
5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E

500|$|The {{theory was}} {{advanced}} {{in part because}} of lack of archeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Some proponents of this theory hold that it is likely that there was migration of smaller groups of Celts to Ireland, with sufficiently regular traffic to constitute a [...] "migration stream," [...] but that this was not the fundamental cause of Insular Celticisation. Historical linguists are sceptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of the Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'. Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> mitochondrial DNA between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account a recent study drew the conclusion that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European [...] "Atlantic Celts" [...] showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.|$|E

2500|$|The {{breast cancer}} studies [...] Cancer in the Augmented Breast: Diagnosis and Prognosis (1993) and Breast Cancer after Augmentation Mammoplasty (2001) {{of women with}} breast implant {{prostheses}} reported <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> disease-stage {{at the time of}} the diagnosis of cancer; prognoses are similar in both groups of women, with augmented patients at a lower risk for subsequent cancer recurrence or death. Conversely, the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death. That patients with breast implants are more often diagnosed with palpable—but not larger—tumors indicates that equal-sized tumors might be more readily palpated in augmented patients, which might compensate for the impaired mammogram images. The ready palpability of the breast-cancer tumor(s) is consequent to breast tissue thinning by compression, innately in smaller breasts a priori (because they have lesser tissue volumes), and that the implant serves as a radio-opaque base against which a cancerous tumor can be differentiated.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study on}} {{personality}} and religiosity found {{that members of}} secular organizations (like the international Center for Inquiry) have similar personality profiles to members of religious groups.

It was also found that secular group members show <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> their negative or positive affect.

Secular group members tended to be less agreeable (e.g. more likely to hold unpopular, socially challenging views), {{as well as more}} open minded (e.g. more likely to consider new ideas) than members of religious groups. Luke Galen, a personality researcher, writes [...] "Many previously reported characteristics associated with religiosity are a function not of belief itself, but of strong convictions and group identification." [...] Catherine Caldwell-Harris notes that [...] "non-believers" [...] are interested in social justice concerns and posits that this is due to their lack of belief in an afterlife, leading to a focus on what can be fixed here and now. [...] Another study by Caldwell-Harris describes atheists as being capable of experiencing awe, which she states debunks stereotypes of atheists as [...] "cynical and joyless". [...] A 2014 study created six different personality profiles of 'types' of nonbelievers and compared them to Big Five personality traits.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the amount of homework assigned to sophomore and senior high school students of White Plains High School, White Plains, New York, during a typical school day, and to determine certain parent, teacher and student reactions and expectations relative to those assignments. The subject areas for which homework assignments were studied in detail, and upon which correlations were made, were English, mathematics, social studies, and science. Instruments, specifically developed to correlate responses from three different groups were completed by 159 parents of students involved in the study, 54 teachers of the four subject areas indicated above, 505 sophomores, and 408 seniors. Two hundred and eighteen student response sheets which were electronically rejected because of deviations in responding techniques, were hand scored to obtain responses to specific questions. All other response sheets were tabulated electronically. Because of an insufficient number of responses, data gathered from the parent instruments were not used for statistical analysis. Data obtained from the various instruments were applied to the chi-square test of independence to determine rejection of null hypotheses. In applying data obtained from questionnaires to the chisquare formula, eight hypotheses were rejected and five hypotheses were not rejected. There was insufficient data to allow application of this formula to one of the hypotheses; one hypothesis, therefore, remains untested. The hypotheses that were rejected are:There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time that English teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time that mathematics teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time spent on homework between college-bound and non college-bound students. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time spent on homework between sophomore and senior populations. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time spent on homework between boy and girl populations.

There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time that homework is worked on in school between boy and girl populations. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time that homework is worked on in school between sophomore and senior populations. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of time spent on homework in the subject area of social studies between sophomore and senior populations.
