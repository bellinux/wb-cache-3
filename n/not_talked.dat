25|$|Along with hostility {{between the}} North and the South, there was {{friction}} between Mexicans and whites. For example, in New Mexico there was active {{resistance to the}} United States in the Taos Revolt, resulting in {{the execution of the}} U.S. governor of New Mexico. New Mexico proved to be the safest place for Mexicans in the United States because there is strength in numbers. Texas and California were more dangerous places because Mexicans were not the majority, and not all whites appreciated their presence there. California was particularly profitable for the United States, so many Americans wanted to move to that area. For instance, gold was discovered in 1849, causing Euro-Americans to rush to California. These individuals were very hostile towards Mexicans. In California alone, over 302 lynchings occurred between 1849 and 1902. During those years there were at least 5,000 lynchings in the United States as a whole. Most people associate lynchings with blacks. With about 73% of lynchings that occurred in the U.S. being those of African Americans, this association is understandable. However, Mexicans were lynched as well, though it is <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> about as often. Not all resistance to Mexicans included violence, however. On April 13, 1850, the state legislature passed a $20 per month tax on non-American-born miners in California during the Gold Rush. The tax primarily targeted Latin Americans. Resistance to the Foreign Miners Tax came not only from Mexicans but also from French, Chilean, and German miners, along with merchants whose businesses suffered {{as a direct result of}} the tax.|$|E

In an interview with Wootton in The Sun, the singer called the omission [...] "unfair" [...] and [...] "discriminatory", and felt [...] that ageism was a taboo that is still not being talked about. She also recalled discussing the incident with her manager Guy Oseary and admitted that it was perplexing for her to learn that artists in their fifties do not get played on radio, without exceptions. [...] "We've made so many advances in other areas— civil rights, gay rights— but ageism is still an area that's taboo and <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> about and dealt with," [...] she concluded.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, {{researchers}} {{have begun to}} investigate the Elaine race riot more thoroughly. For decades, the riot and numerous murders were too painful to be discussed openly in the region. The wide-scale violence ended union organizing among black farmers. White oppression continued, threatening every black family. Historian Robert Whitaker says, [...] "As with many racial histories of this kind," [...] it was “one of those shameful events best <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> about.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Bustamante had an {{apparently}} icy relationship with Governor Davis, a fellow Democrat, during his tenure. They reportedly had <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> in {{months before the}} recall election approached. Bustamante's decision {{to run in the}} recall election was controversial, as many supporters of Governor Davis had urged prominent Democrats not to run, in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the event.

The Game of the Week, however, put the sleeper Cubs on the national stage against their regional rival, the St. Louis Cardinals.

Brennan the 3rd on December 30, 1968, in which Brennan accused Friedland and two other legislators of being [...] "entirely too comfortable with members of organized crime". Brennan's testimony was based on New Jersey State Police files which alleged that Friedland had acted as the middleman to suppress criminal complaints against a loan shark. Friedland denied Brennan's allegations and demanded his resignation, stating that he had been attempting to settle a usurious loan and that he had <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> to any of the complaining witnesses.|$|E
2500|$|International {{sporting}} {{events such as}} the Tour de France got little mention except when there was a scheduled interview or major story. Both Russo and Francesa have admitted to not being experts in hockey, but playoff games involving the local teams were discussed and noted NHL guests sometimes appeared. Boxing was <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> about much, as both hosts consider the sport not to be what it once was. Although Freddy Adu and a few other soccer celebrities did interviews on the show, the FIFA World Cup and the sport itself received little to no attention on the program; the local MLS team, the New York Red Bulls, were rarely mentioned at all. (Russo said in his first book that he played soccer as a teenager, but was not a big fan of the game.) ...|$|E

In 1998, following the deaths of his parents he returned to Zlín for the first time in over 50 years. He has expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past, but he has no sense of being a survivor, at whatever remove. [...] "I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die.

2500|$|There is a {{community}} just outside {{the city on the}} San Andrés side called San Luis Tehuiloyocan, which has a 17th-century house, which is boarded up and the exterior is deteriorated. This house is not promoted for tourism and generally <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> about. However, the walls of the large inner courtyard have mosaics of encrusted volcanic stone that depict a goat, a rabbit, flames and elements of the Passion of Christ, such as the weeping face of Saint Veronica, her tears flowing red. The dominant images framing the main doorway are two monkeys with their tongues sticking out and dancing. On the ends of their legs are crow's feet and on their heads are bishops' hats. Both have erect penises and have bowls of steaming liquid in front of them. In a room in the back, there is a beam with the [...] "Magnificat" [...] a speech by the Virgin Mary, in Latin and in reverse. Christian iconography has used the monkey as a symbol of people in the control of the Devil and many suspect the house was used for satanic rites, especially in the 18th century. It is the only example known of its kind in Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|On July 27, 2007, both White House Press Secretary Tony Snow and White House {{spokeswoman}} Dana Perino defended Gonzales's Senate Judiciary Committee testimony {{regarding the}} events of March 10, 2004, saying {{that it did not}} contradict the sworn House Judiciary Committee account of FBI director Robert S. Mueller III, because Gonzales had been constrained in what he could say because there was a danger he would divulge classified material. Lee Casey, a former Justice Department lawyer during the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, told The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer that {{it is likely that the}} apparent discrepancy can be traced to the fact that there are two separate Domestic Surveillance programs. [...] "The program that was leaked in December 2005 is the Comey program. It is not the program that was discussed in the evening when they went to Attorney General Ashcroft's hospital room. That program we know almost nothing about. We can speculate about it. …The program about which he said there was no dispute is a program that was created after the original program died, when Mr. Comey refused to reauthorize it, in March 2004. Mr. Comey then essentially redid the program to suit his legal concerns. And about that program, there was no dispute. There was clearly a dispute about the earlier form or version of the program. The attorney general has <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> about that program. He refers to it as [...] "other intelligence activities" [...] because it is, in fact, still classified." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Dynamite tour, {{two of the}} {{original}} members of the band made decisions to leave. Hiizumi left to focus on his activities with jazz ensemble Pe'z, while Hirama left to focus on his activities as a solo musician. Sheena sought new members to replace Hiizumi and Hirama. She had known pianist Ichiyo Izawa since attending a solo concert of his in early 2004, though the pair had <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> together often since meeting. She wanted Izawa to join the band for both his piano and songwriting abilities. Sheena contacted Izawa on February 17, 2005, {{a day after the}} final date of the Dynamite tour, however Izawa finally agreed in late April. Sheena met Ukigumo through her brother Junpei Shiina, and the pair first collaborated in 2002 as a part of Yokoshima, a band formed to cover the Toto song [...] "Georgy Porgy". Ukigumo collaborated with Sheena during the sessions for her album Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana (2003) and Tokyo Jihen's debut album Kyōiku (2004), in which he played the guitars for Sheena's original demos. Sheena liked Ukigumo's guitar playing so much that she left it in for the studio versions of [...] "Meisai" [...] and [...] "Ishiki", and collaborated on the bonus track [...] "Ichijiku no Hana", which was written by him. Ukigumo did not want to join the band at first, however the band found that Ukigumo was the best fitting of all the potential guitarists. He agreed two to three days before Adults recording sessions began in July 2005. Hiizumi and Hirama's leaving was officially announced on July 1, 2005. [...] Two months later, the [...] "Shuraba" [...] single was announced, and on September 16, 2005, the two new band members, Ichiyo Izawa and Ukigumo were announced officially.|$|E
