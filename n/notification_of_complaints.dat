40|$|Descriptive study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the process <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the technical <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> consumables in a public teaching hospital, a member of Sentinela Hospital Network of the National Health Surveillance Agency. The data obtained was from the printed notices that resulted in 260 notifications analyzed from 2007 to 2009. The results showed a predominance of non-conformities {{in the group of}} medical-hospital material (80. 4 %) and the main complaints referred to the structure of the products used (79 %). Of the total amount <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> 7. 7 % were referred to the National System <b>of</b> <b>Notifications</b> in Sanitary Surveillance. The nurses were the professionals who mostly (81. 2 %) made the <b>notifications.</b> The findings <b>of</b> this research revealed the importance of implementing and using systems for making systematic records of material evaluations as a basis for efficient management regarding the maximization of economic resources...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates an odour {{incident}} {{that occurred in}} April 2008 with an initially unknown source and cause which resulted in hundreds <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> odour <b>complaints</b> across England. Detailed analysis of the incident illustrates how {{a combination of the}} geographical distribution of odour reports together with Met Office data and back-trajectory modelling can be utilised to trace the source location and source term of the odour. The analysis suggests that the source of the odorant was not locally generated and that long range transport from Northern Europe was the likely explanation. This requires potentially exceptional source strength so that dilution at distance is sufficient to lead to odour perception thousands of km away. The proposed cause is suggested to be wide-spread spreading of agricultural slurry. This is common practice in Europe during the spring, and has implications for future reports of odour travelling extensive distances and resulting in long-range pollution events...|$|R
6000|$|Glancing {{down the}} page, our eyes are greeted {{everywhere}} by {{the offer of}} lands at auction, for sale or to be leased, not by the rightful owners, but a rebel committee; notices of the town constable, that he is authorized to receive the taxes on such all estate, in default of which, that also is to be knocked down to the highest bidder; and <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> filed by the attorney-general against certain traitorous absentees, and of confiscations that are to ensue. And who are these traitors? Our own best friends; names as old, once as honored, as any in the land where {{they are no longer}} to have a patrimony, nor to be remembered as good men who have passed away. We are ashamed of not relinquishing our little property, too; but comfort ourselves because we still keep our principles, without gratifying the rebels with our plunder. Plunder, indeed, they are seizing everywhere,--by the strong hand at sea, as well as by legal forms oil shore. Here are prize-vessels for sale; no French nor Spanish merchantmen, whose wealth is the birthright of British subjects, but hulls of British oak, from Liverpool, Bristol, and the Thames, laden with the king's own stores, for his army in New York. And what a fleet of privateers--pirates, say we--are fitting out for new ravages, with rebellion in their very names! The Free Yankee, the General Greene, the Saratoga, the Lafayette, and the Grand Monarch! Yes, the Grand Monarch; so is a French king styled, by the sons of Englishmen. And here we have an ordinance from the Court of Versailles, with the Bourbon's own signature affixed, as if New England were already a French province. Everything is French,--French soldiers, French sailors, French surgeons, and French diseases too, I trow; besides French dancing-masters and French milliners, to debauch our daughters with French fashions! Everything in America is French, except the Canadas, the loyal Canadas, which we helped to wrest, from France. And to that old French province the Englishman of the colonies must go to find his country! ...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the stated Brazilian policy on {{medicines}} that their quality, effectiveness and safety should be ensured at reasonable cost, hospitals in the ANVISA Surveillance Network have been receiving <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>complaints,</b> adverse reactions and suspected therapeutic ineffectiveness (STI) of medicines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the medicines notified for suspicion of therapeutic ineffectiveness, at a university hospital participating in the national Surveillance Network, and to investigate the existence of polymorphs of any of the drugs involved, by examining the literature. There were 31 <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> STI in a period of 18 months, concerning 11 different drugs, all of which were 'similar' drugs (neither original nor licensed by originator); five of these could contain polymorphs, according to the literature. However, this does not mean that the other drugs could not contain some unknown polymorphs, more studies being needed on polymorphism, especially in the cases of reported therapeutic ineffectiveness. Therefore, tests of polymorphism should be made part of the routine quality control of the raw materials during the development of medicines and in the studies of pharmaceutical equivalence to 'reference' medicines (innovative brands). The stability test should also involve a study of polymorphism, in order to confirm the solid state stability of the drug. All these measures will assure the effectiveness of medicines, since the reproducibility in the quality of pharmaceutical products could be monitored, as well as the equivalence of each production batch with the batch selected to determine the bioequivalence with the reference brand...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to critically analyze data <b>of</b> the National <b>Notification</b> System for Adverse Events and Technical Complaints (Notivisa) related to central venous catheters, through an evaluation of the description <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> recorded between 2006 and 2009. Methods: Notifications were categorized and evaluated to: (i) determine the number of adverse events and technical complaints, (ii) verify compliance with the classification criteria defined by the legislation, (iii) reclassify notifications, when necessary, in order for them to fit in with the legal definitions, (iv) verify registered companies in Brazil, (v) quantify the notifications according to the registered company and product lot, and (vi) identify the country of original of the notified product. Microsoft Excel&# 174; 2010 was used to categorize and systematize the data. Results: Some conceptual errors and incomplete records were found. Altogether, 228 <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>complaints</b> and 119 <b>of</b> adverse events were identified. Some notifications on guidewires and broken catheters were reported which led to the necessity of duplicating some medical procedures and to the occurrence of lesions/lacerations of vessels and tissue injury. Forty-seven percent of companies presented at least one notification in Notivisa and in all, 38 product lots had more than one notification. Conclusion: These data support a necessity for cooperation between all entities of the National Health Surveillance System to check compliance of this type of product and to properly report adverse events and technical complaints. It is also important to incorporate minimum standards for the management of technologies in health services, including in the acquisition of products and training of staff...|$|R
40|$|Odour {{pollution}} is {{generally regarded as}} a local issue. The long range transport of odorants at levels sufficient to generate odour complaints far from their source is not normally given serious consideration, let alone subject to legislation. We argue that such an event led to an odour incident affecting much of southern and eastern England and use emission and dispersion modelling to support the contention. The specific incident discussed in this paper occurred in April 2008 with an initially unknown source and cause that resulted in hundreds <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> odour <b>complaints</b> across affected regions of England. Detailed analysis of the incident illustrates how {{a combination of the}} geographical distribution of odour reports together with emission and dispersion modelling can be utilised to trace the source location and source term of the odour. Two levels of dispersion modelling were applied. One was a simple integral model, which was used for quick feasibility and sensitivity studies, and the other a detailed trajectory and meteorological model from the UK Met. Office. Both approaches were used to assess the range of emission rates required to explain the incident. The analysis suggests that the source of the odorant was indeed not local, with Germany and the Benelux Countries the likely source region. The proposed source, sufficient to lead to odour perception hundreds of kilometres away, is the widespread application of agricultural slurry or manure. This is common practice in Europe during the spring and this has implications for future reports of odour travelling extensive distances and resulting in long range pollution events. The likelihood of further long range odour incidents in the UK is discussed, as are the general implications of the case study. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
