Having very small, ridged teeth {{they could not}} have chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E
5|$|Abebe {{returned}} to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard.|$|E

Catherine does <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> that a stalker from their past has resurfaced and has been posting polaroids of the family to Black. Black has meanwhile been persuaded by his fellow Group member Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell) that his family is in no immediate risk.|$|E

5|$|The {{first trial}} series {{consisted}} of three shots. All bombs were dropped and detonated over Malden Island, and exploded high in the atmosphere, rather than being detonated on the ground, {{in order to reduce}} the production of nuclear fallout. British scientists were aware that the Americans had been able to reduce fallout by obtaining most of the bomb yield from fusion instead of fission, but they did <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> how to do this. Amid growing public concern about the dangers of fallout, particularly from strontium-90 entering the food chain, a committee chaired by Sir Harold Himsworth was asked to look into the matter. Another, in the United States chaired by Detlev Bronk, also investigated. They reported simultaneously on 12 June 1956. While differing on many points, they agreed that levels of strontium-90 were not yet sufficiently high to be of concern.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{is elected}} {{president}} of the Troubletones, and tells Santana that she should play fair against New Directions from now on. Santana makes a rare apology to Finn in the school hallway, but her so-called apology consists of a series of insults. As she walks away, Finn retaliates by telling her {{to come out of the}} closet, and calls her a coward for constantly tearing others down while not accepting herself and her relationship with Brittany. A couple of days later, Santana is told by Sue and Burt that the niece of one of their opponents in the election overheard the conversation between her and Finn, and said opponent is about to release an attack ad that criticizes Sue for choosing a lesbian as head cheerleader. Santana runs out of the office in tears, saying that her parents do <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> she is gay. The episode concludes with the Troubletones' mash-up of Adele songs. The moment the performance ends, Santana jumps down from the stage, blames Finn for outing her to the world and slaps him in the face.|$|E

5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> {{the name of the}} man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street {{whether or not they were}} headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E
5|$|McBride & the Ride {{was created}} in 1989 when Tony Brown, then the {{executive}} vice president of MCA Records, decided to establish a new country music band in order to compete with Alabama, who he thought was falling out of favor with country radio. At the time, guitarist Ray Herndon (born July 14, 1960) was serving as a backing musician for Lyle Lovett, then a recording artist for MCA. Brown suggested that Herndon join lead vocalist Terry McBride (born September 16, 1958), whom Herndon did <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know,</b> in the new band that Brown had planned. McBride, a musician since childhood, had worked as a backing musician for his father, Dale McBride, and later for Delbert McClinton and Rosie Flores. At the Fan Fair in Nashville, Tennessee, Brown introduced McBride and Herndon to drummer Billy Thomas (born October 24, 1953), who had previously played for Emmylou Harris and Mac Davis, and the band's lineup was in place. Brown had also chosen steel guitarist Steve Fishell to be a fourth member, but Fishell declined and chose to work as a record producer instead. The trio pitched their songs through the assistance of songwriters Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth, and four of those demos ended up on the band's first album.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{scientists}} did <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> {{the reason for}} Genie's fear of cats and dogs the Riglers used their puppy {{in an effort to}} acclimate her, and after approximately two weeks she entirely overcame her fear of their dog but continued to be extremely afraid of unfamiliar cats and dogs. Marilyn worked with Genie to help overcome her ongoing difficulty with chewing and swallowing, which took approximately four months. She also tried to help Genie become more attuned to her body's sensations, and in late 1973 Curtiss recorded the first instance of Genie showing sensitivity to temperature. Although Genie deliberately did the least she possibly could in both Curtiss' and the Riglers' estimation, throughout her stay her physical health substantially improved.|$|E
25|$|The party then learns of {{one last}} hope of {{stopping}} Melodia and Malpercio: the Magnus of Life. This power is {{counter to the}} End Magnus which currently empower Malpercio, and that this power was used to create Kalas and his brother, Fee. Kalas, however, was too human for Geldoblame's liking and only had one wing, so Geldoblame had ordered his termination. This leads Georg to blow up his laboratory with explosives and secretly flee to Mira with Kalas and Fee in tow. Due to being a creation of the Magnus of Life, however, Kalas is empowered by it, though he does <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> how to tap into this power. The group decide to tie up some loose ends from their journey so they can learn to harness the Magnus of Life's tremendous power. While they are doing this, it is decided that the islands shall launch a massive assault against Cor Hydrae's barrier. The purpose {{is to create a}} hole in it so Kalas' party can enter by flying the White Dragon into it.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} {{can also}} have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the coarticulated nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping, while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word cat compared to the word cot. The initial hard c is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one prepares to say cat, and the more limp position as one prepares to say cot. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically do <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>know</b> the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ight in right) is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) {{can be helpful in}} promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.|$|E
