40|$|AbstractTerminally-differentiated cells {{cease to}} proliferate and acquire {{specific}} sets of expressed genes and functions distinguishing them from less differentiated and cancer cells. Mature granulocytes show lobular structure of cell nuclei with highly condensed chromatin in which HP 1 proteins {{are replaced by}} MNEI. These structural features of chromatin correspond to low level of gene expression {{and the loss of}} some important functions as DNA damage repair, shown in this work and, on the other hand, acquisition of a <b>new</b> <b>specific</b> <b>function</b> consisting in the release of chromatin extracellular traps in response to infection by pathogenic microbes. Granulocytic differentiation is incomplete in myeloid leukemia and is manifested by persistence of lower levels of HP 1 γ and HP 1 β isoforms. This immaturity is accompanied by acquisition of DDR capacity allowing to these incompletely differentiated multi-lobed neutrophils of AML patients to respond to induction of DSB by γ-irradiation. Immature granulocytes persist frequently in blood of treated AML patients in remission. These granulocytes contrary to mature ones do not release chromatin for NETs after activation with phorbol myristate- 12 acetate- 13 and do not exert the neutrophil function in immune defence. We suggest therefore the detection of HP 1 expression in granulocytes of AML patients as a very sensitive indicator of their maturation and functionality after the treatment. Our results show that the changes in chromatin structure underlie a major transition in functioning of the genome in immature granulocytes. They show further that leukemia stem cells can differentiate ex vivo to mature granulocytes despite carrying the translocation BCR/ABL...|$|E
40|$|Terminal {{differentiation}} is {{the process}} by which cycling cells stop proliferating to start <b>new</b> <b>specific</b> <b>functions.</b> It involves dramatic changes in chromatin organization as well as gene expression. In the present report we used cell flow cytometry and genome wide DNA combing to investigate DNA replication during murine erythroleukemia-induced terminal cell differentiation. The results obtained indicated that the rate of replication fork movement slows down and the inter-origin distance becomes shorter during the precommitment and commitment periods before cells stop proliferating and accumulate in G 1. We propose this is a general feature caused by the progressive heterochromatinization that characterizes terminal cell differentiation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new theoretical approach {{based on the}} concept of velocity singularities developed by Mateescu for airfoils in subsonic flows and for wing-body systems in supersonic regime. The present approach uses the velocity singularities in the Trefftz plane to derive the contributions of the wing incidence and chord changes in the solution of the circulation variation along the wing span. The <b>new</b> <b>specific</b> <b>functions</b> derived for these contributions contain both natural and forced symmetry and anti-symmetry terms, and represent the first correct mathematical modeling of the physical problem. The new forced symmetry and anti-symmetry terms and the new contributions of the incidence and chord distribution changes, which were missing from the previous methods, determine a high level of accuracy of the solution, which is free of spurious oscillations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new method of {{solution for the}} aerodynamics of finite-span wings, which overcomes the difficulties of the previous methods. The present method uses velocity singularities in the Trefftz plane (situated downstream at infinity) to derive the contributions in {{the solution of the}} circulation distribution caused by the changes in the spanwise variation of the wing chord and incidence. The <b>new</b> <b>specific</b> <b>functions</b> derived for these contributions contain both natural and forced symmetry and antisymmetry terms, and thus represent a correct mathematical modeling of the physical problem. The correct mathematical representation of these contributions leads to a highly accurate theoretical solution which is not the case in the previous methods. The method has been validated in comparison with the results obtained by theoretical methods such as Rasmussen & Smith, and Carafoli for rectangular and tapered wings of uniform incidence, and with panel method (Katz & Plotkin) results. Accurate theoretical solutions have been derived for various wing geometries of aeronautical interest, such as wings with curved leading and trailing edges, and wings with asymmetric incidence variations caused by symmetric and antisymmetric deflection of flaps and ailerons (which are more difficult to model using the panel methods). Furthermore, the present method of solution has been extended {{to solve the problem of}} swept wings. A procedure has been developed to specifically treat this problem...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{develops}} {{a method to}} design shielded printed microwave filters based on Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks. Genetic Algorithms techniques have been applied in the microwave optimization problems, but they are usually very time consuming. Thanks to the Neural Networks, the Genetic Algorithms operation time in the filter design task is reduced. The Neural Networks approximates the Green’s functions employed in the Integral Equation approach. This neural method allows fast analysis of any printed circuit inside the shielded structure. In order to improve the Genetic Algorithm performance a <b>new</b> <b>specific</b> fitness <b>function</b> suitable to microwave problems has also been developed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{boundary}} layer theory for singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations in the unit circle. Two characteristic points appear, (± 1, 0), {{in the context of}} the equations considered here, and singularities may occur at these points depending on the behaviour there of a given function f, namely, the flatness or compatibility of f at these points as explained below. Two previous articles addressed two particular cases: [24] dealt with the case where the function f is sufficiently flat at the characteristic points, the so-called compatible case; [25] dealt with a generic non-compatible case (f polynomial). This survey article recalls the essential results from those papers, and continues with the general case (f non-flat and non-polynomial) for which <b>new</b> <b>specific</b> boundary layer <b>functions</b> of parabolic type are introduced in addition. close 0...|$|R
30|$|Mutants play {{important}} roles for identifying <b>new</b> genes with <b>specific</b> <b>functions.</b> Many {{methods have been}} applied to generate loss-of-function mutations, {{including the use of}} ethyl methanesulfonate, fast-neutron treatment, antisense and RNA interference technology, and insertion mutations by a transposable element or T-DNA (Bolle et al. 2011). These methods have produced a large number of mutant pools in Arabidopsis (Alonso et al. 2003; Berardini et al. 2004; Lamesch et al. 2012), rice (Zhang et al. 2006; Krishnan et al. 2009) and maize (Andorf et al. 2015). However, these approaches do not likely discover the genes that are redundant or essential for early embryo development, as these mutations may cause embryo lethality that gives no offsprings. Gain-of-function strategy works efficiently to overcome these shortcomings, which enhances gene expression to generate mutation phenotypes (Weigel et al. 2000; Nakazawa et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|The author {{continues}} {{his study of}} the functions of religion. The ﬁrst section is devoted to a description of the various approaches to a functional analysis of religion suggested by members of the Bielefeld School of Sociology (Franz-Xaver Kaufmann, Hans Küng, Niklas Luhmann), by Thomas O’Dea, as well as by Russian experts: Yablokov, Tokarev, and Kagarov. In this context, the author studies the question regarding the functionality speciﬁc to religion, particularly in relation to magic. The author suggests that the post-modern paradigm allows him to deﬁne and describe a <b>new</b> and <b>speciﬁc</b> <b>function</b> of religion: that of culpabilisation. In order to explain and better deﬁne this function (that of sensing or placing guilt), the author turns to a study of the origins of the feelings of guilt and the way guilt is deﬁned by semantics and metaphysics. Guilt feelings are described in the works of some of the foremost experts in the ﬁ eld of twentieth century philosophy and theology: René Girard (anthropologist), Gilles Deleuse and Paul Ricoeur (philosophers), Karl Rahner (theologian) and Julia Kristeva (semiotician), together with concepts drawn from Freud (psycho-analytics) and Pitirim Sorokin (sociology). All these are representative of the post-modern paradigm and worked in the ﬁelds of classical or non-classical paradigms. The author concludes that religious culpabilisation precedes the institution of organized religion and the setting apart of a priesthood or professional clergy. Its development is set along the following logical chain of the development of phenomena: Soteriology — Eschatology — Hamartology — Theodicy — Culpabilisation...|$|R
40|$|Proteins are {{essential}} molecules {{composed of a}} linear sequence of amino acids found in all organisms and participating in many physiological processes. The threedimensional structure a protein adopts, as defined by its unique sequence, determines the biological role of the protein. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure is vital in understanding how proteins function and this understanding is a crucial step in designing and engineering <b>new</b> proteins with <b>specific</b> <b>functions.</b> The unique sequence of a protein is so important for function, that the mutation of any single amino acid can disrupt the entire fold and thereby function of a protein by upsetting the balance of interacting forces within the protein. Structure based calculations of the relative activity of a protein after a mutation is an important problem since small mutations can lead to complete loss of function of the protein, and subsequently, to disease. However, predicting the functional outcome of mutations is very difficult, even when sufficient structural data are available. To date, few studies exist that have tried to correlate mutant protein function with biochemical measurement, and in fact, {{those that have been}} successful examine the stability of the protein, not the functional outcome. In this thesis I develope...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} eight years the {{structure}} of Topographical Database of green areas has been implemented and consolidated: originally born to manage green areas in Milan, it is now used in other cities. Beside the optimizations achieved in data management (i. e. relationship between data and working process, updating procedures, exhaustive Index of Items) it is now becoming important an optimization in data acquisition: this is the reason why a test was started involving the use of LiDAR technology for surveying those green areas classified as equipped parks (over 50. 000 sqmt), {{as an alternative to the}} traditional topographycal survey. LiDAR technology is commonly applied to forestry surveying and green mass computation, even in urban contexts, achieving good results also in automation of data processing. Nevertheless this testing activity has a specific aim, that is to derive (also using the contextual orthophoto) as many layers as possible among the ones described by the Specifications on Green areas TDb, preserving the high level of thematical detail and accuracy suggested by the Specifications. To do this, using the application Laserweb © for visualization and interaction with the point cloud, <b>new</b> and <b>specific</b> <b>functions</b> and layouts have been designed and implemented. For each item of the index has been made an effort to encode the optimal strategy for exploring the cloud and exporting the datum. The variety of the elements included in the Specification Index of Items is very differentiated, therefore also the procedures in point cloud analysis are various, as the main purpose of this work is to exploit all the potential information contained in a point cloud...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} such as Bordetella bronchiseptica modulate host immune {{responses to}} enable their establishment and persistence; however, the immune response is generally successful in clearing these bacteria. Here, we model the dynamic {{outcome of the}} interplay between host immune components and B. bronchiseptica virulence factors. The model extends our previously published interaction network of B. bronchiseptica and includes the existing experimental information on the relative timing of IL 10 and IFNg activation {{in the form of}} qualitative inequalities. The current model improves the previous one in two directions: (i) by augmenting the network with <b>new</b> nodes with <b>specific</b> <b>function</b> in T helper cell differentiation and effector mechanisms and (ii) by using a dynamic approach that allows us to quantify node states and mechanisms revealed to be important from our previous model. The model makes predictions about the time scales of each process, the activity thresholds of each node and novel regulatory interactions. For example, the model predicts that the activity threshold of IL 4 is higher than that of IL 12 and that pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the activity of Th 2 cells. Some of these predictions are supported by the literature, and many can serve as targets of future experiments...|$|R
40|$|Chromatin {{diminution}} in the parasitic nematodes Ascaris suum and Parascaris univalens {{represents a}} rather complex molecular phenomenon that includes chromosomal breakage, DNA degradation and new telomere formation. At a given elimination site, DNA breakage and new telomere addition {{does not take}} place at a single chromosomal locus but at many different places within a several kilobase long chromosomal region, referred to as chromosomal breakage region (CBR). Here we describe the cloning and the characterisation of seven CBRs from A. suum and P. univalens and we show that {{the process has been}} conserved between the two species. A detailed sequence comparison provides evidence that the sequences of the CBRs and their flanking regions are not directly important for the specification of the elimination sites. Six out of the seven CBRs are conserved between the two nematode species, suggesting that they have already existed in a common ancestor. We present a hypothesis stating that the elimination process ensures the maintenance of a functional somatic genome and concomitantly allows extremely rapid and profound changes in the germ line genome, thereby allowing the development of <b>new</b> germ line <b>specific</b> <b>functions</b> and thus providing a selective advantage for the chromatin eliminating nematodes during further evolution...|$|R
