40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} opioids {{is that they}} inhibit pain that persists from previous injuries without eliminating either the initial pain of a new injury or the protective reflexes triggered by it. Here we ask whether selective expression of the �-opioid receptor (MOR) gene in primary nociceptors (pain-sensing neurons) might contribute to this aspect of opioid specificity. We quantified single-cell levels of MOR mRNA and measured opioid inhibition of Ca channels on identified nociceptors and low-threshold mechanosensors (non-nociceptors) isolated from rats. Negligibly few non-nociceptors express MOR mRNA, thereby rendering nonpain sensations insensitive to opioids. <b>Nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> nociceptors <b>of</b> <b>all</b> size classes also fail to express MOR mRNA or to respond to opioids. Among the opioid-responsive nociceptors, a gene dose–response relationship exists such that maximal opioid inhibition occurs when the MOR mRNA concentration of a cell is � 15 pM. Almost all large, myelinated nociceptors express MOR mRNA below this level, whereas small, unmyelinated nociceptors are likely to express above it. Because myelinated nociceptors mediate anti-nociceptive reflexes, the data suggest that fine control of the MOR mRNA level contributes to a complex neural trait: the ability of opioids to suppress persistent pain without preventing response t...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that 50 {{marks the beginning of}} old age. While many still hold to this construct, individuals at 50 actually have <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> their lives ahead of them. With advancements in medicine and a surge in both health and wellness, today, life expectancy can reach 83 years of age and, in the next 20 years, will reach 90 years of age. This is a considerable shift from a century ago, when the average life expectancy reached only 47 years old. The new life expectancy is the underpinning of the new face of aging.

40|$|<b>Nearly</b> one <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> pregnancies in the United States are {{unintended}} {{despite the}} availabil-ity of {{safe and effective}} contraceptives. The morbidity and mortality from unintended preg-nancy are not insignificant. Currently available hormonal contraceptives are very effective, safe, and available for most American women. National and international institutions have removed the pelvic examination as a requirement for initiating the prescription for hormonal contraceptives, substituting instead a medical history and a blood pressure measurement. However, problems with uneven access, prescription requirements, conflicting information on the package instructions for initiating and continuing use, and incorrect perceptions of ex-cess risk of contraceptive products may lead women to use them less than effectively or not at all. Newer progestins {{have been shown to}} have more risk of thrombosis than older for-mulations, instead of improved safety. In considering how hormonal contraceptives might be made safer, recommendations are made for improved availability and effective use. These in-clude expanding the numbers and types of providers and the compensation for these services; reconsidering the need for prescription; revising labels to reflect the safety of the current for-mulations; communicating the safety of the current formulations; encouraging the use of the older progestins; exploring alternate schedules, such as extended or continuous oral contra-ceptive (OC) use; promoting same-day initiation of methods rather than waiting for menses; and ensuring universal access to emergency contraception as an adjunct to effective ongoing contraceptive methods. 5...|$|R
