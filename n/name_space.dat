5|$|Space Cavern was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo. Company founder Pat Roper had flown programmer Ed Salvo to a Consumer Electronics Show to show him the Imagic video game Demon Attack. Impressed with Imagic's game, Roper {{decided he wanted to}} produce one similar to it. He told developer Dan Oliver what he wanted in the game without disclosing his inspiration. Space Cavern was released in 1982. Game publisher Panda rereleased an identical version of Space Cavern under the <b>name</b> <b>Space</b> Canyon the following year, and an Atari 5200 port was started but not completed.|$|E

25|$|The Domain Name System delegates the {{responsibility}} of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated <b>name</b> <b>space</b> to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.|$|E

40|$|The Spring {{operating}} system provides a uniform name service {{that can be}} used to associate any name with any object independent of the type of object, and allows arbitrary <b>name</b> <b>spaces</b> to be created and used as first-class objects. We have used this name service to unify the many UNIX ® <b>name</b> <b>spaces.</b> Objects that on UNIX systems are typically stored in separate <b>name</b> <b>spaces</b> are all accessible via a single uniform name service in Spring. In addition, it is easy to add new Spring objects that are not currently available in UNIX systems without modifying the underlying name service. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experiment}} is described which replicates recent name mapping work, and delves {{further into the}} detailed structure of colour <b>naming</b> <b>space.</b> Observers freely <b>named</b> 1044 CRT-displayed colour-background combinations, sampled regularly along the (u′,v′) axes of the 1976 UCS, and along a luminance axis. Three response measures — response times, confidence ratings and consistencies — were obtained. These measures were collapsed by principal components analysis (PCA) into ‘nameability’, a single measure of ease of naming of colours. The structure of colour <b>naming</b> <b>space</b> {{and the use of}} different colour name types, were investigated. Data confirmed the uniqueness of basic colour terms as compared with the non-basic terms, agreeing with previous constrained naming studies. Colour <b>naming</b> <b>space</b> was found to exhibit regular structure, which appears to be linked to fundamental response categories, and to previous observations that colour <b>naming</b> <b>space</b> may be divided into five major regions...|$|R

6000|$|But {{if another}} should come and make to himself another idea, {{different}} from Descartes's, of the thing, which yet with Descartes he calls {{by the same}} name body, and make his idea, which he expresses by the word body, to be of a thing that hath both extension and solidity together; he will as easily demonstrate, {{that there may be}} a vacuum or space without a body, as Descartes demonstrated the contrary. Because the idea to which he gives the <b>name</b> <b>space</b> being barely the simple one of extension, and the idea to which he gives the name body being the complex idea of extension and resistibility or solidity, together in the same subject, these two ideas are not exactly one and the same, but in the understanding as distinct as the ideas of one and two, white and black, or as of CORPOREITY and HUMANITY, if I may use those barbarous terms: and therefore the predication of them in our minds, or in words standing for them, is not identical, but the negation of them one of another; [viz. this proposition: 'Extension or space is not body,' is] as true and evidently certain as this maxim, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO BE, [can make any proposition.] ...|$|E
