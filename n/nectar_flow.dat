40|$|Larvae, artificially {{infected}} when 0 to 1 day {{old with}} Streptococcus pluton (White) {{and placed in}} colonies, were usually ejected by adult bees. Ejection was delayed from colonies deprived either of unsealed brood or their queen, or which were reinforced with adult bees. The feces of surviving larvae whose weight was subnormal, contained many viable cells of S. pluton. Colonies reinforced with unsealed brood removed more infected larvae than usual. It is concluded that infected larvae are ejected when larval food is merely adequate, {{as it may be}} when a colony is growing rapidly; and they are kept when larval food is more abundant, as it may be when brood rearing is retarded. Natural outbreaks of disease occurred when brood-rearing, in colonies heavily infected with S. pluton, was increasing during <b>nectar</b> <b>flows,</b> which was also when secondary infection with Bacterium eurydice White increased. At such times, larvae heavily infected with both organisms may die quicker than they are being removed. At the same time infection of new larvae with S. pluton seemed to decrease: transmission of S. pluton was presumably checked by the death and ejection of unsealed larvae. Thus outbreaks usually seemed to be self-limiting.

40|$|International audienceThis review {{considers}} how a {{honey bee}} colony optimally controls {{the timing and}} type of new comb construction. Optimal timing requires bees to balance the energy costs of construction with the opportunity costs of lacking storage space during <b>nectar</b> <b>flows.</b> They do so by conditioning the start of building on (1) the attainment of a fullness threshold, and (2) the availability of nectar. A dynamic optimization model has suggested that this rule is slightly suboptimal, but may compensate for this by its simplicity and generality. The emergence of this collective strategy from the decisions of individual bees is poorly understood, but recent experiments have {{cast doubt on the}} long-standing idea that building is triggered by increased distension of the crops of nest bees. Bees also regulate the relative amounts of drone and worker comb in their nests, with important consequences for their sex investment strategy. Regulation depends on the inhibitory effect of drone comb on further drone comb construction, mediated through a decentralized process requiring that workers have direct contact with the comb. Contact by the queen is not required, nor is the presence of drone brood, although the latter may enhance the strength of inhibition...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of a bee colony follows an annual cycle of growth that begins in spring with a rapid expansion of the brood nest, as soon as pollen is available for feeding larvae. Some production of brood may begin as early as January, even in a cold winter, but breeding accelerates towards a peak in May (in the northern hemisphere), producing an abundance of harvesting bees synchronized to the main <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> in that region. Each race of bees times this build-up slightly differently, {{depending on how the}} flora of its original region blooms. Some regions of Europe have two nectar flows: one in late spring and another in late August. Other regions have only a single <b>nectar</b> <b>flow.</b> The skill of the beekeeper lies in predicting when the <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> will occur in his area and in trying to ensure that his colonies achieve a maximum population of harvesters at exactly the right time.|$|E

There are two ways of measuring the weight of the colony: 1) automatic measurements, which can be made using industrial scales; 2) manual weight measurements.|$|E

The research has shown that supplemental feeding of the bee colony in late winter in order to encourage the rapid spring development is justified. Namely, at the final measurements in April, the results showed differences between groups.

40|$|When a {{honey bee}} swarm leaves the colony it {{is faced with}} a tough dilemma; it must collectively locate, choose between and {{coordinate}} movement to the best quality nesting cavity it can find. The process of nest-site selection in the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the best studied example of collective decision-making in the social insects. But A. mellifera {{is only one of}} eleven species within the genus Apis. Furthermore, the genus can be split into three categories based on nesting biology; cavity nesters (e. g. A. mellifera), dwarf open nesters (e. g A. florea) and giant open nesters (e. g. A. dorsata). Both open nesting groups are migratory, following seasonal <b>nectar</b> <b>flows.</b> Dwarf open nesters build small colonies on shrub and tree branches, while due to their size giant open nesters are limited to nesting on large smooth surfaces such as the branches of large trees. In this thesis I test whether differences in nesting biology influence the decision-making processes used by these species. Creating swarms of A. florea and A. dorsata I found that unlike A. mellifera, neither of these species go through a process of waggle dance decay. In contrast to A. mellifera, A. florea scout bees did not frequently leave the swarm surface to re-evaluate sites being danced for, while A. dorsata took off from the swarm surface regularly. My results demonstrate that the decision-making process of A. florea is the simplest within the genus, with the decision-making process of A. dorsata appearing to be intermediate between the quality independent process of A. florea and the quality dependent process of A. mellifera. By forcing A. mellifera swarms to the air prior to the final phase of their decision-making process I demonstrated that they are unable to successfully guide themselves. My results suggest that quorum detection {{plays an important role in}} priming scouts to become swarm guides...|$|R

I meticulously study every step of nectar capture and ingestion. My dissertation chapters are organized following a morpho-functional and feeding sequence approach: 1) Feeding Apparatus Morphology; with emphasis on the understudied morphology of the tongue grooves and bill tongue coupling. 2) Tongue Tip Dynamics; how hummingbird tongues entrap nectar. 3) Tongue Grooves Functioning: how the tongue acts as an elastic micropump while collecting nectar. 4) Bill Tip Mechanics; internal bill structures that aid in offloading nectar from the tongue. 5) Intraoral Transport: how the <b>nectar</b> <b>flows</b> inside the bill to the throat where it can finally be swallowed. My results demonstrate that capillarity equations are unsuitable to calculate energy intake rate, which is the building unit of foraging theories; therefore a {{development of a new}} theoretical framework to study hummingbird energetics and foraging ecology is needed. I describe previously unknown methods of tongue-based nectar collection, report undocumented tongue and bill structures, and offer the first test of intraoral transport hypotheses. I followed the scientific method cycle of deduction and induction. To understand the determinants of hummingbird feeding mechanics in an ecological context, I tested biophysical model predictions using data from wild birds. Elucidating the drinking mechanism of hummingbirds will facilitate downstream calculations of the rates at which birds can obtain nectar along several environmental axes (e. g. altitudinal and latitudinal ranges, migrations, corolla morphology, etc.). This will in turn inform how and where the limits of nectar uptake have shaped the distribution, ecology and evolution of hummingbirds. With their enchanting appeal and unique physical capabilities, hummingbirds captivate people of all ages. As such, they serve as ambassadors to the natural world, fostering public appreciation for scientific and conservation efforts aimed at preserving these fascinating birds, and the biodiversity upon which they depend...|$|R

Nectaries of similar structure are found in both types of these flowers. The nectary gland located {{on the surface of the}} receptacle belongs to interstaminal nectaries. It has the form of a fleshy ring situated between the petals and the pistil. The bases of the staminal filaments are located in the depressions of the nectary. The outer diameter of the nectary reaches ca. 5 mm, while the thickness of this gland’s tissues is 400 - 700 μm. In the epidermis of the nectary gland, there are numerous, evenly distributed stomata through which nectar re-lease occurs. The stomata function asynchronously. In some stomata, we could observe <b>nectar</b> drops <b>flowing</b> out and a layer of this secretion around the stomata. The secretory parenchyma of the nectary is composed of several layers of thick-walled cells, whereas the ends of the vascular bundles with xylem and phloem elements are situated in the subglandular parenchyma.

50|$|Hummingbird top-fill feeders {{are popular}} among bird lovers {{because they are}} easy to fill and clean and also because they {{do not need to be}} turned upright which means that there are less chances that the nectar is spilled. The sports bottle top-fill hummingbird feeders have the design of a sports bottle, with a {{mechanism}} that works similarly to such a bottle.

After the cap is replaced, the body of the nectar reservoir can be pulled up. This type of bird feeder has the advantage that the feeder does not need to be turned upside down to be refilled and which results in less nectar wasted by spilling. The traditional top-fill hummingbird feeders are one of the most popular types.

Consequently, {{it is important to understand}} how the phenology of both pollinators and plants will be influenced by global climate change. Current satellites allow a near-daily synoptic view of the entire earth, but it is difficult linking the imagery with in situ events because of the difference in scale between a point and pixel. Due to their generalized foraging on a variety of plants in the 100 km 2 surrounding their hive, honey bees operate at a scale which may be compared to satellite data. The MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites produce daily images of the earth and the Normalized Differentiation Vegetation Index (NDVI) is able to show the “green-up” or start of spring (SOS).

This research investigates the link between smoothed, gap-filled NDVI data, and weight gain of hives in Slovenia, Switzerland, Belgium and Finland during 2009 - 2012. No correlation was found between the SOS and HBNF start day, but a notable relationship (R 2 = 0. 73) was seen between NDVI SOS and HBNF midpoint (50 % day) within the Alps and broadleaf forests of central Europe.

Honey bee colonies fed sublethal concentrations of imidicloprid (0, 5, 20 and 100 ppb) over 6 weeks in field trials at a desert site (Arizona), a site near intensive agriculture (Arkansas) and a site with little nearby agriculture but abundant natural forage (Mississippi) were monitored with respect to colony metrics, such as adult bee and brood population sizes, as well as pesticide residues. Hive weight and internal hive temperature were monitored continuously over two trials in Arizona. Colonies fed 100 ppb imidacloprid in Arizona had significantly lower adult bee populations, brood surface areas and average frame weights, and reduced temperature control, compared to colonies {{in one or more}} of the other treatment groups, and consumption rates of those colonies were lower compared to other colonies in Arizona and Arkansas, although no differences in capped brood or average frame weight were observed among treatments in Arkansas.
