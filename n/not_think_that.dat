5|$|Though Wilhelm was {{primarily}} a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective {{for more than a}} few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.|$|E
5|$|As Chen {{was born}} in a culture other than the culture he now lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, but he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was {{operating}} on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto {{was the size of}} Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, there would not be a Kuiper belt today.|$|E

5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|Following District Judge Earnest Lau's {{ruling in}} the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the confidentiality of subscribers' information and prohibits unauthorised release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a chilling effect on free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} FDR another five years, {{with the help}} of the League of Women Voters to replace Stevens. Making the {{argument}} that Stevens was appointed by the Conference of the Pan-American States and not as a U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give permanent status to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with Mary Nelson Winslow. Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with Eleanor Roosevelt backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens. Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and on a personal level, she believed Stevens behaved in an unladylike manner.|$|E

[...] "I {{have heard}} some chicken-mouthed folk say Hurl-Gate, {{but this is}} the first time I ever heard it called Whirl-Gate--they'll get it to Whirligig-Gate next. I do <b>n't</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> my old commander, Capt. Budd, called the passage {{anything}} but honest up and down Hell-Gate." ...|$|R

5|$|Pitching {{exclusively}} in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm {{finished in the}} top ten in Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish that high. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased to 7â€“8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any of the catchers could handle his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of camels in Mesopotamia {{but not in}} Israel {{is not a new}} idea. The historian Richard Bulliet did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the occasional mention of camels meant that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that time. The archaeologist William F. Albright writing even earlier saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.|$|E
25|$|Apollo program {{director}} Sam Phillips {{was quoted as}} saying that he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all.|$|E
25|$|Starting to {{move his}} army toward Jetersville at 1:00p.m. with Longstreet's corps in the lead, Lee {{discovered}} that his route to Danville was blocked by fast-moving Union cavalry.

25|$|However, in a {{television}} show later that same day, he went to state he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he was qualified for office and not even for any elected office.

25|$|Kate then visits Professor Clarkville {{to further}} discuss the situation.

25|$|On 31 March, TEPCO {{reported}} that it had measured radioactivity in the plant-site groundwater which was 10,000 times the government limit.

Some debris around the plant {{has been found to}} be highly radioactive, including a concrete fragment emanating 900mSv/h.|$|E
