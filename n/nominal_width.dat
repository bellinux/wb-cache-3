5000|$|Because {{the east}} and west edges of townships, called [...] "range lines", are meridians of longitude, they {{converge}} towards the North Pole. Therefore, the north edge of every township is slightly shorter than the south. Only along the baselines do townships have their <b>nominal</b> <b>width</b> from east to west. The two townships to the north of a baseline gradually narrow as one moves north, and the two to the south gradually widen as one moves south. Halfway between two base lines, wider-than-nominal townships abut narrower-than-nominal townships. The east and west boundaries of these townships therefore do not align, and north-south roads that follow the survey system have to jog to the east or west. These east-west lines halfway between baselines are called [...] "correction lines".|$|E
5000|$|The wheel size is the {{diameter}} of the wheel in inches where the beads of the tire sit on the wheel. This measurement does not include the rim flange. Modern road tires have several measurements associated with their size as specified by tire codes like 225/70R14. The first number in the code (e.g., [...] "225") represents the nominal tire width in millimeters. This is followed by the aspect ratio (e.g.,"70"), which is the height of the side wall expressed {{as a percentage of the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>width.</b> [...] "R" [...] stands for radial and relates to the tire construction. The final number in the code (e.g.,"14") is the rim size measured in inches. The overall circumference of the tire will increase by increasing any of the tire's specifications. For example, increasing the width of the tire will also increase its circumference, because the side wall height is a proportional length. Increasing the aspect ratio will increase the height of the tire and hence the circumference.|$|E
50|$|The new boiler {{made the}} {{so-called}} Reko-01 (Reko {{is short for}} Rekolokomotive) into the most powerful German express train steam locomotive. In addition to a combustion chamber and the well-known IfS mixer-preheater, the 01.5's boiler was fitted with three full bore boiler safety valves (Ackermann valves, <b>nominal</b> <b>width</b> 60). The engines were given Trofimoff valves and, apart from 01 501 and 01 520, new welded cylinders. The new boiler came with a new, welded driver's cab with upholstered seats, side-pull regulator and other improvements to the working conditions of the locomotive crew, {{as well as an}} Indusi system. The latter was required for the border-crossing traffic to Bebra and Hamburg-Altona and services on the Dresden-Berlin line. Because the coupled wheelsets on many engines had to be replaced due to fractured spokes, eight examples were fitted with Boxpok wheels made of cast iron, like those already used in the Soviet Union and the United States. These did not prove themselves, however, due to manufacturing defects and were later swapped out for spoked wheels from retired 01s. In order to hide the ugly wheelsets, the Boxpok locomotives and several other vehicles were fitted with full skirts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the performance and}} design of free-space optical (FSO) communication links over slow fading channels from an information theory perspective. A statistical model for the optical intensity fluctuation at the receiver due to the combined effects of atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors is derived. Unlike earlier work, our model considers the effect of beam width, detector size, and jitter variance explicitly. Expressions for the outage probability are derived {{for a variety of}} atmospheric conditions. For given weather and misalignment conditions, the beam width is optimized to maximize the channel capacity subject to outage. Large gains in achievable rate are realized versus using a <b>nominal</b> beam <b>width.</b> In light fog, by optimizing the beam width, the achievable rate is increased by 80 % over the <b>nominal</b> beam <b>width</b> at an outage probability of 10 − 5. Well-known error control codes are then applied to the channel and shown to realize much of the achievable gains.

Was (and is) 35 mm <b>nominal</b> <b>width</b> (1⅜ inch actual width), acetate base, double perforated film, pre-loaded into felt-lipped, daylight-loading cartridges ready-to-use for still cameras. Originally intended for Kodak Retina, Zeiss Ikon Contax and E. Leitz Leica 35 mm rangefinder cameras. Previously, bulk rolls of 35 mm motion picture film {{would need to}} be user cut and loaded, in complete darkness, into camera specific cartridges or magazines. The September 1936 release of Kodachrome (the first high speed 8 equivalent, realistic color film) in standardized 135 format (but not medium format roll film) spurred explosive growth in the popularity of all types of miniature format 35 mm cameras. The vast majority were not high-end SLRs or RFs, but basic amateur RFs such as the nearly three million selling Argus C3 (USA) of 1939. Originally, each US$3.50 (including processing) Kodachrome cartridge gave eighteen exposures if the camera used the 24×36 mm frame size (double the frame size of 35 mm cine cameras) established by the Multi-Speed Shutter Co. Simplex (USA) camera of 1914 and popularized by the E. Leitz Leica A (Germany) of 1925. The 24×36 mm frame size did not become the universal standard frame size until the early 1950s. Note that 135 film cameras using non-standard frame sizes, such as 24×18 mm or 24×24 mm, continued to be made into the early 1990s. Panoramic 135 film cameras using extra-wide aspect ratio frame sizes (up to 24×160 mm for the 360° revolving slit Globuscope USA of 1981) were still available in 2006.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of nanofabrication techniques for creating high aspect ratio (∼ 50 : 1) sub- 10 nm silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with smooth, uniform, and straight vertical sidewalls using an {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) etching process at 20 &# 176;C is reported. In particular, {{to improve the quality}} and flexibility of the pattern transfer process for high aspect ratio SiNWs, hydrogen silsesquioxane, a high-resolution, inorganic, negative-tone resist for electron-beam lithography has been used as both the resist for defining sub- 10 nm patterns and the hard mask for etching the underneath silicon material. The effects of SF 6 /C 4 F 8 gas flow rates, chamber pressure, platen power and ICP power on the etch rate, selectivity, and sidewall profile are investigated. To minimize plasma-induced sidewall damage, moderate plasma excitation power (ICP power of 600 W) and low ion energy (platen power of 6 – 12 W) were used. Using the optimized etch process at room temperature (20 &# 176;C), the authors have successfully fabricated sub- 10 nm SiNWs, which have smooth vertical sidewall profile and aspect ratios up to ˜ 50 : 1. This optimized etch combined with a controlled thermal oxidation allows the realization of consistent, reproducible, and reliable SiNW devices with <b>nominal</b> <b>widths</b> from 100 nm down to sub- 5 nm in silicon on top of SiO 2 fabricated on silicon on insulator substrates...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} with liquid–vapor {{phase change}} in microchannels can support very high heat fluxes {{for use in}} applications such as the thermal management of high-performance electronics. However, the effects of channel cross-sectional dimensions on the two-phase heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop have not been investigated extensively. In the present work, experiments are conducted to investigate the local flow boiling heat transfer of a dielectric fluid, Fluorinert FC- 77, in microchannel heat sinks. Experiments are performed for mass fluxes ranging from 250 to 1600 kg/m 2 s. Seven different test pieces made from silicon and consisting of parallel microchannels with <b>nominal</b> <b>widths</b> ranging from 100 to 5850 lm, all with a nominal depth of 400 lm, are considered. An array of temperature sensors on the substrate allows for resolution of local temperatures and heat transfer coefficients.

Also, heat transfer coefficients and boiling curves are independent of mass flux in the nucleate boiling region for a fixed channel size, but are affected by mass flux as convective boiling dominates. A strong dependence of pressure drop on both channel size and mass flux is observed. The experimental results are compared to predictions from a number of existing correlations for both pool boiling and flow boiling heat transfer...|$|R
