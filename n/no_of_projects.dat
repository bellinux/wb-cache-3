40|$|Abstract Before an {{outsourced}} software project officially {{begins the}} contracting or supplier organization has already expended effort. Although project start and start-up effort impact on project success {{in most cases}} these are undefined concepts. There are <b>no</b> clear definitions <b>of</b> <b>project</b> start, start-up or the activities that should be completed before project start either in the literature or in practice. Ambiguity around project start sets up risks to the profitability <b>of</b> a <b>project</b> and therefore makes the real success <b>of</b> a <b>project</b> not only uncertain but difficult to measure. A vague project start also makes comparisons between projects and between organizations unreliable. In this paper, we describe a pilot study that reviews project start, project start-up, and project start date, and then investigates what the key activities of the supplier are normally performed by the end <b>of</b> the <b>project</b> start-up phase. We use interviews with software supplier practitioners to define those key activities. ...|$|R

40|$|Project risk {{management}} includes {{the process of}} risk identification, analysis, and handling (response). Risk handling/response is {{the choice of a}} proper strategy to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of risk events and/or the magnitude of their negative impact. Research on risk handling is mostly opinion- or case-based and, as such, it offers scant guidelines for making the decision. Managers often choose a risk-handling strategy based on their experience or preference toward risk, with <b>no</b> consideration <b>of</b> <b>project</b> characteristics (e. g., project size, slack, or technical complexity) and the associated financial implications. This study assumes that the choice of the risk-handling strategy should be aligned with unique project characteristics. This study constructed a conceptual framework that defines the relationship between risk-handling strategy and relevant project characteristics. A conceptual model was developed to describe the quantitative relationships among all variables. Accordingly, optimization analysis is performed to derive a minimum-cost risk-handling strategy for a particular risk event. The findings provide insights into how various project characteristics and risk situation affect the choice of a risk-handling strategy. ...|$|R
