5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E

Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony. The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were {{supportive}} of the protest, {{and a number of}} them made their own black armbands during the match. In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E

She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E

The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E
5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled {{to fly in}} this mission, {{as he had done}} on the 17 June flight. Pellerin was unavailable for the flight on 24 June and Wolff was selected as the replacement aircrew member. Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the pre-flight briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. Thus, Wolff was <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of the planned mission profile and did not have an opportunity to raise any objections before take-off.|$|E

5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while the problem was solved.|$|E
