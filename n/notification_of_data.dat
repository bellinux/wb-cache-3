Data credentials such as SSN’s are used by thieves to setup fraudulent credit and perform other illegal activities associated with stealing a person’s identity. The University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO) has legal and ethical responsibilities to protect this sensitive data. Failure to do so could result in economic or social harm to individuals, loss of the public’s confidence in the University’s ability to protect sensitive data and legal liability for damages incurred. The State of Nebraska approved LB 876, known as the Consumer <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Data</b> Security Breach Act of 2006, in April of 2006.

40|$|Mandatory {{data breach}} {{notification}} laws are a novel and potentially important legal instrument regarding organisational protection of personal information. These laws require organisations that {{have suffered a}} data breach involving personal information to notify those persons that may be affected, and potentially government authorities, about the breach. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) has proposed {{the creation of a}} mandatory data breach notification scheme, implemented via amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). However, the conceptual differences between data breach notification law and information privacy law are such that it is questionable whether a data breach notification scheme can be solely implemented via an information privacy law. Accordingly, this thesis by publications investigated, through six journal articles, the extent to which data breach notification law was conceptually and operationally compatible with information privacy law. The assessment of compatibility began with the identification of key issues related to data breach notification law. The first article, Stakeholder Perspectives Regarding the Mandatory Notification of Australian Data Breaches started this stage of the research which concluded in the second article, The Mandatory <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Data</b> Breaches: Issues Arising for Australian and EU Legal Developments (‘Mandatory Notification‘). A key issue that emerged was whether data breach notification was itself an information privacy issue. This notion guided the remaining research and focused attention towards the next stage of research, an examination of the conceptual and operational foundations of both laws. The second article, Mandatory Notification and the third article, Encryption Safe Harbours and Data Breach Notification Laws did so from the perspective of data breach notification law. The fourth article, The Conceptual Basis of Personal Information in Australian Privacy Law and the fifth article, Privacy Invasive Geo-Mashups: Privacy 2. 0 and the Limits of First Generation Information Privacy Laws did so for information privacy law. The final article, Contextualizing the Tensions and Weaknesses of Information Privacy and Data Breach Notification Laws synthesised previous research findings within the framework of contextualisation, principally developed by Nissenbaum. The examination of conceptual and operational foundations revealed tensions between both laws and shared weaknesses within both laws. First, the distinction between sectoral and comprehensive information privacy legal regimes was important as it shaped the development of US data breach notification laws and their subsequent implementable scope in other jurisdictions. Second, the sectoral versus comprehensive distinction produced different emphases in relation to data breach notification thus leading to different forms of remedy. The prime example is the distinction between market-based initiatives found in US data breach notification laws compared to rights-based protections found in the EU and Australia. Third, both laws are predicated on the regulation of personal information exchange processes even though both laws regulate this process from different perspectives, namely, a context independent or context dependent approach. Fourth, both laws have limited notions of harm that is further constrained by restrictive accountability frameworks. The findings of the research suggest that data breach notification is more compatible with information privacy law in some respects than others. Apparent compatibilities clearly exist as both laws have an interest in the protection of personal information. However, this thesis revealed that ostensible similarities are founded on some significant differences. Data breach notification law is either a comprehensive facet to a sectoral approach or a sectoral adjunct to a comprehensive regime. However, whilst there are fundamental differences between both laws they are not so great to make them incompatible with each other. The similarities between both laws are sufficient to forge compatibilities but {{it is likely that the}} distinctions between them will produce anomalies particularly if both laws are applied from a perspective that negates contextualisation...|$|E

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, is a {{major cause}} of {{bacterial}} meningitis and septicemia worldwide. Infection in most cases leads to asymptomatic carriage and only rarely to disease. Meningococcal disease often occurs in outbreaks, which are both sporadic and highly unpredictable. The occurrence of disease outbreaks in a host population in which the etiological agent is widely carried is not well understood. A potential explanation {{lies in the fact that}} meningococci are diverse with respect to disease-causing potential. We formulated a stochastic mathematical model to investigate whether diversity of the bacterial population is related to outbreaks of meningococcal disease. In the model, strains that occasionally cause the disease appear repeatedly in a population dominated by a nonpathogenic strain. When the pathogenicity, i. e., the disease-causing potential, of the pathogenic lineage was low, the model shows distinct outbreaks, the size distribution of the outbreaks follows a power law, and the ratio of the variance to the mean number of cases is high. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>data</b> <b>of</b> meningococcal disease showed that the ratio of the variance to the mean was significantly higher for meningococcal diseases than for other bacterial invasive diseases.

The main problem in such a system is the management and distribution <b>of</b> the keying <b>data</b> to the clients in a secure way, including rekeying when a user leaves the group.

In this paper, it is demonstrated that a highly secure file backup mechanism {{can be achieved}} by combining technologies that implement the following: spatial random scrambling <b>of</b> file <b>data,</b> subsequent random fragmentation of the file, the duplication and encryption of each file fragment using a stream cipher code in each encryption stage, and the corresponding <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the history <b>data</b> <b>of</b> the encryption key code sequence used in "encryption metadata". If a disaster should occur in the data backup center, prompt data recovery can be easily and securely achieved by making use of a massive number of widely distributed wired PCs, mobile PCs, cellular phones managed by multiple supervisory servers which are secretly diversified but functionally combined. In an experimental evaluation, encryption performance, spatial scrambling performance and the average response time from the Web server have been estimated in terms of the memory load characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>data</b> center. Discussion is also provided on an effective shuffling algorithm to determine the dispersed location sites.

5000|$|Privacy {{researcher}} Pam Dixon, {{founder of}} the World Privacy Forum, coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006. In the report, she defined the crime {{for the first time}} and made the plight of victims public. The report's definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person. Insurance theft is also very common, if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card, they can seek medical attention posing as yourself. [...] In addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft, the thief's medical history may be added to the victim's medical records. Inaccurate information in the victim's records is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctors relying on the misinformation to deliver inappropriate medical care. After the publication of the report, which contained a recommendation that consumers receive <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>data</b> breach incidents, California passed a law requiring this, and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people. Data collected and stored by hospitals and other organisations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information.|$|R
