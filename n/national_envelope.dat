40|$|A {{communication}} containing {{proposals for}} {{reform of the}} EU olive-oil regime was forwarded by the European Commission to the EU Council and European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003. There are concerns that a complete conversion into a single decoupled payment scheme could lead to land abandonment in traditional olive-growing areas, so partial decoupling, with 60 % of payments to be decoupled and incorporated into the single farm payment scheme is proposed. 40 % of payments are to remain within <b>national</b> <b>envelopes,</b> nominally not linked to production but linked {{to the maintenance of}} olive groves, the soil and the environment. Full details of the reform proposals and their likely impact {{can be found in the}} Commission communication to the Council and European Parliament (COM (2003) 544 final). It is anticipated that adhesion to the single farm payment scheme will result in more stable incomes for olive-oil producers, due to the greater efficiency of direct aid payment schemes in getting money into farmers pockets.

It intends to reduce significantly the discrepancies between the levels of payments obtained between farmers, between regions and between Member States. All Member States will be obliged to move towards a uniform payment per hectare at national or regional level by the start of 2019. In line with the Commission proposals within the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the <b>national</b> <b>envelopes</b> for direct payments will be adjusted so that those that receive less than 90% of the EU average payment per hectare will receive more.

40|$|Estimates of {{mortality}} in Thailand during 2005 have been published, integrating multiple data sources including national vital registration {{and a national}} follow-up cluster sample, covering both deaths in health facilities (approximately one-third) and elsewhere. The methodological challenge {{is to make the}} best use of the existing data, supplemented by additional data that are feasible to obtain, in order to arrive at the best possible overall estimates {{of mortality}}. In this case, information from the national vital registration database was supplemented by a verbal autopsy survey of approximately 2. 5 % of deaths, the latter being used to validate routine cause-of-death data and information from medical records. This led to a revised <b>national</b> cause-specific mortality <b>envelope</b> for Thailand in 2005, amounting to 447, 104 deaths.

40|$|The ongoing global {{effort to}} detect {{gravitational}} waves continues {{to push the}} limits of precision measurement while aiming to provide a new tool for understanding both astrophysics and fundamental physics. Squeezed states of light offer a proven means of increasing the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, potentially increasing {{the rate at which}} astrophysical sources are detected by more than 1 order of magnitude. Since radiation pressure noise {{plays an important role in}} advanced detectors, frequency-dependent squeezing will be required. In this paper we propose a practical approach to producing frequency-dependent squeezing for Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and similar interferometric gravitational wave detectors. This work focuses on “realistic filter cavities” in the sense that optical losses in the filter cavity and squeezed light source consistent with current technology are considered. The filter cavity solution proposed for Advanced LIGO is “practical” in that it considers the nonquantum noise and readout scheme of the interferometer and a potential implementation geometry in the Advanced LIGO vacuum <b>envelope.</b> <b>National</b> Science Foundation (U.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, the σ[superscript E] {{transcription}} factor monitors and maintains outer membrane (OM) integrity by activating genes required for assembly {{of its two}} key components, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by transcribing small RNAs to down-regulate excess unassembled OMPs. σ[superscript E] activity is governed by the rate of degradation of its membrane-spanning anti-σ factor, RseA. Importantly, the DegS protease can initiate RseA cleavage only when activated by binding to unassembled OMPs. The prevalent paradigm {{has been that the}} σE response is controlled by the amount of activated DegS. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of a second negative regulator, the periplasmic protein RseB, is also required for σ[superscript E] induction in vivo. Moreover, OMPs, previously known only to activate DegS, also generate a signal to antagonize RseB inhibition. This signal may be lipid related, as RseB is structurally similar to proteins that bind lipids. We propose that the use of an AND gate enables σ[superscript E] to sense and integrate multivariate signals from the <b>envelope.</b> <b>National</b> Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|<b>National</b> audienceAim Bioclimatic <b>envelope</b> {{models are}} often used to make {{projections}} of species' potential responses to climate change. It can be hypothesized that species with different kinds of distributions in environmental niche and geographical space may respond differently to changes in climate. Here, we compare projections of shifts in species ranges with simple descriptors of species niche (position and breadth) and geographical (range size) distributions. Location Europe. Methods The future distribution for 1200 European plant species were predicted by niche-based models using seven climate variables known to {{have an important role}} in limiting plant species distributions. Ecological niche properties were estimated using a multivariate analysis. Species range changes were then related to species niche properties using generalized linear models. Results Generally, percentage of remaining suitable habitat in the future increased linearly with niche position and breadth. Increases in potential suitable habitat were associated with greater range size, and had a hump-shaped relationship with niche position on temperature gradient. By relating species chorotypes to percentage of remaining or gained habitat, we highlighted biogeographical patterns of species sensitivity to climate change. These were clearly related to the degree of exposure according to regional patterns of projected climate change. Main conclusion This study highlights general patterns about the relationships between sensitivity of species to climate change and their ecological properties. There is a strong convergence between simple inferences based on ecological characteristics of species and projections by bioclimatic ‘envelope' models, confirming macroecological assumptions about species sensitivity based on niche properties. These patterns appear to be most strongly driven by the exposure of species to climate change, with additional effects of species niche characteristics. We conclude that simple species niche properties are powerful indicators of species' sensitivity to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{payments}} have progressively {{become the}} largest and most visible form of support in the CAP tool-box. Analyses on direct payments have always highlighted a large inequality in their distribution, both between Member States and, within them, among farmers and territories where, on one side, a relevant amount of payments is concentrated {{in the hands of a}} few beneficiaries; on the other, a small share of support is divided among many heads. The European Commission has faced the problem of the volume and the distribution of the direct payments with two main instruments: the modulation and the capping. Modulation was originally conceived as a temporary tool aimed at filling the gap between pillars, but in the last years it has changed shape and rules alongside with the CAP process path and it has become one of the milestones of the CAP tool-box. The capping has received high attention during each step of the recent CAP reform process, however, it has been never implemented so far. Both the instruments have relevant implications about the total amount of payments received by farms and by the Member States and about their distribution; however, the way they are implemented and combined together is crucial to fully evaluate their effects. The main goal of this paper is to reconstruct the evolution of modulation in the process of CAP reform, from the voluntary one launched by Agenda 2000 till the most recent proposal of the CAP Health Check, that combines in one single tool modulation and direct payments’ capping. Simulations of the most recent proposal of modulation show that the goal of Pillar 2 reinforcement has prevailed over the distributional one, through the creation of a sort of <b>national</b> <b>envelope</b> that shifts resources from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2, even though it is not very clear so far how and for what that envelope will be spent. Moreover, the capping goal within the progressive modulation is not very effective and only affects to some limited extent direct payments in few Member States.
