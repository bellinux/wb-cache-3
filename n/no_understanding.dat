Improved {{transport}} and communications facilitated the spread of new cultural influences, along with dealings with outside companies with <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of Welsh, trade union meetings held in English, the coming of radio, cinema and then television and cheap English newspapers and paperback books; all were factors in the absorption of the English language.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{he acted}} {{on the ground}} of his enemy's choosing, not of his own, and {{on the basis of}} meager {{information}} and almost <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of the ground, he broke all the military tactical rules of his own devising. He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in pointless charges across soft, spongy ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than en masse; of course, he could not send his cavalry en masse because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's armies again {{broke into}} the Ottoman Empire, {{but they could not}} {{recapture}} Chilia or Cetatea Albǎ. The Tatars of the Great Horde invaded southern Moldavia, but Stephen defeated them {{with the support of the}} Crimean Tatars in 1502. He also sent reinforcements to Hungary to fight against the Ottomans. By then, however, the treaty with Poland was no longer enforced, prompting Stephen to recapture Pocuția in 1502. Although Alexander of Lithuania was by then the new King of Poland, <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> could be reached between him and Stephen, and the two became enemies. At around that time, Luca Arbore, acting either as Stephen's envoy or on his own, stated a Moldavian claim to Halych and other towns of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Hungary and the Ottoman Empire concluded a new peace treaty on 22 February 1503, which also included Moldavia. Thereafter Stephen again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|After Hitler's {{attack on}} the Soviet Union, both the Polish Government in Exile and the Ukrainian OUN-B {{considered}} the possibility that {{in the event of}} mutually exhaustive attrition warfare between Germany and the Soviet Union, the region would become a scene of conflict between Poles and Ukrainians. The Polish Government in Exile, which wanted the region returned to Poland, planned for a swift armed takeover of the territory as part of its overall plan for a future anti-Nazi uprising. This view was compounded by OUN's prior collaboration with the Nazis, that by 1943 <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> between the Polish government's Home Army and OUN was possible.|$|E
25|$|Without any {{agricultural}} crops {{or experience}} gathering, preparing and eating the ground acorns and grass seeds the Indians subsisted on {{for much of}} the year, the shortage of food at San Diego became extremely critical during {{the first few months of}} 1770. They subsisted by eating some of their cattle, wild geese, fish, and other food exchanged with the Indians for clothing, but the ravages of scurvy continued because there was then <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of the cause or cure of scurvy (a deficiency of vitamin C in fresh food). A small quantity of corn they had planted grew well, only to be eaten by birds. Portolá sent Captain Rivera and a small detachment of about 40 men south to the Baja California missions in February to obtain more cattle and a pack-train of supplies.|$|E
25|$|As Minister for Finance, Haughey on two {{occasions}} arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries (Germany and the United States), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to Irish punts and depositing them in the Exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional, because it effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making a currency speculation against his own currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General Eugene Francis Suttle, Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions. The debate was very short and the record shows <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of the issue by the opposition finance spokesmen, O'Higgins for Fine Gael and Tully for Labour. The legislation was passed on 26 November 1969.|$|E

25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the twentieth century, the {{fundamental}} macroscopic laws of thermodynamics had been formulated and although techniques existed to measure temperature using empirical techniques, the scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} temperature was minimal. Maxwell and Boltzmann had produced theories describing the inter-relational of temperature, pressure and volume of a gas on a microscopic scale but otherwise, in 1900, there was <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of the microscopic or quantum nature of temperature. [...] Within the metric system, temperature was expressed in degrees Centigrade with the definition that ice melted at 0°C and at standard atmospheric pressure, water boiled at 100°C. A series of lookup tables defined temperature in terms of inter-related empirical measurements made using various devices.|$|E
500|$|In his 1980 {{commentary}} on the story, Dick also suggested that his reasoning for making Bors sympathetic {{was a result of}} a form of trust he advanced towards robots, as opposed to androids.

One of the themes that runs throughout all of Dick's fiction is the [...] "power of empathy" [...] and he uses it as the [...] "key element defining the authentic human being". For example, when Silvia meets the robot that runs the government, she exclaims [...] "My God, you have <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of us. You run all this, and you're incapable of empathy.

500|$|Although {{encouragement}} to keep Indigenous languages alive {{was present in}} some schools, a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society was to suppress Indigenous languages and culture. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. Teachers responded by strictly prohibiting {{the use of these}} languages despite many students having little or <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of English or French. The practice of traditional and spiritual activities including the Potlatch and Sun Dance were also banned. Some survivors reported being strapped or forced to eat soap when they were caught speaking their own language. [...] The inability to communicate was further affected by their families' inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors felt ashamed for being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities as ugly and dirty.|$|E
500|$|Native Americans {{opposed to}} mascots {{point to the}} oversimplification of their culture by fans [...] "playing Indian" [...] with <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of the deeper meaning of feathers, face paint, chants, and dancing. Richard Lapchick, {{director}} emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, wrote: [...] "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in black face at a game? Yet go to a game {{where there is a}} team with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?" [...] The unofficial mascot of the Redskins team was Zema Williams (aka Chief Zee), an African American man who attended games beginning in 1978 dressed in a red faux-"Indian" [...] costume, complete with feathered war bonnet and tomahawk. Other fans often dress in similar costume for the games.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{prototype}} cartridge of the English NES Final Fantasy II was produced, the project was, by Moriyama's own admission, {{still far from}} complete; [...] "We had so very limited memory capacity we could use for each game, and it was never really [...] "translating" [...] but chopping up the information and cramming them back in... our boss had <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> in putting in extra work for the English version at that time." [...] In 2003, when the game was finally released to English-speaking audiences as part of Final Fantasy Origins, it was released with new graphics, music, and a brand new translation {{under the supervision of}} Akira Kashiwagi. A fan translation of the original game was also created prior to the release of Origins, and makes use of an original translation as the existence of the prototype cartridge was not common knowledge at the time.|$|E

500|$|An {{argument}} {{exists that}} the women's suffrage movement in Wales was not truly 'Welsh', {{based on the}} fact that it was organised and orchestrated by an Anglicised, English-speaking, middle-class movement that had little bearing on the true voice of the country. As it has been shown, the first people to embrace the suffrage movement were English-born and wealthy. Rose Mary Crawshay, was born in Berkshire before moving to Wales after her marriage; Millicent Mackenzie was born in Bristol and University educated. In addition, the societies that sprang up in the wealthier coastal towns of the north and south were run by middle-class women, normally of English background with little or <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> of the Welsh language. Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan, writing in 2000, linked support for women's suffrage from an earlier campaigning group, the temperance movement, and although the temperance movement reached out through Welsh-language periodicals such as Y Frythones and Y Gymraes, she too concluded that the cross-over was [...] "dominated by immigrant middle-class women".|$|E
500|$|Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan [...] (or simply Borat) is a 2006 British-American mockumentary comedy film {{written and}} {{produced}} by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen who also plays the title character, Borat Sagdiyev, a fictitious Kazakh journalist travelling through the United States recording real-life interactions with Americans. The film {{was directed by}} Larry Charles and distributed by 20th Century Fox.

It is the second of three films built around Baron Cohen's characters from Da Ali G Show (2000–04): the first, Ali G Indahouse, was released in 2002, and featured a cameo by Borat, and the third, Brüno, was released in 2009.

500|$|There {{are also}} {{surviving}} gold coins from Offa's reign. One is {{a copy of}} an Abbasid dinar struck in 774 by Caliph Al-Mansur, with [...] "Offa Rex" [...] centred on the reverse.

The coin may have been produced to trade with Islamic Spain; or it may be part of the annual payment of 365 mancuses that Offa promised to Rome. There are other Western copies of Abbasid dinars of the period, but it is not known whether they are English or Frankish. Two other English gold coins of the period survive, from two moneyers, Pendraed and Ciolheard: the former is thought to be from Offa's reign but the latter may belong either to Offa's reign or to that of Coenwulf, who came to the throne in 796. Nothing definite is known about their use, but they may have been struck to be used as alms.|$|E
