40|$|Aging is characterised by {{a decline}} in {{physiological}} function. The rate of this decline can depend on certain lifestyle factors, genetics, and the environment. Although life expectancy is slowly increasing, {{there is a need}} to reduce the time spent in debilitated, and non-independent states by elderly individuals. Preventive measures need to be implemented to reduce dependency and improve the quality of life for elderly individuals. One such preventive and remedial measure is the use of exercise and physical activity. Because limited exercise prescription exists for the elderly population, {{there is a need to}} determine the effectiveness of exercise interventions that are more desirable for elderly individuals. Hence, the purpose of this pilot study was to implement and compare two types of exercise interventions, a holistic exercise intervention (Range of Motion Dance method or ROM) and a Conventional Exercise intervention commonly performed in the community by aged individuals. Forty-three elderly individuals over 65 -years of age were randomly allocated to the two intervention groups and a control group. The exercise interventions were performed for 10 -weeks and included baseline and post-intervention testing. The groups were compared using Analysis of Covariance on the following variables; muscular strength (grip strength, isokinetic knee flexion and extension); postural stability (Berg Balance Scale, and Center of Pressure) : and functionality (Timed 2 ̆ 7 up 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 go 2 ̆ 7 and Physical Performance Test). T-tests were performed to compare the two intervention groups on attrition and compliance. The Conventional Exercise and the ROM exercise groups generally showed similar results on all physiological parameters when compared to each other. However, some statistically significant differences were observed between the intervention groups and the control group for isokinetic knee flexor and extensor strength, grip strength and the Physical Performance Test. Mean differences between post-intervention and baseline results for knee extensor and flexor strength measures ranged between 0. 97 to 5. 78 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> for the Conventional Exercise group; - 6. 00 to 5. 73 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> for 2 ̆ 7 the ROM group and; 8. 74 to 5. 36 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> for the Control group.

Seven nondisabled participants performed a 1 min exercise test at 70 rpm on a hand cycle (HC) fixed to an ergometer in synchronous (SC) mode versus asynchronous (AC) mode and in arm-power (AP) versus arm-trunk-power (ATP) type of propulsion. Higher (p < 0. 001) flexion/extension of the trunk was found during ATP versus AP type and higher (p < 0. 001) lateral flexion and rotation of the trunk in AC versus SC mode. The trunk ROM should explain the different force generation patterns observed in this investigation between AC and SC modes and AP and ATP types. However, kinetic results do not allow the most effective type or mode of propulsion (FEF 2 D: from 72. 9 % to 89. 3 %) to be established. We conclude that trunk movement is an important parameter to consider in ergonomically optimizing hand cycling.

40|$|Abstract Background Exercise {{causes a}} variety of {{physiological}} and metabolic changes that can in turn reduce exercise tolerance. One of the potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue is “exercise-induced hyperammonemia”. Previous {{studies have shown that}} supplementation with amino acids can increase training tolerance. The α-keto acids are biochemical analogs of amino acids and can be converted to amino acids through transamination, thus reducing the cellular ammonia level. This double blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to investigate the effects of α-keto acid supplementation (KAS) on training tolerance, training effect, and stress-recovery state. Methods Thirty-three untrained young male adults underwent four weeks of training (5 sessions/week; 30 minutes running at the individual anaerobic threshold followed by 3 x 3 minute sprints/each session). Throughout the 4 [*]weeks of training and one week of recovery, subjects took α-ketoglutarate (AKG group, 0. 2 [*]g/kg/d, n[*]=[*] 9), branched-chain keto acids (BCKA group, 0. 2 [*]g/kg/d, n[*]=[*] 12) or isocaloric placebo (control group, n[*]=[*] 12) daily.

40|$|A free-air gravity {{map of the}} Guiana Basin between 15 ° N. and 6 ° S. in {{the western}} {{equatorial}} Atlantic, using all available shipboard and pendulum data, is presented. The gravity field is interpreted in terms of short wave-length components directly related to topographic features and a long wave-length regional field which is independent of surface or basement relief. The regional field is negative throughout the survey area, varying from − 15 to − 40 mgal. The magnetic anomalies over the large equatorial fracture zones indicate that the fracture zone trough {{is an area of}} zero or greatly reduced magnetization within a zone in which the magnetization is induced rather than remanent. Only about half of the gravity anomaly over the fracture zone can be assigned to topographic relief implying the presence of excess mass under the fracture zones. The gravity and magnetic evidence together suggest that large fracture zones serve as the site of intrusion of ultrabasic rocks from depth. The deformation of the lithosphere due to the sediment load of the Amazon cone and the resulting gravity anomalies were computed for various flexural rigidities, using two-dimensional elastic beam theory. The value giving the best fit to the observed gravity anomalies in both wave length and amplitude is 2 × 1023 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> (nt m) (2 × 1030 dyne cm).

Exclusion criteria were a history of diabetes, neuromuscular disorder, or recent lower-extremity injury. [...] Main Outcome Measures: Sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane angular displacements (degrees) and peak moments (<b>newton</b> <b>meters)</b> at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. [...] Results: The level of significance was set at P less than. 008. Compared with normal-weight children, overweight children had greater absolute peak joint moments at the hip (flexor, extensor, abductor, external rotator), the knee (flexor, extensor, abductor, adductor, internal rotator), and the ankle (plantarflexor, inverter, external/internal rotators). After including body weight as a covariate, overweight children had greater peak ankle dorsiflexor moments than normal-weight children. No kinematic differences existed between groups. Greater peak hip extensor moments and less peak ankle inverter moments occurred during FW than SW. There was greater angular displacement during hip flexion as well as less angular displacement at the hip (extension, abduction), knee (flexion, extension), and ankle (plantarflexion, inversion) during FW than SW. [...] Conclusions: Overweight children experienced increased joint moments, which can have long-term orthopedic implications and suggest {{a need for more}} nonweight-bearing activities within exercise prescription. The percent of increase in joint moments from SW to FW was not different for overweight and normal-weight children.

Testosterone concentrations increased to 22. 9 ± 10 and 18. 4 ± 9. 2 nmol/L in the T-treated group at 3 and 6 months respectively, while remaining unchanged in the placebo group.

Lean body mass increased and fat mass decreased significantly in the T group by 1. 08 ± 1. 8 and 0. 9 ± 1. 6 kg respectively.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that local muscular fatigue predisposes {{the individual to}} injury. Despite the significance of muscular fatigue and endurance, there are not much dynamic endurance studies for trunk muscles in the literature. Most of them have used isokinetic dynamometer which keeps the velocity of movement constant. In this studies {{with the help of}} an isoinertial dynamometer we have assessed the effect of repetitive and fatiguing flexion-extension movements patterns and motor output. 38 female subjects with no history of low-back pain for the 6 months volunteered for the study. A triaxial dynamometer was used that simultaneously provided measurement of torque, angular position, velocity impulse, work and power of each axis. Resistance were set independently for each axis by an interfaced computer. The subjects performed trunk flexion and extension movement against a saggital plane resistance equal to 50 % of their maximum isometric extension strength in the upright position. The minimum resistance in the coronal and transverse planes were set-up at 5 - 7 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters.</b> The subjects were asked to perform trunk movement as quickly and as accurately as possible while exerting the maximum efforts until exhaustion. Immediately after dynamic test another isometric test was performed. A paired T-test procedure was performed among the selected parameters of the 1 st middle and last 3 repetition cycles. The selected parameters are range of motion, velocity, torque, impulse, work, power, time interval and time of movement. Also, a paired T-test was performed between maximum isometric strength before and after dynamic test. All the selected parameters were significantly reduced in the saggital plane. Subjects displayed significantly less motor control and greater range of motion in the coronal and transverse planes in performing the primary task of flexion and extension. The reduction of the functional capacity of the primary muscles performing the required task is compensated by secondary muscle groups and the spinal structures is located in a more injury prone position, as identified by finite element models. In addition it is suggested that the fatigued muscles would be less able to compensate any perturbation in the load or position of the trunk. The repetitive loading results in a weakening of the viscoelastic passive elements of the spineless structure. The loss of ability to protect these weakened passive elements makes the spine susceptible to industrial and recreational injuries...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} postural control using {{a dynamic}} virtual reality {{environment and the}} relationship between postural metrics and history of falls in patients with glaucoma. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: the study involved 42 patients with glaucoma with repeatable visual field defects on standard automated perimetry (SAP) and 38 control healthy subjects. Methods: Patients underwent evaluation of postural stability by a force platform during presentation of static and dynamic visual stimuli on stereoscopic head-mounted goggles. the dynamic visual stimuli presented rotational and translational ecologically valid peripheral background perturbations. Postural stability was also tested in a completely dark field to assess somatosensory and vestibular contributions to postural control. History of falls was evaluated by a standard questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures: Torque moments around the center of foot pressure on the force platform were measured, and the standard deviations of the torque moments (STD) were calculated as a measurement of postural stability and reported in <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> (Nm). the association with history of falls was investigated using Poisson regression models. Age, gender, body mass index, severity of visual field defect, best-corrected visual acuity, and STD on dark field condition were included as confounding factors. Results: Patients with glaucoma had larger overall STD than controls during both translational (5. 12 +/- 2. 39 Nm vs. 3. 85 +/- 1. 82 Nm, respectively; P = 0. 005) and rotational stimuli (5. 60 +/- 3. 82 Nm vs. 3. 93 +/- 2. 07 Nm, respectively; P = 0. 022). Postural metrics obtained during dynamic visual stimuli performed better in explaining history of falls compared with those obtained in static and dark field condition. in the multivariable model, STD values in the mediolateral direction during translational stimulus were significantly associated with a history of falls in patients with glaucoma (incidence rate ratio, 1. 85; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 30 - 2. 63; P = 0. 001). Conclusions: the study presented and validated a novel paradigm for evaluation of balance control in patients with glaucoma {{on the basis of the}} assessment of postural reactivity to dynamic visual stimuli using a virtual reality environment. the newly developed metrics were associated with a history of falls and may help to provide a better understanding of balance control in patients with glaucoma.
