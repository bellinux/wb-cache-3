5000|$|The {{club was}} always praised for {{depending}} on {{coaches and players}} that had graduated from the club itself, but since the 2011-12 season, the club went a different way by contracting with a professional coach of Swiss <b>nationality</b> (<b>Iraqi</b> origin) called Younis Al-Qattan. But the club's management did not settle on one coach during the season, so they changed the coach seven times during these three years. In the 2011-12 season, the team {{under the leadership of}} Al-Qattan was not successful with two wins, two losses and six draws, so the manager was changed. The team began playing under the leadership of Rahim Hameed and they ended the Premier League in 11th place, and in the 2012-2013 season, the club returned to the local coach Aqeel Hato but this did not last very long as he was sacked having won four matches, drawn four matches and lost two matches, and the team played under the leadership of the young coach Ghazi Fahad afterwards but this also did not last long as he was fired having won five matches, drawn one match and lost five matches. The club then appointed coach Asaad Abdul Razzak [...] who led the team to finish the season in eighth place, having won eight matches and lost six with one draw, and the team began the season relying on foreign players. Al-Mina'a used five foreign professionals from Europe, Africa and Asia in this season.|$|E

40|$|During the Iran-Iraq War of 1980 - 1988, the Iraqi Baʿth party {{engaged in}} the {{production}} of historical narrative, which defined the party's ideal of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>nationality</b> and statehood, while promoting the legitimacy of its military efforts. Public intellectuals {{played an important role in}} the manufacture of such historical narrative. This thesis examines two works produced in the service of this project, Al-Ṣirāʿal-ʿIrāqiyy Fārisiyy, or "The Iraqi-Persian Conflict," and Tārīkh al-Munāzaʿāt wa-l-Ḥurūb Bayn al-ʿIrāq waʾĪrān, or "The History of the Conflicts and Wars Between Iraq and Iran. " It will be demonstrated that these works reflected, and rarified a wartime nationalist discourse permeating the public sphere, in which an ideal of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>nationality</b> and statehood was defined through the demonization of an essentialist Persian other. Pre-Islamic and medieval Islamic history was employed to emphasize episodes of violence and cultural conflict between Iraqis and Iranians, in doing so illustrating the characteristics of both peoples. <b>Iraqi</b> <b>nationality</b> was defined as embodying superlative qualities of governance, military prowess, cultural achievement, and religiosity. Iraqi nationhood was defined and elevated in contrast to an opposite, malicious Persian nationality, rooted in anti-Arab hostility and characterized by inferiority in piety, culture, leadership, and warfare. Direct parallels existed between this nationalist narrative, and public sphere expressions of Baʿthist nationalist discourse, such as government statements, school textbooks, and monument construction...|$|R

In 2013, it was reported that Israel accepted three Kurdish children from Iraqi Kurdistan for medical treatment.

50|$|According to {{the report}} of local authorities, 18 dead bodies were found {{stranded}} at the coast of Thermis west of the island. The survivor, a man of age 20, stated that a total of 28 people of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>nationality,</b> including children, were aboard a small boat, which departed from the Turkish coast shortly after midnight on Thursday. After about one hour of sailing, the boat capsized due to bad weather conditions about 2.2 nmi km before the Greek coast. He added that they had paid US$2,000 per capita for the illegal immigration transport.|$|R

Yaqo was accompanied by 200 armed men which was seen as an act of defiance by the Iraqi authorities. His activities caused distress among the Kurds and the Iraqi government started sending its army to the Dohuk region in order to intimidate Yaqu and dissuade the Assyrians from joining his cause.|$|R

5000|$|The {{persecution}} of the Feyli Kurds, {{also known as}} the Feyli Kurdish genocide, was a systematic {{persecution of}} Feylis by Saddam Hussein between 1970 and 2003. The persecution campaigns led to the expulsion, flight and effective exile of the Feyli Kurds from their ancestral lands in Iraq. The persecution began when a large number of Feyli Kurds were exposed to a big campaign by the regime that began by the dissolved RCCR issuance for 666 decision, which deprived Feyli Kurds of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>nationality</b> and considered them as Iranians. The systematic executions started in Baghdad and Khanaqin in 1979 and later spread to other Iraqi and Kurdish areas.|$|R
2500|$|Croatian police {{violence}} {{has been used}} to intimidate refugees travelling from Serbia into Croatia. This has included segregation of <b>nationalities,</b> with Syrian, <b>Iraqi</b> and Afghani nationals gaining entry to Croatia as refugees much more easily than other nationalities. An unaccompanied sixteen-year-old from Morocco recounted his experience in attempting to gain asylum in Croatia after lying about being a Syrian national: [...] "We had to get into a police car…They told us this is Slovenia, but then it was Serbia…One of my friends tried to run away, but the Croatian police caught [...] him and beat him." [...] Police beatings are illustrative of the systemic discriminatory violence that exists within the Croatian police force.|$|R

50|$|As {{with his}} {{politics}} and his poetry, Rusafi's religious views also courted controversy. His {{belief in a}} mystical interpretation of Islam gave rise in 1934 to what Khulusi considers his Magnum opus, al-Shakhsiyya al-Muhammadiyya aw Hall al-Lughz al-Muqaddas (The Personality of Muhammad or the Solution of the Sacred Enigma). In it he asserted that the Prophet Muhammad was at one with the universe and God, and that his word was that of God. This was Rusafi's interpretation {{of the principle of}} 'revelation' and gave an alternative view to the concept of the 'messenger of God'. His unorthodox religious views were seized upon by his political opponents and used to ferment opposition to him. The situation reached its climax with publication of Rusafi's Rasa'il al-Ta'liqat (The Commentary Epistles) in 1944. This provoked outrage amongst some theologians and demands that he should be 'stripped of his <b>Iraqi</b> <b>nationality</b> and exiled to bilad al-kufr (the land of the infidels)'. When Khulusi was questioned by government officials investigating the matter, he told them that he did not see anything in Rusafi's book beyond the doctrines of Monism and Sufism, {{that he did not know}} where bilad al-kufr was and that those who were agitating against Rusafi should themselves be in bilad al-jahl wa 'l-ta'assub (the realm of ignorance and fanaticism).|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{interviews}} conducted in Amman, Jordan and Louisville, Kentucky posed the following questions: “How is information and communication technology (ICT) use affecting interpersonal communication patterns within the displaced Iraqi community in the US and Jordan?” and “What are the factors that limit the proliferation of {{the internet as a}} communication tool in that community?” Participants were individuals with legal refugee status and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>nationality</b> who left Iraq after the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War. Eight interviews were conducted in Louisville during the summer of 2012 and twelve were conducted in Amman during November 2012. Participants were asked demographic questions, as well as questions about their use of mobile phones and the internet. Based on these interviews and a survey of information collected on mobile phone and internet access in Jordan and Iraq, the researcher concluded that Iraqi refugees primarily utilize ICTs to communicate with relatives abroad. Younger participants in both Jordan and the US use ICTs to communicate with friends more often than older individuals. Participants in Jordan were more likely to call relatives in Iraq instead of using the internet than participants in the US. Interviewees in the US used smart phones, while few in Jordan did. Access issues for Iraqis in Jordan included cost and security concerns. Iraqis in the US had few access concerns. Differences between the two groups can be attributed to resource differences, as most {{of the participants in the}} US came directly from Iraq and came from well-off families and those in Jordan had exhausted their savings while waiting for resettlement. This study expands the information available on the subject of refugees 2 ̆ 7 transnational communication patterns and could be helpful to aid and resettlement organizations in the future...|$|R
