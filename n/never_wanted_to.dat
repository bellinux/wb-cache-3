5|$|Levin was {{commissioned}} by the BBC to visit musical festivals around the world, broadcasting a series of talks about them. Together with Stassinopoulos, he visited festivals in Britain, Ireland, continental Europe and Australia. He later wrote a book, Conducted Tour (1982) on the same subject. By {{the time it was}} published he and Stassinopoulos were no longer together. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> marry or be a father. She concluded that she must break away, and moved to New York in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Rushing to Fiore's house, Mulder and Scully find Michelle using telekinetic {{powers to}} try to kill Fiore. They prevent her from doing so, and Fiore confesses that he, Felder and Barbala had stolen a large sum of money, {{intending}} to keep it safe for ten years before claiming it. Morris learned of their plan and threatened to report on them, and was consequently killed to silence him. However, Fiore maintains that he <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see Morris dead and only wanted {{to take care of}} Anita after his death. Michelle uses her powers to destroy the fish-tank, but spares Fiore after hearing pleas from Anita not to hurt him. Later, Fiore pleads guilty to charges of murder and grand larceny, whilst Michelle seemingly recovers and goes on to become a normal little girl.|$|E

5|$|Brian {{turns down}} {{a chance to}} see Disney on Ice with Jillian, so she decides to give his ticket to Peter. After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.|$|E

25|$|The {{criterion}} of embarrassment {{is also used}} to argue in favor of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as it is a story which the early Christian Church would have <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> invent. Based on this criterion, given that John baptised for the remission of sins, and Jesus was viewed as without sin, the invention of this story would have served no purpose, and would have been an embarrassment given that it positioned John above Jesus.|$|E
25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To {{write a book about}} him would {{definitely}} not be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him.

He chose the squad number 16, due to the fact he often wore it when on international duty, and later claimed he <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave Liverpool but that the chance to work with André Villas-Boas, with whom he had spent a short period of time at Porto, was too good an opportunity to turn down.|$|E

Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped {{it with a}} then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. Contrary to popular belief, Ryan <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be traded from the Mets and felt betrayed by the team that drafted him. His views on this only calmed once he started running the Rangers and gained {{a better understanding of}} the business side of baseball.|$|E
25|$|Actress Björk, who {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a contemporary composer, had rarely acted before, and has described {{the process of making}} this film as so emotionally taxing that she would not appear in any film ever again (although in 2005, she appeared in Matthew Barney's Drawing Restraint 9). She had disagreements with the director over the content of the film, wanting the ending to be more uplifting. She later called von Trier sexist. Deneuve and others have described her performance as feeling rather than acting. Björk has said that it is a misunderstanding that she was put off acting by this film; rather, she <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> act but made an exception for Lars von Trier.|$|E
25|$|Joseph {{was the son}} who <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a businessman, {{and told}} his father {{that he wanted to}} be a farmer when grown up. He demanded his curtains, bedding, carpet, {{everything}} in his room be the color of green. Joseph studied agriculture and ran the farm after the death of his father, in addition to running his own nearby farm. Not liking the mansion's walls being decorated by the beautiful patterns, he painted over them, causing extensive damage. The mansions walls are being renovated as the funds are available, being painstakingly removed by a scalpel, carefully not to damage the original layer. Six layers of paint by Joseph nearly destroyed 171 years of art.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{graduating from}} the university, Sakuraba had {{initially}} thought to remain with Chuo University as a coach. However, {{at the last minute}} he decided to pursue a career as a professional wrestler. According to Sakuraba, the impetus for this stemmed from a childhood dream of one day emulating Satoru Sayama, a professional wrestler who portrayed in real life the famous Japanese cartoon hero Tiger Mask. He also stated in an interview with Scramble TV that as an amateur wrestler, he weighed 68 kilograms (about 150 pounds.) He was encouraged by his peers to gain weight as {{it would be difficult to}} compete as a smaller fighter in 'puroresu', and after working to gain the weight needed to compete, he <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> lose it anymore, something that would be reflected in his MMA career.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of John the Baptist {{within the same}} time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Josephus and {{the overwhelming majority of}} modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.|$|E
25|$|Franklin Pierce was {{a member}} of the U.S. House of Representatives by the time they married and became a U.S. Senator in 1837. She was forced to become the {{political}} wife she <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be. Jane hated life in Washington, D.C., and encouraged her husband to resign his Senate seat and return to New Hampshire, which he did in 1842. She blamed politics for all the troubles in her life including the death of her child and Franklin's excessive alcohol consumption. Service in the Mexican-American War brought him the rank of Brigadier General and local fame as a hero. He returned home safely, and for four more years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshire. Unfortunately their son Frank passed from typhus a year later, causing stress for the entire family and leading to health issues for Jane. In 1842, President James K. Polk offered Franklin the U.S. attorney post; however, due to Jane's objection, he turned it down. A senate seat and New Hampshire governor was also offered, and again he turned it down for family reasons.|$|E
