25|$|Although the {{histories}} of <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> and <b>Native</b> Americans are significantly different, {{there is still a}} widely held perception that <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> have received similar kinds of unfair treatment from the U.S. Government as Native Americans. The Apology Bill is thus seen as a means of acknowledging historical grievances that they believe are valid. Some also see it as a step towards identifying <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> as an indigenous people to preserve for them specific legal rights based on ancestry; some also see it as the beginning of a process to provide compensation or reparation to <b>native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> for alleged past injustices.|$|R

He variously cajoled, shamed and appealed to men's (and women's) egos, and to their desire to be more sexually active.

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} in the native community, White was portrayed negatively in the English-language press in his lifetime and in the published histories after his death. As a consequence of {{his opposition to the}} powers that overthrew the monarchy and later annexed the islands to the United States, White remains obscure in Hawaiian history. Recent research efforts in Hawaiian academia using Hawaiian language sources have shed more light on White and many other early <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> resistant leaders like him.|$|E

5|$|The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{reports that}} many species populations {{have not yet}} fully {{recovered}} from a large-scale shift in the oceanic ecosystem that affected the North Pacific during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This shift reduced populations of important species such as spiny lobster, seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals. Commercial fishing ended in 2011.

5|$|While {{most major}} U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, {{some of which}} have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> {{activities}} that predate Western contact. The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR. Rugby union is considered the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with registered players numbered at 115,000+ and a further 1.2 million participants.|$|E

Mau returned to Honolulu in April 1975 to begin work with the Hawaii-based Polynesian Voyaging Society, eventually navigating the double-hulled canoe, Hōkūle‘a, from Hawaii to Tahiti on its maiden voyage in 1976. Mau trained and mentored <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> navigator Nainoa Thompson, who would later become a master navigator. David Henry Lewis, a scholar of Polynesian navigation, documented Mau's work.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, the Court of Appeals {{concluded}} that [...] "the voting restriction for trustees {{is rooted in}} historical concern for the Hawaiian race ... carried through statehood when Hawaii acknowledged a trust obligation toward <b>native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> ... and on to 1993, when Congress passed a Joint Resolution 'apologizing to <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> {{on behalf of the}} people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii ... and the deprivation of the rights of <b>Native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> to self-determination'." [...] Thus the 9th circuit held that <b>native</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> were entitled to [...] "special treatment" [...] much like the special treatment accorded Native American Indians in Morton v. Mancari, where [...] "preferential treatment that is grounded in the government's unique obligation toward Indians is a political rather than a racial classification, even though racial criteria may be used in defining eligibility." ...|$|R
