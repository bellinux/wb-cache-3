5|$|Although Jordan {{has done}} much to {{increase}} {{the status of the}} game, some of his impact on the game's popularity in America appears to be fleeting. Television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league, and Finals ratings have <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.|$|E
5|$|After King John's {{death in}} October 1216, Neville {{and his son}} made their peace with the new king, HenryIII, John's son. Both men had their lands {{restored}} in 1217, but the offices that the elder Neville had held were <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> quickly. Custody of some royal forests was returned by 1220, but the office of Chief Forester was <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> until some time later. In 1218 Neville {{was supposed to have}} had the forest of Rockingham returned to his custody, but William de Forz, the Count of Aumale, refused to return it. It was not until 1220 that de Neville managed to recover his custody of Rockingham forest. By 1224 Neville was once more Chief Forester, but he never regained the power and influence that he had held under John. When he lost the office for the second time is unclear. The historian C. R. Young states that he held the office until his death in 1234 when it passed to his son John, but Daniel Crook, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, claims that Neville lost the forester office in 1229, to be replaced by John of Monmouth and Brian de Lisle. He also served as Sheriff of Lincolnshire.|$|E

5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|Göth {{believed}} if {{one member}} of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, the entire team must be punished. On one occasion he ordered the shooting of every second member of a work detail {{because one of the}} party had escaped. On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{the onset of the}} first World War, four new ships were purchased: Bermagui, Bonandera, Bodalla and Bergalia. Bodalla was requisitioned for the war effort and {{repurposed}} as a minesweeper, and she was lost in 1924. After the war the company purchased another three vessels: Nergalia, Cobargo and Kianga. Two of these three boats, Nergalia and Kianga, were requisitioned during World War II, but while both survived the hostilities, Kianga was <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to the company after being decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|Mary {{had always}} {{rejected}} the break with Rome instituted {{by her father}} {{and the establishment of}} Protestantism by her brother's regents. Philip persuaded Parliament to repeal Henry's religious laws, thus returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and Pope Julius III had to make a major concession: the monastery lands confiscated under Henry were <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to the church but remained in the hands of their influential new owners. By the end of 1554, the pope had approved the deal, and the Heresy Acts were revived.|$|E
5|$|Reversing the {{traditional}} Link-saves-Zelda plotline, Wand of Gamelon stars Zelda as she adventures to rescue Link {{and her father}} the king who have <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> from their quest. As with Faces of Evil, the game was patterned most closely upon Nintendo's previous side-scroller, , and again features outsourced Russian animation for all cutscenes. Despite the game's similarly positive contemporary reception along with Faces of Evil, modern critics have almost unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability {{to live up to}} modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception.|$|E
5|$|The Hudson Bay territories (known to the English as Prince Rupert's Land) {{were not}} {{significantly}} fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson's Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> its territories, and it successfully lobbied {{for the return of}} its territories in the negotiations that ended this war.|$|E

5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> in open court because the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E
5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} she had <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> {{home by the}} morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body on the back seat. He immediately called the police.|$|E
5|$|William Petit, {{the sole}} {{survivor}} of the home invasion, is an endocrinologist in Cheshire. He survived when he escaped via a direct external exit from the basement despite his injuries.

He contemplated running for Congress as a Republican, but later decided against it. In the following election cycle, he successfully completed a Congressional run and now serves as a state representative.|$|E

5|$|Within days of Operation Berlin, the British {{returned}} to a heroes' welcome in England. A list of 59 decorations was quickly published for the 2,000 men who had returned and an investiture ceremony for the division was held at Buckingham Palace in December.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Australia, {{all members of}} the 9th Division were given three weeks leave. The men were then assembled in their home state capital and took part in a welcome-home march; these marches were conducted both to acknowledge the division's service in the Middle East and advertise a war loan drive. Following the marches the division re-assembled at training camps on the Atherton Tableland in far North Queensland, where it was to complete its training for jungle warfare. The 9th Division next saw action against Japanese forces during the Salamaua–Lae campaign in New Guinea during September 1943; had the division <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> from the Middle East, at least part of this task would have fallen to less-experienced militia units.|$|E
5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the {{proclamation}} of Indonesian independence in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} country. In support of the new Republic, Soegijapranata had an Indonesian flag flown {{in front of the}} Gedangan Rectory; however, he did not formally recognise the nation's independence, owing to his correspondence with Willekens regarding the Church's neutrality. He and his clergy treated injured Dutch missionaries, who had recently been released from internment, at the rectory. The Dutch clergy were malnourished, and several required treatment at a hospital. Some were later taken to Indonesian-run internment camps, but the Catholics were still allowed to look after them. Meanwhile, inter-religious strife led to the burning of several mission buildings and the murder of some clergymen. The government also took several buildings, and some that had been seized by the Japanese were <b>not</b> <b>returned.</b>|$|E

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|Black convinces Birckenbeuhl {{to confess}} {{publicly}} to the hit-and-run, {{in order to}} have his son returned. Birckenbeuhl does so, but continues to maintain his innocence in private. Charlie is <b>not</b> <b>returned,</b> however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one must be taken from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the background noise on the tape that Charlie is being held near the local high school's swimming pool. The boy is rescued, and killer—Edward Petey—is found and arrested. However, the elder Birckenbeuhl is found hanged in his bedroom, driven to suicide by his guilt.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} tiebreaker with long {{histories}} {{of frustration and}} disappointment. California had won the AL West division title on 3 occasions (1979, 1982, and 1986), but failed {{to advance to the}} World Series each time. In particular, the Angels blew a 2–0 series lead in the best-of-five 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers, and were one strike away from defeating the Boston Red Sox in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS but ended up losing that game and the next two to lose the best-of-seven series that they had led 3–1. They had <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to the postseason since the 1986 loss.|$|E
