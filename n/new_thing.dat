25|$|After A Love Supreme was recorded, Ayler's style {{became more}} {{prominent}} in Coltrane's music. A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet {{in the first}} half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, utilization of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, Living Space, Transition, <b>New</b> <b>Thing</b> at Newport, Sun Ship, and First Meditations.|$|E
40|$|The {{freedom to}} try <b>new</b> <b>things</b> plays {{a vital role}} for {{employees}} engaging in creative endeavors. This freedom can be influenced by one's relationship with her supervisor, relationship with her team, and various work pressures. One of the first steps to reaching creative output {{is to have a}} playful attitude toward work where there is encouragement and processes that allow individuals to take risks and try <b>new</b> <b>things.</b> However, we argue that what allows someone to try <b>new</b> <b>things</b> earlier in their career and when they are more established might be different. Noteworthy {{progress has been made in}} conceptualizing the multi-level factors that are important for creativity. In the current study, we identified variables associated with a willingness to try <b>new</b> <b>things,</b> part of the exploration phase of creativity, and divided them by the early and established careers of 59 Nobel Prize winners. Using a historiometric approach, we rated individual and team-level variables to identify what makes someone try <b>new</b> <b>things</b> either earlier or later in her career. Findings indicate that willingness to try <b>new</b> <b>things</b> is related to autonomy, the relationship with one's mentor, team climate, and team network, but not to personal initiative. ...|$|R

25|$|Historians {{have been}} using his diary to gain greater insight and {{understanding}} of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, {{the time he got}} up in the morning, the weather, and what he ate. He talked at length about his new watch (which had an alarm, a <b>new</b> <b>thing</b> at the time) which he was very proud of, a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded, and his cat waking him up at one in the morning. Pepys's diary is one of the only known sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper middle class man during the seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{situation}} in the East, only a punitive expedition could be launched in 167. Both Marcus and Verus led the troops. After the death of Verus (169), Marcus led personally the struggle against the Germans for the great part of his remaining life. The Romans suffered at least two serious defeats by the Quadi and Marcomanni, who could cross the Alps, ravage Opitergium (Oderzo) and besiege Aquileia, the Roman main city of north-east Italy. At the same time the Costoboci, coming from the Carpathian area, invaded Moesia, Macedonia and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders. Numerous Germans settled in frontier regions like Dacia, Pannonia, Germany and Italy itself. This was not a <b>new</b> <b>thing,</b> but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and Marcomannia, including today's Bohemia and Hungary.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a <b>new</b> <b>thing</b> and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

25|$|Partly {{because it}} {{may not always be}} the case that a {{wrongdoing}} trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust. Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged for other things (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the <b>new</b> <b>thing</b> can potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given £22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for Sir Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a get-away to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Plumer, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown an investment manager wrongfully took £20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out £1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid out anyway. The majority of the House of Lords held that clients could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (£400,000). Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon unjust enrichment, as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.|$|E

500|$|Along with musicians D'Angelo and Erykah Badu, Maxwell was {{credited}} with helping to shape the [...] "neo soul" [...] movement that rose to prominence during the late 1990s. Along with D'Angelo's Brown Sugar (1995) and Badu's Baduizm (1997), Urban Hang Suite has been recognized by writers for beginning neo soul's popularity and helping the genre obtain commercial visibility. However, in contrast to D'Angelo, Maxwell was more conventional in his approach on his debut album. The term [...] "neo soul" [...] was penned in the late 1990s by record executive Kedar Massenburg, who managed both D'Angelo and Erykah Badu. According to Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from more classical styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R counterparts. In commenting on the [...] "new soul revival" [...] in music, Maxwell told Entertainment Weekly in 1997 that [...] "everything out there musically was inspired or influenced by something from the past. It's not about creating some super-fresh <b>new</b> <b>thing.</b> If it doesn't lend itself to your history, {{how is it going}} to extend to your future?" [...] According to Kerika Fields, Maxwell received an overwhelmingly positive reaction to his debut album from music listeners due to their weariness of contemporary black music's predictability.|$|E

Of course, it requires greater effort to learn from one's juniors, and their manners are not invariably good.
