5|$|Harris was {{recalled}} from reserve {{status to}} active duty with {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War in 1950. On October 15, 1951, Harris reported to NAS Memphis for a two-month pilot refresher training before being assigned to NAS Pensacola for flight duty. Following this post, Harris served in the Air Warfare Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav) at The Pentagon, and after the Korean War he moved through a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> at different Naval Air Stations. He ultimately attained the rank of captain and finished out his career in the Navy back at OpNav, this time as Head of the Aviation Periodicals and History Office. Harris retired on July 1, 1967.|$|E

5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village {{in what is now}} Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Ksenia Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian origin, and had a {{daughter}} two years Nikita's junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on the 28th Brigade's {{left flank}} the Shropshires met slight resistance, {{securing}} Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 10:10. They were then relieved by the Canadians by nightfall {{in preparation for}} the third phase of the operation. The brigade plan was now a day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by the Canadians, overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan. However, determined to hold on following the loss of Hill 355, the Chinese moved in fresh troops, heavily reinforcing a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions,</b> including Maryang San.|$|E

5|$|The Warden of the Fleet Prison, who {{was also}} keeper of Westminster Hall, was tasked with keeping it clean and letting the shops and booths along the sides.

Overall, the court has had seven women compared to ninety-seven men serve on the court. Additionally, there are currently two openly gay justices on the court.|$|E
5|$|This {{conflict}} has led historians {{to take a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> on political arrangements in the province.

Another suggestion is that part of the province was transferred to Felix after disturbances under Cumanus' rule.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, {{the growth in the}} proportion of female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it {{opened up a whole}} new field of study.|$|E

5|$|La Rose and La Marguerite are rival {{societies}} that commemorate the Anglo-French {{heritage of the}} island; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies {{date back to the}} early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions,</b> including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite, members sing or play instruments and dance. La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seat chorus with a leader, the chantwèl, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the tanbouwen (tambourine), baha (wooden trumpet), chakchak (rattles), guitar and gwaj (scraper).|$|E
5|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> {{available}} {{to women in}} the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% of positions in the ADF were {{available to}} females as well as males. In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years. This decision {{was supported by the}} CDF and the chiefs of the services. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013. This remaining restriction was removed during 2016.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1615 and 1616 Koniecpolski gained further {{experience}} in Ukraine, fighting the Tatar hordes, {{but failed to}} destroy or capture any sizable enemy units. In 1616, Katarzyna died while giving birth to in labor with Koniecpolski's first son, Andrzej. The following year, Koniecpolski {{took part in the}} Moldavian Magnate Wars alongside Żołkiewski, and stood against Iskender Pasha's powerful Turkish army. The conflict ended that year with a negotiated cease-fire. Following negotiations with the Cossacks in Olszanica, Koniecpolski reduced the Cossack register to 1,000, thereby limiting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> that the Cossacks could hold in the Commonwealth military. He also banned raids on the Black Sea. Such raids, which pillaged wealthy Ottoman cities, contributed to the Cossacks' income but provoked retaliatory raids into Commonwealth territory.|$|E
