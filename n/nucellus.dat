25|$|In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in {{the pollen}} chamber, located beneath the micropyle, {{underneath}} the integuments of the ovule. A pollen tube is produced, which grows into the <b>nucellus</b> to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of Pinophyta and Gnetophyta are without flagella, and are {{carried by the}} pollen tube, while those of Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta have many flagella.|$|E
25|$|In most {{monocotyledons}} (such as {{grasses and}} palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) dicotyledons (such as castor beans) the embryo {{is embedded in}} the endosperm (and <b>nucellus),</b> which the seedling will use upon germination. In the non-endospermic dicotyledons the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as exalbuminous seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds. All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>nucellus,</b> {{the remnant}} of the [...] megasporangium and main region of the ovule where the {{megagametophyte}} develops.|$|E
2500|$|Female plants do {{not produce}} cones. Two ovules are formed {{at the end of}} a stalk, and after pollination, one or both develop into seeds. The seed is 1.5–2nbsp&cm long. Its fleshy outer layer (the sarcotesta) is light yellow-brown, soft, and fruit-like. It is {{attractive}} in appearance, but contains butyric acid (also known as butanoic acid) and smells like rancid butter or vomit when fallen. Beneath the sarcotesta is the hard sclerotesta (the [...] "shell" [...] of the seed) and a papery endotesta, with the <b>nucellus</b> surrounding the female gametophyte at the center.|$|E
2500|$|The pollen grains are {{dispersed}} by {{the wind}} to the female, [...] ovulate cone that {{is made up of}} many overlapping scales (sporophylls, and thus megasporophylls), each protecting two ovules, each of which consists of a megasporangium [...] (the <b>nucellus)</b> wrapped in [...] two layers of tissue, the integument and the cupule, that were derived from highly modified branches of ancestral gymnosperms. [...] When a pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through the micropyle ( [...] a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) [...] often by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop. The pollen enters a [...] pollen chamber close to the <b>nucellus,</b> and there [...] it may wait for a year before it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the wall of the megasporangium (=nucellus) where fertilisation takes place. During this time, the megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid cells, three of which degenerate. The surviving one develops as a megaspore and divides repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. [...] Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the body cell of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte inside. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of the sperm cells enters the egg cell in the megagametophyte’s archegonium.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{by analogy}} with the animal ovum, the outer <b>nucellus</b> layer (perisperm) was {{referred}} to as albumen, and the inner endosperm layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as [...] "albuminous". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with starch, as for instance cereal grains, or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as [...] "fleshy" [...] or [...] "cartilaginous" [...] with thicker soft cells such as coconut, but may also be oily as in Ricinus (castor oil), Croton and Poppy. The endosperm is called [...] "horny" [...] when the cell walls are thicker such as date and coffee, or [...] "ruminated" [...] if mottled, as in nutmeg, palms and Annonaceae.|$|E
2500|$|The mature {{seeds of}} A. mirabilis are about [...] long and [...] wide. The seed {{integument}} has three layers of tissues - the sarcotesta, the thickened sclerotesta, and endotesta. It is fused to the <b>nucellus</b> (central {{portion of the}} ovule) only at the base. The sclerotesta (the [...] "shell") also exhibits a zigzag pattern of sclereids. The fossilized seeds are exquisitely preserved, showing both mature and immature stages. They often contain well-developed dicotyledonous embryos, indicating that they were capable of lying dormant. [...] The size of the cones did not indicate maturity as small cones around [...] in diameter can be found with fully formed embryos. Most of the cones have been preserved before their seeds could be dispersed. Some cones, however, do not contain embryos and the naked axes of cones have also been recovered (described by Wieland as a separate species - Proaraucaria patagonica). It is believed that A. mirabilis shed only its seeds but not the scales at maturity. Nevertheless, no separate petrified seeds or bracts have been recovered.|$|E
5000|$|The seed {{megaspore}} {{was surrounded}} by two layers of tissue: a vascularised <b>nucellus</b> and a usually three-layered integument; the <b>nucellus</b> and integument were completely free except {{at the base of}} the ovule. [...] There has been some debate as to the exact homologies of these tissues, and it has been argued that the vascularised <b>nucellus</b> was in fact the <b>nucellus</b> and integument that have become fused together, and that the 'integument' was homologous to a cupule that contained only one ovule.|$|E
50|$|After fertilization, the <b>nucellus</b> {{may develop}} into the {{perisperm}} that feeds the embryo. In some plants, the diploid tissue of the <b>nucellus</b> can {{give rise to}} the embryo within the seed through a mechanism of asexual reproduction called nucellar embryony.|$|E
5000|$|Megasporogenesis, {{formation}} of the megaspores in the megasporangium (<b>nucellus)</b> by meiosis ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{apospory}} (also called somatic apospory), the megagametophyte {{arises from}} some other <b>nucellus</b> cell.|$|E
50|$|The haploid {{megaspore}} {{inside the}} <b>nucellus</b> {{gives rise to}} the female gametophyte, called the megagametophyte.|$|E
50|$|Located {{opposite}} {{from the}} micropyle is the chalaza where the <b>nucellus</b> is joined to the integuments. Nutrients {{from the plant}} travel through the phloem of the vascular system to the funiculus and outer integument and from there apoplastically and symplastically through the chalaza to the <b>nucellus</b> inside the ovule. In chalazogamous plants, the pollen tubes enter the ovule through the chalaza instead of the micropyle opening.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>nucellus,</b> {{the remnant}} of the megasporangium and main region of the ovule where the {{megagametophyte}} develops.|$|E
50|$|In plant ovules, the chalaza {{is located}} {{opposite}} the micropyle {{opening of the}} integuments. It is the tissue where the integuments and <b>nucellus</b> are joined. Nutrients from the plant travel through vascular tissue in the funiculus and outer integument through the chalaza into the <b>nucellus.</b> During {{the development of the}} embryo sac inside a flowering plant ovule, the three cells at the chalazal end become the antipodal cells.|$|E
50|$|In {{flowering}} plants the megasporangium is {{also called the}} <b>nucellus,</b> and the female gametophyte is sometimes called the embryo sac.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} part, Brown sets {{down for the}} first time the modern view of the anatomy and {{development}} of the angiosperm ovule. He describes the standard arrangement in angiosperms—the <b>nucellus</b> joined by the chalaza to the integuments, which surround the <b>nucellus</b> except at the micropyle, through which the pollen tubes enter. David Mabberley describes this section as [...] "a remarkably clear exposition of one of the most intricate and misunderstood areas of developmental anatomy in higher plants." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} ovules (e.g., Genomosperma) consisted of a <b>nucellus</b> (the equivalent of the sporangium wall) surrounded by a sheath of slender axes known as a pre-integument. [...] It is widely thought that this arrangement was derived from an ancestral condition {{where there was a}} cluster of sporangium-bearing axes, but where only one eventually retained its megasporangium, the others forming the surrounding pre-integument. Progressively, this sheath of axes became fused to form a continuous integument that surrounded and protected the <b>nucellus,</b> such as in Eurystoma [...] and then Stamnostoma. [...] These earliest ovules had the apical part of the <b>nucellus</b> exposed, from which there was a projection known as a lagenostome (sometimes also called a salpinx) that facilitated capture of the pollen and directed it down to the pollen chamber above the megagametophyte. In later, Pennsylvanian-age ovules such as Lagenostoma the <b>nucellus</b> became almost entirely encased by and fused to the integument, leaving just the small distal opening in the integument known as the micropyle through which pollen passed. Nevertheless, most lyginopteridalean ovules retained a lagenostome, despite its function in pollen capture having been replaced by the micropyle.|$|E
5000|$|Megaspore - it is {{the female}} part of the flower in which seeds are formed. it {{consists}} of 7 parts: funicle, hilam, integuments, micropyle, chalaza, <b>nucellus,</b> embryosac ...|$|E
5000|$|The chalaza ( [...] ; from Greek [...] "hailstone"; plural chalazas or chalazae) is a {{structure}} inside bird and reptile eggs and plant ovules. It attaches or suspends the yolk or <b>nucellus</b> {{within the larger}} structure.|$|E
5000|$|The Medullosales is {{an order}} of pteridospermous seed plants characterised by large ovules with {{circular}} cross-section, with a vascularised <b>nucellus,</b> complex pollen-organs, stems and rachides with a dissected stele, and frond-like leaves. [...] Their nearest still-living relatives are the cycads.|$|E
50|$|Recurrent apomixis, is {{now more}} often called gametophytic apomixis: In this type, the {{megagametophyte}} has {{the same number of}} chromosomes as the mother plant because meiosis was not completed. It generally arises either from an archesporial cell or from some other part of the <b>nucellus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>nucellus</b> (plural: nucelli) {{is part of}} {{the inner}} {{structure}} of the ovule, forming a layer of diploid (sporophytic) cells immediately inside the integuments. It is structurally and functionally equivalent to the megasporangium. In immature ovules, the <b>nucellus</b> contains a megasporocyte (megaspore mother cell), which undergoes sporogenesis via meiosis. In gymnosperms, three of the four haploid spores produced in meiosis typically degenerate, leaving one surviving megaspore inside the <b>nucellus.</b> Among angiosperms, however, a wide range of variation exists in what happens next. The number (and position) of surviving megaspores, the total number of cell divisions, whether nuclear fusions occur, and the final number, position and ploidy of the cells or nuclei all vary. A common pattern of embryo sac development (the Polygonum type maturation pattern) includes a single functional megaspore followed by three rounds of mitosis. In some cases, however, two megaspores survive (for example, in Allium and Endymion). In some cases all four megaspores survive, for example in the Fritillaria type of development (illustrated by Lilium in the figure) there is no separation of the megaspores following meiosis, then the nuclei fuse to form a triploid nucleus and a haploid nucleus. The subsequent arrangement of cells is similar to the Polygonum pattern, but the ploidy of the nuclei is different.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} seed-plants, the lyginopteridalean ovules {{had just one}} {{functional}} seed megaspore within the <b>nucellus.</b> In some, however, three other, aborted megaspores were still present that together with the functional megaspore represented the remains of {{what would have been}} the tetrad of megaspores in the ancestral pre-seed plants.|$|E
50|$|Agamospermy occurs {{mainly in}} two forms: In gametophytic apomixis, the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg cell (i.e. by parthenogenesis) in a {{gametophyte}} that was produced from a cell {{that did not}} complete meiosis. In adventitious embryony (sporophytic apomixis), an embryo is formed directly (not from a gametophyte) from <b>nucellus</b> or integument tissue (see nucellar embryony).|$|E
50|$|As the {{development}} of embryo and endosperm proceeds within the embryo sac, the sac wall enlarges and combines with the <b>nucellus</b> (which is likewise enlarging) and the integument to form the seed coat. The ovary wall develops to form the fruit or pericarp, whose form is {{closely associated with the}} manner of distribution of the seed.|$|E
50|$|Adventive embryony, {{also called}} sporophytic apomixis, sporophytic budding, or nucellar embryony: Here {{there may be}} a {{megagametophyte}} in the ovule, but the embryos do not arise from the cells of the gametophyte; they arise from cells of <b>nucellus</b> or the integument. Adventive embryony is important in several species of Citrus, in Garcinia, Euphorbia dulcis, Mangifera indica etc.|$|E
50|$|In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in {{the pollen}} chamber, located beneath the micropyle, {{underneath}} the integuments of the ovule. A pollen tube is produced, which grows into the <b>nucellus</b> to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of Pinophyta and Gnetophyta are without flagella, and are {{carried by the}} pollen tube, while those of Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta have many flagella.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} a few {{morphological}} characters that unite the clusioids with Ochnaceae. The petal aestivation is often contort in the clusioids, and usually so in Ochnaceae. In both groups, the flowers usually bear numerous stamens, and in the ovary, the placentation is mostly axile. In the ovules, the <b>nucellus</b> is often thin, and the outer integument is usually thicker than the inner.|$|E
5000|$|The small ovules (fossil genus Callospermarion) {{with the}} {{characteristic}} secretory structures have an integument {{that was only}} fused to the <b>nucellus</b> in the basal part of the ovules and so superficially resemble medullosalean ovules. Unlike the Medullosales, the ovules appear to be bilaterally symmetrical, although details of the vasculature suggest they were in fact evolved from plants with radially symmetrical ovules. The apical part of the <b>nucellus</b> has a lagenostome-like projection, which breaks down to form the pollen chamber. The full ontogeny of these ovules has been worked out in some detail {{and seems to be}} essentially similar to that seen in modern-day gymnosperms, including the use of a pollen drop to help capture and draw the pollen into the pollen chamber and a pollen tube to deliver the generative nucleus. [...] The ovules were borne on the underside of pinnules that did not differ significantly in form from those of the purely vegetative fronds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inclusion}} of the Callistophytales within the Lyginopteridopsida is controversial because of the apparent sophistication of the ovules and pollen. [...] There are nevertheless many other characters that suggest that the Callistophytales may have been derived from a more primitive lyginopterdalean-like ancestor, including {{the presence of a}} lagenostome at the apex of the <b>nucellus,</b> the general structure of the pollen organs, and the overall morphology of the vegetative structures.|$|E
50|$|They are much-reduced and {{embedded}} in the megagametophytes of gymnosperms. The term is not used for angiosperms or the gnetophytes Gnetum and Welwitschia because the megagametophyte is reduced {{to just a few}} cells, one of which differentiates into the egg cell. The function of surrounding the gamete is assumed in large part by diploid cells of the megasporangium (<b>nucellus)</b> inside the ovule. Gymnosperms have their archegonium formed after pollination inside female conifer cones (megastrobili).|$|E
50|$|The female megasporangiate {{is larger}} than the male. It {{contains}} bracts and megasporophylls, each of which contains two ovules, arranged in a spiral. These then develop a <b>nucellus</b> in which a mother cell if formed. Meiosis occurs and a megaspore is produced as the first cell of the megagametophyte. As cell division takes place the nucleus of the megaspore thickens, and cell differentiation occurs to produce prothallial tissue containing an ovum. The remaining undifferentiated cells then form the endosperm.|$|E
50|$|In seed plants, the ovule ("small egg") is the {{structure}} that {{gives rise to}} and contains the female reproductive cells. It consists of three parts: The integument(s) form its outer layer(s), the <b>nucellus</b> (or remnant of the megasporangium), and female gametophyte (formed from haploid megaspore) in its center. The female gametophyte—specifically termed a megagametophyte—is also called the embryo sac in angiosperms. The megagametophyte produces an egg cell (or several in some groups) {{for the purpose of}} fertilization. After fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed.|$|E
