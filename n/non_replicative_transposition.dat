5000|$|<b>Replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> is a {{mechanism}} of transposition in molecular biology, proposed by James A.

40|$|Transposons are mobile genetic {{elements}} that move by transposition from one location to another within genomes. The present work {{is focused on}} the characterization of the activities mediated by the transposase protein (TnpA) of the bacterial transposon Tn 4430 belonging to the Tn 3 family. TnpA catalyzes <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> of Tn 4430 and target immunity that prevents multiple insertions of the transposon into the same DNA molecule. Very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that control the transposition and target immunity reactions catalyzed by TnpA of the Tn 3 family. In this study, we have achieved decisive steps toward the understanding of the <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> mechanism by developing in vitro reactions with TnpA reproducing specific steps of the transposition process. Additional observations have also revealed an unexpected link between the mechanism of DNA targeting by Tn 4430 and DNA replication, suggesting a mechanism for recruiting replication machinery during the <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition.</b> This work also provides important findings toward the understanding of target immunity. We first showed that formation of a specific complex between TnpA and the immunizing transposon is necessary to generate immunity. In addition, the biochemical assays revealed that TnpA mutants affected in their immunity function had promiscuous activities when compared to wild type TnpA, suggesting that the activity of the protein is normally tightly regulated. Finally, we were interested in the biological significance of target immunity. We tested the involvement of this process in avoiding intra-molecular <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> leading to deleterious events within the DNA molecule. The results showed that the immunity mutants exhibited a higher intra-molecular transposition frequency than wild type TnpA, which was in accordance with the hypothesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), {{which are}} {{resistant}} to most or all known antibiotics, consti-tute a global threat to public health. Transposable elements are often associated with antibiotic resistance determinants, suggest-ing {{a role in the}} emergence of resistance. One insertion sequence, IS 26, is frequently associated with resistance determinants, but its role remains unclear. We have analyzed the genomic contexts of 70 IS 26 copies in several clinical and surveillance CPE iso-lates from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We used target site duplications and their patterns as guides and found that a large fraction of plasmid reorganizations result from IS 26 <b>replicative</b> <b>transpositions,</b> including replicon fusions, DNA inversions, and deletions. <b>Replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> could also be inferred for transposon Tn 4401, which harbors the car-bapenemase blaKPC gene. Thus, <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> is important in the ongoing reorganization of plasmids carrying multidrug-resistant determinants, an observation that carries substantial clinical and epidemiological implications for under-standing how such extreme drug resistance phenotypes evolve. IMPORTANCE Although IS 26 is frequently reported to reside in resistance plasmids of clinical isolates, the characteristic hall-mark of transposition, target site duplication (TSD), is generally not observed, raising questions about the mode of transposition for IS 26. The previous observation of cointegrate formation during transposition implies that IS 26 transposes via a replicativ...|$|R

40|$|Bacteriophage Mu uses non-replicative {{transposition}} for {{integration into}} the host's chromosome and <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> for phage propagation. Biochemical and structural comparisons together with evolutionary considerations suggest that the Mu transposition machinery might share functional similarities with machineries of the systems that are known to employ a hairpin intermediate during the catalytic steps of transposition. Model transposon end DNA hairpin substrates were used in a minimal-component in vitro system to study their proficiency to promote Mu transpososome assembly and subsequent MuA-catalyzed chemical reactions leading to the strand transfer product. MuA indeed was able to assemble hairpin substrates into a catalytically competent transpososome, open the hairpin ends and accurately join the opened ends to the target DNA. The hairpin opening and transposon end cleavage reactions had identical metal ion preferences, indicating similar conformations within the catalytic center for these reactions. Hairpin length influenced transpososome assembly as well as catalysis: longer loops were more efficient in these respects. In general, MuA's proficiency to utilize different types of hairpin substrates indicates {{a certain degree of}} flexibility within the transposition machinery core. Overall, the results suggest that non-replicative and <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> systems may structurally and evolutionarily be more closely linked than anticipated previously...|$|R

The cis and trans requirements for Mu phage-mediated transposition, which include the L/R ends of the Mu DNA, the transposition factors MuA and MuB, and the cis/trans functioning of the E element as an enhancer, are presented. Mini-Mu(LR) /(LER) units are Mu derivatives that lack most of the Mu genes but contain the L/R ends or a properly arranged E element in cis to the L/R ends. The dual-component system, which consists of an integrative plasmid with a mini-Mu and an easily eliminated helper plasmid encoding inducible transposition factors, is described in detail {{as a tool for}} the integration/amplification of recombinant DNAs.

40|$|The lytic {{cycle of}} {{bacteriophage}} Mu includes {{a large number}} of coupled DNA replication and integration events, each of which is equivalent in several respects to the process of transposition of genetic elements. To aid us in studying the process of Mu DNA <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition,</b> we developed a technique for synchronizing the first round of replication following induction of a lysogen. Synchronization was achieved by inducing a lysogen in the absence of DNA replication for a time sufficient to develop the potential for Mu DNA replication in all cells in the population; upon release of the inhibition of replication, a synchronized round of Mu DNA replication was observed. Development of the potential for Mu DNA replication in the entire population took approximately 12 min. Protein synthesis was required for development of the potential, but the requirement for protein synthesis was satisfied by approximately 9 min suggesting that other, as yet unspecified, reactions occupied the last 3 min.

This was detected by {{the activity of the}} tet gene expressed from the phage 434 P(R) promoter. Each interplasmid transposition resulted in the fusion of the donor and acceptor plasmids into cointegrate structure, with a 9 -bp duplication of the target DNA at the insertion site. Cointegrate formation was abolished in δrecA strains, although simple insertions of IS 10 were observed. This suggests a two-stage mechanism involving IS 10 conservative transposition, followed by homologous recombination between the donor and the acceptor. Two plasmids carrying inactive IS 10 sequences were fused to cointegrates at a 100 -fold lower frequency, suggesting that homologous recombination is coupled to and stimulated by the transposition event. Each IS 10 transposition from the chromosome to the acceptor plasmid involved replicon fusion, providing a mechanism for IS 10 -mediated integration of extrachromosomal elements into the chromosome.

5000|$|Transposase is {{an enzyme}} that binds {{to the end}} of a {{transposon}} and catalyzes the movement of the transposon to another part of the genome by a cut and paste mechanism or a <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> mechanism. The word [...] "transposase" [...] was first coined by the individuals who cloned the enzyme required for transposition of the Tn3 transposon. The existence of transposons was postulated in the late 1940s by Barbara McClintock, who was studying the inheritance of maize, but the actual molecular basis for transposition was described by later groups. McClintock discovered that pieces of the chromosomes changed their position, jumping from one chromosome to another. The repositioning of these transposons (which coded for color) allowed other genes for pigment to be expressed. Transposition in maize causes changes in color; however, in other organisms, such as bacteria, it can cause antibiotic resistance. Transposition is also important in creating genetic diversity within species and adaptability to changing living conditions.
