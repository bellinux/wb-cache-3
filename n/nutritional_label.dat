Factor analysis was performed to identify the underlying dimensions among a set of <b>nutritional</b> <b>labeling</b> parameters using principal component analysis. Based on factor analysis, ten factors emerged. Regression analysis and t test indicated that, out the ten factors, only three factors namely ‘Nutritional Belief’, ‘Storage instruction & Information overload’, and ‘Exercise & Nutrition’ were significant. These factors were mainly inclined outside the purview of <b>nutritional</b> <b>labeling</b> purchase influence.

Firstly, parents should be informed of the nutritional values of the foods that they are giving to their children (Grier, Mensinger, Huang, Kumanyika & Stettler, 2007). For example, an easy-to-read <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> on food packaging that provides the nutrient values and their definitions (Nikolova & Inman, 2015). This will create healthier food environments for families around the world (Sacks et al., 2015). Secondly, parents could restrict which advertisements that their children are exposed to (Newman & Oates, 2014). For example, parents could use ad-blocking applications or limit television watching time (Thaichon & Quach, 2016). Through the implementation of these strategies, governments can contribute in decreasing the rates of childhood obesity through food marketing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{review of}} literatures reveals that many {{empirical}} researches on <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> in relation with consumer buying decision process {{have been carried}} out over the last twenty years. Nonetheless, the extent on how the concept of <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> was defined and used in the studies on food product buying decision tends to be varied from one study to another. Furthermore, the role of <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> in food product buying decision has not been made clear. This paper is presented with the aim to summarise and draw the common definition of <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> found in the previous studies. Beside that, this paper also discusses the types of label formats that could influence the use of <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> amongst consumers.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{a growing body of}} {{literature}} studying the determinants of children's obesity, relatively {{little is known about the}} association between parental <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use and children's body weight. To bridge this gap, this study examines the effect of mother's <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use on children's body mass index and overweight. Using data from the 2001 National Health Interview Survey in Taiwan, a two-stage econometric model is proposed and estimated with a semiparametric method. Results indicate that mother's <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use leads to lower probability of children becoming overweight or obese, and a non-linear relationship between mother's <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use and children's BMI is evident. For mothers who seldom use nutritional labels, label use does not lead to a reduction in children's BMI. In contrast, for mothers who are frequent <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> users, label use contributes negatively to children's BMI. However, the magnitudes of these effects are relatively small, suggesting that additional instruments or policies are needed if further reduction in children's body mass index is desired. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use Semiparametric method Children's body mass index Overweight Taiwan...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of diet induced {{diseases such as}} cancer, high blood pressure, stroke, cardiovascular/heart disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and malnutrition are rampant in our world today and therefore topical. The practice of <b>nutritional</b> <b>labeling</b> is being advocated as a panacea for this malaise and hence a sizeable number of researches are being undertaken in this direction. Large chunk of these studies are concentrated in the advanced countries. Unfortunately, there is dearth of such studies in developing countries including Nigeria. Consequently, this study sought to empirically determine consumers’ reaction to <b>nutritional</b> <b>labeling</b> of pre-packaged food products in Nigeria. The study was purely descriptive and data collected aptly analyzed through the instrumentality of pertinent statistical tools. Findings show that consumers read, comprehend, trust the authenticity and are significantly aware of <b>nutritional</b> <b>labeling</b> {{and are able to}} relate the effects of nutrition information to their health. Not surprising therefore, consumers consciously search for nutrition information, which significantly influence their purchase decisions of these kinds of products.

The results of a survey conducted on a sample of Italian wine consumers (N =  300) show the strong interest of respondents in the inclusion of such information on the label. Conjoint analysis reveals that consumers assign greater utility to health warnings, followed by nutritional information. Cluster analysis shows the existence of three different consumer segments. The first cluster, which included mainly female consumers (over 55) and those with high wine involvement, revealed greater awareness of the links between wine and health and better knowledge of wine nutritional properties, preferring a more detailed <b>nutritional</b> <b>label,</b> such as a panel with GDA%. By contrast, the other two clusters, consisting of individuals who generally find it more difficult to understand nutritional labels, preferred the less detailed label of a glass showing calories. The second and largest cluster comprising mainly younger men (under 44), showed the highest interest in health warnings while the third cluster - with a relatively low level of education - preferred the specification of the number of glasses not to exceed.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The objectives of this study were to develop a nutrition scoring system which would combine the nutritional information on the new label into a single number, to identify strengths and weaknesses of the new nutritional labels according to nutrition and food industry professionals and to determine if any differences exist between professionals' perception of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>label.</b> A scoring system was designed using the components on the new <b>nutritional</b> <b>label.</b> Labels from main dish products were used for scoring. Each component was given points of 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100 according to the amount present. A score was assigned based on an average of the points. When incorporated with the existing label, the scoring system could be very useful to consumers while still providing specific information for individuals. By making the label easier to understand, it would add to the consumer's willingness to use the label. A questionnaire to assess attitudes toward each component on the new <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> was sent to members of the American Dietetic Association (ADA, n [...] 1220) andthelnstituteofFoodTechnologists(IFT,n [...] 441). Atotalof 464 professionals (28 %) responded of which 79 % and 22 % were ADA and IFT members, respectively. Responses varied with subject age, position, job function and area of practice or responsibility. With the exception of protein, ADA respondents considered each component of the label to be more important than did I]FT respondents. Both groups ranked kilocalories (kcal), total fat, and sodium to be more important components and vitamin A and C and sugars less important. ADA respondents indicated that percentage kcal from fat and other vitamins and minerals should be added to the label. IFT respondents were concerned with the process and the costs required to modify the labels. In conclusion, the nutritional components on the new label were acceptable to this sample of the population. The observation that differences of opinions within the groups of professionals were not as widespread as expected is important.

40|$|Currently, <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> is {{difficult}} to interpret and time-consuming to read.

Front-of-pack labels are a tool to help overcome this problem by providing consumers with understandable, visible information to aid them into making healthier food choices. This study expands on past research by evaluating 7 separate pre-existing, proposed and fictitious front-of-pack <b>nutritional</b> <b>labels.</b> It includes Information, Image or a combination of both Information and Image based labels. Plus No label, which is a control variable to determine the effectiveness of each <b>label.</b> The <b>nutritional</b> <b>labels</b> were placed on a chicken salad sandwich which was kept consistent for all 14 manipulations.

The results provide evidence of the urgent need to communicate nutritional information more effectively. Images, simplicity, colour and reliability, are determining label elements that influence consumption behaviour. The results from this study help to understand behaviours associated to labels.
