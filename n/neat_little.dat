25|$|Since {{the days}} of O'Connell a larger public {{demonstration}} has not been witnessed than that of Sunday last. About 1 o'clock the monster procession started from Claremorris, headed by several thousand men on foot – the men of each district wearing a laural leaf or green ribbon in hat or coat to distinguish the several contingents. At 11 o'clock a monster contingent of tenant-farmers on horseback drew {{up in front of}} Hughes's hotel, showing discipline and order that a cavalry regiment might feel proud of. They were led on in sections, each having a marshal who kept his troops well in hand. Messrs. P.W. Nally, J.W. Nally, H. French, and M. Griffin, wearing green and gold sashes, led on their different sections, who rode two deep, occupying, at least, over an Irish mile of the road. Next followed a train of carriages, brakes, cares, etc. led on by Mr. Martin Hughes, the spirited hotel proprietor, driving a pair of rare black ponies to a phæton, taking Messrs. J.J. Louden and J. Daly. Next came Messrs. O'Connor Power, J. Ferguson, and Thomas Brennan in a covered carriage, followed by at least 500 vehicles from the neighbouring towns. On passing through Ballindine the sight was truly imposing, the endless train directing its course to Irishtown – a <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> hamlet on the boundaries of Mayo, Roscommon, and Galway.|$|E
500|$|Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000 was {{received}} well by reviewers. Sputnikmusic contributor Nandrucu gave the album a perfect five, describing it as [...] "perfect way to introduce you" [...] to the band. New song [...] "Bless My Soul" [...] {{was seen in}} a positive light, with the comment [...] "it has a great opening, with <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> guitar fills popping {{up all over the}} place". However, the reviewer dislike [...] "Process This", stating the song had [...] "a try-hard feel about it".|$|E

Kate Lawson of The Detroit News {{wrote that}} the book offers [...] "mouthwatering recipes ranging from {{variations}} on the classic sandwich to soups, salads and pastas." [...] Karola Saekel of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Recipes for recommended basics like aioli and tomato concasse round out the <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> book." [...] Food editor of the Daily Herald [...] Deborah Pankey wrote in her review of the book, [...] "While giving the titled trio its due respect, author Michele Anna Jordan introduces {{a host of other}} ingredients that will surely shake up your next toasted meal (yes, she favors toast to help maintain the sandwich's structure.)" ...|$|E

500|$|Pompeo {{fights for}} a truthful storyline for her character—she {{wants it to}} be {{realistic}} and says you can't always wrap it up in a <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> package. Referring to Grey's tampering with Shepherd's trial, Pompeo said: [...] "Listen, what Meredith did clearly crossed a line. Derek has a right to be pissed." [...] Following the tampering, Rhimes said she believes that Grey and Shepherd are meant to be together and that it in the end, they will end up with each other. Grey's relationship with Cristina Yang, has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to Grey as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a [...] "honeymoon" [...] together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale. Grey has been characterized, by some, as [...] "whiny". Rhimes offered her insight: ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Delia is {{rushed to}} {{hospital}} after spiking a high temperature of 105, {{where she is}} diagnosed with leukemia, devastating Chloe. SoapNet noted that [...] "Chloe's world is turned upside down" [...] {{as a result of}} the diagnosis. The leukemia storyline spans into January 2012. Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who supported me through the entire shooting day, and the writing. It was just all wrapped up in a <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> package. I could not ask for a better show." [...] Delia needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Victor arranges for Billy to secretly be able to donate his bone marrow, saving Delia's life, though he passes the donation off as Kevin's. Hendrickson praised the writing for the storyline as a [...] "full arc" [...] which had a [...] "beginning, middle and an end". She said, [...] "It was a great story. I got to show a lot of range, and also got to work with some great supporting actors who were in those scenes." [...] For the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards, Hendrickson submitted the scenes in which Chloe is informed of Delia's leukemia, which allowed her to receive a nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In July 2013, Delia has a health scare. In light of Chloe's marriage to Kevin ending and Billy experiencing troubles in his marriage to Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), Jamey Giddens of Zap2it observed that this could act as a catalyst towards a [...] "Chilly" [...] (Chloe and Billy) reunion, writing, [...] "The perfect storm of two failing marriages and a sick child seems to be conjuring up the right elements for some Chilly weather in Genoa City." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone called [...] "Black Widow" [...] a [...] "great song" [...] and praised its [...] "hypnotic chorus." [...] Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie felt the track had [...] "future hit written all over it", and lauded Ora's [...] "sing-along chorus", Stargate's [...] "fantastic" [...] production, and considered the song to be a [...] "darker alternative" [...] to [...] "Dark Horse". A writer for MuchMusic felt [...] "Black Widow" [...] was [...] "a killer collaboration", {{in the same vein}} as Azalea's fourth single [...] "Fancy" [...] which featured Charli XCX. MTV Buzzworthy's Nedeska Alexis placed the song in her list of the 4 Songs You Have To Hear from the album, and said Perry [...] "worked her magic on the track." [...] Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus called the track a [...] "call-and-response anthem." [...] Marie Claire journalist Lauren Valenti deemed the song [...] "deliciously wicked" [...] and [...] "nothing short of brilliant", and commended Ora's vocal delivery on the track's hook. A writer for Rap-Up called Azalea and Ora [...] "a deadly duo" [...] on the song. Saeed Saeed of The National highlighted [...] "Black Widow" [...] as a stand out track on The New Classic and praised its [...] "strong chorus and slithering beats." [...] Saeed's view was echoed by John Wiley of The Heights who listed the song as one of two highlights on the record. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Craig Mathieson stated, [...] "while her verses don't have the sustained length of her previous underground releases, Azalea skillfully upsets convention." [...] Kyle Moody of the Marquette Wire preferred Azalea's sound [...] "Black Widow" [...] to the more rap-orientated songs on The New Classic. Laetitia Wong Wai Yi of Today felt the track attained well-deserved hype and commended it for [...] "perfectly" [...] combining Azalea's vocal fluidity with its minimalistic dance breakdown. Glamour journalist Megan Angelo positively reviewed the song, writing, [...] "'Black Widow' isn't just an excellent get-up, get-ready, get-moving song for Friday night—it also happens to be a Women Killing Music summit {{in the form of a}} <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> track." ...|$|E

On his marriage, he sold out and got fat: and was indeed a florid, contented, and jovial gentleman.|$|R
60|$|When I quitted the hotel, a brown brougham, {{with a pair}} of {{beautiful}} horses, the harness and panels emblazoned with the <b>neatest</b> <b>little</b> ducal coronets you ever saw, and a cypher under each crown as easy to read as the arrow-headed inscriptions on one of Mr. Layard's Assyrian chariots, was in waiting, and I presumed that Madame la Princesse was about to take an airing.|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{put up the}} <b>neatest</b> <b>little</b> rosebud {{mouth to}} be kissed. Everything about her was neat--her little round neck with the row of coral beads; her little {{straight}} nose, not at all snubby; her little clear eyebrows, rather darker than her curls to match her hazel eyes, which looked up with shy pleasure at Maggie, taller by the head, though scarcely a year older.|$|R

His gods had temples, and the Mycenaeans built none, whereas the latter constructed great vaulted tombs to bury their chieftains in and the poet cremates his. A <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> touch {{is provided by the}} battle chariots. Homer had heard of them, but he did not really visualize what one did with chariots in a war. So his heroes normally drove from their tents a mile or less away, carefully dismounted, and then proceeded to battle on foot." ...|$|E

60|$|The prettiest little brick city, the pleasantest little park to ride in, the neatest {{comfortable}} {{people walking}} about, the canals not unsweet, and busy and picturesque with old-world life. Rows upon rows of houses, built with the <b>neatest</b> <b>little</b> bricks, with windows fresh painted, and tall doors polished, and carved to a nicety. What a pleasant spacious garden our inn has, all sparkling with autumn flowers and bedizened with statues! At {{the end is}} a row of trees, and a summer-house, over the canal, where you might go and smoke a pipe with Mynheer Van Dunck, and quite cheerfully catch the ague. Yesterday, as we passed, they were making hay, and stacking it in a barge which was lying by the meadow, handy. Round about Kensington Palace there are houses, roofs, chimneys, and bricks like these. I feel that a Dutchman is {{a man and a}} brother. It is very funny to read the newspaper, one can understand it somehow. Sure it is the <b>neatest,</b> gayest <b>little</b> city--scores and hundreds of mansions looking like Cheyne Walk, or the ladies' schools about Chiswick and Hackney.|$|R
2500|$|Krasner {{struggled}} with the public's reception of her identity, both as a woman and as the wife of Pollock. When they both exhibited their works at a show called [...] "Artists: Man and Wife" [...] in 1949, an ARTnews reviewer stated: [...] "There is a tendency among some of these wives to 'tidy up' their husband's styles. Lee Krasner (Mrs. Jackson Pollock) takes her husband's paint and enamels and changes his unrestrained, sweeping lines into <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> squares and triangles." [...] Even after the rise of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s, her career as an artist was always put into relation to Pollock since remarks made about her work often commented on how {{she had become a}} successful artist by moving out of Pollock's shadow. In articles about her work, Pollock is continually referred to. Typically in the 1940s and 1950s, she would not sign works at all, sign with the genderless initials [...] "L.K.", or blend her signature into the painting in order to not emphasize her status as a woman and as a wife to another painter.|$|E
2500|$|Don 2 {{received}} [...] positive {{reviews from}} critics, receiving {{praise for the}} cast's performance, cinematography, production design and action sequences but was criticised for its pace and music. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 73 percent based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five, noting as [...] "a classic action/crime thriller that doesn't let go, even for a moment. More importantly, the plot has been finely crafted, with every twist and turn falling into place like a complicated albeit <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> jigsaw." [...] Filmfare also gave the film four out of five, praising the performances by Khan, Chopra and Irani and wrote [...] "They carry the film through its flat moments. It's not very taut, but Don 2 serves up enough thrills in the finale and that alone makes it worth a watch." [...] Priya Joshi of Digital Spy gave the film four out of five, praising its dramatic conclusion which she thought was brilliantly executed, and wrote the it [...] "is a thoroughly exhilarating action-fest, fashioned in a Bollywood-style – and a shot of adrenaline amidst the usual elf-inspired festive film fare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{journalists and}} video game {{designers}} have questioned this cultural classification, {{arguing that the}} differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated. In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo, Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura (who worked on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts) emphasized that RPGs should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: role-playing games. Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Final Fantasy and The Last Story, noted that, while [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Japanese RPGs as [...] "turn-based, traditional styles" [...] and Western RPGs as [...] "born from first-person shooters," [...] there [...] "are titles that don't fit the category," [...] pointing to Chrono Trigger (which he also worked on) and the Mana games. He further noted {{that there have been}} [...] "other games similar to the style of Chrono Trigger," [...] but that [...] "it's probably because the games weren't localised and didn't reach the Western audience." [...] series director Tetsuya Takahashi, in reference to Xenoblade Chronicles, stated that [...] "I don’t know when exactly people started using the term 'JRPG,' but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term, I’ll be satisfied." [...] The writer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com states that [...] "Xenoblade throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community's obsession over the differences between" [...] Western and Japanese RPGs, pointing out that it [...] "does things that don't really fit into either genre. Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and <b>neat</b> <b>little</b> rules, I know, but just because you cram something into a little box doesn't mean it belongs there." [...] Nick Doerr of Joystiq criticizes the claim that Japanese RPGs are [...] "too linear," [...] pointing out that non-linear Japanese RPGs are not uncommonfor instance, the Romancing SaGa series. Likewise, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq points out that linear Western RPGs were common in the 1990s, and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally [...] "not true" [...] and [...] "never was", pointing to classic examples like Lands of Lore and Betrayal at Krondor that were more narrative-focused than the typical Western-style RPGs of the time. In 2015, IGN noted in an interview with Xenoblade Chronicles Xs development team that the label [...] "JRPG" [...] is most commonly used to refer to RPGs [...] "whose presentation mimics the design sensibilities" [...] of anime and manga, that it's [...] "typically the presentation and character archetypes" [...] that signal [...] "this is a JRPG." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{front room}} of the Hinkle House was as <b>neat</b> a <b>little</b> parlor as there was in the black-waxy country. It was all willow rocking-chairs, and home-knit tidies, and albums, and conch shells in a row. And a little upright piano in one corner.|$|R
60|$|The child {{advanced}} promptly. Relieved of her wrapping, {{she appeared}} exceedingly tiny; {{but was a}} <b>neat,</b> completely-fashioned <b>little</b> figure, light, slight, and straight. Seated on my godmother's ample lap, she looked a mere doll; her neck, delicate as wax, her head of silky curls, increased, I thought, the resemblance.|$|R
60|$|Though he was {{scarcely}} eleven years of age, Master George wore straps {{and the most}} beautiful little boots like a man. He had gilt spurs, and a gold-headed whip, and a fine pin in his handkerchief, and the <b>neatest</b> <b>little</b> kid gloves which Lamb's Conduit Street could furnish. His mother {{had given him a}} couple of neckcloths, and carefully hemmed and made some little shirts for him; but when her Eli came to see the widow, they were replaced by much finer linen. He had little jewelled buttons in the lawn shirt fronts. Her humble presents had been put aside--I believe Miss Osborne had given them to the coachman's boy. Amelia tried to think she was pleased at the change. Indeed, she was happy and charmed to see the boy looking so beautiful.|$|R

60|$|The respectability her {{presence}} gave in our pew, and by our hearth, {{was a great}} comfort to our friends of all degrees.

60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Chirrup are {{the nice}} little couple in question. Mr. Chirrup has the smartness, and {{something}} of the brisk, quick manner of a small bird. Mrs. Chirrup is the prettiest of all little women, and has the prettiest little figure conceivable. She has the <b>neatest</b> <b>little</b> foot, and the softest little voice, and the pleasantest little smile, and the tidiest little curls, and the brightest little eyes, and the quietest little manner, and is, in short, altogether {{one of the most}} engaging of all little women, dead or alive. She is a condensation of all the domestic virtues,—a pocket edition of the young man’s best companion,—a little woman at a very high pressure, with an amazing quantity of goodness and usefulness in an exceedingly small space. Little as she is, Mrs. Chirrup might furnish forth matter for the moral equipment of a score of housewives, six feet high in their stockings—if, in the presence of ladies, we may be allowed the expression—and of corresponding robustness.|$|R

6000|$|She did to-day, {{when she}} and Tom {{came in from the}} garden with their father and their uncle Glegg. Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly, and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl, rushed at once to Lucy, who was {{standing}} by her mother's knee. Certainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous, and to superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of Maggie though a connoisseur might have seen [...] "points" [...] in her which had a higher promise for maturity than Lucy's natty completeness. It was like the contrast between a rough, dark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten. Lucy put up the <b>neatest</b> <b>little</b> rosebud mouth to be kissed; everything about her was neat,--her little round neck, with the row of coral beads; her little straight nose, not at all snubby; her little clear eyebrows, rather darker than her curls, to match hazel eyes, which looked up with shy pleasure at Maggie, taller by the head, though scarcely a year older. Maggie always looked at Lucy with delight.|$|R
