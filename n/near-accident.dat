40|$|Errors are {{frequent}} in health care. A specific model was tested that affirms failure in cognitive action regulation {{to mediate the}} influence of nurses' workflow interruptions and safety conscientiousness on <b>near-accidents</b> in health care. One hundred and sixty-five nurses from seven Swiss hospitals participated in a questionnaire survey. Structural equation modelling confirmed the hypothesised mediation model. Cognitive failure in action regulation significantly mediated the influence of workflow interruptions on <b>near-accidents</b> (p[*]<[*]. 05). An indirect path from conscientiousness to <b>near-accidents</b> via cognitive failure in action regulation was also significant (p[*]<[*]. 05). Compliance with safety regulations {{was significantly related to}} cognitive failure and near-accidents; moreover, cognitive failure mediated the association between compliance and <b>near-accidents</b> (p[*]<[*]. 05). Contrary to expectations, compliance with safety regulations was not related to workflow interruptions. Workflow interruptions caused by colleagues, patients and organisational constraints are likely to trigger errors in nursing. Work redesign is recommended to reduce cognitive failure and improve safety of nurses and patients...|$|R
40|$|This study tests whether {{cognitive}} failures mediate {{effects of}} work-related time pressure and time control on commuting accidents and <b>near-accidents.</b> Participants were 83 employees (56 % female) who each commuted between their regular {{place of residence}} and place of work using vehicles. The Workplace Cognitive Failure Scale (WCFS) asked for the frequency of failure in memory function, failure in attention regulation, and failure in action execution. Time pressure and time control at work were assessed by the Instrument for Stress Oriented Task Analysis (ISTA). Commuting accidents in the last 12 months were reported by 10 % of participants, {{and half of the}} sample reported commuting <b>near-accidents</b> in the last 4 weeks. Cognitive failure significantly mediated the influence of time pressure at work on <b>near-accidents</b> even when age, gender, neuroticism, conscientiousness, commuting duration, commuting distance, and time pressure during commuting were controlled for. Time control was negatively related to cognitive failure and neuroticism, but no association with commuting accidents or <b>near-accidents</b> was found. Time pressure at work is likely to increase cognitive load. Time pressure might, therefore, increase cognitive failures during work and also during commuting. Hence, time pressure at work can decrease commuting safety. The result suggests a reduction of time pressure at work should improve commuting safety...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{in-vehicle}} use of {{cell phones}} rapidly increasing, the safety of young drivers, who represent 14 % of licensed drivers but 26 % of drivers involved in fatal crashes, may be dispropor-tionately threatened. The authors used a questionnaire to examine the association between in-vehicle cell-phone use and accidents or <b>near-accidents</b> among 1, 291 conveniently recruited college stu-dents in 4 states. Of the 1, 185 respondents who were drivers, 87 % had a cell phone, and 86 % of the cell-phone owners reported talk-ing while driving at least occasionally. Of the 762 reported acci-dents or <b>near-accidents,</b> 21 % {n = 159) involved at least 1 of the drivers talking while driving. Chi-square tests and logistic regres-sion analyses showed that the frequency, not the duration, of dri-vers talking while driving was related to experiencing accidents or <b>near-accidents.</b> Differences between drivers who used cell phones and nonusers in unsafe driving behaviors and attitudes were also examined, and target groups for intervention efforts against talk-ing {{on a cell phone}} while driving are suggested...|$|R

2500|$|From 1956 a {{permanent}} secretariat was appointed, the Aviation Accident Commission (...) [...] However, the various commissions members were only {{tied to the}} commission {{during the period of}} the investigation. By the 1980s this had increased to two full-time technicians and a clerk. This period saw accident commissions with a significantly different mission than later. Firstly, it only investigated actual accidents of a certain size. General aviation accidents as well as <b>near-accidents</b> were not investigated. Secondly, the commissions were both given the task to uncover the cause of the accident from a safety point of view, but also to uncover any criminal occurrences.

40|$|Building {{on ideas}} from {{contemporary}} neuroscience, a framework is proposed in which drivers’ steering and pedal behavior is modeled {{as a series}} of individual control adjustments, triggered after accumulation of sensory evidence for the need of an adjustment, or evidence that a previous or ongoing adjustment is not achieving the intended results. Example simulations are provided. Speciﬁcally, it is shown that evidence accumulation can account for previously unexplained variance in looming detection thresholds and brake onset timing. It is argued that the proposed framework resolves a discrepancy in the current driver modeling literature, by explaining not only the short-latency, well-tuned, closed-loop type of control of routine driving, but also the degradation into long-latency, ill-tuned open-loop control in more rare, unexpected, and urgent situations such as <b>near-accidents...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop and test a multi-method empirical approach for predicting drivers’ assessments {{of the level of}} acceptability of a warning issued in response to accidents, <b>near-accidents,</b> and other incidents. The role of humans (drivers) in the pre-crash phase means that systems that protect occupants and pedestrians must be seen as distributed, cognitive systems. Driver acceptance therefore has to be an important design goal. One obstacle to acceptance is the human dislike for false alarms. An approach to overcoming driver dislike for false alarms is to focus on driver expectations and to design systems to issue alarms when and only when the driver is likely to accept them.
