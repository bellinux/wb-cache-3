50|$|Two main {{areas of}} <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequencing</b> in {{development}} are solid state <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequencing,</b> and protein based <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Protein <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequencing</b> utilizes membrane protein complexes such as ∝-Hemolysin, MspA (Mycobacterium Smegmatis Porin A) or CssG, which show great promise given {{their ability to}} distinguish between individual and groups of nucleotides. In contrast, solid-state <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequencing</b> utilizes synthetic materials such as silicon nitride and aluminum oxide and it is preferred for its superior mechanical ability and thermal and chemical stability.

30|$|After {{the idea}} of <b>nanopore,</b> DNA <b>sequencing</b> was put forward by the {{biologist}} Kasianowicz group in 1996 [53]; the nanopore technology has been rapidly developed. DNA <b>sequencing</b> using <b>nanopore</b> is a physical method, and it replaced Sanger’s DNA polymerase method. This method uses the electric field to drive the movement of DNA in the nanopore, and it directly uses the time characteristic of nanopore ion current to distinguish {{the size of a}} single base so as to achieve the purpose of DNA <b>sequencing.</b> <b>Nanopore</b> DNA <b>sequencing</b> method avoids DNA modification, amplification, and other processes, which save the cost of expensive polymerase, so this method possessed high competitiveness.

40|$|Background Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato, {{including}} the tick-transmitted agents of human Lyme borreliosis, have particularly complex genomes, {{consisting of a}} linear main chromosome and numerous linear and circular plasmids. The number and structure of plasmids is variable even in strains within a single genospecies. Genes on these plasmids are known to play essential roles in virulence and pathogenicity as well as host and vector associations. For this reason, {{it is essential to}} explore methods for rapid and reliable characterisation of molecular level changes on plasmids. In this study we used three strains: a low passage isolate of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B 31 (−NRZ) and two closely related strains (PAli and PAbe) that were isolated from human patients. Sequences of these strains were compared to the previously sequenced reference strain B 31 (available in GenBank) to obtain proof-of-principle information on the suitability of next generation sequencing (NGS) library construction and sequencing methods on the assembly of bacterial plasmids. We tested the effectiveness of different short read assemblers on Illumina sequences, and of long read generation methods on sequence data from Pacific Bioscience single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and nanopore (Oxford <b>Nanopore</b> Technologies) <b>sequencing</b> technology. Results Inclusion of mate pair library reads improved the assembly in some plasmids as did prior enrichment of plasmids. While cp 32 plasmids remained refractory to assembly using only short reads they were effectively assembled by long read sequencing methods. The long read SMRT and <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequences</b> came, however, at the cost of indels (insertions or deletions) appearing in an unpredictable manner. Using long and short read technologies together allowed us to show that the three B. burgdorferi s. s. strains investigated here, whilst having similar plasmid structures to each other (apart from fusion of cp 32 plasmids), differed significantly from the reference strain B 31 -GB, {{especially in the case of}} cp 32 plasmids. Conclusion Short read methods are sufficient to assemble the main chromosome and many of the plasmids in B. burgdorferi. However, a combination of short and long read sequencing methods is essential for proper assembly of all plasmids including cp 32 and thus, for gaining an understanding of host- or vector adaptations. An important conclusion from our work is that the evolution of Borrelia plasmids appears to be dynamic. This has important implications for the development of useful research strategies to monitor the risk of Lyme disease occurrence and how to medically manage it...|$|R

Molecular detection and analysis can be accomplished through the detection of transverse currents as the molecule or DNA base translocates through the nanopore. To increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio and the accuracy, we implement a new "multi-point cross-correlation" technique for identification of DNA bases or other molecules on the molecular level. We demonstrate that the cross-correlations between each nanopore will greatly enhance the transverse current signal for each molecule. We implement first-principles transport calculations for DNA bases surveyed across a multi-layered graphene nanopore system to illustrate the advantages of proposed geometry.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Electrically driven ionic {{transport}} of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) through nanopores is studied using atomistic simulations. The {{results show that}} in nanopores wetted by RTILs a gradual dewetting transition occurs upon increasing the applied voltage, which {{is accompanied by a}} sharp increase in ionic current. These phenomena originate from the solvent-free nature of RTILs and are in stark contrast with the {{transport of}} conventional electrolytes through nanopores. Amplification is possible by controlling the properties of the nanopore and RTILs, and we show that it is especially pronounced in charged nanopores. The results highlight the unique physics of nonequilibrium transport of RTILs in confined geometries and point to potential experimental approaches for manipulating ionic transport in nanopores, which can benefit diverse techniques including nanofluidic circuitry and nanopore analytics.

40|$|Using <b>nanopores</b> for single-molecule <b>sequencing</b> of {{proteins}} – similar to nanopore-based sequencing of DNA – faces multiple challenges, including unfolding {{of the complex}} tertiary structure of the proteins and enforcing their unidirectional translocation through nanopores. Here, we combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with single-molecule experiments to investigate the utility of SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) to unfold proteins for solid-state nanopore translocation, while simultaneously endowing them with a stronger electrical charge. Our simulations and experiments prove that SDS-treated proteins show a considerable loss of the protein structure during the nanopore translocation. Moreover, SDS-treated proteins translocate through the nanopore in the direction prescribed by the electrophoretic force due to the negative charge impaired by SDS.

50|$|As a young {{professor}} at UC Davis, Deamer {{continued to work}} with electron microscopy, revealing {{for the first time}} particles related to functional ATPase enzymes within the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum. After spending sabbaticals in England at the University of Bristol in 1971 and with Alec Bangham in 1975, Deamer became interested in liposomes. Conversations with Bangham inspired his research on the role of membranes in the origin of life, and in 1985 Deamer demonstrated that the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite contained lipid-like compounds that could assemble into membranous vesicles. Deamer described he significance of self-assembly processes in his 2011 book First Life. In collaborative work with Mark Akeson, a post-doctoral student at the time, the two established methods for monitoring proton permeation through ion channels such as gramicidin. In 1989, while returning from a scientific meeting in Oregon, Deamer conceived that {{it might be possible to}} sequence single molecules of DNA by using an imposed voltage to pull them individually through a nanoscopic channel. The DNA sequence could be distinguished by the specific modulating effect of the four bases on the ionic current through the channel. In 1993, he and Dan Branton initiated a research collaboration with John Kasianowitz at NIST to explore this possibility with the hemolysin channel, and in 1996 published the first paper demonstrating that <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequencing</b> may be feasible. George Church at Harvard had independently proposed a similar idea, and Church, Branton and Deamer decided to initiate a patent application which was awarded in 1998. Mark Akeson joined the research effort in 1997, and in 1999 published a paper showing that the hemolysin channel, now referred to as a nanopore, could distinguish between purine and pyrimidine bases in single RNA molecules. In 2007, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) licensed the patents describing the technology and in 2014 released the MinION <b>nanopore</b> <b>sequencing</b> device to selected researchers.
