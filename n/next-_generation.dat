40|$|Designers {{consider}} {{the future as}} an intrinsic aspect of the design process yet, there has been limited academic investigation of the approaches designers employ to create <b>next-</b> next <b>generation</b> products and services. The central aim of this thesis is to investigate the role of futures thinking in design. It draws upon the field of future studies to provide a theoretical base for the research. The research answers three questions: How do designers engage with the future within the design process? What futures thinking methods are employed in the design process? What futures thinking methods do designers employ? Data was collected via semi-structured interviews in the UK and USA with 40 + designers, researchers, and design managers. Six research propositions {{provide a framework for}} qualitative data analysis through which a series of theoretical categories and associated substantive factors are identified. Analysis of the research findings supported the development of a design futures framework that communicates a representative picture of the role of future thinking in design, and contributes to understanding the ways in which designers {{consider the}} future in the design process. The study identifies the growing need for organisations to engage designers to consider the future within an increasingly complex and competitive product and service developmental landscape.

A modular, customised concept is used and the first version of the sensor has four multispectral CCD lines, which are selected to support both photogrammetry and remote sensing applications.

Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) is thus very important and holds great potential for improving treatment strategies.
