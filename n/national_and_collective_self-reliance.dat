Towards this background {{the main part of the}} article discusses South-South co-operation as an alternative or complementary development strategy. Global South-South co-operation <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance</b> is largely dismissed as an ideologically motivated policy recommendation, overlooking the large number of conflicting interests among developing countries. The areas of joint interest are greater at regional or subregional levels, and a number of South-South integration schemes have been signed during the last decade. There are several potential gains associated with these integration processes, but substantial economic and political barriers have to be overcome. When geographically and politically possible, North-South integration schemes may have larger advantages than pure South-South arrangements...|$|R

German call centers {{were more likely to}} adopt high-involvement management practices than those in the United States, even across workplaces with no collective bargaining institutions. Within Germany, union and works council presence was positively associated with high-involvement practices, while works council presence alone had no effect. In contrast, union presence in U.

40|$|Excerpt] This article {{examines}} the relationship between <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions <b>and</b> high-involvement management practices in new service workplaces, based on case study and survey evidence from U. S. and German call centers. Call centers are a particularly good setting for a comparative study of work organization. The number of call center jobs has grown rapidly, as firms in most industries have made them the central mechanism for interacting with customers. At the same time, standardized call center technologies have diffused worldwide, leading managers to adopt similar approaches to call distribution, productivity measurement, the use of electronic monitoring to manage employee behavior, and workflow standardization. These establishments also face {{a common set of}} competitive conditions, with high cost pressures and unpredictable demand flows. They thus represent a constrained work setting in which skill levels and the bargaining power of workers and unions are typically low. Finally, because call centers are relatively new, many have either no collective bargaining institutions or, in the case of Germany, only recently established works councils—making it feasible to examine variation in these institutional arrangements. The analysis focuses on three questions. First, do <b>national</b> <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions influence the adoption of high-involvement management practices? I use the term “high-involvement management” to describe management practices that engender employee discretion and collaboration and that rely on trust rather than on intensive monitoring and control. Second, I ask whether <b>national</b> <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions <b>and</b> high- involvement management practices are associated with lower voluntary employee turnover. Third, I consider whether high-involvement management mediates the relationship between <b>national</b> <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions <b>and</b> employee turnover. That is, do these institutions affect turnover directly or only indirectly through their effects on work organization and performance monitoring? The study answers these questions through a “mixed-method” analysis, drawing on data from extensive qualitative field research as well as identical establishment-level surveys of 472 U. S. and 154 German call centers...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe development {{strategy of the}} European Union (EU) in Afghanistan suffers from two major defects: inadequate coordination between the EU donors, <b>national</b> <b>and</b> <b>collective,</b> <b>and</b> an overemphasis on short-term projects that do not promote sustainable economic growth. This thesis examines {{the underlying causes of}} these defects and analyzes two methods that might address them. First, it assesses the possible benefits of appointing an EU or United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan "super envoy" to synchronize EU donor activities. Second, it uses a regional development strategy case study called "Nangarhar Inc" to examine techniques that the EU donors could emulate to enable a revised EU strategy to attain its fullest potential. The analysis indicates that an EU "super envoy" might be able to harness the full weight of the EU donors in regional development strategies undertaking large-scale projects beyond the capabilities of most donors in Afghanistan. The thesis concludes that by promoting private-sector-led economic growth through regional strategies, a unified EU strategy might provide sustainable development in Afghanistan that could contribute to a notable reduction in the requirement for international donor intervention in the mid to long term.

40|$|Historically, {{the people}} of Mozambique have faced oppression and social spatial {{segregation}} and responded {{in a way that}} has reinforced rather than dismantled their traditional values. Since pre-colonial times, the population’s strategy for escaping from environmental and foreign political disruption has been to reinvent tradition, based on the principles of resilience, resistance and self-reliance. The development of decentralised human settlements, involving the appropriation of land for domestic space and the self-organisation of neighbourhoods, were strategies to protect communities from adversity <b>and</b> secure <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance.</b> Following Mozambique’s conversion to globalization, the post-colonial ‘cement city’ is now the core of neo-liberalism, as a node of the global economy, where foreign donors and international market economy control national political economy, exacerbating the premise of the negation of self-sufficiency that continues to evolve resiliently at its margins. The adoption of a neo-liberal model of development during the 1990 s, completely bypasses the realities of Mozambican society. This paper argues that the strategy of self-production of space regarding the household/Outdoor Domestic Space unit, which existed previously as a resistance strategy, first of all against colonialism and secondly, against the statist definition of socialism, thirdly, has become a successful strategy for survival, as the building block of the decentralised Agrocity, {{in the face of a}} global economy which totally neglects both the people and the land. Outdoor Domestic Space is a multifaceted space that refers to the external space surrounding the built house and which, in the case of Mozambique, is where daily life takes place, involving strong social, ecological and productive functions. Under successive periods of political economy oppression and environmental adversity, the Outdoor Domestic Space has been adapted and refined to ensure <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance.</b> Shaping a green and ruralised urbanisation at the margins of the Mozambican post-colonial dualistic city, which I call the Agrocity, the Outdoor Domestic Space is resilient because it is able to adjust domestic space as a strategy to secure livelihoods, provide urban food, commerce and services, maintain vital kinship relationships and produce a comfortable and clean microclimate across the spontaneous neighbourhoods. This spatial resilience is the feature underlying the self-organisation of neighbourhoods with a new way of overcoming alienation from nature, which suggest the continuance of an innate relationship between society, the human habitat and natur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} make the case for a model of {{political}} identity based on an optical metaphor, which is especially applicable to nations. Human vision can be separated into sentient object, lenses and inbuilt mental ideas. This corresponds well to identity processes in which 'light' from a bounded territorial referent is refracted through various lenses (ideological, material, psychological) to focus in certain ways on particular symbolic resources like genealogy, history, culture or political institutions. Distinguishing between referent, lenses and resources helps us more precisely situate many hitherto disparate problems of national identity. These include the 'ethnic-civic' dilemma, the mystery of national identity before nationalism, and the relationship between local <b>and</b> <b>national,</b> <b>and</b> individual <b>and</b> <b>collective,</b> identities. The model also clarifies the place of universalist ideology, which currently fits poorly within the leading culturalist and materialist theories of nationalism...|$|R
40|$|From a very centralistic and collectivistic {{tradition}} after World War Two, Dutch {{employment relations}} now show a trend towards radical decentralisation and individualisation. What {{might be the}} consequences of this trend for labour relations? Do developments still fit within a movement towards `organised decentralisation’ or will the existing system of labour relations be hollowed out and destroyed? And what will be the consequences for ER management at company level? We present empirical data on how companies deal with their decentralised and individualised employment relations. It appears that, in the main areas such as labour contracts, working time arrangements, reward systems and development plans, decentralisation and individualisation are taking place. It has also become clear that management as well as workers support this and that a new form of negotiation between them is developing at workplace level, resulting in what we call `third contracts’ that are additional to the initial labour contract <b>and</b> the <b>collective</b> agreement. Our results also highlight the pragmatic way in which companies deal with these decentralised and individualised employment relations, which, nevertheless, remain linked to the <b>national</b> <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> levels of bargaining. Within the multilevel system of Dutch employment relations a new balance between collectivism and individualism is emerging...|$|R

40|$|The re-democratization {{process in}} Argentina, {{beginning}} {{at the end of}} 1983, emphasized a tendency that had emerged within the Judeo-Argentinean fiction (and Argentinean narrative in general) to contemplate on the <b>collective</b> <b>and</b> personal memory, while creating a type of dialogue with the general historic context of the twentieth century. This process was un-masqueraded as a political and literary strategy in order to re-create an 2 ̆ 2 archive 2 ̆ 2 and re-construct {{it in a way that}} would correspond to the new material circumstances of the Argentinean nation and its society at that specific moment.
