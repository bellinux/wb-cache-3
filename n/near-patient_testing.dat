40|$|Acute stent {{thrombosis}} {{remains one}} of the most important concerns in clinical cardiology. The mechanism is not fully understood but a prothrombotic state is a key component. We describe a case of acute stent thrombosis, within an hour of rescue angioplasty, despite use of full dose fibrinolytic (reteplase) and antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). Risk of acute stent thrombosis was predicted an hour earlier, when the patient was clinically well, by a novel <b>near-patient</b> <b>test</b> of thrombotic and thrombolytic status (in vitro). Subsequent stent thrombosis was visualised angiographically (in vivo) and confirmed by extraction of the thrombus (ex vivo).

40|$|Background: Excessive {{antibiotics}} use {{increases the}} risk of resistance. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} Centor score combined with Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) for Group A Streptococci can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients with sore throat. According to the former Swedish guidelines RADT was recommended with 2 - 4 Centor criteria present and antibiotics were recommended if the test was positive. C-reactive protein (CRP) was not recommended for sore throats. Inappropriate use of RADT and CRP has been reported in several studies. Methods: From a larger project 16 general practitioners (GPs) who stated management of sore throats not according to the guidelines were identified. Half-hour long semi-structured interviews were conducted. The topics were the management of sore throats and the use of <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests.</b> Qualitative content analysis was used. Results: The use of the <b>near-patient</b> <b>test</b> interplayed with the clinical assessment and the perception that all infections caused by bacteria should be treated with antibiotics. The GPs expressed a belief that the clinical picture was sufficient for diagnosis in typical cases. RADT was not believed to be relevant since it detects only one bacterium, while CRP was considered as a reliable numerical measure of bacterial infection. Conclusions: Inappropriate use of <b>near-patient</b> <b>test</b> can partly be understood as remnants of outdated knowledge.

40|$|Testing for the {{diagnosis}} of acute myocardial infarction and other diseases included in the spectrum of the "acute coronary syndrome" is rapidly changing from the traditional enzymatic assays to mass measurement bf more specific and sensitive markers (cardiac troponins, CK-MB and myoglobin). Several questions have arisen since the introduction of these new markers into the clinical setting: the choice of strategies for optimizing the utilization of biochemical assays combining different (early and specific) markers, a rationale for sampling specimens and the identification of clinically useful turnaround times. In particular, for achieving the last goal, attention has been directed toward <b>near-patient</b> <b>testing</b> for cardiac markers in addition to, or as a replacement for, traditional diagnostic methodologies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> are {{promoted}} for guiding {{management of}} common infections {{in primary care}} {{with a view to}} enhancing the effectiveness of prescribing decisions and containing antimicrobial resistance. Changes in clinical practice should be based on appraisals of the factors that might influence change, viewed from the perspective of those expected to implement the change. We therefore explored the views of general practitioners concerning the possible introduction of <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> for managing common infections. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interview study. Interviews were recorded and analysed using thematic content analysis. SETTING: General practices in south-east Wales, UK. SUBJECTS: A total of 26 general practitioners (GPs) from high fluroquinolone antibiotics prescribing practices and 14 GPs from practices that prescribed fluroquinolones close to the south-east Wales mean. RESULTS: There was strong enthusiasm for a hypothetical <b>near-patient,</b> finger-prick blood <b>tests</b> that could distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Many GPs emphasized that such tests would be valuable in "selling" decisions not to prescribe antibiotics to patients. Concerns included limited additional useful information to guide prescribing above clinical diagnosis alone, that patients might deteriorate even if the tests correctly identified a viral aetiology, and that GPs would need to be convinced by research evidence supporting uptake. Several indicated that tests would be useful only for a limited number of patients and they were concerned by time pressures, apparatus maintenance and quality control, cost, and possible objections from patients, especially children. CONCLUSIONS: Despite GP enthusiasm for the concept of a rapid test to distinguish viral from bacterial infection, strategies to promote uptake would be enhanced if concerns were addressed regarding the importance and feasibility of such tests in daily practice...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{increased}} pressure on {{primary care physicians}} to monitor oral anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE: To test the null hypothesis that oral anticoagulation care can be provided at least as well in primary care through a nurse-led clinic, involving <b>near-patient</b> <b>testing</b> and computerized decision support software, compared with routine hospital management based {{on a variety of}} clinical outcome measures. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial in 12 primary care practices in Birmingham, England (9 intervention and 3 control). Two control populations were used: patients individually randomly allocated as controls in the intervention practices (intrapractice controls) and all patients in control practices (interpractice controls). Intervention practices' patients were randomized to the intervention (practice-based anticoagulation clinic) or control (hospital clinic) group. The main outcome measure was therapeutic control of the international normalized ratio. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-seven patients were recruited (122 intervention patients, 102 intrapractice control patients, and 143 interpractice control patients). Standard measures of control of the international normalized ratio (point prevalence) showed {{no significant difference between the}} intervention and control groups. Data on proportion of time spent in the international normalized ratio range showed significant improvement for patients in the intervention group (paired t test, P =. 008). CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led anticoagulation clinics can be implemented in novice primary care settings by means of computerized decision support software and <b>near-patient</b> <b>testing.</b> Care given by this model is at least as good as routine hospital follow-up.

40|$|Background: Uncertainty is {{inevitable}} in clinical practice {{in primary care}} and tolerance for uncertainty and concern for bad outcomes {{has been shown to}} vary between physicians. Uncertainty is a factor for inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Evidence-based guidelines as well as <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> are suggested tools to decrease uncertainty in the management of patients with respiratory tract infections. The aim of this paper was to describe strategies for coping with uncertainty in patients with pharyngotonsillitis in relation to guidelines. Methods: An interview study was conducted among a strategic sample of 25 general practitioners (GPs). Results: All GPs mentioned potential dangerous differential diagnoses and complications. Four strategies for coping with uncertainty were identified, one of which was compliant with guidelines, "Adherence to guidelines", and three were idiosyncratic: "Clinical picture and C-reactive protein (CRP) ", "Expanded control", and "Unstructured". The residual uncertainty differed for the different strategies: in the strategy "Adherence to guidelines" and " Clinical picture and CRP" uncertainty was avoided, based either on adherence to guidelines or on the clinical picture and near-patient CRP; in the strategy " Expanded control" uncertainty was balanced based on expanded control; and in the strategy "Unstructured" uncertainty prevailed in spite of redundant examination and anamnesis. Conclusion: The majority of the GPs avoided uncertainty and deemed they had no problems. Their strategies either adhered to guidelines or comprised excessive use of tests. Thus use of guidelines as well as use of more <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> seemed associated to reduced uncertainty, although the later strategy at the expense of compliance to guidelines. A few GPs did not manage to cope with uncertainty or had to put in excessive work to control uncertainty.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the commonest {{cause of}} vaginal discharge, and its {{association}} with obstetric and gynaecological complications is being recognized increasingly. It was our impression that BV was poorly understood and underdiagnosed in family practice. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the management of patients with vaginal symptoms by family practitioners and to see if the management changed after the assimilation of best practice guidelines. METHOD: Family practitioners were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire of their perceived practice, and to record actual practice when consulted about vaginal symptoms, for a minimum of 4 weeks. Consensus best practice guidelines were then provided and practice recorded for a similar period. RESULTS: Baseline data was received from 34 practitioners and suggested that the symptoms and signs of different vaginal infections were not well known. Most symptomatic patients were only investigated at re-presentation with unresolved symptoms or at recurrence, and 43 % of respondents treated with empirical antifungals as a first line approach. Pregnant patients were only occasionally asked about symptoms and only occasionally examined if symptomatic. Pre-guideline practice data from 30 practitioners showed 1. 2 patient consultations/week, of which 60 % were examined and 55 % had a high vaginal swab (HVS) sent. Only 2 % had <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> done. Post-guideline data from 23 family practitioners showed a lower recorded consultation rate at 0. 7 /week, but 90 % of these were examined, 77 % had an HVS sent and 69 % had <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> done. Of the 36 HVS examined by Gram stain, 19 (53 %) showed Lactobacillus predominant flora and 10 (28 %) suggested BV. Seven (19 %) were borderline or ungradable.

40|$|<b>Near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> (NPT) are an area {{of rapid}} {{technological}} advance that may {{enhance the quality of}} care given by primary care physicians by enabling more accurate diagnosis or more reliable monitoring of therapy. Unfortunately, many new diagnostic technologies prove disappointing in practice, either because of limitations of the technology or because of a failure to address setting-specific issues that were not apparent during their evaluation. A recent systematic review of NPT in primary care has highlighted the methodological weaknesses of most published evaluations. There is a need for a formal statement of the criteria by which to judge the quality of evaluations in this field. In a similar fashion to Wilson and Junger's criteria for screening, seven questions need to be addressed. These cover the performance, reliability and acceptability of the test, its impact on decision-making, comparison with existing practice, cost-effectiveness of the test and integration with the practitioner's knowledge base. Evaluations of NPTs should therefore address the following methodological issues: demonstration of the need for the NPT, definition of the appropriate reference standard, calculation of sample size based on modelling of the decision problem and defining acceptable limits to the likelihood ratio, avoidance of verification bias, selection bias and treatment paradox, testing for the presence of spectrum bias, reporting the sensitivity of the results to changes in setting or prevalence or disease and calculating cost-effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Periodontitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammation}} of the periodontium caused by persistent bacterial infection {{that leads to the}} breakdown of connective tissue and bone. Because the ability to reconstruct the periodontium is limited after alveolar bone loss, early diagnosis and intervention should be the primary goals of periodontal treatment. However, periodontitis often progresses without noticeable symptoms, and many patients do not seek professional dental care until the periodontal destruction progresses to the point of no return.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to assess whether a {{screening}} programme for Helicobacter pylori will be both successful and cost-effective. Method: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the NHS Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness; MEDLINE; EMBASE; SilverPlatter, Biological Abstracts and Science Citation Index-Expanded. We used the search terms Helicobacter pylori and (diagnos$ or identif$ or find$) and (systematic review$ or meta-anal$), and searched for articles in all languages and limited the search to humans. Evaluation of the Level of Evidence: We used the rating system of the American Family Physician journal: Level A (randomized controlled trial/meta-analysis); Level B (other evidence); and C (consensus/expert opinion). Results: Serological tests: Antibody levels persist in serum {{for many years and}} do not permit us to distinguish between past and present infection or to identify treatment failures. Saliva and urine tests: A saliva test had sensitivity of 81 % and specificity of 73 %. A urine test had sensitivity of 86 - 89 % and specificity of 69 - 91 %. Breath urea tests: The tests have a high sensitivity and specificity but require expensive equipment. Stool tests: showed a high sensitivity and specificity. The European Helicobacter study group recommends either the breath urea or stool antibody tests in the initial diagnosis of H. pylori. Tests for specific gene sequences showed a high sensitivity and specificity. Endoscopy: is invasive, uncomfortable for patients, and expensive. The cost-effectiveness of tests for H. pylori: The better accuracy of the stool and breath tests, despite their greater cost, make them more cost-effective than the serology or <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests.</b> Conclusions: Tests with good sensitivity and specificity are available. The costs of non-invasive diagnostic tests acceptable to patients have been worked out, and the cost-effective dominance of stool and particularly urea breath tests over serological tests has been determined in a systematic review. What remains is to implement and test further the cost-effectiveness of national testing strategies...|$|R
40|$|A diagnosis-prescribing {{study was}} {{performed}} in 5 Swedish counties during 1 week in November in 2000 and repeated in 2002. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse data for children 0 - 15 y of age who consulted a general practitioner with symptoms of an infection. During the 2 weeks studied, 4049 children were consulted. Respiratory tract infections (RTI) were the predominant diagnoses, above all among the youngest children, while the proportion of urinary tract infections and skin infections increased with increasing age. Between the y 2000 and 2002, the proportion of children allocated the diagnosis streptococcal tonsillitis and pneumonia decreased (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 001, respectively) while the proportion of common cold increased (p < 0. 001). Antibiotic prescribing decreased from 55 % to 48 % (p < 0. 001) for respiratory infections between the years studied. The only significant changes in type of antibiotics prescribed were the increase of isoxazolylpenicillins (p < 0. 001) used for skin infection and the decrease of macrolides (p = 0. 001). A diagnostic test was used in more than half of the consultations. Of children allocated a RTI diagnosis, 36 % were prescribed antibiotics when a C-reactive protein test was performed compared to 58 % in those not tested. Further studies are needed in general practice to determine the optimal use of <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> in children with RTI...|$|R
40|$|The European {{influenza}} surveillance scheme (EISS) {{is based}} on a surveillance model that combines clinical and virological data in the general population. Eighteen countries in Europe report weekly influenza activity to EISS ([URL] A questionnaire on the virological data collection was sent electronically to the EISS members. Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological <b>testing,</b> <b>near-patient</b> <b>tests</b> and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently. For the subtyping of influenza, HAI and PCR are used most often. An east-west divide was seen for the use of PCR in typing and subtyping (more PCR use in the west). Differences in the virological surveillance systems in Europe can make direct comparisons difficult because detection rates may differ by test. For the reporting of other respiratory infections besides influenza, many networks (68 %) collect information on RSV. This is important because RSV causes similar clinical symptoms as influenza and can have a similar impact in terms of burden of disease. With the collection of RSV data, EISS is moving to a broader spectrum of viral respiratory diseases. The findings of this survey will be used to better harmonise laboratory methods in EISS in order to obtain more reliable and comparable information on influenza activity in Europe...|$|R
