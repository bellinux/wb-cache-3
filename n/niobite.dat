5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or <b>niobite).</b> The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E

Nb 2 O 5 immediately reacted with CaO in the molten CaCl 2 and formed calcium <b>niobites</b> that exhibited rod- or plate-like morphology. After the electrolysis of CaO with a graphite consumable anode, spherical particles of metallic niobium powder containing a residual oxygen concentration of 0. 673 mass % O were obtained. 1...|$|R
50|$|Dianium was the {{proposed}} {{name for a}} new element found by the mineralogist and poet Wolfgang Franz von Kobell in 1860. The name derived from the Roman goddess Diana. During {{the analysis of the}} mineral tantalite and <b>niobite</b> he concluded that it does contain an element similar to niobium and tantalum.|$|E
50|$|Columbite, {{also called}} <b>niobite,</b> niobite-tantalite and columbate Mn)Nb2O6, {{is a black}} mineral group that is an ore of niobium. It has a submetallic luster and a high density and is a niobate of iron and manganese. This mineral group was first found in Haddam, Connecticut, in the United States. It forms a series with the tantalum-dominant {{analogue}} ferrotantalite and one with the manganese-dominant analogue manganocolumbite. The iron-rich member of the columbite group is ferrocolumbite. Some tin and tungsten may {{be present in the}} mineral. Yttrocolumbite is the yttrium-rich columbite with the formula (Y,U,Fe)(Nb,Ta)O4. It is a radioactive mineral found in Mozambique.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of digital computers {{has begun to}} saturate due to material, size, and power limitations. In addition to solving these dilemmas, new computing paradigms are being investigated. This thesis explores neuromorphic computing as a possible new computational paradigm, specifically an all hardware approach based on biological neural processing. This thesis introduces neuromorphic computing, neurobiology, memristive devices for neuromorphic computing, and the memristive material lithium <b>niobite</b> (LiNbO 2). It then discusses the synthesis of lithium <b>niobite</b> by room temperature sputtering {{as well as some}} basic physical, optical, chemical, and electrical properties and explores more complex properties of lithium <b>niobite</b> including the effects of high energy radiation on lithium <b>niobite</b> devices and the effects of light interacting with the mobile ions in lithium <b>niobite.</b> The thesis discusses three devices useful for mimicking sub-structures within a biological neuron. These devices are two-terminal lithium <b>niobite</b> memristors, lithium <b>niobite</b> based batteries, and a new memdiode based on Nb 2 O 5. The thesis concludes by discussing device models for lithium <b>niobite</b> memristors and their application in several neuromorphic circuits to add biologically realistic behavior without increasing the complexity of the circuit.

40|$|A {{passive and}} {{wireless}} sensor is provided for sensing {{at least one}} of magnetic field, temperature or humidity. The sensor can provide only one of the sensing functions, individually or any combination of them simultaneously. It can be used for various applications where magnetic field changes, temperature and/or humidity need to be measured. In one or more embodiments, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor is provided that can measure one or more of a magnetic field (or current that generates the magnetic field), temperature and humidity. In one or more embodiments, a magnetoimpedence (MI) sensor (for example a thin film giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) sensor), a thermally sensitive (for example a Lithium <b>Niobite</b> (LiNbO. sub. 3)) substrate, and a humidity sensitive film (for example a hydrogel film) can be used as sensing elements...|$|E
