Sellele nähtusele on pühendatud tuhandeid humanitaartea duslikke, sotsioloogilisi, politoloogilisi jm uurimusi, mis kajastavad vene eksiilkultuuri eri tahke. Vene emigratsioon puudutas ka Eestit ning enamik käsitletud ilmingutest olid otseselt seotud siinse vene kogukonnaga, ent kohati väga erineva tähendusega. Käesoleva artikli eesmärk on lühidalt kirjeldada vene emigratsiooni sotsiaalset ja demograafilist struktuuri, selle keskusi, emigrantide rolli oma ja võõra kultuuri säilitamisel, põlvkondadevahelist aspekti, eelkõige kirjanduselus, ning haridusküsimusi. Lähemalt on käsitletud vene emigrantide rolli Eesti kultuuris muu maailma taustal.     SU M M A R Y   After the October Revolution {{a mass of}} emigrants, all {{citizens}} of the former Tsarist Russia dispersed in the world. In the scholarly literature this dispersal of upwards {{of a million people}} has come to be referred to as the first wave of Russian emigration. Thousands of scholarly articles from the humanities, sociology, political science and other disciplines have been devoted to various aspects of Russian exile culture: descriptions of exile cultural centres (including Paris, Berlin, Constantinople, Brazil, and the USA); various cultural phenomena (literature, film, theatre, fashion, journalism, art, etc.). As was true of the large part of Europe, the Russian emigration impacted Estonia, as it did across the rest of Europe; however, the fate of the Russian community in Estonia had strikingly original features. Some of these derived principally from Estonia’s position as a border state, {{as well as from the}} fact that even in the days of the Russian Empire, over 40000 Russians resided in Estonia. Theoretically, this should have made it easier for Russian emigrants to assimilate to Estonian conditions (for example, Russian schools existed from an earlier period, along with the requisite complement of teachers; Russian-language journalism existed, etc.). However, in reality, most of the promoters of local Russian culture emerged from among the emigrants, new settlers in Estonia. The purpose of this article is briefly to describe the social and demographic structure of the Russian emigration (military personnel will be treated separately) and the question of their legalization, which was solved in 1921 by the renowned Norwegian explorer Fridtjof <b>Nansen.</b> At his <b>initiative,</b> the Intergovernmental Conference of the representatives of 34 nations that met in Geneva adopted the designation refugee, which for the time being only referred to stateless people of Russian origin. The legitimation of these people as refugees was contingent on the acceptance of a statute confirming the use of a heretofore nonexistent International identity document, the so-called Nansen Certificate. This certificate enabled Russian emigrants to claim refugee status in several nations, which included the attribution of rights and freedoms equal to those of citizens of these nations. Approximately 450 000 Nansen Certificates were issued over a period of several years. The article contains brief descriptions of centres of exile, the circumstances and chronology of their foundation, the perceived role of emigrants in the preservation of their own culture and a culture foreign to them. The intergenerational conflict that occurred in cultural, in particular literary life is discussed. Among other topics considered are issues concerning publication, journalistic activity, and educational activities; a brief consideration is given to the positions of different nations on the support and preservation of Russian-language education. A very important influence on Russian emigration was Vladimir Lenin’s so-called „gift“— the expulsion of over 200 scholars from Soviet Russia in the year 1921. A special place is accorded in this article to the role of Russian emigrants in Estonian culture, including the role played by Russian cultural figures (scholars, military personnel, artists, etc.) in building up the young Estonian Republic. The most active participation of Russians was occasioned by the creation of Estonia’s own legal system. In addition, Russians participated in organizing the Estonian postal system and local transportation. The role of Russian emigrants in the development of the educational system of the Estonian Republic is also significant. The article describes the leadership provided by the local Russian community, particularly in the establishment in 1924 of the tradition of Russian cultural festivals, which was then disseminated globally in Russian exile culture. Brief consideration is given to local Russian culture and its importance in the development of Estonian culture. The most important facet of this was the Estonian ballet, born of Russian traditions and experience. Reportedly the first professional ballet troupe was assembled in Tallinn in 1918 by Sessy Smironina-Sevun, but the first actual ballet was performed in 1922, premiering with Coppelia, choreographed by the Moscow Bolshoi Ballet prima ballerina Viktorina Krieger, who played the lead role, and was later to be the artistic director of the Estonia ballet. In 1919, Jevgenia Litvinova, a former ballerina from the Maria Theatre, founded the first ballet studio in Tallinn. Another topic addressed in the article is local publishing and literary activity in the Russian language. Besides Russian publishing houses (Bibliofiil, Koltso, Alfa, Russkaja Kniga), Estonian-language publishing houses printed Russian-language books, textbooks, magazines and newspapers. Up to the year 1940, 91 publishing houses in Estonia printed Russian-language material, many of them only a few Russian books. In addition to publication activities, literary circles were active at different times. Among them was the Revel Literary Circle, founded in 1898, the oldest and most unusual gathering place for educated people. Poets’ workshops in Tallinn and Tartu were among the more interesting societies in Estonia, aimed more specifically at poets of the younger generation. Members of the Tallinn workshop created their own almanac, „Nov“, and published a magazine, Polevõje Tsvetõ. All of these phenomena and problems must be situated in the context of the larger world. The Russian emigration is far from being merely a unique phenomenon of life and work outside of the homeland; indeed, it exerted a strong influence on the culture, scholarship, and literature of the countries of settlement. Among the greatest achievements of 20 th century humanity are the works of Nobel laureate and writer Ivan Bunin, prose writer Vladimir Nabokov, artists Marc Chagall, Konstantin Korovin, Aleksander Benois, and Vassily Kandinsky; the theories of Noble laureate, physicist and chemist Ilya Prigogine; the works of composers Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Igor Stravinsky; actor and theatre director Mikhail Chekhov; constructor Igor Sikorsky; chemist Vladimir Ipatjev. No less important in Estonian culture were poet Igor Severjanin, architect Aleksander Vladovski, representatives of Russian classical ballet (Tamara Beck, Jevgenia Litvinova); artists Anatoli Kaigorodov, Nikolai Kalmakov, and Andrei Jegorov...|$|R
40|$|In June 2016, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) {{announced}} {{that more than}} 65 million persons have fled conflict and persecution. While certainly large in its own right, the number actually underestimates displacement in today’s world. Many millions more are displaced each year and cumulatively from a much broader range of life-threatening humanitarian crises than are captured by UNHCR’s figures. An average of 26. 4 million were displaced annually by acute natural hazards since 2008 and an unknown but sizable number displaced by gang and cartel violence, electoral and communal violence, nuclear and industrial accidents, {{and a range of}} other human-made disasters. This article argues for new frameworks to more effectively address the situation of the totality of displaced persons, citing two recent efforts — the <b>Nansen</b> <b>Initiative</b> and Migrants in Countries in Crisis Initiative — as examples of practical ways to move forward in this regard...|$|E
40|$|The {{exhibition}} Antarctica {{is based}} on the Ortas’ 2007 expedition to the Antarctic peninsula where they created a temporary “village” of domelike tents to highlight the efforts of those struggling to cross borders and gain the freedom of movement necessary to escape conflict or natural disaster. Preserved as an area for scientific research with aims to protect the environment and to encourage international cooperation by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, Antarctica embodies utopia: a continent whose extreme climate encourages mutual aid and solidarity, freedom of research, sharing, and collaboration {{for the good of the}} planet. Each Dome Dwelling, one of which will be on display, is made from flags from nations around the world and affixed with clothes and gloves, further symbolizing the multiplicity and diversity of people and the freedom of crossing borders. Drop Parachutes and Life-Line – Survival Kit, two other major elements of the series, incorporate dueling points of view: help is urgently needed/help has arrived. Laden with the tools of survival, they signal urgency and emergency. The core of the project and the centerpiece of the exhibition is The Antarctic World Passport Delivery Bureau (2008 -ongoing), an architectural structure built with reclaimed materials recently installed at the <b>Nansen</b> <b>Initiative</b> Global Consultation in Geneva and the Grand Palais in Paris during the COP 21 Climate Summit. This public engagement artwork invites visitors to collect their personalized edition of the Antarctica World Passport (1995 -ongoing), and join the tens of thousands of people who have registered to become members of the online Antarctica World Community...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and intensity of}} natural disasters from climate events have been increasing {{in the last few}} years. While scientists are careful in causally linking these natural disasters to climate change, the record-breaking extreme climate events such as typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines speak for itself. Formerly a laggard in climate talks, adaptation has now gained footing not just in the UNFCCC but also among different countries. Decision 1 /CP. 16 also known as The Cancun Agreements invites all parties to the UNFCCC to enhance action on adaptation and undertake measures with regard to climate change induced displacement and migration. It is exactly this COP decision, which motivated the governments of Norway and Switzerland to establish the <b>Nansen</b> <b>Initiative</b> and craft a protection agenda for people who are at risk of disaster-induced cross-border displacement. Despite these efforts, there has yet to be a legally binding migration treaty that climate change victims can invoke. In this paper, we will look into the feasibility of immigration opportunities as humanitarian aid for victims of extreme climate events. Inspired by US and Canada immigration relief measures for typhoon Haiyan victims in the Philippines, we use a socio-political approach in constructing an immigration humanitarian model, which we would like to recommend as a potential humanitarian intervention after climate disasters. This recommendation is not only intended to address UNFCCC’s Decision 2 /CP. 19 (the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage) but to also provoke ambition and compassion from countries that are historically responsible for climate change...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Pacific {{islands are}} made up of twenty-two {{countries}} and territories. Approximately 10 million inhabitants live in about 300 islands (<b>Nansen</b> <b>Initiative,</b> 2013, p. 4). In the last decade, the region has emerged among the media, international institutions and civil society as one of climate change’s icons and hotspots. The United Nations Environment Program declared in 2005 that the inhabitants of Lataw (Tegua island, Torres archipelago, northern Vanuatu) were the ‘World’s first climate change refugees’ when the village was moved inland. In this context, the prevailing iconography and vocabulary associated with the climate change and migration nexus (CCMN) regarding the South Pacific seems to be dominated by the figure of the small island in a geographical sense and of the small island developing state in a political sense. This single-unit based imagery seems to tie islanders with the notions of isolation and powerlessness in a continued process of othering. Carol Farbotko pointed out that such representations could be viewed as “the legacy of the island laboratory” and “[ [...] . ] enable the exercise and justification of cosmopolitan activism towards climate change that speaks in part through space” (Farbotko, 2010, p. 1). Building on Farbotko's argument on the politicization of island space, this paper will attempt to show the necessity of varying our perspectives on the nature and scale of island space to understand the dynamics and meanings of the CCMN in the Pacific. One way to do so can be to consider the CCMN as a paradigm embedded in the dynamics of territorial networks. Territorial networks can be defined as multi-scalar systems of customary informal or institutionalized interactions between places, with these systems being experienced, identified and appropriated by social groups as well as embedded in power relations. The interest of this concept is threefold. It can allow researchers to pay a greater attention to the scalar, multi-local and relational dynamics of the CCMN. Secondly, discourses on climate change and migration reveal and may influence the political and social dynamics producing the continuities and discontinuities that structure territorial networks in the South Pacific. Finally, studying the CCMN in the context of territorial networks in the South Pacific allows an analysis of hierarchies and inequalities between actors and places. First, I will focus on the need and opportunity to look at island spaces from a relational perspective through the concept of territorial networks. Then I will try to show how it {{can be applied to the}} climate change and migration nexus in the South Pacific...|$|E
