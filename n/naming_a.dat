5|$|Since Koht {{lived in}} Lysaker, Bærum Municipality wanted to honor him by <b>naming</b> <b>a</b> street after him. When {{the street was}} named in 1967, Koht was still controversial. The street was {{therefore}} named Professor Kohts vei ("Professor Koht's Road") to emphasise his academic, rather than his political career.|$|E

5|$|A {{monument}} to Ion Heliade Rădulescu, sculpted by the Italian artist Ettore Ferrari, {{stands in front}} of the University building in central Bucharest. In addition to <b>naming</b> <b>a</b> lecture room after him, the Romanian Academy has instituted the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award—in 1880, it was awarded to Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, for his Cuvinte den bătrâni, and worth 5,000 gold lei. Ten years after, the prize was the center of a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the National Liberal Party, including Hasdeu and Dimitrie Sturdza. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal stance and his association with Junimea, as well as to his anti-nationalism, dislike of didacticism, and alleged cosmopolitanism. They thus refused to grant him the prize.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally <b>naming</b> <b>a</b> ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
5|$|Plagis was the top-scoring Southern Rhodesian ace of the war, and the highest-scoring ace of Greek origin, with 16 {{confirmed}} aerial victories, including 11 over Malta. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order {{and other}} medals, {{he was also}} one of Rhodesia's most decorated veterans. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, honoured his wartime contributions by <b>naming</b> <b>a</b> street in its northern Alexandra Park neighbourhood after him. On his return home after retiring from the RAF with the rank of wing commander in 1948, he set up home at 1John Plagis Avenue, opened a bottle store bearing his name, and was a director of several companies, including Central African Airways in the 1960s. He contested the Salisbury City constituency in the 1962 general election, running for the Rhodesian Front, but failed to win. He died in 1974, reportedly by suicide.|$|E

5|$|The LPF {{decided to}} {{maintain}} Fortuyn's candidacy, and delayed <b>naming</b> <b>a</b> new leader {{until after the}} election. The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives—by far {{a record number of}} seats in the Netherlands for a new party—to become the second largest party. LN also made it into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains. CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn's criticism of the purple coalition and Holland's multicultural society. As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate for Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Marthandan {{is chosen}} by a {{majority}} of the imperial council of the kingdom of Ratnapuri to be its new ruler after the previous king died without <b>naming</b> <b>a</b> successor. However, the kingdom's Rajaguru (high priest) Vijayavarman, plans to kill Marthandan and make Pingalan, Marthandan's cousin, king. Meanwhile, Veerabahu, a loyal bodyguard of the late king, and his men, including his son Bhupathi and daughter Madhana, are not pleased to see Marthandan as king and are equally saddened by the situation of Ratnapuri's people. Food shortages and high unemployment have besieged Ratnapuri in addition to the taxes imposed by Vijayavarman without Marthandan's knowledge. This results in violent protests by the people led by Veerangan, Marthandan's look-alike, with the support of his friend Sagayam. They march to the palace condemning the monarchy and demanding democracy. Veerangan is imprisoned for his actions in Naganathapuram, a nearby town. Madhana is also incarcerated in the same prison on a similar charge. They are pardoned and released on the occasion of Marthandan's coronation. They travel together to Ratnapuri. Sharing the same ideals and revolutionary thoughts, they fall in love.|$|E

6000|$|... § 4. The second general {{division}} of names is into concrete and abstract. <b>A</b> concrete <b>name</b> is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> {{which stands for}} a thing; <b>an</b> abstract <b>name</b> is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> which stands for an attribute of a thing. Thus John, the sea, this table, are names of things. White, also, is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> of <b>a</b> thing, or rather of things. Whiteness, again, is the <b>name</b> of <b>a</b> quality or attribute of those things. Man is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> of many things; humanity is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> of <b>an</b> attribute of those things. Old is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> of things: old age is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> {{of one of their}} attributes.|$|R
