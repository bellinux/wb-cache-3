40|$|BackgroundWe present our {{experience}} of complications of pure transperitoneal laparoscopic surgery in urology at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. MethodsBetween September 2003 and March 2006, 185 laparoscopic urologic operations were performed, consisting of 70 nephrectomies (36 radical, 17 partial, 11 simple, 6 donor), 28 adrenalectomies, 28 nephroureterectomies, 22 radical prostatectomies, 17 ureterolithotomies, 6 radical cystectomies, 5 pyeloplasties, 2 renal cyst unroofings, 2 <b>nephropexies</b> and 5 other operations. We reviewed the database of the patients to evaluate the complications and analyze factors related to laparoscopic surgeries. ResultsA total of 25 patients had 26 complications (14. 1 %, major in 4, minor in 22). The complications were categorized into intraoperative and postoperative complications in 10 and 16 patients, respectively. The mortality rate was 0 %. The conversion rate was 0. 54 % (1 patient). The re-operation rate was 1. 08 % (2 patients). The most common intraoperative complication was vascular injury (5 patients). The incidence of complication {{was related to the}} difficulty level of operation. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} complication rate and patient age, patient body mass index or the American Society of Anesthesiologist score. ConclusionThe complications of laparoscopic urologic surgeries are strongly correlated with the operative difficulties. In spite of elevated complication rates in difficult surgeries, the major complication rate in this study was very low. As the laparoscopic surgeries in urology involve more and more technique-dependent difficult fields, documentation and analysis of experience of complications is important for the development of this surgical modality...|$|R
50|$|While {{working in}} the Clinic of Hospital Surgery for more than 30 years, Professor Fedorov «introduced new {{surgical}} interventions, {{many of which were}} later named after him: one of the variants of pyelotomia (Fyodorov's operation), ways of intracapsular and subcapsular nephrectomy (Fyodorov surgery), a way to repair a lowered kidney (<b>nephropexy</b> by Fyodorov), operations for non-removable tumors of the cardia and lower third of the esophagus in cases involving total gastric cancer (Fyodorov's surgeries), a method for removing the gallbladder (Fyodorov's method), the original method for stitching of the liver and many others. For these procedures, S.P. Fyodorov developed original surgical instruments specifi cally designed for new urological surgery and for surgery of the liver and biliary tract.

40|$|The first {{successful}} <b>nephropexy</b> {{was performed in}} the year 1881. From this time, surgical therapy of nephroptosis {{has always been a}} subject of discussion.

As early as the 15 th century, a first description of ren mobilis was made by Alessius de Pedemontanus. The first surgical intervention for the treatment of nephroptosis was performed by Gilmore in 1870. In 1877, the American Dowell from New Orleans tried a fixation of the kidney through a seton, however, this operation failed. Eventually in 1881, Eugen Hahn from Berlin was able to perform the {{first successful}} <b>nephropexy,</b> he named this method "nephroraphy". In 1882, the first modification was made by Bassini with sutures through the renal capsule. Finally, the gynaecologist George Edebohl led <b>nephropexy</b> into a great popularity and secured the method through numerous technical innovations. By 1936, approximately 170 different surgical methods existed for fixation of the kidney. An accurate diagnosis is imperative before performing <b>nephropexy.</b> There were times in which this operation was carried out much too often and, therefore, had a bad reputation. However, it is not correct to drop <b>nephropexy</b> altogether as some would prefer.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty-five cases of <b>nephropexy</b> for movable kidney were {{experienced}} from 1967 to 1971 at the Department of Urology, Nagoya University Hospital. The upper urinary stasis {{was investigated in}} these cases both roentgenologically and pathohistologically. Urography showed the upper urinary stasis in 30. 3 %. The stasis was frequently seen particularly in the cases with kink at the ureteropelvic junction. Number of such cases increased according to grade of movability. Pathohistology of the kidney showed low grade of fluid stasis in the Bowman's capsule as well as fluid stasis and dilatation of the tubulus quite frequently. These findings were highly frequent particularly in those having urographical stasis of the upper urinary tract and were more advanced than those without urographical stasis. It was concluded that movable kidney with kink at the ureteropelvic junction may cause the upper urinary stasis which may then result the histological changes in the kidney, namely hydronephrotic changes.

40|$|Background: Simultaneous kidney-pancreas {{transplantation}} {{has become}} a recognized therapy for type I diabetes mellitus patients with diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. In {{the vast majority of}} these procedures, both grafts are placed intraperitoneally, which reduces posttransplant morbidity. Recently, in some of our recipients, we noted renal dysfunction related to complications of the renal pedicle. Our objectives in this study were to identify the cause of this renal dysfunction and to prevent its occurrence in future recipients. Study Design: We undertook a retrospective chart review of simultaneous kidney-pancreas recipients who experienced renal dysfunction related to renal pedicle complications. Results: We found four recipients with renal dysfunction related to renal pedicle torsion, diagnosed by serial ultrasound scans and kidney graft biopsies. Early diagnosis allowed salvage of three kidney grafts, but one was lost after late diagnosis. Conclusions: A high level of suspicion is needed to diagnose renal pedicle torsion. If simultaneous kidney-pancreas recipients have recurrent renal dysfunction, and rejection has been excluded, serial ultrasound scans with color flow Doppler examinations are needed. Once the diagnosis is made, a <b>nephropexy</b> to the anterior abdominal wall is indicated to prevent further torsion and save the kidney graft.

Materials and Methods: From November 1996 to March 2003, 12 patients (three females and nine males), with intractable chyluria were treated at our department with the retroperitoneoscopic technique. Diagnosis was based on urine examination for the presence of chyle and fat globules, cystoscopy, excretory urogram and retrograde ureteropyelography. The technique of retroperitoneoscopic management of chyluria consisted of nephrolympholysis, ureterolympholysis, hilar vessel stripping, fasciectomy and <b>nephropexy.</b> The first three procedures were done in all cases, whereas fasciectomy was only done in four cases and <b>nephropexy</b> in three as required. Results: Chyluria disappeared in all ipsilateral renal units of the patients who underwent retroperitoneoscopic management but it recurred in two patients at 1 and 9 months of follow up from the contralateral side. Both the cases have since been successfully treated with contralateral retroperitoneoscopic management. Complications included lymphatic leak through the drain, which persisted for 5 days in one case and an inadvertent clipping of a branch of the posterior segmental artery of the kidney in one. The latter patient did not have pain or hypertension and the renal scan did not reveal any focal deficit at follow up. All patients were followed periodically from 6 to 54 months (mean of 31 months).

In order to find out the difference in the renal function between standing up and laying down position, the author tried to use exponential function curve in blood concentration of PAH and half crest value time on each of the following groups of patients : 15 persons with normal kidneys as a control group, 15 persons with unilateral nephroptosis, 15 persons with bilateral nephroptosis, 5 persons with remaining normal kidney as a control group, and 5 persons with nephroptosis of the remaining kidney. In addition to these, 4 persons who had <b>nephropexy</b> for unilaterl nephroptosis were examined pre and postoperatively. The results are summarized as fol l ows: 1) In normal persons, eliminatin g constant (K) is almost equal in both upright and supine position. There also are no remarkable difference of average (K) between upright and supine position in both normal and nephroptosis patients unilaterally. or bilaterally, for the first half an hour following injection. After that, however, the difference becomes larger in order of normal persons, unilateral nephroptosis patients and bilateral nephroptosis patients. In the cases of remaining kidney with nephroptosis, the difference average of (K) between upright and supine position is most remarkable for the first half an hour following injection. 2) The characteristic distribution area is seen in each of the exponential function curve of different groups. 3) In normal a d ults, half crest value time is 19. 3 ± 2. 44 min. in supine position and 22. 4 ± 1. 89 min. in upright position. In upright position, the arevage half crest value time is almost equal in both normal and nephroptosis cases unilaterally or bilaterally. The discrepancy of the half crest value time between upright and supine position is 3. 1 min. in normal persons, 6. 8 min. in unilateral nephroptosis, 1. 7 min. in control remainin g NOTES 1) Exponential Function Curve (Exponentielle Funktionskurve) 2) Half Crest Value Time (Halbwertszeit) kidney, 4. 8 min. in remaining kidney with nephroptosis, 12. 5 min. pre-nephropexy and 2. 3 min. post-nephropexy. 4) In bilateral nephroptosis, if the renal descending ratio in either side of the kidneys goes over 2 nd or 3 rd degree, the half crest value time tends to become longer. 5) In bilateral nephroptosis patients, the cases with prolonged half crest value time shows remarkable changes in the kidney position in the upright x-ray films. Particularly, it is accorded with the degree of the renal torsion. 6) In the cases of <b>nephropexy,</b> the average half crest value time and the. upright x-ray findings have improved after <b>nephropexy.</b> 7) Comparing direct clearance v a lue with indirect clearance value which was calculated with half crest value time, the value with Niissigensts formula gives the most approximate value to that of the direct clearance...|$|E
