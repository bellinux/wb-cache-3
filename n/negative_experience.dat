5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli. It {{was published by}} Balai Pustaka, the state-owned publisher and literary bureau of the Dutch East Indies, in 1922. The author {{was influenced by the}} cultures of the west Sumatran Minangkabau and the Dutch colonials, who had controlled Indonesia in various forms since the 17th century.

5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry, after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E

In 2003, actresses Amanda Maiden and Kimberly Kevon Williams played the character in flashbacks to her childhood and her {{time as a}} nightclub singer. Ross was initially hesitant to audition for the role following her <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> on Ryan's Hope, but was attracted to the show after learning about its supernatural and fantasy elements. Her casting was part of NBC's attempt to include a racially diverse ensemble on daytime television. She based her performance on Joanne Woodward's role in the 1957 film The Three Faces of Eve and Catherine Halsey from Ayn Rand's 1943 novel, The Fountainhead.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{onset of}} {{vitiligo}} occurs {{before the age}} of 20 years in 50 % of patients. Having a chronic disease in childhood can impede a child's health-related quality of life (HRQL). Objectives Firstly, to compare the social and psychosexual development and current HRQL of young adult patients with childhood vitiligo with those of a group of healthy controls. Secondly, to compare these outcomes in patients reporting <b>negative</b> childhood <b>experiences</b> with those of patients not reporting <b>negative</b> childhood <b>experiences.</b> Methods Eligible patients were mailed questionnaires on (i) sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, (ii) social and psychosexual development, (iii) generic and dermatology-specific HRQL, (iv) presence of <b>negative</b> childhood <b>experiences</b> related to vitiligo, (v) specification of these <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> and (vi) patients' recommendations for further care. Results A total of 232 patients with vitiligo completed the questionnaires. Social and psychosexual development and generic HRQL in young adult patients with childhood vitiligo were not different from those of healthy controls. However, patients reporting <b>negative</b> childhood <b>experiences</b> reported significantly more problems in social development than those not reporting <b>negative</b> <b>experiences.</b> Furthermore, <b>negative</b> childhood <b>experiences</b> were significantly associated with more HRQL impairment in early adulthood.

25|$|In 1874, the Roach {{shipyard}} {{launched the}} Pacific Mail passenger-cargo steamers City of Peking and City of Tokio. At 5,033 gross tons each, these were {{by far the}} largest iron merchant steamships built to that date in the United States and almost twice the gross tonnage of the previous largest, the Cramp-built Pennsylvania class. In fact they were the largest gross-tonnage steamships in the world behind the experimental British ship Great Eastern (which was a commercial failure) and they remained the largest American-built steamships for a number of years. Between 1873 and 1875, Roach also completed the contracts for the remaining five Pacific Mail ships, City of Panama, City of Guatemala, City of San Francisco, City of New York and City of Sydney. He eventually built more ships for Pacific Mail, however, this early <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> led him to reject future shipbuilding contracts sought on terms.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{footage and}} the film's soundtrack were off-limits, the {{designers}} {{were allowed to}} re-create the likenesses of the actors who {{had appeared in the}} film. Westwood never intended for Rick Deckard to be a major character in the game, but they did attempt to contact Harrison Ford with the intention of asking him to make a cameo appearance. However, they never received a response. This didn't surprise them, as Ford had had a <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> working on the film and, at the time, even refused to talk about it in interviews. According to Castle, Ford was also against the concept of video games based on films in general. The designers were also unable to get any input from Ridley Scott, the film's director, as he too had had a bad experience on the film, and had fallen out with Yorkin and Perenchio when they took over production. He was uninterested in participating in the game.|$|E
50|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>experiences</b> can {{be created}} through a sport that is overly focused on {{competition}} and winning at all costs or that fails to place the healthy development of youth {{at the center of}} the <b>experience.</b> Such <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> may result in a young person’s low self-esteem, involve them in negative relationships, encourage poor sportsmanship, permit aggression and violence, allow racism, perpetuate gender discrimination, or expose them to psychological, sexual and commercial exploitation and abuse. Many of these <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> can be avoided when parents and coaches are chosen carefully, ensuring that programs offer a positive development experience for youth.|$|R
40|$|Using daily diary data, {{this study}} {{examined}} the associations between positive and <b>negative</b> parent-youth <b>experiences</b> and youth cortisol and physical health symptoms among a sample of adolescents (N= 132, Mean Age = 13. 39).

Daily positive experiences with fathers were linked with lower dinner cortisol levels. Youth with high levels of <b>negative</b> <b>experiences,</b> on average, were less sensitive to daily variation in <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> than youth who experienced lower parental negativity.

25|$|Multiple Prince {{characters}} were featured in , created by Mechner, co-written by Mechner and A. B. Sina, illustrated by LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland, {{and published by}} First Second Books. The story {{takes place in a}} kingdom called Marv, alternating between the 9th and 13th centuries. The story follows two men of royal blood: Guiv, who goes into self-imposed exile after clashing with his brother; and Ferdos, hidden with the region's water keeper during a purge of newborn children. Each is helped by a mystical bird named Tulen, with Guiv's actions in his time influencing Ferdos' own life. Sina was initially wary of the project, as he had <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> of the portrayal of Midden Eastern people, {{and did not want to}} be controlled by marketing requirements. But after meeting Mechner and the editor for First Second Books, he was won over Sina's story deliberately played on the series concept of there being multiple Princes, writing his story around several Prince characters in different eras.|$|E
25|$|Later that spring, Scott {{returned}} to her beginnings as a comedian when she began work on her first comedy noir, Scared Stiff, with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Scott played an heiress who inherits a haunted castle on Lost Island {{off the coast of}} Cuba. Though Scott had fond memories of working on the set in the years ahead, at the time of filming, she found it trying. Scott found Lewis' impersonations of her offensive, while a jealous Hal Wallis instructed the director, George Marshall, not to let the romantic scenes between Scott and Martin get too steamy. Despite Scott's best efforts, including making excuses for Lewis' behavior to the press, most of her scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor. Shooting took place late May to mid-July 1952. The film premiered the week of 28 May 1953 in Los Angeles. Despite the <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> and reviews, Scared Stiff remains Scott's third favorite film.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{controversy}} because {{several members of}} the Eurasian Scout Region's top hierarchy are former Pioneer leaders. The primary goal of the Pioneers, whose membership was nearly compulsory, was the indoctrination of youth into Communism. To complicate matters, these organizations adopted many of the trappings of the Scout organizations they supplanted. Because of the <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> with the Communist youth organizations, Scouting in the Eurasian Region is having a slow rebirth. Proponents see the inheritance of Pioneer work and properties in a positive light. Opponents have seen the Eurasian Region as a tool that would allow former Pioneers to keep their influence over post Soviet youth movements, and use their newfound connections outside the region for their own gain. Even the placement of the Regional headquarters at the historic Pioneer Camp Artek at Yalta appears to many to point to this Pioneer dominance. Opponents also question the fact that authoritarian Belarus {{was a member of the}} World Organization of the Scout Movement, against WOSM's stated guidelines, while democratic neighbor Ukraine is not a WOSM member. In the years following its creation, the Eurasian Region was considered by some to have stagnated in its purpose: among other things, the official website was not updated between 2004 and February 2006.|$|E

The <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> with the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class convinced the constructors, led by Benedetto Brin, {{to design a}} larger battleship that could engage its foreign counterparts. The new class was designed specifically to counter the new s of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. For this purpose, the ships were armed with the [...] gun that had become standard for most pre-dreadnought battleships of the day.

500|$|After the <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> {{with the}} {{preceding}} , which were {{too weak to}} engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers, the Italian navy wanted a new battleship that returned to a larger, more effective size.

They returned to the [...] gun that was standard in most other navies of the day, but sacrificed armor protection to achieve high speed. As such, the ships represented a hybrid type that merged the firepower of the slow battleships and the speed of a cruiser. Benedetto Brin initially wanted to arm the ships with only two of the 12-inch guns and twelve [...] guns, but after his death, Admiral Ruggero Alfredo Micheli altered the design to double the number of 12-inch guns, at the expense of eight of the medium-caliber pieces.|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} {{of participation in}} physical activity was explored in a qualita- tive study with twenty Norwegian adults with physical and visual disabilities. The interviews showed that more than 75 % of <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> reported in this study originated from physical education (PE), suggesting {{that this was a}} particularly challenging arena. The <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> were centered in these common themes: experiences of not being included, experiences of failing, and experiences of not being listened to. The interviews were analyzed applying an existential-phenomenological approach. The participants with relatively minor degrees of disability and with the least visible disabilities were the ones who most often reported <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> regarding PE. This suggests the experiences were not generated solely by the actual physical or sensory limitations, but equally by how well the participants’ challenges were understood by their teachers and to what degree adaptations were implemented...|$|R
