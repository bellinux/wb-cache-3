5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, <b>now</b> <b>one</b> can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and <b>now</b> <b>one</b> of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E

After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a garrison by the Sikh Empire and the British Empire, but is <b>now</b> <b>one</b> of Pakistan's most iconic sights.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including {{a quarter}} of the 1913 year), with its {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This came at the cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but academic success did not improve significantly, in what was <b>now</b> <b>one</b> of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E

After completing basic flight training on 28 October 1938, Finucane was classed as an average pilot, but deemed to be competent enough to be assigned to advanced flying school. With effect from the following day, he was granted a short-service commission as an acting pilot officer (on probation) and sent to 8 Flying Training School, RAF Montrose in Scotland. On 12 November, he left King's Cross railway station travelling on the Flying Scotsman to Glasgow, arriving at Montrose after a 10-hour journey.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 the London and North Western Railway revived powers {{granted to}} the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to build a railway from Manchester via Eccles and Tyldesley to Wigan with a branch to Kenyon Junction on the Liverpool to Manchester Line via Leigh and Pennington. The station, {{originally}} named Bedford Leigh served the town. The railway crossed the town on a viaduct which has since been largely demolished. It closed in May 1969, leaving the town without a railway: after the reopening of Mansfield and Corby railway stations, Leigh is <b>now</b> <b>one</b> of the largest towns in Great Britain without a railway station. Numerous colliery lines crossed the town, but with {{the closure of the}} collieries these were no longer required.|$|E

5|$|No {{records of}} the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of {{introduction}} to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested.
