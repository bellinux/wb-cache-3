5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists {{across the political spectrum}} who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> death sentences.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776).

5|$|Emerging in {{the mid-1980s}} with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal {{movement}} rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Fr. Antonio Mateo, the Vicar of Tayabas, became {{suspicious}} of the cofradías monthly masses and fees, thus Fr. Manuel Sancho stopped holding Masses for the cofradía. Mateo and Sancho then accused the cofradía of conducting heretical activities. Due to religious persecution and the increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> members, Pule decided to have the cofradía recognized by the colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church. He first sought recognition and authorization from the Bishop of Camarines but his request was denied. Not discouraged, he then sought {{the approval of the}} Real Audiencia but he was also ignored.|$|E
5|$|Local {{churches were}} further {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate churches were entitled to be represented by two or more ruling elders {{in proportion to the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> pastors. Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E

5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October the {{majority}} of the 3rd Division was removed from the line for rest and reorganisation, although a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> artillery batteries would continue to support the operations of the II American Corps until they were withdrawn. Following this they continued to participate in the fighting in support of the British 6th Division. The 27th Battery fired the division's last shot of the war on 4 November at Wassigny. Nevertheless, the division was out of the line when news of the Armistice came on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began and as men were repatriated back to Australia, the division was eventually disbanded on 28 May 1919.|$|E

By 1907–1908 membership had risen to 500 (up from 160 in 1900), the Talmud Torah had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Torah scrolls in a public auction.|$|E
5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, {{and the loss of}} a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E
5|$|Abiodun Alao of King's College London {{marks the}} Entumbane episode as {{the start of}} the Zimbabwe National Army's politicisation. The ex-Rhodesians' enthusiasm and success during the battle, coupled with Mugabe's {{readiness}} to deploy them, convinced many in ZAPU that ZANU–PF and the white community had united against them, and intensified ZAPU opposition to the government. ZIPRA guerrillas deserted from the assembly points and the National Army en masse following the rebellion's failure, fearing for their safety. Mugabe's sense of resolve regarding his political rivals was greatly strengthened, meanwhile; Entumbane satisfied him that white army officers and airmen could be counted on in future conflicts with ZAPU. The Entumbane engagement was the RAR's last—its companies were allocated to other 1Brigade units later in 1981 during the military reform process—but a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> white officers subsequently led units of the Zimbabwean special forces during the 1980s.
