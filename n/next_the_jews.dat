5000|$|UNDO {{pursued a}} dual policy {{with respect to}} Poland's <b>next</b> largest minority, <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> UNDO protested acts of {{antisemitism}} and cooperated with Jewish representatives in the Polish parliament. It supported Jewish civil rights and fought against Polish attempts to limit Jewish cultural practices. [...] For example, UNDO's representatives in the Polish parliament joined their Jewish colleagues in voting against an attempt to limit kosher slaughtering. UNDO's support for <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> was largely driven by the belief that actions against Jews would set a precedent for future discrimination against Ukrainians. Following a Polish pogrom against Jews in 1936, an UNDO leader published an article called [...] "After <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> Will Come Our Turn." [...] Despite its rejection of violence and discrimination against Jews, UNDO also engaged in an economic struggle against them by supporting Ukrainian cooperatives through boycotting non-Ukrainian (and thus, often, Jewish) businesses. While rejecting Polish offers of cooperation against Jews, UNDO spokesmen also blamed Jews for spreading Communism in Ukrainian villages.|$|R

50|$|The German army invaded Lithuania on 22 June 1941, taking Shadova - Šeduva a {{few days}} later as part of Operation Barbarossa. At first the Lithuanian {{population}} considered the Nazis to be liberators saving them from the Red Army. The new pro-German Government organized a Lithuanian militia which then became the Nazi's manpower for genocide. Five hundred years of Jewish life in Shadova - Šeduva ended in just two days of slaughter. Shadova's Jews attempted to flee east to Russia but were badly treated by Lithuanian nationalists and most returned to their homes. The German forces entered Shadova - Šeduva on 25 June 1941 and were received with flowers by many locals. By the beginning of July, Jews had to wear the yellow Star of David. Jews who had participated in the Soviet rule were immediately arrested and executed. Jews were taken to dismantle the remnants of the munitions factory in Linkaičiai, and were then accused of stealing and executed. Others were forced into labour gangs. They were set to work cleaning the streets and at the warehouses of the rail station. All the work was guarded by armed Lithuanian militi. <b>Next</b> all <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Shadova - Šeduva had to gather in the market place with no more than a small package each, and to hand over the keys to their houses to the police. Under guard. they were escorted at night to the village of Pavartyčiai, five kilometres north-west of Shadova - Šeduva, where they were crowded into two unfinished Soviet barracks surrounded with barbed wire. <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> were ordered to hand over all their valuables and cash.
