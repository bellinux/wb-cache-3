A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> funding.|$|E

This means that the police detainee/suspect/witness does not misunderstand the questions asked or that he/she is not misunderstood by the Investigation Officer, ensuring that statements recorded are reliable.|$|E

25|$|Danzan and Choibalsan {{arrived in}} Verkhneudinsk, {{the capital of}} the pro-Soviet Far Eastern Republic, {{in the first part of}} July. They met with Boris Shumyatsky, then acting head of the government. Shumyatsky knew little about them, and for three weeks dodged their demands for a speedy Soviet {{decision}} whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> military assistance to the Mongolians against the Chinese. Finally, perhaps at Shumyatsky's suggestion, they sent a telegram to members of the MPP in Urga with a coded message that they should obtain a letter, stamped with the seal of the Bogd Khaan, formally requesting Soviet assistance. The MPP did succeed in obtaining a letter from the Khaan's court, albeit with difficulty. Five members of the Party—D. Losol, Dambyn Chagdarjav, Dogsom, L. Dendev, and Sükhbaatar—brought it to Verkhneudinsk. When the seven men met with Shumyatsky, he told them that he had no authority to make a decision on their request; they must go to Irkutsk.|$|E
25|$|I am {{ashamed of}} what I tell them: {{that they should}} indeed worry about making an {{accusation}} because what they fear is likely to come true. Not {{one of the women}} I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{while living}} in New York City, Humbert {{receives}} a letter from Dolores, now 17, telling him that she is married, pregnant, and {{in desperate need of}} money. In the letter, Dolores says she lives in the Midwestern town of Coalmont with her husband, Richard Schiller. However, she chooses <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> Humbert with her street address. Humbert immediately leaves New York for Coalmont. He quickly tracks down Dolores and finds her living in clapboard house with her husband. Upon arriving, Humbert and Dolores discuss her new married life. Humbert realizes he's still in love with her and asks her to leave with him. She gently refuses. Also, he asks her who it was that abducted her from the hospital two years earlier. She reveals it was Quilty and that she willingly left because {{she was in love with}} him. However, after moving into his mansion in Ramsdale, Quilty tried to make her star in one of his pornographic films but that she refused. He then expelled her from his home. Afterward, she supported herself by working as a waitress. Humbert leaves in tears after giving Dolores $4,000.|$|E

[...] Chinook, Steelhead, Sockeye and Coho salmon (as well as other important species including Lamprey) are now unable to spawn in the reaches of the Upper Columbia Basin. The extinction of the spawning grounds upstream from the dam has prevented the Spokane and other tribes from holding the first salmon ceremony.|$|E

500|$|English colonists were {{generally}} organized into militia companies, and their colonies had no regular military presence beyond {{a small number}} {{in some of the}} communities of Newfoundland. The French colonists were also organized into militias, but they also had a standing defense force called the troupes de la marine. This force consisted of some experienced officers and was manned by recruits sent over from France numbering between 500 and 1,200. [...] They were spread throughout the territories of New France, with concentrations in the major population centers. Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops; Spanish policy was to pacify the Indians in their territory and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> them with weapons. This policy had devastating consequences. Florida held an estimated 8,000 Indians before the war, but this was reduced to 200 after English colonist raids made early in the war.|$|E
500|$|During the 24 November 1999 Parliamentary {{debate on}} the rule of law, Jeyaretnam traced the {{doctrine}} to the Magna Carta, and {{said that it was}} {{to be found in the}} Constitution of Singapore, particularly in Article 9 and Article 12, which respectively protect the rights to life and personal liberty, and equality rights. He also noted that in the court judgment Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980), the Privy Council had held that in phrases such as [...] "in accordance with law" [...] and [...] "equality before the law" [...] in the Constitution, the term law does not only mean Acts passed by Parliament, but also includes the fundamental rules of natural justice that have been accepted and become part and parcel of the common law. He then cited eight instances of the Government's alleged non-compliance with the rule of law, including detention without trial under, inter alia, the ISA and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act ("CLTPA"); denial of the right of arrested persons to counsel and to visits from their families for a period of time; denial of the rights to freedom of speech and assembly; and the tendency of the executive <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> reasons for decisions made. Opposition MP Chiam See Tong complained that the Government had not treated opposition parties fairly as regards applications for licences for events.|$|E
500|$|After {{providing}} {{teams with}} the ultrasoft compound for the Monaco and Canadian Grands Prix, tyre supplier Pirelli made the supersoft, soft and medium compounds {{available for the}} race despite the ultrasoft compound being specifically designed for street circuits. Pirelli explained the decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the ultrasoft tyres as being {{a result of a}} lack of available performance data on the circuit, while most teams opted for a full complement of soft and supersoft tyres and taking only the minimum number of medium compound tyres dictated by the rules. In preparing for the race, Pirelli acknowledged concerns about the circuit's high speed straights and direction changes causing [...] "standing waves" [...] over longer runs, a phenomenon whereby the energy passing through the wheel is strong enough to shift the build of the tyre, compromising its rigidity and increasing the likelihood of tyre failures. Further concerns were raised {{about the impact of the}} temporary surface used to protect the cobblestones through the Old City section on the tyres, amid fears that predicted high temperatures throughout the weekend would cause this surface to break up. Following the first free practice session, it was found that the metal bolts used to anchor segments of kerbing to the roadway had started working loose and had been cutting into the rubber of the tyres, necessitating minor modifications to the circuit in order to correct the issue.|$|E
