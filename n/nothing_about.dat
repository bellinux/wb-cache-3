5|$|The Korean {{investigators}} {{cast doubt}} on the U.S. report's suggestion of possible gunfire from among the refugees. Surviving documents said <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> infiltrators at No Gun Ri, even though they would have been the 7th Cavalry's first enemy killed-in-action in Korea. The No Gun Ri survivors denied it emphatically, and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by the U.S. team spoke of hostile fire, and then inconsistently.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E

Jefferson said <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> his {{construction}} of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E

5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

On arrival, Will is mistaken for a journalistin a panic he claims he works for Horse & Hound and is made to {{interview}} not only Anna, but the entire cast of her new sci-fi film, which he knows <b>nothing</b> <b>about.</b> Anna calls him back in and says she has cleared her evening. Will is exhilarated, before remembering that he is expected at his sister Honey's birthday party; Anna surprises him by offering to be his date.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. program {{there were}} {{teething}} troubles. There {{was a lack}} of sufficient numbers of sensor strings and controlling the number of aircraft available for the missions proved problematic. These difficulties could be remedied. Commando Hunt II (1 May through 31 October 1969), however, was thrown off track by phenomena that the Air Force could do absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>about.</b> The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48inches of rain in July alone).|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} aspects of the Roman world, chariot racing {{continued}} in the Byzantine Empire, although the Byzantines did not keep as many records and statistics as the Romans did. In place of the detailed inscriptions of Roman racing statistics, several short epigrams in verse were composed celebrating some of the more famous Byzantine Charioteers. The six charioteers about whom these laudatory verses were written were Anastasius, Julianus of Tyre, Faustinus, his son, Constantinus, Uranius, and Porphyrius. Although Anastasius's single epigram reveals almost <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> him, Porphyrius is much better known, having thirty-four known poems dedicated to him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa {{arrive at}} the beach, but {{discover}} {{that the ability to}} help the animals is reserved for celebrities, who are already doing the job. The two are put to work cleaning rocks, and soon abandon the job and drive home. While picking up Bart, Homer learns about {{the true nature of the}} burlesque house, but does <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> Bart working there. Principal Skinner visits the house and sees Bart as the door greeter. He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about the matter. Homer declares that he has no problem with Bart working there just as Marge returns home unexpectedly.|$|E

Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At a repair shop, the car is found to have no evidence of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E

Natalie Keener, a young and ambitious new hire, {{promotes}} {{a program designed to}} cut costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan raises concerns that the program could be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan that}} the Union {{officers}} devised was called Moss 3, {{named after the}} Pittston’s Moss 3 Preparation Plant which was its primary coal processing plant at the time. The officials were very secretive about planning this act of nonviolent strike. They wanted Pittston to know <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> {{what was about to}} take place. Officials selected 99 union members out of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky to participate in Moss 3 and the selected miners met in Virginia and were told about the plan.|$|E
5|$|The project faced {{multiple}} hurdles, which forced its temporary abandonment. The political {{tensions and}} communal rioting surrounding India's 1947 partition and independence stalled production. Shortly after partition, Shiraz Ali migrated to Pakistan, leaving Asif without a financier. The actor Chandra Mohan {{suffered a heart}} attack and died in 1949. Shiraz Ali had previously suggested that business tycoon Shapoorji Pallonji could finance the film. Although Pallonji knew <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> film production, in 1950 he agreed to produce the film because of his interest in the history of Akbar. Production was then restarted with a new cast.|$|E

The team was British (having been founded by a New Zealander), the tyres were American Goodyears, the TAG-Porsche engine was German, the chassis itself was built by Hercules Aerospace in the USA, and was sponsored by an American tobacco company (Marlboro) and the Saudi Arabian owned company Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG).|$|E
5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E

During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting.

Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E
