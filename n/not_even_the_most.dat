Moore's race is widely cited as the first formal cycle race in history and a plaque {{was added to the}} park {{railings}} to mark the event. But the validity of the claim is contested in Keizo Kobayashi's history of the Draisienne and the Michaux vélocipede, which claims Moore's race was the third that day and <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important.|$|E

[...] "Cesarani provides telling examples", wrote Mark Roseman, [...] "of a lack of coherence and planning for the future in Jewish policy, even when we would most expect it.

2500|$|Cormac Ó Gráda {{disagreed}} {{that the}} famine was genocide. He argues that [...] "genocide includes murderous intent, {{and it must}} be said that <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the extermination of the Irish", and also that most people in Whitehall [...] "hoped for better times for Ireland". Additionally, he states that the claim of genocide overlooks [...] "the enormous challenge facing relief agencies, both central and local, public and private". Ó Gráda thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than that of genocide. Edward Lengel claims that views of the Irish as racially inferior, and for this reason significantly responsible for their circumstances, gained purchase in Great Britain during and immediately after the famine, especially through influential publications such as The Medical Times and The Times.|$|E
2500|$|Newly {{appointed}} detectives {{start at}} Detective Third Grade, {{which has a}} pay rate roughly between that of Police Officer and Sergeant. As they gain seniority and experience, they can be [...] "promoted" [...] to Detective Second-Grade, which has a pay grade slightly less than sergeants. Detective First-Grade is an elite designation for the department's most senior and experienced investigators and carries a pay grade slightly less than Lieutenants. All these promotions are discretionary {{on the part of}} the Commissioner and can be revoked if warranted. And while senior detectives can give directions to junior detectives in their own squads, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> senior detective can lawfully issue orders to even a junior patrol officer. All Detective grades still fall under the [...] "chain of command" [...] of the supervisory ranks beginning with Sergeant through Chief of Department. Detectives, like Police Officers, are eligible to take the promotional civil service exams for entry into the supervisory ranks.|$|E
2500|$|Wainwright will {{be remembered}} for gaining the lowest bowling average {{in the history of the}} County Championship - 10.17 for 97 wickets in 1894, a summer of many sticky wickets. On these wickets, he would bowl a perfect length and his spin was such that the ball, [...] "popping" [...] from the crust of the turf, would gain pace so that <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{technically}} correct batsman could hope to survive. However, Wainwright never had any sting on hard pitches. He did not take a single wicket in his five Test matches against Australia. Wainwright featured in four of the five Tests on Stoddart's 1897/98 tour of Australia, but found, not long into the visit, that his off spin was declining to turn. By the conclusion of the tour, Wainwright became convinced of his having lost the facility. When he arrived back in Yorkshire, Wainwright went straight to the nets and noted that the ball immediately started to spin in the manner to which he had been accustomed.|$|E

In a narrative beginning before the war and ending after the armistice, Ford's project is to situate an unimaginable cataclysm within a social, moral and psychological complexity.|$|R

2500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is first}} certainly documented in 1691 {{when it was}} described by a visitor to an aristocratic convent {{on the island of}} Lindau on the Bavarian side of the Bodensee, which was founded long after the book was created. [...] The leather spine of the book is stamped with the date 1594, but it is not absolutely certain where the book was when it was rebound, nor can the possibility be entirely excluded that the present combination of text and covers only dates back this far. [...] Paul Needham notes that while the upper cover is from the Imperial workshop, and in the grandest and most luxurious style of the period, the text, while richly illuminated, does not appear to quite match the cover in richness, and is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> lavishly decorated text written in St Gall during this period. The cover also appears to have been designed for a slightly smaller book. Treasure covers are relatively easy to transfer, as they are only attached to the wooden boards of the binding by small nails. On the other hand, the additional sections enlarging the lower cover are clearly early medieval.|$|E
2500|$|The tour notably {{promoted}} Justin Timberlake and Usher when Jackson selected both as {{its opening}} acts during their early careers, exposing {{them to a}} wider audience. Both artists credit Jackson as a major showmanship influence from both [...] "an entertainment and evolution perspective." [...] While Timberlake was part of 'N Sync, Jackson personally selected them to open for the tour, helping to introduce the relatively unknown group to the public. Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great because we got to see how a real professional tours. And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour. Upon the release of Never Gone, AJ McLean of the Backstreet Boys described his hair as resembling [...] "Janet Jackson on the Velvet Rope Tour." ...|$|E
