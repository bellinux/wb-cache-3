5000|$|Matapa is {{a typical}} Mozambican dish, {{prepared}} with young cassava leaves, which are usually ground in a large wooden mortar and pestle before cooked with garlic, onion and coconut milk. Many [...] "Matapa" [...] dishes add cashew <b>nuts,</b> <b>crab</b> or shrimp and can be eaten with bread, rice, xima or alone.|$|R
50|$|Vikings {{collected}} and ate fruits, berries and <b>nuts.</b> Apple (wild <b>crab</b> apples), plums and cherries {{were part of}} the diet, as were rose hips and raspberry, wild strawberry, blackberry, elderberry, rowan, hawthorn and various wild berries, specific to the locations. Hazelnuts were {{an important part of the}} diet in general and large amounts of walnut shells have been found in cities like Hedeby. The shells were used for dyeing and it is assumed the nuts were enjoyed as well.|$|R
30|$|Ecological notes. Specimens {{were found}} in shallow to deep burrows along the water {{channels}} of betel nut plantations (Figure  4), which were once rice fields (A.R. Sudha Devi, unpublished data). Forest or grasslands were the natural habitats for the new species before their conversion to rice fields. These semi-terrestrial crabs dwell in burrows adjacent to water channels or away from it in open or shaded areas of the banana and betel <b>nut</b> plantations. These <b>crabs</b> are also found in marshy lands and along the paddy field embankments. Normally, their burrow openings are surrounded by wet clods (Figure  4 B,C). The burrows are waterlogged during rainy season whereas the burrow openings are sealed with mud during dry seasons {{in order to maintain}} humidity inside.|$|R
50|$|The {{collared}} grosbeak {{ranges from}} fairly common to scarce within its range. The species summers and breeds at {{an elevation of}} 2700 to 4200 m. It engages in altitudinal movements, by winter traveling to as low as 1800 m or even to 1060 m. This grosbeak occurs in mixed and coniferous forests, commonly around stands of maple, oak or rhododendron. It also may occur during the summer in dwarf juniper above the tree line in the mountains. Pairs or small parties usually perch near the tops of tall trees but forage often in lower vegetation or even on the ground. The collared grosbeak flies in tight flocks in a fast, direct but sometimes undulating flying style. The breeding behavior of this species is unknown. The grosbeak feeds {{on a variety of}} seeds and pine cones as well as buds or shoots, <b>nuts,</b> fruits (including <b>crab</b> apples). A variety of this tough plant life is plucked with the strong bill. It may also feed on insects, mainly caterpillars, as well as snails.|$|R
60|$|The long dry summer came. As each fierce day burned {{itself out}} in little whiffs of pearl-gray smoke on the {{mountain}} summits, and the upspringing breeze scattered its red embers over the landscape, the green wave which in early spring upheaved above Smith's grave grew sere and dry and hard. In those days the master, strolling in the little churchyard of a Sabbath afternoon, was sometimes surprised to find a few wild flowers plucked from the damp pine forests scattered there, and oftener rude wreaths hung upon the little pine cross. Most of these wreaths were formed of a sweet-scented grass, which the children loved to keep in their desks, intertwined with the plumes of the buckeye, the syringa, and the wood anemone, and here and there the master noticed the dark-blue cowl of the monkshood, or deadly aconite. There {{was something in the}} odd association of this noxious plant with these memorials which occasioned a painful sensation to the master deeper than his esthetic sense. One day, during a long walk, in crossing a wooded ridge he came upon Mliss {{in the heart of the}} forest, perched upon a prostrate pine on a fantastic throne formed by the hanging plumes of lifeless branches, her lap full of grasses and pine burrs, and crooning to herself one of the Negro melodies of her younger life. Recognizing him at a distance, she made room for him on her elevated throne, and with a grave assumption of hospitality and patronage that would have been ridiculous had it not been so terribly earnest, she fed him with pine <b>nuts</b> and <b>crab</b> apples. The master took that opportunity to point out to her the noxious and deadly qualities of the monkshood, whose dark blossoms he saw in her lap, and extorted from her a promise not to meddle with it as long as she remained his pupil. This done--as the master had tested her integrity before--he rested satisfied, and the strange feeling which had overcome him on seeing them died away.|$|R
