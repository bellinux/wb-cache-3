In honeybees, when <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> switched from her in-hive tasks to out foraging, cytosine methylation marks are changing. When a forager bee was reversed to do nurse duties, the cytosine methylation marks were also reversed. Knocking down the DNMT3 in the larvae changed the worker to queen-like phenotype. Queen and worker are two distinguish castes with different morphology, behavior, and physiology. Studies in DNMT3 silencing also indicated DNA methylation may regulate gene alternative splicing and pre-mRNA maturation.|$|E

In 2007, the export of queen honey bee from Australia was {{suspended}} when Nosema apis was detected in the <b>nurse</b> <b>bees</b> that were escorting the queens during a quarantine inspection off the Japanese ports. Nosemosis or nosema is a worldwide endemic disease caused by N. apis. Infected bees have reduced life span, energy, productivity, and develop deformed glands. As a result of this suspension, many Japanese fruit farmers had to hand pollinate many of their crops while Australian beekeepers suffered financial losses from the loss of trade. Thus, it will be extremely beneficial for both Japanese and Australian farmers if nosema-free <b>nurse</b> <b>bees</b> could be produced and used as escort <b>nurse</b> <b>bees.</b> Two novel approaches of producing nosema-free bees are proposed: (1) treating infected <b>nurse</b> <b>bees</b> with heat therapy and (2) raising newly hatched <b>nurse</b> <b>bees</b> (HNB) in isolation of infected hives.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that caste determination in the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) {{is a result}} of differences in the composition of the larval food. It has been assumed that the glandular secretions of the <b>nurse</b> <b>bee,</b> and the type and age of larvae fed, may change as the <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> becomes older. Free (1960) recently investigated this possibility by comparing the distribution of bees of known ages on combs containing brood of known ages. We approached this question in a similar manner. The following is a preliminary account of some of our results...|$|E
40|$|The hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs) {{of worker}} honeybees undergo {{physiological}} changes {{along with the}} age-dependent role change from nursing to foraging: <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> HPGs secrete mainly major royal jelly proteins, whereas forager HPGs secrete mainly α-glucosidase III, which converts the sucrose in the nectar into glucose and fructose. We previously identified two other genes, Apis mellifera buffy (Ambuffy) and Apis mellifera matrix metalloproteinase 1 (AmMMP 1), with enriched expression in <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> and forager HPGs, respectively. In the present study, to clarify the molecular mechanisms that coordinate HPG physiology with worker behavior, we first analyzed whether Ambuffy, AmMMP 1, mrjp 2 (a gene encoding one of major royal jelly protein isoforms), and Hbg 3 (a gene encoding α-glucosidase III) expression, is associated with worker behavior in 'single-cohort colonies' where workers of almost the same age perform different tasks. Expression of these genes correlated with the worker's role, while controlling for age, indicating their regulation associated with the worker's behavior. Associated gene expression suggested the possible involvement of some hormonal factors in its regulation. We therefore {{examined the relationship between}} ecdysone- and juvenile hormone (JH) -signaling, and the expression profiles of these 'indicator' genes (<b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> HPG-selective genes: mrjp 2 and Ambuffy, and forager HPG-selective genes: Hbg 3 and AmMMP 1). Expression of both ecdysone-regulated genes (ecdysone receptor, mushroom body large type Kenyon cell specific protein- 1, and E 74) and JH-regulated genes (Methoprene tolerant and Krüppel homolog 1) was higher in the forager HPGs than in the <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> HPGs, suggesting the possible roles of ecdysone- and JH-regulated genes in worker HPGs. Furthermore, 20 -hydroxyecdysone-treatment repressed both nurse bee- and forager-selective gene expression, whereas methoprene-treatment enhanced the expression of forager-selective genes and repressed nurse bee-selective genes in the HPGs. Our findings suggest that both ecdysone- and JH-signaling cooperatively regulate the physiological state of the HPGs in association with the worker's behavior...|$|E
40|$|The worker ovaries of 16 {{species of}} stingless bees and two {{subspecies}} of European honeybee were studied under the queenright condition.

Histologically, the ovary development follows the manner seen in other polytropic type ovaries, though considerably modified.

40|$|Honey bee colonies {{are highly}} {{dependent}} upon the availability of floral resources from which they get the nutrients (notably pollen) necessary to their development and survival. However, foraging areas are currently affected by the intensification of agriculture and landscape alteration. Bees are therefore confronted to disparities {{in time and space}} of floral resource abundance, type and diversity, which might provide inadequate nutrition and endanger colonies. The beneficial influence of pollen availability on bee health is well-established but whether quality and diversity of pollen diets can modify bee health remains largely unknown. We therefore tested the influence of pollen diet quality (different monofloral pollens) and diversity (polyfloral pollen diet) on the physiology of young nurse bees, which have a distinct nutritional physiology (e. g. hypopharyngeal gland development and vitellogenin level), and on the tolerance to the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae by measuring bee survival and the activity of different enzymes potentially involved in bee health and defense response (glutathione-S-transferase (detoxification), phenoloxidase (immunity) and alkaline phosphatase (metabolism)).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{some important}} physiological and pheromonal factors regulating foraging and colony growth in honey bee colonies. The first study analyzed effects of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) {{on the development}} of hypopharyngeal gland, midgut enzyme activity and survival of the honey bee. In this study newly emerged caged bees were fed pollen diets containing three different concentrations of SBTI. Bees fed 1 % SBTI had significantly reduced hypopharyngeal gland protein content. This study indicated that nurse bees fed a pollen diet containing at least 1 % SBTI would be poor producers of larval food. In the second study <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> biosynthesis of brood food was manipulated using SBTI, and the resulting effects on pollen foraging were measured. Experimental colonies were given equal amounts of SBTI treated and untreated pollen. SBTI treatments had significantly lower hypopharyngeal gland protein content than controls. There {{was no significant difference in}} the ratio of pollen to non-pollen foragers and pollen load weights collected between the treatments. These results supported the pollen foraging effort predictions generated from the direct independent effects hypothesis. In the third study we tested whether brood pheromone (BP) regulated queen egg laying via modulation of worker-queen interactions and <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> rearing behaviors. This experiment had BP and control treatments. Queens in the BP treatment laid greater number of eggs, were fed for a greater amount of time and were less idle. Significantly more time was spent in cell cleaning by the bees in BP treatments. The results suggest that brood pheromone regulated queen egg-laying rate by modulating worker-queen interactions and <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> rearing behavior. The final study of this dissertation focused on how dose-dependent BP-mediated division of labor affected the partitioning of non-foraging and foraging work forces and the amount of brood reared. Triple cohort colonies were used and there were three treatments, Low BP, High BP and Control. Low BP treatments had significantly higher ratio of pollen to non-pollen foragers and greater pollen load weights. Low BP treatment bees foraged at a significantly younger age. This study has shown that BP elicits dose-dependent modulation of foraging and brood rearing behaviors...|$|E

40|$|Honeybees, Apis mellifera, {{have several}} {{prophylactic}} disease defense strategies, including the foraging of antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral compounds of plant products.

40|$|The {{parasitic}} mite, Varroa destructor, is {{the most}} important threat for apiculture in most bee-keeping areas of the world. The mite is carried to the bee brood cell, where it reproduces, by a nurse bee; therefore the selection of the bee stage by the parasite could influence its reproductive success. This study investigates the role of the cuticular hydrocarbons of the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) in host-selection by the mite. Preliminary laboratory bioassays confirmed the preference of the varroa mite for <b>nurse</b> <b>bees</b> over pollen foragers. GC-MS analysis of <b>nurse</b> and pollen <b>bees</b> revealed differences in the cuticular hydrocarbons of the two stages; in particular, it appeared that pollen bees have more (Z) - 8 -heptadecene than <b>nurse</b> <b>bees.</b> Laboratory experiments showed that treatment of <b>nurse</b> <b>bees</b> with 100 ng of the pure compound makes them repellent to the varroa mite. These results suggest that the mite can exploit the differences in the cuticular composition of its host for a refined selection that allows it to reach a brood cell and start reproduction.

40|$|International audienceAbstractHoney bees that consume pollen with {{sublethal}} {{levels of}} the fungicide Pristine® can have reduced pollen digestion, lower ATP synthesis, {{and in many ways}} resemble malnourished bees. Reduced nutrient acquisition in bees exposed to Pristine® might be due to the effects of this fungicide on the composition of gut microbial communities. Two experiments were conducted in two separate years to test for the effects of Pristine® on the composition and diversity of bacteria in <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> midguts. In the low-dose experiment, bees fed the fungicide had a reduced relative abundance of Gilliamella sp. and the number of bacterial taxa within each individual bee was lower. In the high-dose experiment, the fungicide treatment led to increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus sp. Firm 4 and Firm 5 relative to the control. Presence of the fungicide did not impact the distribution of bacteria among individuals on either the low-or high-dose experiments. Considerable differences in gut microbial communities existed between the two experiments perhaps due to environmental and dietary factors. The effects of Pristine® on the gut microbiota were inconsistent between experiments indicating that exposure rate and environmental conditions can influence the effects of this fungicide on gut microbial communities...|$|E

The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of common arthropod repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) on the chemosensing of the V. destructor and its hosts, the European honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), by electrophysiological and behavioural bioassays. In electrophysiological assays, the nurse headspace served as a positive stimulus for the V. destructor foreleg, whereas a queen headspace was used as a positive stimulus for honey bee antennae. Two effects of DEET on V. destructor host chemosensing were evaluated: short-term inhibition and long-term inhibition. The inhibition observed in the presence of DEET simultaneously with a positive stimulus was termed “short term inhibition”, while inhibition that occurred following the administration of the compound alone was termed “long term inhibition”. In V. destructor, DEET served as a long-term inhibitor to the response of the chemosensory organ to <b>nurse</b> <b>bee</b> headspace volatiles, whereas in honey bee, it caused short-term inhibition of antenna response to queen volatiles. Consistent with electrophysiological studies, DEET significantly inhibited host choice of mites, whereas even a 10 times higher dose did not alter honey bee behaviours (e. g. antennating, grooming, fanning etc.) or worker attraction to a queen.

Differences in hemolymph protein concentration between nurses and pollen foragers were significantly smaller among MDI colonies than among SDI colonies. While intracolonial genetic diversity is correlated with increased foraging, our results suggest that this relationship may be driven {{in part by the}} elevated resource demands of <b>nurse</b> <b>bees</b> in genetically diverse colonies that consume and distribute more protein in response to the social context within the hive...|$|R
