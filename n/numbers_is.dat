5|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{generalization of}} addition of natural <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> {{the addition of}} ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> not commutative. Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation of {{cardinal}} <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct from}} exponentiation of ordinal numbers, which {{is defined by}} a limit process involving transfinite induction.|$|E
5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group {{can be described as}} a set that is closed under subtraction.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, a {{transcendental}} <b>number</b> <b>is</b> a real or complex <b>number</b> that <b>is</b> not algebraic—that is, {{it is not}} a root of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer (or, equivalently, rational) coefficients. The best-known transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> [...] and e. Though only a few {{classes of}} transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> known (in part because it can be extremely difficult to show that a given <b>number</b> <b>is</b> transcendental), transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> not rare. Indeed, almost all real and complex <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> transcendental, since the algebraic <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> countable while the sets of real and complex <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> both uncountable. All real transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> irrational, since all rational <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> algebraic. The converse is not true: not all irrational <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> transcendental; e.g., the square root of 2 is irrational but not a transcendental <b>number,</b> since it <b>is</b> a solution of the polynomial equation [...] Another irrational <b>number</b> that <b>is</b> not transcendental is the golden ratio, [...] or , since it is a solution of the polynomial equation [...]|$|R

5|$|If an {{interval}} {{of the real}} <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> partitioned into two non-empty parts L, R, such that every element of L is (strictly) less than every element of R, then either L contains a largest element or R contains a smallest element, but not both.|$|E
5|$|Powers of a {{positive}} real number are always positive real numbers. The solution of x2=4, however, can be either 2 or −2. The principal value of 41/2 is 2, but −2 is also a valid square root. If the definition of exponentiation of real <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> extended to allow negative results then the result is no longer well-behaved.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} the parity of zero is often treated within the first {{two or three years}} of primary education, as the concept of even and odd <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> {{introduced}} and developed.|$|E

5000|$|Either <b>number</b> may <b>be</b> used in addresses. Sometimes, {{businesses}} will use both numbers to avoid confusion, usually putting the descriptive (or registration) number first: [...] "Hlavní 20/7". The two (or three) types of <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> commonly distinguished by colour of the sign. Each municipality can {{have its own}} traditional or official rules and colours. In Prague and many other Bohemian cities, descriptive <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> red, orientation <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> blue and [...] "evidential" [...] <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> green or yellow or red. In many Bohemian municipalities, descriptive <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> blue, black, or are not unified. In Brno and some Moravian and Slovak cities, descriptive <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> white-black signs, orientation <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> red-white signs.

5|$|All {{elements}} from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) {{have been discovered}} or synthesized, with the most recent additions (nihonium, moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson) being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2015 and officially named in 2016: they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature. Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors. Synthesis of elements having higher atomic <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> being pursued. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> proof that the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic strength in Alsace of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem plausible.|$|E

25|$|Up until 1884 {{locomotive}} <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> reused when locomotives <b>were</b> retired; <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> {{not allocated}} sequentially (unless lower <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> used up). In 1884, {{in order to}} reduce confusion, all locomotives were renumbered to group like locomotives together, and thereafter <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> retired along with the locomotive to which they referred.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E
5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{range over}} a large area of Africa and southern Asia. The overall trend in <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> uncertain, {{with a mix of}} regional populations that are increasing, declining, stable or unknown, but {{there is no evidence of}} rapid overall decline and the status of the species is assessed as being of Least Concern. Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.|$|E
5000|$|The base b {{may also}} be {{indicated}} by the phrase [...] "base-b". So binary <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> [...] "base-2"; octal <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> [...] "base-8"; decimal <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> [...] "base-10"; and so on.|$|R
50|$|Every computable real <b>number</b> <b>is</b> arithmetical, and the arithmetical numbers form a {{subfield}} of the reals, as do {{the analytical}} numbers. Every arithmetical <b>number</b> <b>is</b> analytical, but not every analytical <b>number</b> <b>is</b> arithmetical. Because there are only countably many analytical numbers, most real <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> not analytical, and thus also not arithmetical.|$|R

5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E
5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} fields are {{the field of}} {{rational}} numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.|$|E
5|$|The letter M in {{the state}} highway <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> an {{integral}} part of the designation and included on the diamond-shaped reassurance markers posted alongside the highways. The state's highways are referred to using an M-n syntax as opposed to Route n or Highway n, which are common elsewhere. This usage dates from 1919, when Michigan's state trunklines were first signed along the roadways, and continues to this day in official and unofficial contexts. Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax, the other one being Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of red-billed tropicbird <b>numbers</b> <b>is</b> difficult {{due to the}} remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of sea they might be found. This bird {{is considered to be}} a least-concern species according to the IUCN. This is due to the fact that the range, declination, and numbers of this species, although small, do not meet the criteria required to be considered a vulnerable species. The range of this species is believed to be , with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals. In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs. The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird's environment and predation by invasive species, such as rats. These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline. It is estimated that this bird experienced a population bottleneck about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low. In Mexico and Brazil, it is considered to be threatened.|$|E
