50|$|Temperature has {{the highest}} effect on virus’s {{survival}} in water since lower temperatures {{are the key to}} longer virus survival. The rate of protein, <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> and chemical reactions that destroy the viral capsid are increased at higher temperatures, thus viruses will survive best at low temperatures. Hepatitis A, adenoviruses and parvoviruses have the highest survival rate in low temperatures amongst enteric viruses.|$|E
5000|$|Nucleic acids (including RNA and DNA) are {{nucleotide}} polymers synthesized by polymerase enzymes during either transcription or DNA replication. Following 5'-3' {{synthesis of}} the backbone, individual nitrogenous bases are capable of interacting with one another via hydrogen bonding, thus allowing {{for the formation of}} higher-order structures. <b>Nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> occurs when hydrogen bonding between nucleotides is disrupted, and results in the separation of previously annealed strands. For example, denaturation of DNA due to high temperatures results in the disruption of Watson and Crick base pairs and the separation of the double stranded helix into two single strands. Nucleic acid strands are capable of re-annealling when [...] "normal" [...] conditions are restored, but if restoration occurs too quickly, the nucleic acid strands may re-anneal imperfectly resulting in the improper pairing of bases.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} purification procedure yielded {{bluetongue virus}} free from any single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) component. Double-stranded RNA obtained from purified virus or isolated from infected cells was fractionated into 5 components {{by means of}} sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, and into 10 components by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. The size of these components vary from 0. 5 × 106 to 2. 8 × 106 daltons, with a total molecular weight estimate of about 1. 5 × 107 for the viral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>denaturation</b> of the genome and separation of the resulting fragments are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The optical {{activity}} (absorption and scattering of light) and hydrodynamic properties (translational diffusion, sedimentation coefficients, and rotational correlation times) of formamide denatured <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> {{are similar to}} those of heat-denatured <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> Therefore, depending on the desired effect, chemically denaturing DNA can provide a gentler procedure for denaturing <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> than <b>denaturation</b> induced by heat. Studies comparing different denaturation methods such as heating, beads mill of different bead sizes, probe sonification, and chemical denaturation show that chemical denaturation can provide quicker denaturation compared to the other physical denaturation methods described. Particularly in cases where rapid renaturation is desired, chemical denaturation agents can provide an ideal alternative to heating. For example, DNA strands denatured with alkaline agents such as NaOH renature as soon as phosphate buffer is added.|$|R
40|$|The facile {{self-assembly}} and nanomanipulation of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> hold {{great promise}} {{in the design}} of innovative, programmable materials, with applications ranging from biosensing to cellular targeting and drug delivery. Little is known, however, of the effects of confinement on biochemical reactions within such systems, in which the level of packing and crowding {{is similar to that of}} intracellular environments. In this review article, we outline novel, unexpected properties of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> that arise from nanoscale confinement, as mainly revealed by atomic force and electron microscopy, electrochemistry, fluorescence spectroscopy, and gel electrophoresis. We review selected scientific studies over the last decade that describe the novel behavior of nanoconfined <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> with respect to hybridization, denaturation, conformation, stability, and enzyme accessibility. The nanoscale systems discussed include self-assembled, water-soluble, DNA or RNA nanostructures, ranging in width from a few to several tens of nm; gold nanoparticles coated with DNA monolayers; and self-assembled monolayers of DNA, from a few to several hundreds of bp in length. These studies reveal that the functionality of nucleic acid-based nanosystems is highly dependent upon the local density, molecular flexibility and network of weak interactions between adjacent molecules. These factors significantly affect steric hindrance, molecular crowding and hydration, which in turn control <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> hybridization, <b>denaturation,</b> conformation, and enzyme accessibility. The findings discussed in this review article demonstrate that <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> function in a qualitatively different manner within nanostructured systems, and suggest that these novel properties, if better understood, will enable the development of powerful molecular tools for nanomedicine...|$|R
40|$|Although {{real-time}} PCR (RT-PCR) {{has become}} a diagnostic standard for rapid identification of bacterial species, typical methods remain time-intensive due to sample preparation and amplification cycle times. The assay described in this work incorporates on-chip dielectrophoretic capture and concentration of bacterial cells, thermal lysis, cell permeabilization, and <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assisted in situ hybridization (FRET-ISH) species identification. Combining these techniques leverages the benefits of all of them, allowing identification to be accomplished completely on chip less than thirty minutes after receipt of sample, compared to multiple hours required by traditional RT-PCR and its requisite sample preparation...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{processes}} during wet-heat {{treatment of}} individual spores of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus subtilis at 80 to 90 °C were investigated using dual-trap Raman spectroscopy, {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy, and nucleic acid stain (SYTO 16) fluorescence microscopy. During spore wet-heat treatment, while the spores' 1 : 1 chelate of Ca 2 + with dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) was released rapidly at a highly variable time Tlag, the levels of spore nucleic acids remained nearly unchanged, and the Tlag times for individual spores from the same preparation were increased somewhat as spore levels of CaDPA increased. The brightness of the spores' DIC image decreased by ∼ 50 % in parallel with CaDPA release, {{and there was no}} spore cortex hydrolysis observed. The lateral diameters of the spores' DIC image and SYTO 16 fluorescence image also decreased in parallel with CaDPA release. The SYTO 16 fluorescence intensity began to increase during wet-heat treatment at a time before Tlag and reached maximum at a time slightly later than Trelease. However, the fluorescence intensities of wet-heat-inactivated spores were ∼ 15 -fold lower than those of nutrient-germinated spores, and this low SYTO 16 fluorescence intensity may be {{due in part to the}} low permeability of the dormant spores' inner membranes to SYTO 16 and in part to <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> during the wet-heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) possess similar {{structural}} and molecular features, are transmitted by biting midges (genus Culicoides), and cause similar diseases in some susceptible ruminants. Generally, BTV causes subclinical disease in cattle, {{characterized by a}} prolonged viremia. EHDV-associated disease in cattle is less prominent; however, it {{has emerged as a}} major economic threat to the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) industry {{in many areas of the}} United States. The recent emergence of multiple BTV and EHDV serotypes previously undetected in the United States demonstrates the need for robust detection of all known serotypes and differential diagnosis. For this purpose, a streamlined workflow consisting of an automated <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> purification and <b>denaturation</b> method and a multiplex one-step reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the simultaneous detection of BTV serotypes 1 – 24 and EHDV serotypes 1 – 7 was developed using previously published BTV and EHDV assays. The denaturation of double-stranded (ds) BTV and EHDV RNA was incorporated into the automated <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> purification process thus eliminating the commonly used separate step of dsRNA denaturation. The performance of this workflow was compared with the World Organization of Animal Health BTV reference laboratory (National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa) workflow for BTV and EHDV detection, and high agreement was observed. Implementation of the workflow in routine diagnostic testing enables the detection of, and differentiation between, BTV and EHDV, and coinfections in bovine blood and cervine tissues, offering significant benefits in terms of differential disease diagnosis, herd health monitoring, and regulated testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} study of {{cellular}} species using Raman spectroscopy has proven a powerful non-invasive modality {{for the analysis}} of cell constituents and processes. This work uses micro-Raman spectroscopy to study the chemical fixation mechanism in three human cell lines (normal skin, normal bronchial epithelium, and lung adenocarcinoma) employing fixatives that preferentially preserve proteins (formalin), and <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> (Carnoy’s fixative and methanol–acetic acid). Spectral differences between the mean live cell spectra and fixed cell spectra together with principal components analysis (PCA), and clustering techniques were used to analyse and interpret the spectral changes. The results indicate that fixation in formalin produces spectral content that is closest to that in the live cell and by extension, best preserves the cellular integrity. <b>Nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> degradation, protein <b>denaturation,</b> and lipid leaching were observed with all fixatives and for all cell lines, but to varying degrees. The results presented here suggest that the mechanism of fixation for short fixation times is complex and dependent on both the cell line and fixative employed. Moreover, important spectral changes occur with all fixatives that have consequences for the interpretation of biochemical processes within fixed cells. The study further demonstrates the potential of vibrational spectroscopy in the characterization of complex biochemical processes in cells at a molecular level. Figure Chemical preservation of cells for Raman microspectroscopy is shown to be strongly dependent on the cell type and the fixative used, in a variety of cell lines, with formalin fixation show to result in spectral content most comparable to that in the live cel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{biological}} techniques {{become more}} and more popular, as they are applied to many kinds of applications, authentication protocols, biochemistry, and cryptography. One of the most interesting biology techniques is deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> and using it in such domains. Hiding secret data in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> becomes an important and interesting research topic. Some researchers hide the secret data in transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments where it doesn't mention to modify the original sequence, but others hide data in non-transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> non-translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments. Unfortunately, these schemes either alter the functionalities or modify the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequences. As a result, how to embed the secret data into the deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence without altering the functionalities and to have the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence be able to be retrieved is worthy of investigating. This paper applies reversible information hiding scheme on deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence by using the reversible contrast mapping technique. The reversible property makes the secret data hidden in anywhere in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> without altering the functionalities because the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence can be recovered exactly in our scheme...|$|R
