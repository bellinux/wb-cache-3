5|$|On April 10, Punk briefly {{became a}} villain by joining the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> alliance, after several weeks {{in which both}} the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and the ECW Originals had {{attempted}} to recruit him. Two weeks later, however, Punk betrayed the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> during a four-on-four elimination match between the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and ECW Originals by kicking <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> leader Elijah Burke {{in the back of}} the head and costing them the match. After the match, Punk proceeded to deliver his finisher, the Go To Sleep, on Burke and sarcastically apologized before leaving the ring alone, becoming a fan favorite again. At Judgment Day, Punk defeated Burke in his first singles match on a pay-per-view. Punk then went on to One Night Stand and teamed up with Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in a tables match to defeat the <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early March, Dreamer {{challenged}} the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> to a match at WrestleMania 23 {{on behalf of}} the Originals. The following week, Dreamer won a battle royal featuring members of the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and the Originals. In the final weeks leading up to WrestleMania, the stables continued to clash, with Van Dam defeating Burke on the March 27 episode of ECW. This provoked an attack on Van Dam by the other <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> members, until the Originals made the save. At WrestleMania, the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> members lost to the ECW Originals in an eight-man tag team match, but on the following episode of ECW on Sci Fi, they defeated the ECW Originals in an extreme rules rematch.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} WrestleMania, both the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and the ECW Originals began {{attempting}} to recruit CM Punk into their stables. On the April 3 episode of ECW, Cor Von eventually told Punk {{to choose a}} side, stating that Punk was either with the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> or against them. The following week, Punk made his decision and joined the <b>New</b> <b>Breed,</b> shaking hands with Burke in the ring. The next week, his presence immediately created tension within the group, as he berated Cor Von and Thorn for losing and undermined Burke's position {{as the leader of}} the <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b> Later that episode, Burke faced Van Dam in a singles match. Punk attempted to interfere, sliding a steel chair into the ring, but Van Dam got to it first and hit Burke with it. Afterward, Punk apologized to Burke. The following week, Punk apologized again, but was forced by Burke to miss an eight-man elimination tag team match between the Originals and the <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b> In retaliation, Punk attacked Burke, causing him to lose the match, and left the <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b>|$|E

Thorn and Ariel left the stable shortly afterward as well. The <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> continued to feud with the Originals and Punk, and also with The Major Brothers, a new tag team who had defeated Striker and Cor Von in their debut match.

At WrestleMania 23, the <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> was defeated by the ECW Originals in an 8-man tag team match, but won a rematch on the following episode of ECW. In {{the midst of the}} feud, tension began to appear between the leader Elijah Burke and Striker, after Striker and Cor Von were defeated by the debuting Major Brothers. As a result, Striker began trying to avenge the loss to the Major Brothers and defeated Brett Major on the May 22 episode of ECW. The feud with the Originals lost momentum, however, as Sabu was released from his WWE contract in mid-May, and the feud ended at the One Night Stand pay-per-view, when Striker, Cor Von, and Burke lost to Dreamer, Sandman, and CM Punk in a tables match.|$|E
