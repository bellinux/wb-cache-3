25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> he loved money, but because he loved his country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they thought he should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.|$|E
25|$|William Gascoigne was {{the first}} who {{commanded}} a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common focal plane of the objective and the eyepiece. This led to his invention of the micrometer, and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not till about {{the middle of the}} 17th century that Kepler's telescope came into general use: <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its field of view was much larger than in the Galilean telescope.|$|E
25|$|This {{state of}} affairs changed {{with the murder of}} Photios's patron Bardas in 866 and of Emperor Michael III in 867, by his {{colleague}} Basil the Macedonian, who now usurped the throne. Photios was deposed as patriarch, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> he was a protégé of Bardas and Michael, but because Basil I was seeking an alliance with the Pope and the western emperor. Photios was removed from his office and banished about the end of September 867, and Ignatios was reinstated on November 23. Photios was condemned by the Council of 869–870, thus putting an end to the schism. During his second patriarchate, however, Ignatios followed a policy not very different from that of Photios.|$|E

25|$|Zionist ambitions were {{increasingly}} {{identified as a}} threat by the Arab leaders in Palestine region. Certain developments, such as the acquisition of lands from Arab owners for Jewish settlements, {{which led to the}} eviction of the fellaheen from the lands which they cultivated as tenant farmers, aggravated the tension between the parties and caused the Arab population in the region of Palestine to feel dispossessed of their lands. Ottoman land-purchase regulations were invoked following local complaints in opposition to increasing immigration. Ottoman policy makers in the late 19th century were apprehensive of the increased Russian and European influence in the region, {{partly as a result of}} a large immigration wave from the Russian Empire. The Ottoman authorities feared the loyalty of the new immigrants <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> of their Jewishness but because of concern that their loyalty was primarily to their country of origin, Russia, with whom the Ottoman Empire had a long history of conflicts: immigrant loyalty to Russia might ultimately undermine Turkish control in the region of Palestine. This concern was fomented by the example seen in the dismantling of Ottoman authority in the Balkan region. European immigration was also considered by local residents to be a threat to the cultural make-up of the region. The regional significance of the anti-Jewish riots (pogroms) in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and anti-immigration legislation being enacted in Europe was that Jewish immigration waves began arriving in Palestine (see First Aliyah and Second Aliyah). As a result of the extent of the various Zionist enterprises which started becoming apparent, the Arab population in the Palestine region began protesting against the acquisition of lands by the Jewish population. As a result, in 1892 the Ottoman authorities banned land sales to foreigners. By 1914 the Jewish population in Palestine had risen to over 60,000, with around 33,000 of these being recent settlers.|$|E

According to John Kinnamos, both Stephen and Ladislaus [...] "became extremely hateful" [...] towards King Géza after they had quarreled with him. On the other hand, Niketas Choniates wrote that Ladislaus [...] "defected to Manuel, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> Géza loved him less than he should or that he feared a plot on his brother's part, but more because he was fascinated" [...] by Stephen's favorable reception by the Emperor.|$|E

2500|$|Livy {{describes}} {{the character of}} the ensuing warfare in this way: “The struggle in Bruttium had assumed the character of brigandage much more than that of regular warfare. The Numidians' had commenced the practice, and the Bruttians followed their example, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> of their alliance with the Carthaginians as because it was their traditional and natural method of carrying on war. At last even the Romans were infected by the passion for plunder and, as far as their generals allowed them, used to make predatory incursions on the enemy's fields.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Pastoral Concert {{is one of}} a {{small group}} of paintings, {{including}} the Virgin and Child with Saint Anthony and Saint Roch in the Prado, which are very close in style and, according to Charles Hope, have been [...] "more and more frequently given to Titian, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> of any very compelling resemblance to his undisputed early works—which would surely have been noted before—as because he seemed a less implausible candidate than Giorgione. But no one has been able to create a coherent sequence of Titian's early works that includes these ones, in a way that commands general support, and fits the known facts of his career. An alternative proposal is to assign the Pastoral Concert and the other pictures like it to a third artist, the very obscure Domenico Mancini..". While Crowe and Cavalcaselle considered the Concert from Palazzo Pitti as Giorgione's masterpiece but disattributed Louvre's Pastoral Concert, Lermolieff reinstated the Pastoral Concert and claimed instead that the Pitti Concert was by Titian.|$|E

50|$|Today he is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> remembered <b>because</b> of his music, {{but because}} of his alleged vanity. Kalkbrenner was {{convinced}} that, {{after the death of}} Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn, he was the only classical composer left, and he never hesitated to let the world know this. Although of humble origins, he had a lifelong aspiration to be an aristocrat and delighted in rubbing shoulders with the nobility in London and Paris. He is invariably described as a somewhat pompous, formal, overly polite, yet intelligent and business wise extremely shrewd man. He was the target of many anecdotes during his own lifetime and bitingly satirized by the German poet Heinrich Heine. There hardly is any other composer who lives on in so many anecdotes and stories as Kalkbrenner.|$|R
2500|$|Hoshaiah {{was called}} the [...] "father of the Mishnah," [...] <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> of his {{collection}} and edition of the mishnayot, as because of the ability with which he explained and interpreted them (see Yer. Ḳid. i. 60a; Yer. B. Ḳ. iv. 4c). Hoshaiah's most important halakic decision is directed against the standard weights and measures, held by R. Johanan to be traditional from the Sinaitic period. Hoshaiah's radical point of view {{can be traced to}} his theory of the development of the Mishnah. He even {{goes so far as to}} overrule both Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel with reference to offerings brought on visiting the Temple in Jerusalem three times every year (Ḥag. i. 2). The custom of greeting mourners on the Sabbath was permitted in southern Galilee, including Cæsarea, and prohibited in other places. Hoshaiah happened to be in a certain town on the Sabbath, and, meeting mourners, greeted them, saying, [...] "I do not know your custom, but I greet you according to our custom" [...] (Yer. M. Ḳ. iii. 82d).|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{has always}} been {{acclaimed}} by Americans for the brilliance of his political oratory. Kukla wrote,"Henry explained the Revolution to ordinary men and women through America in words they understood—and inspired them to fight for liberty." [...] Mayer argued, [...] "Henry had forged a popular and partisan political style whose democratic implications took another generation to realize fully and accept. His career pointed {{the transition from the}} political squirearchy of the eighteenth century to the mass politics of Andrew Jackson's day". In his study of Henry's oratory, David A. McCants suggested that Henry's position as great American orator of his day was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>because</b> of his [...] "heroism and eloquence" [...] but for adapting the clashing philosophies, religious and political, that met in Henry's Virginia, to create a new style of oratory that appealed to the masses. According to Tate, [...] "by his unmatched oratorical powers, by employing a certain common touch to win the unwavering loyalty of his constituents, and by closely identifying with their interests, he almost certainly contributed to making the Revolution a more widely popular movement than it might otherwise have become". Kidd argued that the historical focus on the quality of Henry's oratory may result from a discomfort with the content of his speeches, especially his opposition to the Constitution.|$|E

The extent that banking system is in distress or passing through a period of crisis, then, everything turns into a general crisis, especially that, in some states, natural and legal persons have been learned,,to live’’ on the credits.

2500|$|Sovereign of the Seas was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> built <b>because</b> of {{tactical}} considerations, {{but as a}} deliberate attempt to bolster {{the reputation of the}} English crown. Her name was, in itself, a political statement as Charles tried to revive the perceived ancient right of the English kings to be recognised as the 'lords of the seas.' English ships demanded that other ships strike their flags in salute, even in foreign ports. The Dutch legal thinker Hugo Grotius had argued for a mare liberum, a sea free to be used by all. Such a concept was mainly favourable to Dutch trade; in reaction, John Selden and William Monson published the book Mare Clausum ("the Closed Sea") in 1635, with special permission of Charles, which attempted to prove that King Edgar had already been recognised as Rex Marium, or [...] "sovereign of the seas" [...] - this book had been previously repressed by James I. The name of the ship explicitly referred to this dispute; King Edgar was the central theme of the transom carvings.|$|R
