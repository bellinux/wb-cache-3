These flexible processes require for process management infrastructures of a more peer to peer style. We argue that the concept of Dynamic Routing is a valuable paradigm for supporting highly flexible processes.

To cope with these changes, the operator <b>needs</b> <b>personalized</b> support that can vary over time. To realize this support, we present the design and first testing of a framework for adaptive support. First an analysis was done which data is necessary for the framework. After selection, data was collected during an experiment. Based on this data a software tool was designed to visualize task load of operators over time. Evaluation of the tool shows that combination of cognitive task load, effort and performance gives insight into the task load of an operator over time.

Evaluation with 34 navy students shows positive results on performance and general usability. Performance increases because the most important problems are solved faster.

Due to the difference of users' device, network conditions, and especially their personal preference on video content, adaptation systems <b>need</b> <b>personalized</b> multimedia access aiming at enhancing the multimedia retrieval process by complementing explicit user requests with various user's environments [32 – 35]. Meanwhile, user preference on video content is vital for achieving personalized video adaptation. [26, 31] performed video adaptation by considering video content and user preferences. Most recently, related research focus on adaptation for heterogeneous mobile display devices. In [36], the authors propose a semantic image adaptation scheme to provide mobile users with the most desired image content by integrating the content semantic importance with user preferences under limited mobile display constraints.

Is personalization consistently effective in different search contexts? We study the QAC problem by selectively personalizing the query completion list. Based on a lenient personalized QAC strategy that encodes the ranking signal as a trade-off between query popularity and search context, we propose a model for selectively personalizing query auto-completion (SP-QAC) to study this trade-off. We predict effective trade-offs based on a regression model, where the typed query prefix, clicked documents and preceding queries in the same session are used to weigh personalization in QAC. Experiments on the AOL query log show the SP-QAC model can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art personalized QAC approach...|$|R

Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is {{a vision}} of future Information Society, where people are {{surrounded}} by an electronic environment which is sensitive to their <b>needs,</b> <b>personalized</b> to their requirements, anticipa-tory of their behavior, and responsive to their presence. It emphasizes on greater user-friendliness, user-empowerment, and more eective ser-vice support, with an aim to make people's daily activities more con-venient, thus {{improving the quality of}} human life. To make AmI real, eective data management support is indispensable. High-quality infor-mation must be available to any user, anytime, anywhere, and on any lightweight device. Beyond that, AmI also raises many new challenges related to context-awareness and natural user interaction, entailing us to re-think current database techniques. The aim {{of this paper is to}} address the impact of AmI, particularly its user-centric context-awareness requirement on data management strate-gies and solutions. We rst provide a multidimensional view of database access context. Taking diverse contextual information into account, we then present ve context-aware data management strategies, using the most fundamental database operation- context-aware query request as a case in point. We execute the proposed strategies via a two-layered infrastructure, consisting of public data manager(s) and a private data manager. Detailed steps of processing a context-aware query are also described in the paper. ...|$|R

A prediction of the clinical outcome and appropriate choice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy <b>needs</b> <b>personalized</b> insight to the main driving pathways. Because most CRCs have polyps as progenitor lesions, studying the pathways driving to adenomagenesis is no less important. Our purpose was the evaluation of microsatellite stability status within conventional colon adenomas and also β-catenin, BRAFV 600 E and p 53 contribution. The cohort included 101 cases of typical colon adenomas with high grade epithelial dysplasia according to WHO. An immunohistochemistry method {{was used for the}} depiction of the expression of targeted proteins, as also their heterogeneity. Generally, we noted a 10 % frequency of MSI events where MSI-H reached a 5 % share occurred within the left colon and rectal polyps. β-catenin nuclear overexpression was noted with a 70 % frequency and p 53 with close to a 24 % frequency. In addition, we found a presence of micro-serration foci more often within tubular adenomas, where focal MSI took place more often. Our results indicate that MSI events occur more often than had been theorized earlier. It results in tumour heterogeneity, more complex underlying pathways and finally ontogenetic molecular-diversity of tumours besides similar occurring histopathological features...|$|R

This paper presents the design and first user evaluation of an adaptive interface. A method for cognitive task analysis and 4 support concepts, which were validated for static function allocation and interface design, were taken as starting point. Specific instances of the resulting adaptive interface are the possibility to redirect the alarm (system or operator initiated), and the changing functional layout (e. g. buttons, alarm categories). A first user evaluation of the interface with 64 navy students shows promising results. The method for cognitive task analysis and the 4 support concepts prove to be useable for adaptive support as well. Evaluation shows very positive results on the support system, specifically on the task allocation functions.

40|$|Web Search Engines {{provide a}} huge number of answers in {{response}} to a user query, many of which are not relevant, whereas some of the most relevant ones may not be found. In the literature several approaches have been proposed in order to help a user to find the information relevant to his/her real needs on the Web. To achieve this goal the individual Information Behavior can been analyzed to ’keep’ track of the user’s interests. Keeping information is a type of Information Behavior, and in several works researchers have referred to it as the study on what people do during a search on the Web. Generally, the user’s actions (e. g., how the user moves from one Web page to another, or her/his download of a document, etc.) are recorded in Web logs.
