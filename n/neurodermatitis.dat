5000|$|This variety was {{developed}} to provide a source of edible linseed oil with a low alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content of approximately 2%, as compared to 50% in the wild type variety. [...] It was done to improve the storage quality of linseed when used as a bulk livestock feed. Linseed's previous main use had been linseed oil {{for use as a}} paint ingredient, with the ALA (omega-3 fatty acid) being a quick drying component. With the advent of [...] "plastic" [...] water-based paints, the linseed market fell into decline, but when marketed as a stock feed, the omega-3 content also deteriorated quickly in storage. It also has a correspondingly higher content of the linoleic acid, omega-6 fatty acid, around 65% to 75%. The lower level of ALA increases the oxidative stability of the oil/seed, which makes remain edible when stored. The seed colour was also changed from the wild type dark brown seed to a light yellow seed, which consequently gives an oil of a light colour, easily distinguished from the darker linseed oil, the flaxseed oil that we consume today. Linola oil does not contain any useful omega-3 fatty acids, and {{is not likely to be}} found as a human food/health supplement.Linola can specially help against <b>neurodermatitis.</b> Linola is being produced in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and in the U.S. states of Washington and Idaho.

40|$|SUMMARY Prurigo nodularis (PN) is {{a benign}} <b>neurodermatitis</b> of unknown {{etiology}} characterized by firm, hyperkeratotic pruritic nodules most commonly localized symmetrically on the bilateral extensor lower extremities. PN represents a primary dermatological condition or a dermatological manifestation of repeated traumatic manipulation secondary to chronic pruritus. One must consider {{underlying causes of}} pruritus, which may include psychiatric disorders and internal disease. Given its chronicity and relapsing nature, treatment of PN can be challenging. Interruption of the itch-scratch cycle is difficult; long term prognosis remains guarded.

One case of <b>neurodermatitis</b> and two cases of lichen sclerosus progressed to carcinoma but no case of chronic hypertrophic vulvitis became malignant. It is possible that vulval dermatoses occur more commonly in the nulliparous than in the parous women and there is a slight preponderance of women who are blood group A. It is suggested that the term "leukoplakia" should be abandoned and that vulval lesions should be described in precise and meaningful histological terms...|$|E

40|$|<b>Neurodermatitis</b> {{patients}} were treated in brief psychotherapy, following a specific {{method of treatment}} designed to encourage and reinforce the expression of hostility toward contemporary life conflicts. Significant {{differences were found between}} those who were successfully treated and those who were not. Of those investigated factors related to outcome, two (intensity of overt hostility as inferred from initial interviews and hostile-content responses on the Rorschach test) showed significant differences, although not in the direction predicted. Such factors as inferred motivation for treat-ment, likelihood of dangerous acting out, verbal resources, and the likelihood of a psychotic decompensation {{did not appear to be}} related to outcome. There was no evidence of significant symptom substitution or of dangerous acting out in the course of treatment. Results support the hypotheses that patients with <b>neurodermatitis</b> can be treated in brief psychotherapy with successful remission of their symptom and that patients who do not improve or who discontinue the prescribed form of treatment differ significantly from those who complete it successfully.

40|$|Background: The {{habit of}} {{cleaning}} {{the external auditory}} canal with cotton buds is a common practice of the masses.

In many cases the injury will heal but damage to minuscule bones deep inside the ear can cause permanent deafness. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the association of dermatological condition of external ear with the use of cotton buds. Materials and Methods: This case control study was done from January to October 2012 in the Ear Nose Throat Department of Pakistan Level III Hospital, Darfur, Sudan. Sixty seven patients with dermatological diseases of external ear were cases and 83 subjects without dermatological diseases of external ear were selected as controls.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Autoerythrocyte sensitization syndrome (AES) is a disorder characterized by recurrent, spontaneous, painful bruising {{in patients with}} underlying psychosis and neurosis. Its pathogenesis is uncertain. Purpuric lesions reproduced by injections of washed autologous erythrocytes suggest an autoimmune etiology. The authors described a 50 -year-old woman who presented with recurrent episodes of painful bruising for 8 months, along with a 2 -year history of general chronic <b>neurodermatitis.</b> A diagnosis of AES was {{made on the basis}} of the clinical symptoms and laboratory examinations results: the positive autoerythrocyte sensitization test and psychophysiologic derangement. However, the noticeable symptoms, simultaneously identical distribution of the ecchymosis and <b>neurodermatitis</b> lesions, as well as concomitant symptom of itching over the ecchymosis, created doubts regarding the real etiopathogenesis of the ecchymosis and whether the ecchymosis in the present patient were just factitious purpura.

As predicted, patient dyads made more negative and fewer positive statements than control dyads. The patient group also showed more negative and fewer positive nonverbal interactions. Descriptive sequence analyses for both verbal and nonverbal behaviour indicated that in patient dyads positive/neutral interaction patterns were shorter and less frequent and negative escalations were longer and more frequent than in control dyads...|$|E
