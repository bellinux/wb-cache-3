5000|$|Alcest {{was formed}} as a solo project by <b>Neige</b> in 2000.

5000|$|Famine {{put things}} {{straight}} when he stated: [...] "The most absurd idea spread by idiots is that La Sanie des siècles is better because <b>Neige</b> was {{more involved in}} its recording and production, yet {{the fact is that}} the album was recorded without <b>Neige,</b> in 2005, when I had kicked him out of the band. <b>Neige</b> never had any influence on my music in the slightest way possible; I write everything and I tell people what they must do over MY riffs. This was exactly what happened with <b>Neige,</b> ask him! ... To claim that <b>Neige</b> is an important figure in PN is the same as saying that the person who plays the triangle in SOPOR AETERNUS AND THE ENSEMBLE OF SHADOWS is the main man in SOPOR." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Piton des <b>Neiges</b> (Snow Peak) is {{a massive}} 3,069 m (10,069 ft) shield volcano on Réunion, one of the French {{volcanic}} islands in the Mascarene Archipelago in the southwestern Indian Ocean.

The volcano was formed by the Réunion hotspot and emerged from the sea about two million years ago. Now deeply eroded, the volcano has been inactive for 20,000 years and is surrounded by three massive crater valleys, the Cirques. Piton des <b>Neiges</b> forms the northwestern two thirds of Réunion, with the very active Piton de la Fournaise comprising the rest.
