5000|$|In a {{jazz band}} a guitarist or pianist will comp by playing {{a variety of}} chords that include the notes of the chord known as the 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 13th (jazz chord players often omit the root, because the bassist usually plays the root. The fifth of the chord is also omitted, except when the fifth is {{flattened}} or sharpened). In the key of C, the G7 chord in a jazz context might be performed by playing the notes B, E, F, and A (the 3rd, 13th, flat 7th, and 9th notes of the chord). As well, jazz compers may use altered chords that contain flattened or sharpened 5ths, sharp 11ths, flat or sharpened 9ths, and flat 13ths for some songs or soloists. For example, an altered G7 chord might be played with a basic voicing, often the 3rd (B) and 7th (F), {{along with some of}} the following <b>notes</b> <b>A,</b> <b>A,</b> C, and E (9, 9, 11, 13), subject to the taste and style of the performer and/or the bandleader.|$|E
40|$|In shear flows like pipe {{flow and}} plane Couette flow {{there is an}} {{extended}} range of parameters where linearly stable laminar flow coexists with a transient turbulent dynamics. When increasing the amplitude of a perturbation {{on top of the}} laminar flow, one <b>notes</b> <b>a</b> <b>a</b> qualitative change in its lifetime, from smoothly varying and short one on the laminar side to sensitively dependent on initial conditions and long on the turbulent side. The point of transition defines a point on the edge of chaos. Since it is defined via the lifetimes, the edge of chaos can also be used in situations when the turbulence is not persistent. It then generalises the concept of basin boundaries, which separate two coexisting attractors, to cases where the dynamics on one side shows transient chaos and almost all trajectories eventually end up on the other side. In this paper we analyse a two-dimensional map which captures many of the features identified in laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations of hydrodynamic flows. The analysis of the map shows that different dynamical situations in the edge of chaos can be combined with different dynamical situations in the turbulent region. Consequently, the model can be used to develop and test further characterisations that are also applicable to realistic flows. Comment: 24 pages, 9 color figure...|$|E
