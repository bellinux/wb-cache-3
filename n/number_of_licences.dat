40|$|We use {{survey data}} for 238 European {{universities}} and 24 research institutes {{to examine the}} effects of regional factors at the NUTS- 1 or NUTS- 2 level on three knowledge transfer outcomes of public research organisations: the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> agreements, start-ups and R&D agreements with companies. We find that (1) a larger share of regional employment in high and medium-high technology manufacturing sectors in the same region as the public research organisation has a positive impact on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> agreements. (2) A larger share of employment in knowledge-intensive services has a positive impact on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> start-ups and research agreements, but a negative impact on licence agreements. (3) Competition as measured by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> public research organisations in a region has a negative impact on all three outcomes...|$|R
50|$|On 24 April 2015, the High Court {{ruled the}} {{rejection}} of HKTV's application as unlawful: when the Executive Council switched to a policy that limits the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences,</b> it failed to follow the policy which encourages competition within the broadcasting industry as set forth in 1998. The court ordered the Exco to reconsider HKTV's application.|$|R

In the UK, according to the HE-BCI survey, IP income includes non-software, software income and other IP income. In Japan, it includespatents and others. We also investigate the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> spin-offs created by universities and academics in the two countries.|$|R
25|$|The Department of Fisheries {{have issued}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> to {{cultivate}} black-lip pearl oysters in the Abrolhos. The first {{recipient of a}} license was Abrolhos Pearls in 1996. By 2000, another license had been issued and four more applications had been received. A year later, there were 10 square kilometres licensed for the culture of pearl oysters in the Abrolhos, of which about 21% was actually in use, carrying over 210,000 shell. Six licences had been issued by 2002, and by 2007 that number had grown to eight.|$|E
25|$|Support Branch is sub-divided {{into five}} divisions. Field Division is {{responsible}} for coordinating policy matters relating to firearms, equipment, uniforms and operational procedures. Projects undertaken by the Division during the year included the force-wide introduction of the OC Foam and the new, expandable baton. It had also been instrumental in developing technological solutions {{to a number of}} policing problems and is currently conducting a review of police uniforms including the cap and the shoes as well as other accoutrements. General Division handles policy matters relating to station procedures; the security and management of the Police Headquarters (PHQ) complex; and diverse other duties. During the year, the Division {{played a major role in}} the streamlining of station procedures; making arrangements for the reallocation of offices and facilities; formulating a new policy for parking at the PHQ as required by the PHQ Redevelopment Project and such other duties as coordinating the Force involvement in the District Council elections. Transport Division {{is responsible for}} the management and deployment of the Force fleet of approximately 2,400 vehicles, driver establishment and the acquisition of new police vehicles. It also administers all policy matters relating to police transport requirements. Force Data and Access to Information Coordination Unit is responsible for coordinating the Force response to devising internal policy on and ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and the Code on Access to Information. Police Licensing Office acts as the licensing authority for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> and permits.|$|E
2500|$|P.charlestoni is {{protected}} {{by a number of}} laws in Cape Verde. A limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> are granted (only five in 2006), and a minimum landing size of [...] is applied. A ban on landing egg-bearing females was repealed, and the closed season extended from three to six months (July to November). An estimate of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of P.charlestoni using Fox's surplus production model suggested that the species is being overexploited; it found the MSY to be around 40t, which could be caught using only 60% of the effort expended on the fishery in 1999. Because of the likely overexploitation, and the species' limited range, it is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} allow for {{commercial}} licensing, the country was divided into a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> areas. When these were drawn up in the 1950s, each major city or regional area - about 50 in all - was considered its own market region. In {{each of the five}} major capitals, three commercial licences were granted (the exception being Perth which did not receive its third commercial station until 1988), while smaller cities or regions were granted a single licence.|$|R

50|$|On {{the south}} side of the inlet, the {{gathering}} and processing of cockles (Cerastoderma edule) contributes significantly to the economy of the villages of Crofty, Llanmorlais and Penclawdd. Anyone can take a bucket of cockles for their personal use, but the commercial fishery is restricted to a relatively small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> holders. Cockle density fluctuates from year to year; the estuary is also an internationally important location for waders and other wildfowl, which has led to demands from cocklers for the control of oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus), which feed on cockles.|$|R
2500|$|Two six-room {{houses were}} {{built on the}} corner of Cannon Street and Church Place in 1873. They were {{converted}} into a single building and opened as the Kent Hotel in 1875. The building's exterior was restyled in Art Deco fashion in the 1940s and the interior of the hotel completely renovated in the 1990s. It is now known as the Port Anchor Hotel.Brunswick Pier Hotel was {{on the corner of}} Vincent and Robe Streets. It opened in 1878 in what had been a butcher's shop. The hotel lost its licence in 1909, along with other hotels, after an opinion poll resulted in a reduction of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences.</b> After this the building was used as a furniture shop and a butcher's shop. During the 1920s it became a pharmacy specialising in photographic materials and [...] "Kirby's Calcarea Teething Powders". [...] Medical suites were leased upstairs. It was bought by Birks Chemists in 1946, and remained a pharmacy until 1996. [...] From then to at least 2001 the building was vacant.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Blériot {{established}} his first flying school at Etampes near Rouen in 1909. [...] Another was started at Pau, where the climate made year-round flying more practical, in early 1910 and in September 1910 a third was established at Hendon Aerodrome near London. [...] A {{considerable number of}} pilots were trained: by 1914 nearly 1,000 pilots had gained their Aero Club de France license at the Blériot schools, around half the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> issued. [...] Flight training was offered free {{to those who had}} bought a Blériot aircraft: for others it initially cost 2,000 francs, this being reduced to 800 francs in 1912. [...] A gifted pupil favoured by good weather could gain his license in as little as eight days, although for some it took as long as six weeks. [...] There were no dual control aircraft in these early days, training simply consisting of basic instruction {{on the use of the}} controls followed by solo taxying exercises, progressing to short straight-line flights and then to circuits. [...] To gain a license a pilot had to make three circular flights of more than 5km (3mi), landing within [...] of a designated point.|$|E

50|$|In 1960 {{the company}} was renamed Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft (and the {{equivalent}} names in the other languages - see above) to reflect the addition of television services. In 1964 the Federal Council allowed television advertising, as a means <b>of</b> keeping <b>licence</b> fees down. In 1966 the three main languages were each given a second radio channel, in order to counter the effects of new commercial broadcasters outside the country, whose strong signals were reaching the Swiss population. In the same year a dedicated Romansh broadcasting unit was created in Chur, {{using some of the}} new German-language second channel's broadcasting time. In 1968 colour television was introduced, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> fee payers passed one million.|$|R

50|$|At 7:30pm on 1 June 1960, New Zealand's first {{television}} channel, AKTV2, started broadcasting in Auckland from the NZBC building at 74 Shortland Street, previously used to broadcast {{public radio station}} 1YA and now home to The University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery. Owned and operated by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service. With {{the passing of the}} Broadcasting Corporation Act 1961, the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was established, with F. J. Llewellyn as its chairman. During the course of the Bill through the House of Representatives in the session of 1961, provision was made for the establishment of privately owned stations and, although strongly opposed by the Labour Opposition, this became part of the Act. But before such stations may be established, the Corporation, which took office on 1 April 1962, is required to undertake a review of existing coverage. At the time of transfer, the Corporation assumed responsibility for the control of 35 radio stations and four television stations. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> holders for sound radio has grown to more than 600,000. The tremendous appeal of television is demonstrated by {{the fact that in the}} first three-year period <b>of</b> development the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> holders reached a total of 275,000 (November 1964). The annual income from all sources exceeds £5,000,000, more than £250,000 being paid in taxation. Initially, the four television facilities were unlinked, and programming had to be shipped between each station. However, for urgent news video, it was possible to link the two stations in each island using Post Office Telephone Department (now Chorus) coaxial toll lines at the expense <b>of</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> voice channels. This method was too costly for the regular programming.|$|R
5000|$|Special rules {{apply to}} the issue of regular and heavy tow truck {{licences}} used for the provision of accident towing services on the CityLink and EastLink toll roads.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the economies of salmon fishing in Ireland. Essentially, it set out to answer the question "how valuable was the Irish salmon industry to the economy in 1970 ?" In order to answer this question, the study tried to evaluate the economic impact of angling and commercial fishing on the various districts, determine the capacity of the industry for future development and provide information to assist in the more effective marketing of salmon and sea-trout angling. Although the survey was confined to 1970, its findings may be updated for subsequent years by means of the regularly published data on catches and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences,</b> and by appropriate price indices...|$|R
