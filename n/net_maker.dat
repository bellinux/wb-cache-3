50|$|The land {{immediately}} {{to the west of}} Portgordon was owned by Patrick Steuart of Tannachy and Auchlunkart, who built there the Seatown of Tannachy (now more commonly Porttannachy) during the 19th century. At this time trade was expanding, not just in fishing and boat building, but in the export of grain, and import of salt, coal and lumber, and the building of granaries. This placed Portgordon at a great advantage over Buckie which was still limited by its natural harbour to fishing alone. By the 1850s a post office had opened and there were many coopers, fish processors and <b>net</b> <b>makers.</b> By 1861 the population had grown to around 630. The opening of a fertiliser factory in Keith lead to traffic in bones through the harbour too.|$|R
50|$|Although our {{recorded}} {{history of the}} tribes in this region does not begin until the explorers and missionaries arrived, {{there is evidence of}} many tribal settlements in the area later known as Cambria. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people inhabited the area in the time (some 1000 years) before the Spanish arrived. Experts believe these tribes to have been migratory and used Cambria as a seasonal settlement; other scientists are convinced that they lived there permanently. Most agree that they fed themselves with shellfish and seafood, as well as obtaining food from travels inland to hunt and gather seeds. A variety of artistically-crafted implements have been discovered, including spears points and arrowheads made from obsidian; basalt, sandstone, and granite were used to make mortars and pestles; soapstone kettles and stone hammers were also found. These early inhabitants were skilled basket and <b>net</b> <b>makers</b> and fashioned jewelry from crab claws, abalone shells, and the teeth of sharks and whales. The presence of soapstone (steatite) provides evidence that they traded with the Catalina Island tribes, whereas the lack of metals and glass indicates that they did not trade with Europeans or Asians.|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes devastated {{not only}} fishing boats but also many {{businesses}} interdependent with fishermen: processing plants, ice plants, boat builders, <b>net</b> <b>makers</b> and other suppliers. Fuel prices {{and other expenses}} have increased. Wholesale catch prices are down due to damaged markets, lack of storage facilities and, in the shrimp fishery, imports of farmed shrimp. We commonly discuss ecosystem-based management. We need to include humans in that ecosystem, and use this opportunity to improve: ‌• Fishery sustainability ‌• Stewardship of the biophysical environment ‌• Economic justice for the fishing community ‌• Understanding and communication among fishery stakeholders This paper draws on case studies to identify practices that have worked around the world, in Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, the Middle East and South and North America.

In this paper, I examine what factors contributed to the success of selected cases, and analyze whether part (or all) of the program would be applicable in the Gulf of Mexico Coastal region (Gulf Coast), given differences in physical and cultural environments. Any program that draws on finite resources needs to be evaluated regularly, and improved where possible. In this paper I propose a framework for program evaluation that will enable evaluators to determine where the program is succeeding, identify challenges and make improvements...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses a {{gravity model}} with panel data and 3 {{regional}} dummies {{to assess the}} effects of the new free trade agreements signed between Latin American countries in the 90 ’s. The originality of this research lies in the spectrum of agreements covered (big customs unions as well as bilateral free trade areas) and in its objective. We try {{to find out if the}} new zones boost trade between member countries and also with all the partners of the sub-continent. This question is essential as the choice between continental and sub-continental integration is still not clearly established. Our findings show evidence that all the selected groups (Mercosur, Andean Community, Group of 3, Free trade areas Bolivia-Mexico and Chile-Mexico) generate internal trade creations. Except for the Chile-Mexico agreement, the impact on the imports and on the exports with the rest of Latin America is also positive. The new groups represent building blocks (<b>net</b> trade <b>makers)</b> for the Latin American region. The revival of the regionalization process of the 90 ’s thus entails an expansion of trade on the whole sub-continent. This result constitutes an argument for a South American free trade area which would precede an exposure to North American competition within the framework of the Free trade area of Americas. building / stumbling blocks, gravity model, Latin America, trade creation / diversion, trade integration...|$|R

Using a unique data set from the Chicago Board Options Exchange, we construct non-market <b>maker</b> <b>net</b> demand for volatility over the 1990 through 2001 period. We find that this demand possesses information about the future volatility of underlying stocks. A natural interpretation of this result is that investors trade on volatility information in the option market. This interpretation is corroborated by our finding that demand constructed from transactions that open new option positions contains more information about future volatility than demand constructed from transactions that close existing option positions We also examine the asset pricing implications of option investors trading on volatility information.

THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES have witnessed astonishing growth in the market for derivatives. The market’s current size of $ 200 trillion is more than 100 times greater than 30 years ago (Stulz (2004)). Accompanying this impressive growth in size has been an equally impressive growth in variety: The derivatives market now covers a broad spectrum of risk, including equity risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and, most recently, credit risk and inflation risk. This phenomenal growth in size and breadth underscores the role of derivatives in financial markets and their economic value. While financial theory has traditionally emphasized the spanning properties of derivatives and their consequent ability to improve risk-sharing (Arrow (1964) and Ross (1976)), the role of derivatives as a vehicle for the trading of informed investors has emerged as another important economic function of these securities (Black (1975) and Grossman (1977)). We contribute to the body of knowledge on the economic value of derivatives by investigating the role of options as a mechanism for trading on information about future equity volatility. Our focus on informed volatility trading is motivated to a large extent by the fact that equity options are uniquely suited to investors with information about future volatility.

40|$|Background: SERVIR [...] the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System [...] {{helps people}} use Earth {{observations}} and predictive models {{based on data}} from orbiting satellites to make timely decisions that benefit society. SERVIR operates through a network of regional hubs in Mesoamerica, East Africa, and the Hindu Kush-Himalayas. USAID and NASA support SERVIR, with the long-term goal of transferring SERVIR capabilities to the host countries. Objective/Purpose: The purpose of this presentation is to describe how the SERVIR system helps the SERVIR regions cope with eight areas of societal benefit identified by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) : health, disasters, ecosystems, biodiversity, weather, water, climate, and agriculture. This presentation will describe environmental health applications of data in the SERVIR system, as well as ongoing and future efforts to incorporate additional health applications into the SERVIR system. Methods: This presentation will discuss how the SERVIR Program makes environmental data available for use in environmental health applications. SERVIR accomplishes its mission by providing member nations with access to geospatial data and predictive models, information visualization, training and capacity building, and partnership development. SERVIR conducts needs assessments in partner regions, develops custom applications of Earth observation data, and makes NASA and partner data available through an online geospatial data portal at SERVIRglobal. <b>net.</b> Results: Decision <b>makers</b> use SERVIR to improve their ability to monitor air quality, extreme weather, biodiversity, and changes in land cover. In past several years, the system has been used over 50 times to respond to environmental threats such as wildfires, floods, landslides, and harmful algal blooms. Given that the SERVIR regions are experiencing increased stress under larger climate variability than historic observations, SERVIR provides information to support the development of adaptation strategies for nations affected by climate change. Conclusions: SERVIR is a platform for collaboration and cross-agency coordination, international partnerships, and delivery of web-based geospatial information services and applications. SERVIR makes a variety of geospatial data available for use in studies of environmental health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Web 2. 0 {{has been}} a {{dominant}} concept in recent discussion and development of Internet applications, businesses and uses. Dating from 2004, the term Web 2. 0 is variously understood as new forms of website development and delivery technology, changing uses of the Internet to emphasise sociability over consumption, new understandings of the possible financial exploitation of the web, and more broadly, {{a new way of}} thinking about the Internet as a whole. However, Web 2. 0 is, conceptually, both more and less than these various understandings and we can only grasp why it has become such a key term in contemporary usage by appreciating two key discursive foundations for this term. Firstly, much Web 2. 0 thinking is a re-expression of long-held ideas about the Internet and the web. Secondly, at the particular time when Web 2. 0 was made popular, <b>net</b> technology policy <b>makers</b> and financial analysts were primarily enthused by the possibilities of broadband networks for improved and more profitable versions of the well-established businesses of telephony and audio-visual entertainment, and had to some extent consigned novel, web-based services to a lesser role, following the dot. com crash. Thus, as I argue in this paper, Web 2. 0 can be understood as a key intervention, from within the dot. com / new media business sector, recovering from the crash, that re-asserts the equal legitimacy of the use of networked computing, over high-speed lines, for computing-oriented activities, and not just video on demand and voice over IP. In short, {{in the first years of}} this century, discussions about the future of the Internet had become dominated by arguments for increased broadband access, substantially concerned with providing more traditional video and voice services in new ways. The World Wide Web was seen as relatively unimportant for this purpose, even though it was part of the so-called 2 ̆ 7 triple play 2 ̆ 7 of voice and data services. At this time, first in the hands of Tim O 2 ̆ 7 Reilly and then from others who took up his position, Web 2. 0 became a catchy simple term under which to mount a campaign for the renaissance of the World Wide Web as a quite distinct, yet equally important, form of media and communications. So, Web 2. 0 provides evidence that, while there is a convergence of all forms of media and communications towards similar data traffic over the Internet, there remain diverging views over the nature, control and use of the Internet, views that express the degree to which corporate players imagine themselves to be 2 ̆ 7 media 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 telephony 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 computing 2 ̆ 7 in primary orientation...|$|R

Leaders must create a reliable approach that reflects the opportunities and risks of investing these funds, contraction of liquidity around the world and we need to stop the reckless policy of trade protectionism and the class struggle, the fall of the dollar. However, there is another problem beyond all this. It is that system to assess the credit risk and the need to adjust the distribution and flawed financial structure.

We live in an age that can save a new global economic policy-makers need to properly capture important moments. And right now, this moment is an important historical moment. [...] Unlike the past, today's brave policy leaders need a little more aggressive, have an effective agenda to avoid a disaster to move forward.
