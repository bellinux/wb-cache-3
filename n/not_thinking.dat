5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars.

25|$|Because this {{declaration}} {{has often}} been held up by anti-Semites as proof that Jews are untrustworthy, the Reform movement removed it from the liturgy - temporarily, but there was enough popular demand for its restoration. In fact, the reverse is true: Jews cherish this ritual because they take vows so seriously that they consider themselves bound even if they make the vows under duress or in times of stress when <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> straight. This ritual gave comfort {{to those who were}} forcibly converted to Christianity, yet felt unable to break their vow to follow Christianity. In recognition of that history, the Reform movement restored this recitation to its liturgy.|$|E

25|$|With {{existing}} behavioral, prosthetic, {{and pharmaceutical}} treatments providing limited {{relief from the}} overt symptoms of stuttering, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support by professionals and people who stutter. Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering. One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> about the stammer for prolonged periods. Psychoanalysis has claimed success {{in the treatment of}} stuttering. Hypnotherapy has also been explored as a management alternative. Support groups further focus on the fact that stuttering is not a physical impediment but a psychological one.|$|E

After multiple tests, it was determined that Sayama needed to undergo emergency heart surgery, which took place on May 22.

25|$|The {{original}} version contains hints of Romantic themes when it mourns {{the death of}} Chatterton. Coleridge was influenced by John Milton's Lycidas, Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and the poetry of both William Bowles and Thomas Warton. Gray's particular influence was in word choice and Coleridge's incorporating the image of Chatterton as a young poet. Warton's The Suicide provides a connection to Chatterton by describing a poor poet killing himself. Although Warton {{made it clear that}} he was <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> of Chatterton when composing the poem, Coleridge believed that there was a connection, and he believed that Warton's depiction was too unfavourable towards Chatterton. Coleridge was personally affected by the idea of Chatterton's death and how the poet was ruined by debt. Of the later point, Coleridge knew of poverty affecting many poets that he admired along with having a lot of experience with his own debt and poverty.|$|E
25|$|Madilog {{introduced}} {{a way of}} thinking of evidence and fact in a way that fit into Indonesian demographics and culture, in line with Indonesian thinking on fundamentals. Evidence is fact and fact is founded on scientific evidence. There are two main ways of thinking in Western philosophy. The first is idea (mind), unity of thinking, and sense. The second is matter as tangible reality, objective in nature as existence. Those two concepts were combined in the same way of thinking for human beings, who are the subject living things. In Madilog, the main field is evidence. Although evidence can't be described rationally, scientifically—as to what, why, and how—evidence should be considered as a true way of thinking, the consequence of <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> evidentially being logical fallacies and myth-making. This is the focus of the epistemology of Madilog, concerning truth, the validity of science, and the correlation of human knowledge to life. The epistemology is divided into three parts: definition, testing, and mathematical thinking.|$|E

25|$|Liang faced Northern Ireland's Joe Swail in {{the last}} 16 of the tournament. In a humorous incident, Liang fluked a red after {{scattering}} the balls, but failed to notice {{and went back to}} his seat. To laughter, Swail pointed out his mistake and the referee called Liang back to the table. In the 23rd frame, Liang, with a 12–10 lead, prematurely celebrated winning after potting match ball, only to go on to lose the frame due to a snooker. Swail came back to level the match at 12–12. In the final frame, Liang made breaks of 34 and 30 early on. He missed the final yellow but snookered Swail, leaving the white in the jaws of the pocket. Liang played a safety and Swail snookered him behind the blue, but Liang failed to hit the ball and Swail had the white replaced. Liang then hit the yellow directly. This incident proved controversial as the referee replaced the white in the wrong position, giving Liang a better sight of the yellow. At the time, Swail nodded his assent to the referee, but in a post-match interview, complained and accused Liang of unprofessional behaviour for not pointing out the referee's error. Commentators countered that Swail should have queried the placement of the ball before Liang took his shot, and given the tension of the situation Liang could be forgiven for <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> clearly. Liang {{went on to win the}} frame 74–34, and thus, the match 13–12.|$|E
