50|$|Seneca Glass Company Building is a {{historic}} glass factory located at Morgantown, Monongalia County, West Virginia. It was built in 1896-1897, and is an industrial complex of work areas, all connected by doors, passageways, or bridges. A fire in 1902, destroyed much of {{the interior of the}} original brick part of the complex. After the fire, Elmer F. Jacobs designed the new two-story replacement, a new <b>Needle</b> <b>Etching</b> Room in a separate building connected by a bridge, and the reconstruction of the Grinding, Glazing, and Cutting areas. A large addition was built in 1947. The building features a conical brick stack that projects 36 feet above the roofline of the Furnace / Blowing Room. The complex was the home of one of the finest hand-blown, hand-cut and etched, lead glass factories in the world. After the factory closed in 1983, it was adapted for commercial use.|$|E

The burin acts exactly as a plough in the earth: it makes a furrow and turns out a shaving of metal in the same way a plough turns the soil of a field.

5000|$|Etching {{prints are}} {{generally}} linear and often contain fine detail and contours. Lines {{can vary from}} smooth to sketchy. An etching is opposite of a woodcut in that the raised portions of an etching remain blank while the crevices hold ink. In pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate {{is covered with a}} waxy or acrylic ground. The artist then draws through the ground with a pointed <b>etching</b> <b>needle.</b> The exposed metal lines are then etched by dipping the plate in a bath of etchant (e.g. nitric acid or ferric chloride). The etchant [...] "bites" [...] into the exposed metal, leaving behind lines in the plate.

5000|$|The {{process of}} stipple {{engraving}} {{is described in}} T.H. Fielding's Art of Engraving (1841). To begin with an etching ground is laid on the plate. The outline is drawn out in small dots with an <b>etching</b> <b>needle,</b> and the darker areas of the image shaded with a pattern of close dots. As in mezzotint use was made of roulettes, and a mattoir to produce large numbers of dots relatively quickly. [...] Then the plate is bitten with acid, and the etching ground removed. The lighter areas of shade are then laid in with a drypoint or a stipple graver; Fielding describes the latter as [...] "resembling the common kind, except that the blade bends down instead of up, thereby allowing the engraver greater facility in forming the small holes or dots in the copper". The etched middle and dark tones would also be deepened where appropriate with the graver.|$|R
50|$|In {{intaglio}} printing, {{the lines}} to be printed are cut into a metal plate by means either of {{a cutting tool}} called a burin, held in the hand - {{in which case the}} process is called engraving; or through the corrosive action of acid - in which case the process is known as etching. In etching, for example, the plate is covered in a resin ground or an acid-resistant wax material. Using an <b>etching</b> <b>needle,</b> or a similar tool, the image is engraved into the ground, revealing the plate underneath. The plate is then dipped into acid. The acid bites into the surface of the plate where it was exposed. Biting is a printmaking term to describe the acid's etching, or incising, of the image. After the plate is sufficiently bitten, the plate is removed from the acid bath, and the ground is removed to prepare for the next step in printing.|$|R

5000|$|Callot's {{technical}} {{innovations in}} improving the recipes for etching ground were crucial in allowing etching to rival the detail of engraving, {{and in the long}} term spelt the end of artistic engraving. Previously the unreliable nature of the grounds used meant that artists could not risk investing too much effort in an etched plate, as the work might be ruined by leaks in the ground. Equally, multiple stoppings-out, enabling lines etched to different depths by varying lengths of exposure to the acid, had been too risky. Callot led the way in exploiting the new possibilities; most of his etchings are small but full of tiny detail, and he developed a sense of recession in landscape backgrounds in etching with multiple bitings to etch the background more lightly than the foreground. He also used a special <b>etching</b> <b>needle</b> called an échoppe to produce swelling lines like those created by the burin in an engraving, and also reinforced the etched lines with a burin after biting; which soon became common practice among etchers. Callot etched a great variety of subjects in over 1400 prints, from grotesques to his tiny but extremely powerful series Les Grandes Misères de la guerre. Abraham Bosse, a Parisian illustrative etcher popularized Callot's methods in a hugely successful manual for students. His own work is successful in his declared aim of making etchings look like engravings, and is highly evocative of French life at the middle of the century.|$|R
5000|$|Confusingly, the printmaking {{technique}} used in steel engravings is, after the earliest {{years in the}} 1820s, normally a combination of etching and true engraving, with etching becoming dominant in later examples, after the technique became popular in the 1830s. Engraving is done with a burin, which is a small bar of hardened steel with a sharp point. It is pushed along the plate to produce thin furrowed lines, leaving [...] "burr" [...] or strips of waste metal to the side. This {{is followed by the}} use of a scraper to remove any burs, since they would be an impediment during the subsequent inking process. Steel plates are very hard for this technique, which is normally used on softer copper plates. So steel engraving also used etching (q.v.), where acid creates the lines in the plates in the pattern made by selectively removing a thin coating of acid-resistant ground by tools. This is much less effort. As well as <b>etching</b> <b>needles,</b> the etched part of steel engravings made great use of roulettes, small wheels mounted in handles which have regular sharp projections which produce broken lines of dots and dashes when rolled across the plate. Roulettes of different types were used together with the burin and needle to create densely packed marks which appear as tonal to the eye, and allow a great variety of textures and effects. True burin engraving was generally used to finish the etched image.|$|R
40|$|A {{near-field}} {{laser ablation}} {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometric (NF-LA-ICP-MS) procedure was created for element analysis in the nm resolution range. The method utilizes a well-known near-field effect {{in order to enhance}} the incident light energy on the thin tip of a Ag needle during the laser ablation process. A robust <b>needle</b> <b>etching</b> procedure was developed to produce the thin needles with a tip diameter in the range of hundreds of nm. An experimental arrangement was constructed to control the "sample-to-tip" distance via the measurements of tunnel current between the needle and sample surface. The NF-LA-ICP-MS technique thus developed was applied to analyze thin Au films deposited onto a Si substrate. The observed craters ranged from 500 nm to about 1 mu m in diameter and were dependent on the needle used {{as well as on the}} "sample-to-tip" distance. These results were also confirmed by mass spectrometric measurements of the Au sample. Theoretical calculations performed showed that using the developed NF-LA-ICP-MS arrangement a detection efficiency of 2. 7 x 10 (- 5) cps per ablated Au atom can be achieved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceA Veil of Footsteps. Memoir of a Nomadic Fictional Character, by South African-born {{writer and}} painter Breyten Breytenbach, is {{composed}} of short texts ranging in length from one to around ten pages. The work, published in 2008, may be read as the travel notes of a nomadic writer and painter. Cyclical journeys to Paris, Spain, Gorée Island {{off the coast of}} Senegal, South Africa and New York are described. The texts correspond to an outer reality, or truth, as ever since Breytenbach was released from apartheid’s prisons in 1982, he has indeed led a nomadic life, living and working in one place for no longer than a few months, before moving on. Yet the reader becomes aware very early on that the places described in what he calls his “black book of impressions” (AVF 31) correspond to an outer and an inner reality. In places the biographical is fictionalized, and the name the I-narrator gives himself, Breyten Wordfool, is emblematic of this in-between state. In the short text this analysis focuses on, “Paris,” the nomad’s narrative is suspended, and troubled, by the ambiguous evocation of a work of art. The work of art in question is a hand-coloured etching the I-narrator takes to be framed. This paper considers the contradictory manner in which a visually powerful text avoids describing a work of art that is nevertheless placed at its centre. I shall examine {{the manner in which the}} narrative runs circles around the etching, which remains a veritable blind spot in the text. This frustrating game of hide and seek will lead the ideal reader to turn to the extra-text, the existing etching, in order to try to determine “what this picture wants,” to borrow W. J. T. Mitchell’s expression.

6000|$|... 144. I {{shall not}} attempt, in this lecture, {{to give you}} any account {{of the use of}} the pen as a drawing instrument. That use is {{connected}} in many ways with principles both of shading and of engraving, hereafter to be examined at length. But I may generally state to you that its best employment is in giving determination to the forms in drawings washed with neutral tint; and that, in this use of it, Holbein is quite without a rival. I have therefore placed many examples of his work among your copies. It is employed for rapid study by Raphael and other masters of delineation, who, in such cases, give with it also partial indications of shadow; {{but it is not a}} proper instrument for shading, when drawings are intended to be deliberate and complete, nor do the great masters so employ it. Its virtue is the power of producing a perfectly delicate, equal, and decisive line with great rapidity; and the temptation allied with that virtue is the licentious haste, and chance-swept, instead of strictly-commanded, curvature. In the hands of very great painters it obtains, like the <b>etching</b> <b>needle,</b> qualities of exquisite charm in this free use; but all attempts at imitation of these confused and suggestive sketches must be absolutely denied to yourselves while students. You may fancy you have produced something like them with little trouble; but, be assured, it is in reality as unlike them as nonsense is unlike sense; and that, if you persist in such work, you will not only prevent your own executive progress, but you will never understand in all your lives what good painting means. Whenever you take a pen in your hand, if you cannot count every line you lay with it, and say why you make it so long and no longer, and why you drew it in that direction and no other, your work is bad. The only man who can put his pen to full speed, and yet retain command over every separate line of it, is Dürer. He has done this in the illustrations of a missal preserved at Munich, which have been fairly facsimiled; and of these I have placed several in your copying series, with some of Turner's landscape etchings, and other examples of deliberate pen work, such as will advantage you in early study. The proper use of them you will find explained in the catalogue.|$|R

Again, {{do not let}} it {{be thought}} that when I call his {{execution}} evasive, I ignore the difference between his touch, on brow or lip, and a common workman's; but the whole school of etching which he founded, (and of painting, {{so far as it}} differs from Venetian work) is inherently loose and experimental. Etching is the very refuge and mask of sentimental uncertainty, and of vigorous ignorance. If you know anything clearly, and have a firm hand, depend upon it, you will draw it clearly; you will not care to hide it among scratches and burrs. And herein is the first grand distinction between etching and engraving--that in the <b>etching</b> <b>needle</b> you have an almost irresistible temptation to a wanton speed. There is, however, no real necessity for such a distinction; an etched line may have been just as steadily drawn, and seriously meant, as an engraved one; and for the moment, waiving consideration of this distinction, and opposing Rembrandt's work, considered merely as work of the black line, to Holbein's and Dürer's, as work of the black line, I assert Rembrandt's to be inherently evasive. You cannot unite his manner with theirs; choice between them is sternly put to you, when first you touch the steel. Suppose, for instance, you have to engrave, or etch, or draw with pen and ink, a single head, and that the head is to be approximately half an inch in height more or less (there is a reason for assigning this condition respecting size, which we will examine in due time): you have it in your power to do it in one of two ways. You may lay down some twenty or thirty entirely firm and visible lines, of which every one shall be absolutely right, and do the utmost a line can do. By their curvature they shall render contour; by their thickness, shade; by their place and form, every truth of expression, and every condition of design. The head of the soldier drawing his sword, in Dürer's [...] "Cannon," [...] is about half an inch high, supposing the brow to be seen. The chin is drawn with three lines, the lower lip with two, the upper, including the shadow from the nose, with five. Three separate the cheek from the chin, giving the principal points of character. Six lines draw the cheek, and its incised traces of care; four are given to each of the eyes; one, with the outline, to the nose; three to the frown of the forehead. None of these touches could anywhere be altered--none removed, without instantly visible harm; and their result is a head as perfect in character as a portrait by Reynolds.|$|R
