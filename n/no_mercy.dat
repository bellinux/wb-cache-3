50|$|The story mode's depth {{is due in}} part to its {{branching}} storylines {{that develop}} based on the outcomes of the player's matches. In WrestleMania 2000, if the player lost a match in the career mode, the game only allowed the player to retry the match, rather than adjusting the storyline accordingly. <b>No</b> <b>Mercys</b> story mode offers branching storylines based on the outcomes of matches. The player has to actually play through each story several times and lose matches in order to achieve a 100% completion rating.|$|R

5|$|Without a {{recording}} budget, {{the band was}} forced to self-finance its debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from King's father, the band entered the studio in November 1983. The album was rushed into release, hitting shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. Show <b>No</b> <b>Mercy,</b> released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and sales of Show <b>No</b> <b>Mercy</b> eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{tracks are}} older songs, like <b>No</b> <b>Mercy's</b> [...] "Crazy and Proud" [...] which was {{originally}} released in 1987, while others tracks are recent re-recordings of previously released songs, such as Suicidal Tendencies' [...] "Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right" [...] which originally appeared on their 1987 Join the Army album.

The storyline {{continued at}} Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him. McMahon later became Angle's manager {{and was in}} his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at <b>No</b> <b>Mercy.</b> The alliance was short lived, however, as after The Rock performed his Rock Bottom maneuver on McMahon at <b>No</b> <b>Mercy,</b> Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his fault that McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time. On the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw, McMahon lost the WWF's Women's Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.|$|E

The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at <b>No</b> <b>Mercy,</b> this time in a Hell in a Cell match.

40|$|A recent {{numerical}} {{study has}} found that, contrary to conventional theoretical and experimental expectations, reversed shear plasmas are unstable primarily because the term {{proportional to the}} shear in the Mercier criterion is destabilizing. In the present study, {{the role of the}} magnetic shear, both local and global, is examined for various tokamak configurations with monotonic and non-monotonic safety factor profiles. The enhancement of the local shear due to the outward shift of the magnetic axis suggests that the latter are less susceptible to interchanges. Furthermore, by regrouping the terms in the criterion, the V" term when differentiated instead with respect to the toroidal flux, is shown to absorb the dominant shear term. <b>No</b> <b>Mercier</b> instability is found for similar profiles as in the previous study...|$|R
