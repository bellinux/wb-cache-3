2500|$|In the evenings, ABC World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> <b>with</b> David Muir, CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley, and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt are the networks' {{flagship}} news programs. After {{years of}} being largely similar, the programs have evolved to their own niches. World News emphasizes [...] "stories relevant to viewer's lives" [...] delivered in Muir's laid back style; the CBS Evening News focuses prominently on business, political, and international stories delivered in a no-nonsense style; and Nightly News takes a middlebrow, folksy approach with a balance of [...] "hard" [...] and [...] "soft" [...] stories. [...] All three shows air seven nights a week, but their titular hosts only appear on weeknights unless there is major breaking news during weekends. [...] On weekdays, the evening newscasts air at 6:30 in most Eastern Time Zone and Los Angeles stations and 5:30 local time in most other time zones.|$|E
2500|$|Springer began {{traveling}} consistently {{with the}} A4 pod (her mother's closest relatives), and distant cousins in the A5 pod. It was hoped that Springer would form {{a bond with}} a mature female who would act as a surrogate mother. The killer whale known as A51 or [...] "Nodales," [...] a 16-year-old female from the A5 pod who had no calf of her own, appeared to take that role. In August, A51 was observed following Springer and guiding her away from boats, which Dr. Barrett-Leonard described {{as a sign of}} [...] "reciprocalness in the relationship. It convinced me {{this is not just a}} case of A73 finding a placid female she's following around." [...] The bond between Springer and Nodales turned out to not be as strong as a normal mother-offspring bond in killer whales, however. Springer has since often been seen with Nawitti, a 12-year-old female from the A4 pod, and with Springer's great-aunt Yakat. Dr. John Nightingale, Director of the Vancouver Aquarium, stated on ABC World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> <b>With</b> Peter Jennings, [...] "I've been a fascinated spectator, watching these whales get used to each other and her integration into her larger family group." ...|$|E

2500|$|ABC Evening News began airing in 1953, {{hosted by}} John Charles Daly. [...] Daly {{had been a}} {{well-known}} CBS radio correspondent, though today he is best remembered as the emcee of CBS's long-running game show, What's My Line?, which he hosted while serving as ABC's anchorman. [...] Daly left ABC in 1960 and was succeeded by a frequently expanding list of successors that included John Cameron Swayze, Bill Laurence, Bill Sheehan, Ron [...] Cochran, a young Peter Jennings, and Bob Young. [...] In 1968, Frank Reynolds became anchor of the program, and it soon expanded from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. [...] A year later, Howard K. Smith joined as co-anchor, reporting from Washington. [...] In early 1971, Harry Reasoner left CBS News and replaced Reynolds as the New York anchor. [...] Reasoner became the sole anchor in 1975, and Smith provided commentaries. [...] In 1976, Barbara Walters joined the program as Reasoner's co-anchor in New York, thus becoming {{the first woman to}} serve as a regular network news anchor. (Marlene Sanders had previously served as an occasional substitute anchor). Other women who would occasionally appear in daytime and weekend anchor roles in earlier days were Pauline Frederick of ABC and NBC and Nancy Dickerson of NBC. From the early 1970s forward, females such as Lesley Stahl of CBS, Carole Simpson of ABC and Jessica Savitch of NBC began to appear in significant on-camera newscasting roles. [...] Reasoner was very unhappy with the addition of Walters, and the two did not work well together. [...] In 1978, a year after Roone Arledge became President of ABC News, the ABC Evening News was [...] succeeded by ABC World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> <b>with</b> a trio of anchors: Frank Reynolds, Peter Jennings and Max Robinson.
