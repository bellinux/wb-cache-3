5|$|In {{the downstairs}} lounge, {{a few minutes}} before the Act 2 curtain for Me and Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the {{remarkable}} conclusion to Act 1—although the audience has noticed <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual</b> ("Intermission Talk"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors ("It Feels Good"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet, where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date ("We Deserve Each Other"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out ("I'm Your Girl"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual</b> about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E
5|$|Currently, both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus are {{classified}} within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, {{argued that a}} synonymy is very probable {{in the light of}} new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original Nemegtosaurus quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the Nemegtosaurus holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and hind limb bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelous – a diagnostic feature of Opisthocoelicaudia – suggesting that both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In her first description, Borsuk-Białynicka (1977) argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual,</b> as is evident in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally different, as larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus can be formally declared synonyms.|$|E

50|$|The {{front man}} for a local rock band leaves Stephen's {{apartment}} at leisure and takes his time getting back to his band and playing their scheduled show as if <b>nothing</b> were <b>unusual.</b> This proves to be somewhat of a mistake, and the band members pay for the mistake.|$|R
50|$|On August 24, a 5-hour long severe {{thunderstorm}} hit Southern Ontario {{that evening}} which also spawned {{a pair of}} weak tornadoes, <b>nothing</b> particularly <b>unusual</b> for August, but it set records for lightning frequency, thought to be fueled by abnormally high Lake Ontario water surface temperatures due to the heat wave.|$|R
25|$|Kenji Andō's article {{concluded}} that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual</b> about Hosono's treatment, which was sensationalized to fit a 1997 article accompanying the release of a Hollywood film, and it was actually no different than that of Western male survivors such as J. Bruce Ismay.|$|E
25|$|Economist Paul Krugman {{argued the}} {{economic}} expansion during the Reagan administration was primarily {{the result of}} the business cycle and the monetary policy by Paul Volcker. Krugman argues that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual</b> about the economy under Reagan because unemployment was reducing from a high peak and that it is consistent with Keynesian economics for the economy to grow as employment increases if inflation remains low.|$|E
25|$|Video {{taken during}} {{lift-off}} of STS-107 was routinely reviewed {{two hours later}} and revealed <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual.</b> The following day, higher-resolution film that had been processed overnight revealed the foam debris striking the left wing, potentially damaging the thermal protection on the Space Shuttle. At the time, the exact location where the foam struck the wing could not be determined due to the low resolution of the tracking camera footage.|$|E

It added that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual</b> in a capital sentence being mandatory as its efficacy as a deterrent may diminish to some extent if it is not mandatory. At common law all capital sentences were mandatory, and this is still so for murder and offences against the President's person under the Penal Code.|$|E

On a small black oak table {{in the middle of the}} rich green carpet, stood a crystal ball. There was <b>nothing</b> else <b>unusual</b> about the apartment, except the absence of any pictures upon the walls, and a faint aromatic odor, as though somewhere dried weeds were being burned.|$|R
25|$|At 1:45a.m., Eddowes' {{mutilated}} {{body was}} found in the south-west corner of Mitre Square by the square's beat policeman PC Edward Watkins. Watkins said that he entered the square at 1:44 a.m, having previously been there at 1:30a.m. He called for assistance at a tea warehouse in the square, where night watchman George James Morris, who was an ex-policeman, had noticed <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual.</b> Neither had another watchman (George Clapp) at 5 Mitre Square or an off-duty policeman (Richard Pearse) at 3 Mitre Square.|$|E
25|$|Daisy Coffey, the landlord/owner, would {{testify at}} Frechette's trial that she spent most evenings during the Hellmans' stay {{furnishing}} apartment 310, which {{enabled her to}} observe {{what was happening in}} apartment 303 directly across the courtyard. On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments. The building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they saw <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual,</b> mainly due to the blinds being drawn.|$|E
25|$|Logistics. The {{fast moving}} host, like all {{military}} formations, needed supplies. These {{were provided by}} young boys, who were attached to a force and carried rations, cooking pots, sleeping mats, extra weapons, rations, and other material. Cattle were sometimes driven on the hoof as a movable larder. Again, such arrangements in the local context were probably <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual.</b> What was different was the systematisation and organisation, a pattern yielding major benefits when the Zulu were dispatched on military missions. Shaka's general ratio of logistic personnel was one herdboy to three men.|$|E

50|$|Fishing with John is a 1991 {{television}} series conceived, directed by and starring actor and musician John Lurie, which earned a cult following. On the surface, the series resembles a standard travel or fishing show: in each episode, Lurie takes a famous guest {{on a fishing}} expedition. Since Lurie has no expert knowledge of fishing, the interest is in the interaction between Lurie and his guests, {{all of whom are}} his friends. <b>Nothing</b> particularly <b>unusual</b> actually happens, but the show is edited and narrated in a way to suggest that Lurie and his guest are involved in dramatic and even supernatural adventures.|$|R
60|$|Considering all the {{circumstances}} {{with reference to}} these children shrugging their shoulders, it can hardly be doubted that they have inherited the habit from their French progenitors, although they have only one quarter French blood in their veins, and although their grandfather did not often shrug his shoulders. There is <b>nothing</b> very <b>unusual,</b> though the fact is interesting, in these children having gained by inheritance a habit during early youth, and then discontinuing it; for it is of frequent occurrence with many kinds of animals that certain characters are retained for a period by the young, and are then lost.|$|R
25|$|The {{claim of}} cloven hoof prints {{in the snow}} on January 1, 1976, was {{rejected}} by other researchers, because weather records showed {{that there had been}} no snow in Amityville on that date. Neighbors reported <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual</b> during the time that the Lutzes were living there. Police officers are depicted visiting the house in the book and 1979 film, but records showed that the Lutzes did not call the police during the period that they were living on Ocean Avenue. There was no bar in Amityville called The Witches' Brew at the time; Ronald DeFeo, Jr. was a regular customer at Henry's Bar, a short distance from 112 Ocean Avenue.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. So I had to make myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual.</b> Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E
25|$|The bombing {{occurred}} at 4:58 PM on 19 July 1992, 57 {{days after the}} bombing of Capaci, in which Borsellino's friend, anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, had been killed {{with his wife and}} police escort. The only survivor of the escort in the massacre of Via D'Amelio, Antonino Vullo, said the judge had stayed in his summer residence outside Palermo from 1:30pm to around 4:00pm, when he and the escort drove to Via D'Amelio in the Sicilian capital, where he was to meet his mother. When they arrived, Vullo and the other agents noticed <b>nothing</b> <b>unusual</b> except some parked cars. The car in which Borsellino had been travelling exploded, along with one of the escort cars, while Vullo was sitting in a third car.|$|E
