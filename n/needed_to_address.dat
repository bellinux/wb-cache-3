5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes for earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{had several}} {{issues that he}} needed to deal with {{at the time of his}} accession, which had been left behind by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a {{tendency}} towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve. Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Rome's income. Most of the money was spent on the army; he had greatly increased their pay from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year. The increased expenditures forced Caracalla to strip bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference. This shortfall left Rome in a dire fiscal situation that Macrinus <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, {{opponents have}} objected to GM crops on several grounds, {{including}} environmental concerns, whether food produced from GM crops is safe, whether GM crops are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the world's food needs, whether the foods are readily accessible to poor farmers in developing countries, and concerns {{raised by the}} fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law.|$|E
25|$|Since this {{approach}} to land ownership is unconventional, especially to Western nations, opposition political parties have used this to their advantage during elections, arguing that land ownership has to be privatized.

25|$|Making Globalization Work {{surveys the}} inequities {{of the global}} economy, and the {{mechanisms}} by which developed countries exert an excessive influence over developing nations. Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.|$|E
25|$|President of the United States Harry S. Truman {{appointed}} Phelps {{to serve}} as Governor of American Samoa, making him the first civilian governor of the islands; the previous governors had been naval officers. He began his term on February 23, 1951. Phelps immediately <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the failing economy of American Samoa, caused largely by {{the withdrawal of the}} United States Navy from the islands with the final naval governor. Phelps attempted to replace the lost military revenue by selling oil from storage facilities to shipping enterprises, drawing in new airlines to Pago Pago International Airport, and encouraging larger copra crop yields.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Norwegian {{sociologist}} Johan Galtung first {{created the}} term peacebuilding through his promotion of systems {{that would create}} sustainable peace. Such systems <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> {{the root causes of}} conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution. Galtung's work emphasized a bottom-up approach that decentralized social and economic structures, amounting to a call for a societal shift from structures of coercion and violence to a culture of peace. American sociologist John Paul Lederach proposed a different concept of peacebuilding as engaging grassroots, local, NGO, international and other actors to create a sustainable peace process. He does not advocate the same degree of structural change as Galtung.|$|E

25|$|Many {{respondents}} who {{never used the}} library cited embarrassment or {{lack of knowledge about}} available information as reasons. Even those that did frequent the library often said that they were too embarrassed to ask for help; many expected shocked reactions or outright homophobia from librarians. Some common complaints about library collections from those who did use them were that information was negative, outdated or difficult to find. Whitt concluded that more staff training was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> these perceptions. She also found that those {{respondents who}} regularly used a college or university library had a more positive experience finding needed information than those who used only the public library.|$|E
500|$|In mid-June Rockwell sketched in {{charcoal}} the Four Freedoms {{and sought}} commission from the Office of War Information (OWI). He was rebuffed by an official who said, [...] "The last war, you illustrators did the posters. This war, we're {{going to use}} fine arts men, real artists." [...] However, Saturday Evening Post editor, Ben Hibbs, recognized {{the potential of the}} set and encouraged Rockwell to produce them right away. By early fall, the authors for the Four Freedoms had submitted their essays. Rockwell was concerned that Freedom from Want [...] did not match Bulosan's text. [...] In mid-November, Hibbs wrote Rockwell pleading that he not scrap his third work to start over. Hibbs alleviated Rockwell's thematic concern; he explained that the illustrations only <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the same topic rather than be in unison. Hibbs pressured Rockwell into completing his work by warning him that the magazine {{was on the verge of}} being compelled by the government to place restrictions on four-color printing, so Rockwell had better get the work published before relegation to halftone printing.|$|E
500|$|The {{editorial}} ad– a Neiman-Marcus tradition {{introduced by}} his father in the store's early days– both defended the city against outside critiques and offered more intimate criticisms from one who knew the town and its people well. The message said that Dallas <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> four areas for community improvement: one, its slum problem; two, its political extremism (called [...] "absolutism" [...] in the text); three, {{too much attention to}} physical growth at the expense of [...] "quality" [...] in civic endeavors such as [...] "schools, colleges, symphonies, operas, and museums"; and four, a need to focus less on [...] "civic image" [...] and more on [...] "doing good things and not doing bad things", which he described as [...] "the best public relations." [...] In a 2003 article on the 40th anniversary of the assassination, Ralph Blumenthal of The New York Times praised the message as [...] "strik a perfect balance", though he notes the author met not only with support from some, but from canceled accounts and [...] "anti-Semitic attacks" [...] that only increased after an article in Life referenced Marcus's Jewish heritage.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Brian Howard of The Journal News {{described it}} as [...] "classic Office" [...] and praised the camaraderie the staff showed {{for each other and}} the [...] "bizarre discomfort" [...] of the double date with Jim, Pam, Phyllis and Bob. Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: [...] "The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, {{and for the most part}} so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even without a lot of memorable jokes." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as [...] "familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments." [...] Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> why Pam was staying with the company: [...] "Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show – but there really isn't a very good reason as to why these two would still be at this dead end job." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nash, Labour's third prime minister, {{took office}} in late 1957. Upon coming to power, Labour decided that drastic {{measures}} were <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> balance of payments concerns. This resulted in the (in)famous [...] "Black Budget" [...] of Arnold Nordmeyer, the new Minister of Finance. The budget raised taxes, particularly on alcohol and cigarettes, and was highly unpopular. It is widely thought to have doomed the party to defeat despite the economy having rejuvenated less than 1 year after the black budget. In the 1960 election, the National Party was indeed victorious.|$|E

Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite {{the growing popularity of}} middleware and pre-built game engines. [...] In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.|$|E
