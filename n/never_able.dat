She was married several times (making many of the {{proposals}} herself) but none of these unions lasted. As well as Shen Defu, her husbands included General Li Hualong, art critic Li Rihua and, in later life, an unnamed (but wealthy) merchant from Suzhou. Although she wanted children, she was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to have any.|$|E
5|$|British {{military}} leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, suffered a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> {{to live up to}} Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
5|$|Considered washed-up, the 34-year-old Tittle {{was traded}} to the Giants {{following}} the 1960 season. Over the next four seasons, he won multiple NFL MVP awards, twice set the league single-season record for touchdown passes, and led the Giants to three straight NFL championship games. Although he was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to deliver a championship to the team, Tittle's time in New York is regarded among the glory years of the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{assistance}} from his friends, he was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> {{to secure a}} permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum.

5|$|In 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services, the Australian Army's {{most senior}} medical officer, with {{the rank of}} major general.

5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> {{to exploit}} his gifts {{when he went}} out on his own. His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into a major force, but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't {{live long enough to}} find himself again.|$|E

However, after the first loss at home, the Mariners were able to win seven {{consecutive}} matches at Topper Stadium. Despite this home ground record, Mariners were <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to win away from home. They lost all nine matches played away from their stadium, and subsequently missed out on the finals for the Super League season.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to recover.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E

5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to America in 1924 {{to appear in}} The Passing Show of 1924 which ran for four months beginning in September. Also in this timeframe he became a featured attraction with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and toured London, Brussels and Berlin. It was during an engagement at the London Palladium that Barbette was found engaged in sexual activity with another man. His contract was cancelled and he was <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to obtain a work permit for England again.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues.

Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation {{at a time when}} some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
