5|$|The Annals of the Cakchiquels, an {{indigenous}} document from the Guatemalan Highlands, contains {{an account of}} Pedro de Alvarado's initial incursion into El Salvador. Pedro de Alvarado wrote four letters to Hernán Cortés describing his conquest of Guatemala and El Salvador, of which two survive. One of these relates his expedition into El Salvador, {{with an eye to}} military detail. It is of particular use in its description of tactics and weaponry, although it is disdainful of the <b>native</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{part of the}} Sierra Nevada {{where the}} park is located was long {{considered}} to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of <b>native</b> <b>culture</b> became a policy of the United States Government.|$|E

He notes with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children were faced {{with a sense of}} disgust, in De Stem des Bloeds an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman.|$|E
5|$|Francis Parkman, an American {{historian}} {{who was one}} of the first to write about natives within the colonial historical narrative, argues that the Iroquois wars “were products of an ‘insensate fury’ and ‘mad ambition’". He said that the Iroquois waged wars due to the extinction of the beaver, their growing dependence on European goods, and resentment at the extermination of <b>native</b> <b>culture.</b> Parkman argues that the Iroquois had become so dependent on European goods that they needed these items in order to survive. In his research, Parkman had no evidence to support his claims. He assumed that the natives’ culture was inferior to the British-American, and overlooked potential reasons for the Iroquois attacks. Parkman’s interpretation neglected to explain why the Iroquois had waged war against other native groups as well. Parkman’s view would later on be dismissed due to its ethnocentric interpretation of the events.|$|E
5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of <b>Native</b> <b>culture</b> by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{effects of}} the coast trade on the native peoples of the Northwest {{included}} waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. Other health problems included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and sterility. The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. The overall number of slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these negative effects, the North West Coast natives were largely spared the additional effects that would have come had there been more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, <b>native</b> <b>culture</b> not only survived but flourished.|$|E
5|$|The 167 Bikini {{residents}} who {{were moved to}} the Rongerik Atoll prior to the Crossroads tests were unable to gather sufficient food or catch enough fish and shellfish to feed themselves in their new environment. The Navy left food and water {{for a few weeks}} and then failed to return in a timely manner. By January 1947, visitors to Rongerik reported the islanders were suffering malnutrition, facing potential starvation by July, and were emaciated by January 1948. In March 1948 they were evacuated to Kwajalein, and then settled onto another uninhabited island, Kili, in November. With only one third of a square mile, Kili has one sixth the land area of Bikini and, more important, has no lagoon and no protected harbor. Unable to practice their <b>native</b> <b>culture</b> of lagoon fishing, they became dependent on food shipments. Their four thousand descendants today are living on several islands and in foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|Further {{social changes}} {{brought about by}} the {{presence}} of American military personnel were exemplified in the storm's wake. The use of currency as a means for obtaining goods was first seen in Ulithi in 1956, four years before the typhoon. However, despite the total destruction of markets by Ophelia they were quickly rebuilt, depicting the quick entrenchment of currency in <b>native</b> <b>culture.</b> The reconstruction also accelerated a desire for new goods from trading. Store owners requested a wider range of material to have in stock than seen previously. From a societal standpoint, Ophelia prompted great advances in the Ulithian culture. Women, previously limited to agriculture, housework, and eventually shopping, were found to be doing heavy work (i.e. carpentry, chopping, digging, and lifting) in the immediate wake of the typhoon. A shift in government took place as well, with authority of King Malefich waning to greater power among younger individuals. Malefich also displayed great ineptitude during the storm and was subsequently disposed of as King following Ophelia's passage. The changes in authority occurred due to spontaneous leadership during the storm by the younger persons in order to protect others. Prior to the typhoon, younger members of tribes never spoke during council meetings; however, by 1961 they made their presence known in such meetings.|$|E

Stereotyped issues include simplistic characterizations, romanticizing of <b>Native</b> <b>culture</b> and stereotyping by omission—showing American Indians in a historical rather than modern context.|$|E
