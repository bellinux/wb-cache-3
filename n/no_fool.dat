25|$|Thomson {{attacked}} Whitehouse's contention in {{a letter}} to the popular Athenaeum magazine, pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. However, he thought Whitehouse <b>no</b> <b>fool</b> and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had, however, caught the eye of the project's undertakers and in December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.|$|E
25|$|Although Armin {{typically}} played these intelligent clown roles, it {{has been}} suggested by a few scholars that he originated the role of Iago in Othello, on the grounds that Iago sings two drinking songs (most of the songs in Shakespeare's plays from 1600 to 1610 were sung by Armin's characters) and that this was the sole play between As You Like It and Timon of Athens that has <b>no</b> <b>fool</b> or clown for Armin to play.|$|E

500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened. As Hoxha recalled, [...] "In his speech Khrushchev {{expressed}} the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, {{as well as}} those who were going to follow these parties, but without mentioning any names... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate." [...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was <b>no</b> <b>fool.</b> He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which was the subject of a Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{journal entry}} for October 28, 1949, expresses {{his belief that}} work {{dedicated}} to Jesus {{was more important than}} his life (see Luke 9:24. [...] "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.") He wrote, [...] "he is <b>no</b> <b>fool</b> who gives what he cannot keep [...] to gain that which he cannot lose." [...] He follows the journal entry with a citation from Luke 16:9 ("that when it shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations".)

2500|$|... "Jack and Pearl are not criminals. They're not angels either. Villains perhaps? Well, he {{certainly}} is. They've {{been married for}} fifteen years, and haven't had sex {{with each other for}} thirteen of them. The marriage is a front {{for the sake of the}} pub's image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted - maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too - Prince - an Alsatian...Pearl met Jack at school, and they were sweethearts from the word go. Money and things are what interest her. Jack didn't give her these fast enough in the early stages of their marriage, which is partly why it turned sour. It also went wrong because of sex: he just didn't turn her on...or didn't turn her on enough. And she never stops reminding him of how much of a man he isn't. She is basically a scrubber, trying to reform herself. [...] "Nobody turns me on like Jack" [...] she says loudly in public, [...] "I can't make it with another man." [...] But she does, often...Class is what Pearl wants, and something she'll never pull off. Yes, she's attractive. She's also flash...Pearly the worker is <b>no</b> <b>fool.</b> She can keep two sets of books with the best of them, hire with skill and fire without mercy. Sexual innuendo is the key to her character. The wink. The tease..."Have you seen the Honda 750? Take me for a ride any time!"...Her pub is spotless. And the customer's always right. Except when he isn't. Then she can be so polite, he'll wish he'd gone to a wine-bar...Sometimes Pearl gets so legless that Jack has to throw her over his shoulder and fireman's lift her upstairs to their flat, where they have separate bedrooms...She's fun, she tries and she's trapped. She's also larger than life." [...] (page 63) ...|$|E
