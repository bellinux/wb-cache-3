Background concentrations of nitrate in different aquifers vary depending on geological formations and current and past vegetation cover (ECETOC 1988; Foster et al. 1999; West 2001; Limbrick 2003; Wendland et al. 2005). Natural sources of nitrate in the groundwater include leaching and oxidation of nitrogenous compounds incorporated in rocks (Holloway and Dahlgren 2002) and fixation by leguminous plants and microorganisms (Edmunds and Smedley 1996). According to Holloway and Dahlgren (2002), rock <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compound</b> concentrations range from trace levels to above 200  mg-N/kg in granites and may exceed 1, 000  mg-N/kg in some sedimentary and meta-sedimentary rocks. In many aquifers, background concentration of nitrate is less than 1  mg/l (West 2001; Wendland et al. 2005). However, due to variation in geochemical and historical vegetation cover, higher background concentrations have been reported elsewhere (Burkart and Kolpin 1993; Eckhardt and Stackelberg 1995; Mueller 1995; Foster et al. 1999; Limbrick 2003).

30|$|The {{nitrogen}} use efficiency (NUE) by the wetland vegetable crops {{could conceivably}} limit {{the loss of}} N from applied manure through gaseous emissions of N 2 O from soil. N is often cited as a limiting factor for vegetable growth in sub-tropical Africa.

The differences between dry matter and uptake of N by the crops subjected to single basal applications and those receiving split applications of manure was smaller {{at the end of the}} experiment. This trend in the uptake of N by the crops is attributable to the initial abundance of N-rich easily decomposable organic compounds in the manure in plots that received single applications of cattle manure in four cropping events.

Populations inhabiting highly polluted aquatic habitats marginally showed higher activity level than the populations from less polluted environments, especially when larvae were exposed to ammonium or when nitrite appeared in combination with other nitrogen forms. Levels of activity correlated positively with larval final mass. Moreover, for similar levels of activity, larvae from polluted populations had higher growth rates than those coming from reference populations which suggests interdemic differences in behavioral sensitivity to nitrogenous pollutants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
