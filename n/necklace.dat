5|$|A {{gift from}} King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, it is a fringe <b>necklace</b> {{in design and}} set with {{brilliant}} and baguette cut diamonds. King Faisal bought the <b>necklace,</b> made by the American jeweller Harry Winston, and presented it to her while on a state visit to the United Kingdom in 1967.

Vimala, upset at losing her <b>necklace,</b> searches the house for it. When Raju, Sundaram, Gowri, and Sathyamurthy return after attending a conference in Kodaikanal, Vimala, acting on Rathnam's provocation, orders that Sathyamurthy's suitcase is searched. When the <b>necklace</b> is found in it, Raju throws Sathyamurthy out of his house, despite Sathyamurthy proclaiming his innocence. Gowri then shows Parvathi's photograph to Raju, who is shocked to learn that Sathyamurthy is his own son. Raju reveals the truth about Parvathi to Vimala, who also accepts Sathyamurthy as her son. Before Raju and Vimala rush to bring Sathyamurthy back, Raju learns of a fire breaking out in one of his mills. Sathyamurthy, unhappy of being wrongly accused by Raju, attempts suicide by entering the burning mill. Raju saves Sathyamurthy in time and reveals the truth about his birth to him.

5|$|Like the Coronation <b>Necklace,</b> these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller one, with a large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings and matching <b>necklace</b> in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E

A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain, to the field where Scully was abducted. Seemingly alone without her, he looks up into the stars.|$|E
5|$|The Brazil Parure {{is one of}} {{the newest}} items of {{jewellery}} in the collection. In 1953, the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a <b>necklace</b> and matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds. It had taken the jewellers Mappin & Webb an entire year to collect the perfectly matched stones. The <b>necklace</b> has nine large oblong aquamarines with an even bigger aquamarine pendant drop. The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable. She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a tiara made to match the <b>necklace.</b> The tiara is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines. Seeing that the Queen had so liked the original Coronation gift that she had a matching tiara made, the Government of Brazil decided to add to its gift, and in 1958 it presented Elizabeth II with a bracelet of oblong aquamarines set in a cluster of diamonds, and a square aquamarine and diamond brooch.|$|E

5|$|The George VI Victorian Suite was {{originally}} a wedding present by George VI {{to his daughter}} Elizabeth in 1947. The suite consists of a long <b>necklace</b> of oblong sapphires and diamonds {{and a pair of}} matching square sapphire earrings also bordered with diamonds. The suite {{was originally}} made in 1850. The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter, although this may have been a coincidence on George's part. Elizabeth had the <b>necklace</b> shortened by removing the biggest sapphire in 1952, and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone. In 1963, a new sapphire and diamond tiara and bracelet were made to match the original pieces. The tiara is made out of a <b>necklace</b> that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium, daughter of Leopold II. In 1969, the Queen wore the complete parure to a charity concert.|$|E

5|$|The stylized {{treatment}} {{of her hair}} could represent a ceremonial wig. She wears a single broad <b>necklace,</b> composed of squares that are structured with horizontal and vertical lines, possibly depicting beads, four to each square. This <b>necklace</b> is virtually identical to the <b>necklace</b> of the god found at Ur, except that the latter's <b>necklace</b> has three lines to a square. Around both wrists she wears bracelets which appear composed of three rings. Both hands are symmetrically lifted up, palms turned towards the viewer and detailed with visible life-, head- and heart lines, holding two rod-and-ring symbols of which only {{the one in the}} left hand is well preserved. Two wings with clearly defined, stylized feathers in three registers extend down from above her shoulders. The feathers in the top register are shown as overlapping scales (coverts), the lower two registers have long, staggered flight feathers that appear drawn with a ruler and end in a convex trailing edge. The feathers have smooth surfaces; no barbs were drawn. The wings are similar but not entirely symmetrical, differing both in the number of the flight feathers and in the details of the coloring scheme.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Some {{constraint}} {{problems have}} a combinatorial structure where the constraints allow {{the sequence of}} variables to be rotated (<b>necklaces),</b> if not also the domain values to be permuted (unlabelled <b>necklaces),</b> without getting an essentially different solution. We bring together the fields of combinatorial enumeration, where efficient algorithms have been designed for (special cases of) some of these combinatorial objects, and constraint programming, where the requisite symmetry breaking has at best been done statically so far. We design the first search procedure and identify the first symmetrybreaking constraints for the general case of unlabelled <b>necklaces.</b> Further, we compare dynamic and static symmetry breaking on reallife scheduling problems featuring (unlabelled) <b>necklaces.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|A flint dagger was {{discovered}} on the site. This type of artefact {{is rare in}} Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth. Its presence has been taken as an indication that during the Bronze Age the site was used for funerary practices. Many of the hills near Mellor are surmounted by Bronze Age funerary monuments such as Brown Low, Shaw Cairn, and Werneth Low, supporting the possibility that Mellor was also a funerary site. Also dating from the Bronze Age and found on the site was a rare high-status amber <b>necklace.</b> Amber does not occur naturally in Britain the nearest source is the Baltic.

40|$|This work {{originates}} from a combinatorial {{understanding of}} a branching property of MSS (Metropolis-Stein-Stein) sequences in symbolic dynamics.

We present a branching property of primitive self-complementary <b>necklaces,</b> leading to a combinatorial ex-planation of an analogous property of MSS sequences.
