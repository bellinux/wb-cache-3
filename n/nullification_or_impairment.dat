The key to understanding the provision resides in the acknowledgment that the concept of <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> can be understood in two different senses depending on the stage in the proceedings at which it is relevant. While there is an isolated indication that the Appellate Body is edging closer to a re-interpretation of the provision, it is suggested that the dispute settlement process could be modestly simplified with some amendments to the DSU.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the suspension of concessions or other obligations in the World Trade Organization (WTO), specifically with how the arbitrators have understood this suspension, how they have interpreted the respective legal norms and how they have argued to set the level of suspension. The first chapter contains an introduction. The second chapter discusses the main objectives of suspending WTO concessions or other obligations, especially to induce compliance and to rebalance concessions. The former means creating incentives to bring the complaining party {{to comply with the}} recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The latter means restoring the balance between the parties' concessions that was upset by the complainant. This dissertation offers a three level approach that allows {{a better understanding of how}} these two objectives work. Chapter three {{deals with the}} level of <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment,</b> and especially with the definition of <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment,</b> the presumption contained in Art. 3. 8 DSU, the burden of proof and pass through estimations. The fourth chapter addresses the suspension of concessions or other obligations, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The focal point lies on defining the suspension of concessions or other obligations, punitive sanctions, carousel sanctions, diachronically variable suspension levels, cross retaliation, standing, the right to suspend concessions or other obligations, and transferring the suspension potential. Chapter five analyses WTO decisions, reports and awards concerning the suspension of concessions or other obligations. The results are systematised according to the three yardsticks that define the relation between the level of <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> and the level of suspension of concessions or other obligations: equivalence (Art. 22. 4 DSU), appropriateness (Art. 4. 10 and 4. 11 SCM Agreement), and commensurateness (Art. 7. 9 and 7. 10 SCM Agreement).

40|$|The {{obligations}} {{deriving from}} {{participation in the}} World Trade Organization are never inherently indivisible or erga omnes in the sense elaborated by the International Court of Justice {{in the field of}} human rights. As a rule, remedies for violations of WTO obligations remain available only to the Member(s) whose international trade interests have been affected, in actual or potential terms. Nonetheless, contracting parties have decided to extend to a limited number of WTO obligations the legal regime of indivisible obligation and to consider immaterial for the purpose of resorting to the dispute settlement system the effects of their violations. WTO obligations, therefore, are not a monolithic bloc. They may be divided into two categories which are governed by different rules as far as legal standing and counter-measures are concerned. Depending on whether the obligation allegedly breached belongs to one or the other category, the <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> of benefits is presumed – but can be challenged – under Article 3 (8) of the DSU or is entirely irrelevant. Furthermore, countermeasures are normally proportionate or equivalent to the <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> of the benefits of the complainant. In the case of WTO obligations treated as indivisible obligations, however, the effects of the violation are immaterial and the trade interests of the complainant may well be unaffected. As a result, counter-measures are to be permitted {{to the extent that they}} will effectively ensure compliance.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rationale for}} the rules on domestic subsidies in international trade agreements through a framework that emphasizes commitment. We build a model where the policy-maker has a tariff and a production subsidy at its disposal, taxation can be distortionary and the import-competing sector lobbies the government for favorable policies. The model shows that, under political pressures, the government will turn to subsidies when its ability to provide protection is curtailed by a trade agreement that binds tariffs only (policy substitution problem). When the factors of production are mobile in the long-run, but the investments are irreversible in the short-run, the government cannot credibly commit vis-à-vis the domestic lobby unless the trade agreement regulates production subsidies in addition to tariffs (policy credibility problem). We employ the theory to analyze the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement within the WTO system. We show that WTO rules on <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> solves the policy substitution problem, while serious prejudice rules can address the policy credibility problem in sectors with tariff commitments...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} the WTO security exception, {{with a particular}} focus on State practice. In {{the absence of any}} GATT or WTO jurisprudence, State practice affords the best vehicle to understand the meaning of Article XXI. In the few instances when invocation of the security exception has been challenged, State practice suggests that the security exception is not judicially reviewable. A critical question emerges from this analysis of State practice. If a Member State can avoid WTO obligations through a self-judging security exception, what is to prevent bad faith invocations? The WTO regime includes a number of devices to address this concern, including opting out of normal trade relations, opting in to deeper trade relations, granting preferential treatment to developing countries consistent with security interests, and protecting against the <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> of Member States’ legitimate expectations {{even in the absence of}} a WTO violation. These arrangements provide broad discretion to act in furtherance of the national interest without violating trade rules. As such, Member States quite often can advance national objectives without the need to invoke the security exception. Notwithstanding these mitigating factors, a self-judging security exception poses grave risks. If abused, it could undermine the entire WTO regime. But the practice of WTO Member States is to invoke the security exception in good faith, with a margin of discretion. A Member State may do so because of a fear of sanction, out of a sense of norm legitimacy, or because it is in its self-interest to do so. The Article concludes with brief reflections on why nations comply with the good faith obligation of a self-judging exception. Compliance with a self-judging rule offers useful insights into larger questions of why nations obey international law. Rational choice and normative theories best explain compliance with a self-judging international norm...|$|E
40|$|WTO dispute {{settlement}} procedures have been praised for their effectiveness, but recently {{there have been}} significant examples of Members failing to observe, or delaying implementation of, rulings and recommendations issued by the Dispute Settlement Bodies to rectify violations of the WTO Agreement. This issue has arisen particularly {{in cases where the}} U. S. has been challenged its "law as such" violations, in other words cases claiming that a country's domestic law or regulation in itself constitutes a violation of the WTO Agreement. These cases include those won by Japan against the U. S., and this implementation problem is becoming a pressing trade policy issue. Given special-interest politics and the "sectionalism" of the compartmentalized committee system in the U. S. Congress, it is desirable that procedures to ensure compliance be structured to encourage the Congress to promptly implement rulings by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). However, the current DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding) and its operation in cases involving "law as such" are not necessarily conducive to this goal. First, when a reasonable period of time (RPT) for compliance is determined, the complained party is allowed a broad degree of discretion in selecting the measure to comply with the recommendation, and there is no guarantee of the shortest possible RPT enabling appropriate implementation. Second, while financial compensation imposes a broad-based fiscal burden on the concerned citizens of the complained party, continuation of the violation benefits special interest groups and circumvents pressure to comply with the DSB ruling. Third, under existing practice, the level of <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> for determining suspensions of concessions (countermeasures) is calculated on the basis of actual trade loss created by the violation in question, excluding the chilling effects on trade. In the few examples where the rules on contravention of the WTO agreement have been applied, the suspension of concessions allowed has not been sufficient to cover this loss. It would be possible to partially resolve some of these issues by making some changes to the interpretation or application of the existing rules, but the agreement needs to be amended, particularly regarding the calculation of the level of suspension of concessions. However, this issue has not been dealt with adequately in the proposals submitted to the DSU negotiations in the Doha Round. ...|$|E
40|$|A little-noticed {{provision}} of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement {{could prove to be}} a nasty surprise, write Thomas Faunce and Buddhima Lokuge HIDDEN {{at the back of the}} 1000 -page Australia-US Free Trade Agreement is a strange article, numbered 21. 2 (c). Usually, in a legal document such as a treaty, dispute proceedings only arise if a party has breached a formal obligation in the text. This unusual provision changes all that. It is called a ‘non-violation <b>nullification</b> <b>or</b> <b>impairment</b> of benefits’, or NVNB, clause. It is one of the most contentious and despised provisions in international trade law, symbolising for many the extent to which the World Trade Organisation disputes process has been captured by corporate multinationals. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade plain english guide to this NVNB article explains that it permits dispute procedures where the actions of a party, ‘while complying with the strict letter of the agreement’, go against its ‘spirit’ and the legitimate expectations of the other government. What this guide to the NVNB article fails to mention, however, is that those chapters of the Australia-US FTA most fraught with danger for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are specifically included within its scope. Directly mentioned, for example, are chapters two (which includes Annex 2 C on Pharmaceuticals and a side letter on the PBS) and chapter 17 (which includes the ‘evergreening’ drugs patent clause that spurred recent Australian legislative amendments). A handful of dispute panel cases exist concerning a similar NVNB provision under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. These emphasise that NVNB is really a supercharged mechanism of commercially focused treaty interpretation. The so-called Japan Film Case in 1998, for example, established that for one party to succeed in an NVNB claim, it had to prove to the relevant dispute resolution panel that it couldn’t have reasonably anticipated the domestic legislation that nullified its ‘legitimate expectations’. Developing nations, in particular, have resisted the introduction of NVNB articles into the Convention on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights - TRIPS - because it would chiefly support the commercial expectations of dominant US and European corporations, not the rule of law or principles of social justice. At the behest of developing nations, a moratorium has been placed on NVNB actions under TRIPS. The Deputy US Trade Representative has repeatedly identified Australia-US FTA commitments as a means to pursue the legislated US agenda of ‘eliminating’ the PBS mechanism, which establishes the price for a medicine by reference to its overall community value when measured against cheap generic competitors. To this end, the new Australia-US FTA interpretive principles on pharmaceuticals suggest that the relevant ‘spirit’ of that treaty chiefly emphasises reward of pharmaceutical ‘innovation’ and ‘research and development’ concepts that conflict with universal access to affordable, essential medicines, the basic principle of our PBS. Dispute resolution proceedings will inevitably arise over the FTA, particularly in relation to those 50 or so references to pharmaceuticals in its text. They may well arise under the NVNB article, over the issue of whether the recent amendments, put forward by Labor and directed against brand-name drug patent evergreening breach the ‘legitimate expectations’ of the US under the AUSFTA. The US has already stated that such amendments may breach article 27. 1 of TRIPS, which prohibits ‘discrimination’ as to the field of technology (in this case, pharmaceuticals). The latter argument can, with careful advocacy, be quite properly disposed of. The WTO Canada-Generic Pharmaceuticals Case established that article 27. 1 of TRIPS does not prevent a country from dealing in good faith with problems (such as ‘evergreening’ of brand name medicine patents) that only exist in certain product areas. In relation to the first argument, however, it should be remembered that the current PBS amendments only cover an important, but very narrow area of problems for the PBS under the Australia-US FTA. If, before ratification of this treaty, Australia also puts on record a unilateral declaration of its already stated interpretations of the many other contentious articles related to the PBS, it will have, without in any way interfering with the legal force of the treaty, clarified in the national interest what should be the enforceable ‘legitimate expectations’ of the US concerning the PBS. This may have a significant bearing on its capacity to withstand dispute settlement pressure under the AUSFTA and ensure that low pharmaceutical prices continue in this country.
