40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the season and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> on average milk production and persistence of lactation. Fifty hundred and ninety one lactation of buffaloes, milked once a day and bred on pasture conditions were analyzed. The animals were allocated according season (off breeding season = Goff and breeding season = Gon) and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> (first = FC, second = SC and more than two calving = MC). Data was analyzed by ANOVA. Average milk production was higher on Gon than Goff, and the persistence of lactation was short on Gon than Goff. FC showed lower average milk production than SC and MC that did not differing about. The persistence of lactation was similar among FC, SC and MC. The results showed that on pasture condition, calving on off breeding season results in lower average milk production but in higher persistence of lactation. It is possible that, buffaloes during the off breeding season had higher disposability of pasture that guarantee higher persistence of lactation and buffaloes on breeding season calved with better corporal condition that guarantee higher average milk production. The lower average milk production of first calving buffaloes was according to the expected...|$|E

The combination of these traits resulted in the bioeconomic maternal revenue index (RMat) ensures reproductive efficiency. The index estimates the return in kilograms of live weight produced per cow per year. In addition, the composition of calf weight produced was considered, adding to the PM the information on the scores of conformation, muscling and early finishing at weaning, in order to input the calf biotype. The females considered precocious had their age at first calving before 30 months. The NP was expressed by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> till 53 months of age. The CM was calculated according to the estimated feed intake of dry matter. The estimated average RMat was 62. 02 ± 24. 12 kg/ cow/year.

The animals were fed (16 kg dry matter (DM) /head) two isoenergy/isoprotein diets (NE 1 : 6. 39 MJ/kg DM; 15. 4 CP% DM), composed of corn (diet M) or barley silage (diet O) concentrate, alfalfa hay, and a vitamin-mineral supplement. The fermentation characteristics of both silage diets were evaluated by an in vitro gas production technique, and their nutritional values were calculated as follows: NE 1 (MJ/kg DM) = 0. 54 + 0. 0959 GP + 0. 0038 CP + 0. 0001733 CP 2, where GP is the gas production after 24 h of incubation (ml/ 200 mg DM) and CP is the protein content of silage (g/kg DM). The nutritional values of the silages were slightly different (4. 16 vs. 4. 14 MJ/kg DM for M and O, respectively) likely due to the high content of hemicellulose in the O diet (22. 0 vs. 16. 9 %).

The observed period included the years 2010 till 2014. The evaluation concerns 36 heads of purebred breeding-cows and 70 heads of claves in total in the observed period. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving,</b> the age of breeding-cows at the first calving, the length of mean-time, difficulties of birth delivery, and reasons for elimination from the herd were recorded for every breeding-cow. Regarding the calves, their live weigh at the birth, at the age of 120 and 210 days were recorded. The set of the calves was categorised according to the year of birth, sex, the month of birth, the way of breeding, individuality of bull, and the order of birth. The data were statistically analysed using MS Excel and the programme STATISTICA 12 by StatSoft. The average mean-time, considering the whole herd, was 389. 4 days. The breeding-cows were, at the first calving, 1. 090, 4 days (i. e. 36. 3 months) old on average. The ratio of easy birth deliveries was 98. 75 %. The average live weight, regardless the sex of the calves, was 36. 66 kg. At the age of 120 days, the calves weighed 170. 44 kg and 273. 20 kg at the age of 210 days.

Four commercial Saskatchewan ranches with 7 breeding groups collaborated in this study, where all potential sires and progeny were sampled to determine the sire of each calf. Expected vs observed calf {{data were analyzed using}} Chi-square analysis. In all but 2 of the 7 breeding groups, it was determined that each bull sired a different (P< 0. 01) <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves.</b> Age <b>of</b> sire was found to effect (P< 0. 01) bull prolificacy or <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> sired. A bull prolificacy index (BPI) was developed to compare which bulls are siring more or less than expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> progeny. All bulls were required to pass a breeding soundness exam (BSE) before breeding season, therefore weak correlations were found between scrotal circumference (R 2 = 0. 04) or percent normal sperm (R 2 = 0. 13) and BPI values. No sire match ranged from 2 - 7 % <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> tested. Testing only calves born in the 3 rd week <b>of</b> <b>calving,</b> indicated that bulls could be assigned accurately to high or low prolificacy categories, but bulls with the fewest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> sired could not be detected. Economic models were developed to evaluate the value of adopting parentage testing on farm using a cost benefit analysis. The model showed bulls that sired more calves had a lower cost per calf sired. Based on the model, if bulls were siring < 25 calves it would be more economical to use AI in the breeding program. The model also determined that if one bull was causing increased dystocia rates in a herd, testing calves from difficult births to cull responsible bulls did provide an economic return on investment to the operation.

The animal health issues that were of concern for livestock owners are also identified. Study households were selected using a stratified, two-stage cluster design. Districts (dzongkhags) formed the strata. Villages within dzongkhags were the first sampling stage and households within villages the second sampling stage. All cattle within each selected household comprised the study population. Questionnaires were collected from 409 households with 1480 standing cattle. A total of 71. 0 % (95 % CI 67. 9 %- 74. 1 %) of the standing cattle population were female and the median age of cattle was 5 years (Q 25 3 years; Q 75 7 years). Exotic breeds of cattle (Jerseys, Brown Swiss, and their crosses) comprised 41. 4 % of the cattle population with local breeds making up the remainder. Although exotic breeds of cattle had a significantly lower age at first calving (median 4 years) compared to local breeds (median 4. 8 years) {{there was no significant difference}} in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> events per cow for the two breed groups.

The most frequently cited cause of death was misadventure (proportional mortality 26. 2 %, 95 % CI 15. 7 %- 39. 2 %) followed by old age (17. 8 %, 95 % CI 9. 5 %- 29. 4 %). A lack of access to adequate fodder and pasture was the animal health issue that was cited by interviewees most frequently. We provide no evidence that exotic breeds of cattle have superior reproductive performance compared with local breeds. The major cattle health concern cited by interviewees, lack of access to fodder, is likely to contribute to suboptimal productivity and the relatively high incidence of bovine enzootic haematuria in this population.

40|$|Tasman Glacier {{time-lapse}} (Oct 2011 -Nov 2012) {{video clip}} (. avi file) available with hard copy in the libraryIceberg calving is an efficient ablation process which introduces mechanical instability to glacier systems {{and can cause}} a non–linear climatic response. This thesis quantifies the calving retreat of the freshwater–terminating Tasman Glacier and the coeval expansion of Tasman Lake, at a range of temporal and spatial scales. Tasman Glacier is the longest glacier (c. 23 km) in New Zealand, and lies east of the Main Divide of the Southern Alps, extending from a névé at 2400 m to an ice–contact lake at c. 727 m. Although 20 th century warming caused down–wastage, it remained at its Little Ice Age terminus until the late 20 th century. Since then, calving retreat has occurred, allowing a large proglacial lake to form. Remote sensing datasets, namely satellite imagery, time–lapse photography, and passive seismic recording were used to observe and characterise retreat and calving style and magnitude at inter–annual, sub–annual, and intra–event time–scales. Between 2000 and 2013 Tasman Glacier has retreated c. 6 km, corresponding to an average decrease in ice surface loss at the terminus of 0. 37 km 2 a- 1, {{through a combination of}} melting of the lower glacier and iceberg calving. However, an order of magnitude increase in retreat occurred since 2006 with peak retreat rates in excess of 1. 5 km 2 a- 1. This retreat has seen a continuation of accelerated ice loss since the formation of Tasman Lake in the late 1980 s. A four–stage model for the transition between melt and calving regimes refined in this study has indicated that the processes and factors that {{contribute to the development of}} a proglacial lake at the termini of debris–covered glaciers worldwide are similar, although they act over different time–scales depending on glacier dynamics and climate regimes. At a sub–annual time–scale calving events between October 2011 and November 2012 were identified at a rate of 0. 94 events d- 1, with significant seasonal differences, in that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> events increased during the ablation season. Calving events driven by thermo–erosional notching at the waterline were the most frequent of all calving events, followed by events initiated by over–steepening of the subaerial ice cliff, then sub–aqueous and buoyancy–driven calving events. Buoyancy–driven calving events were of the largest magnitude, and had the greatest effect on glacier retreat. Such events are initiated by a combination of glacier thinning, increased water–depth at the terminus, terminus geometry, subaqueous melt and calving, perturbations in lake level and near–field earthquakes. The increase in calving frequency during spring and summer 2011 / 12 was directly related to the increase in thermo–erosional notch events. Correlation of calving frequency, lake level and lake temperature time–series data reveals that the frequency changes are related to the stability in lake level and elevated lake temperatures. This indicates that although calving retreat rate has increased, low–magnitude calving events are the most frequent, but low frequency, high magnitude buoyancy–driven events have had the greatest influence on net glacier retreat. Calving events at Tasman Glacier emit seismic signals similar to those found at other calving margins globally. All calving events generated seismic signals that had emergent onsets with weak frequencies above 5 Hz, followed by a high amplitude phase with frequency content between 1 and 5 Hz and a protracted coda. The study highlighted relationships between calved iceberg size and seismic parameters (e. g., signal duration, peak amplitude and integrated amplitude) that can be used to remotely assess the frequency, style and magnitude of calving events. It was shown that seismic waveforms, signal duration, and energy indicate order–of–magnitude differences in calving event size and style. However, due to the continuum of spatial and temporal scales over which calving operates, seismic signals are generally too variable to completely substitute direct observational data. Signal analysis algorithms analogous to those used in volcano seismology have been developed for the automatic detection of iceberg calving and were thoroughly tested against independent observational datasets. The algorithms and thresholds can be readily deployed in future seismic studies of dynamic ice margins at freshwater–terminating glaciers...|$|E

Only three observed abortions were reported amongst all the cows surveyed: two among the mobile herds and one among the sedentary herds.

Finally, herd fertility crudely measured as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> on the calf rope as percentage <b>of</b> the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> animals in the herd was 13 % for sedentary herds and 26 % for mobile herds (Table 1). Because the calves on the calf rope are less than six months old, these rates are not the annual fertility rates. All the numbers reported here are within the range observed in other studies in the region (Moritz 2003; Njoya et al. 1997). In short, we found no major differences in morbidity and fertility patterns between mobile and sedentary herds (e.g. age at first calving, birth intervals), except for overall herd fertility, which is higher for mobile herds.|$|R

The study showed that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> immunized was strongly associated with the farmer's perception of the benefits of immunization. There was no association between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> immunized and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> veterinary assistants in a given district or their transport situation. Overall mortality in ECF-immunized calves from various causes stood at 4. 2 %. Based on farmers' reports, the majority of these deaths seemed to have been caused by anaplasmosis, another tick-borne disease, and might have resulted from relaxation of tick control after ECF immunization. The reasons identified by farmers for not immunizing their animals included failure by immunizing teams to reach certain areas, not having <b>calves</b> <b>of</b> immunization age, and lack of money. These findings provide valuable information on how livestock farmers perceive and adopt new animal disease control strategies and the information could be useful in their planning and implementation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the risk {{associated}} with the transport <b>of</b> stock <b>calves</b> imported from France to Italy, information obtained from inspections carried out in Piedmont by competent authorities between 2001 and 2010 was considered. The inspections concerned 246 trucks transporting a total of 13, 857 fattening calves. Based on the types of infringements recorded, several hazards related to animal welfare, such as overcrowding, tying by the horns and inappropriate mixing, were identified and characterized. The inspection of vehicles revealed hazards concerning partitions, bedding, decks, lighting, drinking and mechanical ventilation systems. A calculation {{was made of the}} incidence of these infringements and the consequent exposure <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> to such hazards and risk characterization was performed. The ranking shows overcrowding and the absence of partitions to be major risks in stock calf transportation from France to Italy. A logistic regression was adopted to evaluate the effect on the exposure to hazards of the only two variables recordable during the inspections: <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> inside each vehicle and distance of the journey. The results showed a direct relationship between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> per vehicle and exposure to overcrowding or to absence of partitions. The journey distance was found weakly and inversely related to exposure to the absence of partitions. The information obtained from the inspections provides not only a basis for evaluating the welfare <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> during transport but also an objective contribution to the assessment of the risks tied to their transportation. </p...|$|R

Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins were encountered at a water depth of 1. 1 - 7. 5 m, a distance off shore of 21 - 1, 021 m and water transparency of 67 - 256 cm. Groups and solitary Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins were sighted 39 times. They were extensively {{viewed in the}} coastal zone between Nang Kham bay to Thong Ching bay. There were 34 sightings of groups and five sightings of solitary individuals. A total of 49 individuals were identified and catalogued. There were 33 identified adults, eight juveniles and eight calves. The group size of humpback dolphins varied from 2 - 20 individuals. The group size of adults ranged between 2 - 12 dolphins. The juveniles group size ranged from 0 - 6 dolphins. There were no groups observed consisting solely of juveniles. Groups without juveniles were seen 8 times. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> per group ranged between 0 - 4 individuals.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this analysis was to identify the production practices used by farmers to change seasonal production. Production practices included milk production per cow, proportion <b>of</b> cows milking, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> first lactation animals entering the herd, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cows leaving the herd, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days to first breeding, and calves born. Farms that participated in a seasonal pricing plan during 1993, 1994, and 1995 decreased production practice seasonality in response to price premiums, which caused a decrease in production seasonality compared to nonparticipating farms. Participating farms showed a preference for adjusting entering first lactation animals and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> born, but did make adjustments in other practices as well.

40|$|Herd life, stayability, {{cumulative}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> {{born and}} weaned, and cumulative 200 -d weight <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> weaned were analyzed to estimate differences between 16 breeds of sires, heterosis and breed direct and maternal effects, and to estimate genetic parameters between stayability traits and traits measured early in a cow 2 ̆ 7 s {{life and to}} evaluate {{the importance of the}} method of analysis on prediction of genetic values of selected sires. Record from the Germplasm Evaluation project at the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center were used. Performance with (1) actual culling of cows nonpregnant in two consecutive years or with (2) imposed annual culling of any non-pregnant cows was analyzed. Herd life was analyzed using a Weibull regression model, stayability to various ages with a mixed threshold model, and cumulative traits with linear mixed models. Similar rankings of the sire breeds were found with the actual and imposed culling policies. Breed groups differed in survival with a range of. 72 to. 96 in the probability of survival {{from the beginning of the}} first breeding season of the cows to 7 yr of age. The range in probability of a cow weaning five calves given that she had already calved as a 2 -yr-old was from. 54 to. 89. Cumulative 200 -d weaning weight <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> ranged from 814. 8 kg to 1016. 8 kg by 6 yr of age.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse data on 74, 081 calvings, {{subsequent}} lactation performance and culling of 23, 588 Black-and-White cows improved with Holstein-Friesians. The animals represented the active population in Pomerania and Kujavia, first calved in 2000 and 2001, and were culled before the end of 2008. Frequency of calvings, which averaged 1. 5 % for twin births and just 0. 02 % for triplet births, increased with age of cow and also with increasing milk yield in the preceding lactation. Performance results showed that mothers of twins were superior to mothers <b>of</b> single <b>calves</b> in terms <b>of</b> milk yield (1. 3 kg milk/day milking). Despite the greater perinatal mortality of twins and triplets, multiple pregnancies gave rise to a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> compared to single pregnancies. However, multiple pregnancies were accompanied by adverse effects such as increased proportion of complications requiring human assistance, mechanical assistance and veterinary intervention (1. 2 × more). Fertility of the cows deteriorated after multiple pregnancies, with particularly unfavourable indicators of fertility found for triplet births, decreased chance of survival to the next calving, and increased culling rates in cows, especially due to udder diseases, infertility, reproductive diseases, old age, metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases, and locomotor system diseases. It was found that the increasing milk yield was paralleled by the increasing proportion of multiple pregnancies. This has highlighted the need for early and reliable diagnosis and management of twin pregnancies, which is supposed to facilitate parturition and ensure survival <b>of</b> <b>calves.</b> Multiple pregnancy, yield, fertility Cattle are a monofoetal species with occasional multiple pregnancies which result in the birht <b>of</b> a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> (most often two).
