Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not [...] "so heavily centered" [...] on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who [...] "came out" [...] in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's [...] "coming-out" [...] process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old enough to know what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about.|$|E

He held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool-flake. The germ could be rendered sterile, he said, by 'Mellish's Own Invincible Fumigatory'--a heavy violet-black powder--' the result of fifteen years' scientific investigation, Sir!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I don't mean {{to stay at}} home {{any longer}} than I can help; only it's no good going out into life"--this phrase she often used--"till you know where you are. In my profession, one has to be so careful. Of course, people think it's worse than it is; father gets fits sometimes. But you know, Mrs. Fiorsen, home's awful. We have mutton--you know what mutton is--it's really awful in your bedroom in hot weather. And there's nowhere to practise. What I should like would be a studio. It would be lovely, somewhere down by the river, or up here near you. That WOULD be lovely. You know, I'm putting by. As soon as ever I have two hundred pounds, I shall skip. What I think would be {{perfectly}} lovely would be to inspire painters and musicians. I don't want to be just a common 'turn'--ballet business year after year, and that; I want to be something rather special. But mother's so silly about me; she thinks I oughtn't to take any risks at all. I shall never get on that way. It IS so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you, Mrs. Fiorsen, because you're young enough to know what I feel; and I'm sure you'd never be shocked at anything. You see, about men: Ought one to marry, or ought one to take a lover? They say you can't be a perfect artist till you've felt passion. But, then, if you marry, that means mutton over again, and perhaps babies, and perhaps the wrong man after all. Ugh! But then, on the other hand, I don't want to be raffish. I hate raffish people--I simply hate them. What do you think? It's awfully difficult, isn't it?" ...|$|E

I thought I had {{discovered}} Armadale's limit when I was his neighbor in Norfolk; but my later experience at Naples shows me that I was wrong. He is perpetually {{in and out}} of this house (crossing over to us in a boat from the hotel at Santa Lucia, where he sleeps); and he has exactly two subjects of conversation--the yacht for sale in the harbor here, and Miss Milroy. Yes! he selects ME as the confidante of his devoted attachment to the major's daughter! 'It's so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a woman about it!' That is all the apology he has thought it necessary to make for appealing to my sympathies--my sympathies!--on the subject of 'his darling Neelie,' fifty times a day. He is evidently persuaded (if he thinks about it at all) that I have forgotten, as completely as he has forgotten, all that once passed between us when I was first at Thorpe Ambrose. Such an utter want of the commonest delicacy and the commonest tact, in a creature who is, to all appearance, possessed of a skin, and not a hide, and who does, unless my ears deceive me, talk, and not bray, is really quite incredible when one comes to think of it. But it is, for all that, quite true. He asked me--he actually asked me, last night--how many hundreds a year the wife of a rich man could spend on her dress. 'Don't put it too low,' the idiot added, with his intolerable grin. 'Neelie shall be one of the best-dressed women in England when I have married her.' And this to me, after having had him at my feet, and then losing him again through Miss Milroy! This to me, with an alpaca gown on, and a husband whose income must be helped by a newspaper! ...|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Sebastian {{returns to}} Düsseldorf to visit Adrian, who puts his {{business}} around destroying Johannes for taking his great love Francesca. Sebastian runs into Jana von Lahnstein as her car breaks down. He helps her and even {{wants to ask}} her out as she replies that she's married, but {{would like to see}} him again as a friend. Jana wants to give him her number, but as soon as Sebastian realizes her last name, Sebastian shows no interest in her any longer and leaves a confused Jana behind. Sebastian decides to help Adrian with his war against Johannes and the Lahnstein family because of what Ludwig told his family. According to Ludwig, Johannes was responsible for cutting him out of Dietrich's will and also sided with his father, when Ludwig decided to be with Madeline. Not knowing who he is, Sebastian outs himself on a charity event at Königsbrunn as Ludwig's son; leaving Johannes and his family shocked. Johannes tries to talk to his nephew, but it does not take long for them to fight about the past. In the end, Johannes warns Sebastian about Adrian and tries to make him understand that this man will only use him to his own advantage. Sebastian laughs at Johannes' warning and tells him all about what Adrian did for him and his siblings after his parents have died and Johannes was nowhere to be seen. With Johannes and Sebastian being at odds, Johannes' daughter Carla decides to pay her cousin a visit. Carla realizes that Sebastian is a good man and they enjoy having breakfast together. But as the conversation shifts to Johannes, Sebastian does not want to hear what Carla has to say. He tells her that it was great to see her again and it would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> again as long as Johannes is not the subject. Carla decides to talk to her father about what happened all those years ago. Johannes tells his daughter the story of Ludwig and Madeline and Dietrich's disapproval. But he eventually makes it clear that he did not side with his father and even tried to stay in contact with Ludwig. All the letters he wrote him back then came back unopened and unanswered. Carla uses these letters to tell Sebastian the truth and the young lawyer realizes that Johannes is not the bad person Ludwig made him out to be. But before he can speak to Johannes, his uncle goes on a business trip from which he never returns as his plane goes down over the Atlantic. Sebastian leaves Adrian with his plan for revenge alone, but tries to stay neutral between him and Lahnsteins. This eventually becomes a problem when Sebastian receives a call from Tanja von Anstetten, former lover of his cousin Ansgar, meant for Adrian. Sebastian finds out that Tanja is supposed to be dead after committing suicide {{as a result of her}} son's death. He finds out that Tanja faked not only her own death, but also that of her son and Ansgar's Hannes and that Adrian helped them. Sebastian sides with the Lahnsteins and, with the help of Carla and her brother Leonard, tries to get Hannes returned to Ansgar. After that the bond between Adrian and Sebastian slowly breaks, even though Sebastian realizes that both sides have their share of dark secrets.|$|E
