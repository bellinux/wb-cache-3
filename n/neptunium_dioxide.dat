40|$|The {{electronic}} {{ground states}} of the actinide dioxides AnO 2 (with An=U, Np, Pu, Am, and Cm) are investigated employing first-principles calculations {{within the framework of}} the local density approximation +U (LDA+U) approach, implemented in a full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave scheme. A systematic analysis of the An- 5 f states is performed which provides intuitive connections between the electronic structures and the local crystalline fields of the f states in the AnO 2 series. Particularly the mechanisms leading to the experimentally observed insulating ground states are investigated. These are found to be caused by the strong spin-orbit and Coulomb interactions of the 5 f orbitals; however, as a result of the different configurations, this mechanism works in distinctly different ways for each of the AnO 2 compounds. In agreement with experimental observations, the nonmagnetic states of plutonium and curium dioxide are computed to be insulating, whereas those of uranium, <b>neptunium,</b> and americium <b>dioxides</b> require additional symmetry breaking to reproduce the insulator ground states, a condition which is met with magnetic phase transitions. We show that the occupancy of the An-f orbitals is closely connected to each of the appearing insulating mechanisms. We furthermore investigate the detailed constitution of the noncollinear multipolar moments for transverse 3 q magnetic ordered states in UO 2 and longitudinal 3 q high-rank multipolar ordered states in NpO 2 and AmO 2.

40|$|Wet {{chemistry}} {{experiments were}} carried out to investigate {{the effect of the}} redox state and aqueous speciation on the uptake of <b>neptunium</b> by titanium <b>dioxide</b> (TiO 2) and by calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) under alkaline conditions. TiO 2 was chosen as a reference sorbent to determine the surface complexation behaviour of neptunium under alkaline conditions. C-S-H phases are important constituents of cement and concrete. They may contribute significantly to radionuclide retention due to their high recrystallization rates making incorporation the dominating sorption mechanism for many radionuclides (e. g. the actinides) on these materials. The sorption of neptunium on both solids was found to depend strongly on the degree of hydrolysis. On TiO 2 Rd values for Np(IV), Np(V) and Np(VI) are identical at pH = 10 and decrease with progressing hydrolysis in case of Np(V) and Np(VI). On C-S-H phases, Rd values for the three redox states are also identical at pH[*]=[*] 10. While the Rd values for Np(VI) sorption on C-S-H phases decrease with progressing hydrolysis, the Rd values for Np(IV) and Np(V) sorption are not affected by the pH. In addition to the effect of hydrolysis, the presence of Ca is found to promote Np(V) and Np(VI) sorption on TiO 2 whereas on C-S-H phases, the present wet chemistry data do not give unambiguous evidence. Thus, the aqueous speciation appears to have a similar influence on the sorption of the actinides on both types of solids despite the different sorption mechanism. The similar Rd values for Np(IV,V,VI) sorption at pH = 10 can be explained qualitatively by invoking inter-ligand electrostatic repulsion between OH groups in the coordination sphere of Np(V) and Np(VI). This mechanism was proposed earlier in the literature for the prediction of actinide complexation constants with inorganic ligands. A limiting coordination number for each Np redox state, resulting from the inter-ligand electrostatic repulsion, allows the weaker sorption of the highest hydrolysed Np(V,VI) species to be explaine...|$|R

The oxides were produced as thin films by reactive sputter deposition. Water was condensed as a thick ice overlayer {{on the surface}} at low temperature. Subsequent warming led to desorption of the ice. When warmed up under ultraviolet light (UV light, HeI and HeII radiation), the surface was reduced. NpO 2 was reduced to surface neptunium sesquioxide (Np 2 O 3). In the uranium−plutonium mixed oxide (U−Pu MOX), plutonium was reduced from plutonium dioxide (PuO 2) to plutonium sesquioxide (Pu 2 O 3). In uranium−thorium mixed oxide (U−Th MOX), the uranium was reduced from hyperstoichiometric uranium dioxide (UO 2 +x) to stoichiometric UO 2 but not to lower oxides: the lowest thermodynamically stable oxides are formed. In the mixed oxides, uranium reduction seems to be activated for oxides with both thorium and plutonium. Surface reduction is explained as a photocatalytic reaction of the surface, triggered by the excitation of electrons from the valence (or impurity) band into the conduction band. The enhancement of reactivity of the mixed oxides compared to pure uranium is explained by the higher band gap of thorium dioxide (ThO 2) and plutonium dioxide (PuO 2) compared to uranium dioxide (UO 2).

The present experimental approach employs remote laser heating under controlled atmosphere and fast pyrometry. This technique circumvents problems encountered by more traditional heating techniques, in particular, the reaction between sample and containment at temperatures beyond 2500 K. In addition, {{only a small amount}} of sample material is required, which is an advantage with respect to the radioactivity and limited availability of neptunium. The NpO 2 melting/freezing temperature has been measured to be 3070 K?±? 62 K, much higher than previous values (around 2830 K) obtained by more traditional thermal analysis methods. The large amount of experimental data collected allowed a consistent statistical analysis. It seems likely, although not fully evident from the present results, that the high oxygen potential at temperatures around melting leads to a slightly hypo-stoichiometric congruent melting composition, as already observed in other actinide (ThO 2, PuO 2) and lanthanide oxides (e. g., CeO 2). Finally, a recently developed phase-field model was used for the simulation of the observed thermograms, allowing a deeper insight in material properties that are difficult to directly measure.

Transuranium elements (Np, Pu, Am, Cm) are generated during the irradiation process in a reactor and constitute a major issue for the nuclear industry because of their toxicity and very long half life (2. 14 * 106, 2. 41 * 104 and 432. 2 years for 237 Np, 239 Pu and 241 Am respectively). One main objective of the international GEN-IV program is to operate in a so called closed fuel recycling cycle by incorporating the separated minor actinides (Np, Am, Cm) into the fresh Mixed OXide fuel (MOX) (U, Pu) O 2 and reusing them for energy generation. Such incorporation will however introduce a much more complex chemistry for which many data are still missing. Studies carried out in the past have revealed the formation close to the pellet rim (~ 923 K) of sodium urano-plutonate of formula Na 3 MO 4 (M=U, Pu, U 1 -xPux) upon the reaction between sodium and (U,Pu) O 2 fuels 1. This compound was shown to be of lower density and thermal conductivity than the fuel leading to local swelling and temperature increase, potentially enlarging the breach up to pin failure. Moreover the authors measured the thermodynamic potential or partial molar Gibbs energies of oxygen (∆GO 2 eq) of some urania and urania-plutonia solid solutions. They showed that the metallic coolant coming into contact with the urania-plutonia solid solution could lead to an oxygen concentration increase in the liquid sodium in conjunction with the reduction to a lower valency of the plutonium in the oxide phase [...] Other authors, Pillon 2 and Kleykamp 3 have contributed in the 1990 ’s to the investigation of the Na-U-O, Na-Pu-O and Na-UxPu 1 -x-O ternary and quaternary systems.

The crystal structures of the α-Na 2 NpO 4 and Na 2 Np 2 O 7 compounds were refined by Rietveld analysis. Evolution of the cell parameters of α-Na 2 NpO 4 was also followed as a function of temperature up to 1273 K by X-ray diffraction. The corresponding linear thermal expansion coefficients along the different axis were determined: αa = 41. 3 10 - 6 K- 1, αb = 35. 0 10 - 6 K- 1, αc ~ 0 K- 1. The high temperature X-ray diffraction experiment also revealed the formation of a high temperature γ phase tetragonal of Na 2 NpO 4 between 663 and 763 K and the transition to a β orthorhombic (Pbca) phase upon cooling to room temperature 4. Finally, thermodynamic measurements in a Knudsen effusion cell have given preliminary results on the vaporization behaviour of α-Na 2 NpO 4 when heated up to 2500 K under vacuum conditions.

The dissociation of the initial soluble Np(IV) complex (i. e. [Np(IV) (CO 3) 5] 6 -) induces the intrinsic formation of nanocrystalline NpO 2 in the solution phase. The resulting irregularly shaped nanocrystals with an average size of 4 nm exhibit a face-centered cubic (fcc), fluorite-type structure (space group). The NCs tend to agglomerate under ambient conditions due to the weakly charged hydrodynamic surface at neutral pH (zetapotential ~ 0 mV). The formation of micron-sized agglomerates, composed of nanocrystals of 2 - 5 nm in size, and the subsequent precipitation cause immobilization of the major amount of Np(IV) in the Np carbonate system. Agglomeration of NpO 2 nanocrystals in dependence on time was indicated by PCS and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy with the changes of baseline characteristics and absorption maximum at 742 nm. Hitherto, unknown polynuclear species as intermediate species of NpO 2 nanocrystal formation were isolated from solution and observed by HR-TEM. These polynuclear Np species appear as dimers, trimers and hexanuclear compounds in analogy with those reported for other actinides. Intrinsic formation of NpO 2 (fcc) nanocrystals under ambient environmental conditions is prevented by admixing silicic acid: amorphous Np(IV) silica colloids are formed when silicate is present in carbonate solution. Herein, the initial molar ratio of Si to Np in solution lead to the formation of Np(IV) silica particles of different composition and size where Si content determines the structure and stability of resulting colloids. Implications for different electronic structures of Np(IV) in dependence on Si content in the solid phase are given by the shift of the absorption maximum at 742 nm characteristic for Np(IV) colloids, silica excess of 5 times the magnitude of Si to Np reveal a redshift up to 6 nm in the colloidal UV-vis spectrum. Precipitation of Np(IV) particles in the ternary system results in a different coordination sphere of Np(IV) compared to the binary system, and the incorporation of Si into internal structure of Np(IV) silica colloids in coffinite-like structure is confirmed by EXAFS. TEM confirms different kinds of particle morphologies in dependence on the silica content. Silica-poor systems reveal porous particles in the micron-range which consist of irregular cross-linked hydrolyzed Np(IV) silica compartments with pores 1 year) due to repulsion effects caused by significant surface charge. Particles synthesized from Si/Np = 9 / 1 carry exclusively negative surface charge in nearly the whole pH range from pH 3 to pH 10 with zetapotential = (-) 5 to (-) 30 mV. The zeta potentials of all particle systems containing silica are significantly shifted to more negative values below pH 7 where the isoelectrical point shifts from pH = 8. 0 to 2. 6 effecting negative charge under ambient conditions which supports electrostatic stabilization of Np(IV) particles. Particle surface charge at the slipping plane, particle size and shape necessarily depend on the initial magnitude of Si content in solution during particle formation. Particular changes of the morphology and internal structure of different Np(IV) silica colloids by aging are indicated by TEM and XPS. The composition and the crystallinity state of the initially formed amorphous phases partially changed into well-ordered nanocrystalline units characterized with fcc structure. The presence of silicate under conditions expected in a nuclear waste repository significantly influences the solubility of Np(IV) and provoke the stabilization of waterborne Np(IV) up to concentrations of 10 - 3 M, exceeding Np´s solubility limit by a factor of up 10. 000. Neptunium and silicate significantly interact with each other, and thereby changing their individual hydrolysis and polymerization behavior. Silicate prevents the intrinsic formation of NpO 2 NCs in fcc-structure, and at the same time, Np(IV) prevents the polymerization of silicate. Both processes result in the formation of Np(IV) silica colloids which possibly influence the migration behavior and fate of Np in the waste repositories and surrounding environments. For tetravalent actinides in general, the most significant transport in the environment would occur by colloidal particles. Therefore, Np(IV) silica colloids could have a significant implication in the migration of Np, the important minor actinide in the waste repositories, via colloidal transport...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{interesting}} features behind the exotic orderings of materials have {{attracted the attention}} of many scientists. This new physics can be related to the magnetic and charge multipoles defined by a few electrons around the atomic core in the valence states. The uses of x-rays and neutrons techniques, due to the huge development of large facilities as synchrotrons and spallation sources, have revealed many of these behaviours. In the case of synchrotron sources, photon beams have high brightness, high tunability and good degree of polarization, which together with the development of new experimental techniques have been helpful in the characterization of new functional materials making valuable observations. Resonant Elastic x-ray Scattering (REXS), in particular using polarization analysis, has shown to be an extremely sensitive tool for determining the charge and magnetic degrees of freedom of multiferroic, superconducting or other kind of strongly correlated materials; helping whereas other techniques such as neutron probes or non-resonant x-rays scattering are not able to obtain relevant information. Conventionally, REXS experiments are performed at space group forbidden reflections, where high order contributions as Thomson scattering are not allowed. The data gathered at these weak Bragg reflections, due to space group symmetry rules, can be treated using an atomic model, which has the virtue of being used as a common platform for the analysis of x-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. In this PhD work, three different antiferromagnetic materials with magnetic ions located in threefold symmetry (3) positions have been investigated in detail by means of REXS. 	<b>Neptunium</b> <b>Dioxide</b> (NpO 2), where an enigmatic low-temperature ordering state shows interesting physical features, similar to the one observed in UO 2, that relates its crystal field, the super-exchange interactions and electron¿phonon coupling. Previous works from different groups {{have not been able to}} explain the resonant x-ray diffraction data collected at the neptunium M 4 -edge. But new information, related to a change in the symmetry of the neptunium sites (3 ¿m) due to the delocalization of the oxygen atoms, has helped to analyse and redefine the wave function that has successfully confirmed the reorganization of the oxygen sites and has estimated the value of hexadecapoles, which can not be observed by other techniques, confirming the antiferromagnetic ordering. 	Hematite (¿-Fe 2 O 3) in its antiferromagnetic phase and above the Morin temperature, due to an anisotropic exchange interaction that force the spins of the ions to assume a canted configuration, shows a small ferromagnetic contribution also known as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Previous studies performed to hematite using REXS near the iron K-edge did not explain properly the behaviour under this structure for both the collinear and canted antiferromagnetic phases. The application of the formalism presented in this work, which incorporate all magnetic contributions, successful explains the behaviour by the presence of a mixture between two processes electric-dipole (E 1) -electric-quadrupole (E 2) and E 2 E 2, obtaining good estimated values for the different multipoles behind these processes. A circular polarized REXS experiment was modelled, which showed the possibility of distinguishing between these two processes while doing the experiment under this kind of polarization. The collected data ratifies the coupling between this kind of polarization and the chiral properties of the compound, showing a fully characterization of the high-temperature phase by the Magnetoelectric multipoles. 	Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO 3), the only material from the multiferroic family that shows a magnetoelectric coupling above room temperature, is also an example of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The results presented in this work supports a new chiral phase above the Néel temperature, in the ferroelectric phase, have been obtained by a REXS experiment, with the incoming x-ray beam tuned near the iron K-edge. The R 3 c forbidden reflection (0, 0, 9) H was studied as a function of the rotation of the crystal about the Bragg wave-vector in both phases, paramagnetic (700 K) and antiferromagnetic (300 K). The data gathered is consistent with a chiral structure formed by a circular cycloid propagating along (1, 1, 0) H. Templeton and Templeton (T&T) scattering at 700 K is attributed in part to charge-like quadrupoles absent in a standard model of a cycloid in which a material vector generates all electronic states of the resonant ion. Extensive sets of azimuthal-angle data are used to infer values of three atomic multipoles in a satisfactory minimal model of the iron electronic structure, with a quadrupole (E 1 E 1 event) and a hexadecapole (E 2 E 2 event) contributing T&T scattering, plus a magnetic dipole (E 1 E 1) for the antiferromagnetic phase...|$|E
