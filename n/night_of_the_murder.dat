The film, {{based on the}} novel The Hangover Murders, is about the investigation of the murder of {{one of a group of}} friends. The survivors are unable to recall the events of the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> because they were all too drunk. Remember Last Night? features an ensemble cast headed by Edward Arnold, Constance Cummings, and Robert Young.|$|E
5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed words had {{been added to the}} notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985, the latter read out to the jury as statements H to N. One of the 1985 statements said that Silcott had been carrying a knife with a two-foot-long blade on the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> and that he had attacked Blakelock.|$|E
5|$|Cooper and Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) are {{undercover}} in One Eyed Jacks, a Canadian brothel and casino. Cooper {{speaks to}} drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz), whom {{he believes is}} connected to Laura's death. Posing as a drug financier, Cooper persuades Renault to meet him in the US; Cooper learns that Renault and Johnson were with Pulaski and Laura on the night she died. Later that night, when Renault arrives to meet Cooper, he is arrested for Laura's murder. Renault resists and is shot; he is taken to a hospital where he accuses Johnson of attacking him the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> claiming to have been unconscious while the killing occurred. Laura's father, Leland (Ray Wise), learns of the arrest; he travels {{to the hospital and}} fatally smothers Renault.|$|E

5|$|Several {{witnesses}} {{testified against}} him. The widow Eliza Sharp {{testified that the}} voice of the killer was distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. Sharp to hear Beauchamp's voice; she immediately identified it as that of the killer. (Beauchamp claimed he had disguised his voice on the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> and thought Mrs. Sharp would not recognize it). Patrick Henry Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now knew as Beauchamp. Darby said the man – a stranger to him at the time – had asked for Darby's help in prosecuting an unspecified claim against Sharp. The man then identified himself as the husband of Anna Cooke and said he intended to kill Sharp. Based on the circumstantial evidence, Beauchamp was held for trial at the next term of the circuit court in March 1826.|$|E
5|$|During their investigation, Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja {{has been}} in a Haitian prison for four months, {{eliminating}} him as a lead. Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared as a suspect, leaked from the police. Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> but said he does not kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as a suspect, much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, who says the family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order.|$|E
5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} of the allegations and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with relatives and friends, and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police searched his home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on the trainers. Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from the material of that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> and initially claimed that {{he had nothing to do}} with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed he had bought it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E

50|$|According to a later {{petition}} by the Talwars, the Narco tests {{had revealed}} that the three suspects had watched a Nepali song on the TV in Hemraj's room on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> This {{had been told to}} the journalist Nalini Singh by the CBI official Anuj Arya. Nalini Singh, <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nepalese channel on which the song was telecast, had been asked for <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs telecast on her channel on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> Anuj Arya told her that the information provided by her matched with the suspects' revelations.|$|R

50|$|On 29 September, Henri Chastel, a {{lorry driver}} from Orpierre, a village about 50 km (30 miles) north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime scene, {{informed}} Inspector Ranchin {{that he had}} passed the area on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> at around midnight and had seen a thin man of average height, wearing a shirt with rolled-up sleeves, his hands pressed against one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car's rear doors and looking into the car. This man is unlikely to have been Sir Jack Drummond, who was overweight, and the description matches <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man seen at 11.15 pm by Ode Arnaud on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b>|$|R

50|$|Baranyi {{refused to}} name his {{accomplice}} to the detectives, {{who it was}} later discovered to be a boy called David Anderson. Following further investigations, David Anderson was brought in for another round of questioning. This time, Anderson claimed that he had lied to detectives when {{he told them that}} he had been with Baranyi <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> He claimed that, on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> he had been driving a truck belonging to his girlfriend's father between <b>the</b> cities <b>of</b> Bellevue and Seattle. Anderson also claimed he knew Baranyi had been planning <b>the</b> Wilsons' <b>murders</b> for a while. He cited the friendship between Baranyi and Kim Wilson as his only connection to Kim. Three people who lived near the Baranyi residence contradicted Anderson's statement; they claimed that they saw the two boys leaving the house together at the same time on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> Detectives searched <b>the</b> households <b>of</b> both boys and took items Baranyi had stolen, in addition to bloody shoes and shoelaces matching the shoe-thread pattern at the crime scene.

50|$|Joe Nickell notes that, {{given the}} {{frequency}} with which Ronald DeFeo has changed his story over the years, any new claims from him regarding the events that took place on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> should be approached with caution.|$|R
25|$|Kim Bennett, another bar patron {{who knew}} Ferguson and Erickson, testified {{that she saw}} Ferguson and Erickson leave the bar between 1:15a.m. and 1:30 am. She was never called to testify at the trial and her {{statement}} was not disclosed to Ferguson's defense team. Mike Schook, the bouncer at the bar on the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> testified the bar closed at 1:30 am that evening, disproving Erickson's claims that {{they returned to the}} bar following the murders.|$|E
25|$|When on {{the witness}} stand, Erickson gave a {{detailed}} description of Ferguson strangling Heitholt, despite apparently not remembering any details following the murders and during the interrogation. The defense countered that all of the evidence found at the crime scene pointed elsewhere. None of the hair, blood, or fingerprint samples collected at the crime scene were consistent with Ferguson or Erickson, and no traces of the victim's blood were found in the vehicle Ferguson was driving the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|The other janitor, Shawna Ornt, who {{witnessed}} the two men fleeing the parking lot eventually testified under oath that she had told the prosecutor that the man she saw the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> was not Ferguson. She claims Crane repeatedly {{tried to get her}} to implicate him and that he became threatening during his last conversation with her. Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify the men at the scene, Shawna Ornt was never asked in court if she could identify Ferguson. Zellner alleged that the prosecution did not ask her to identify Ferguson because they knew her answer would hurt their case.|$|E

25|$|In November 1978, {{the body}} of truck driver J.T. McGarry, who had been shot {{multiple}} times, was found over 25 miles from his Ventura County home. Michael Hanline was suspected of having murdered him, {{with the help of}} an accomplice, because he and McGarry had both been involved with the same woman. Largely on this woman's testimony, Hanline was sentenced to life without parole in 1980. Soon after the CIP was established in 1999, the organization received correspondence from Hanline claiming his innocence. The CIP spent years investigating this case. They eventually discovered that a since-deceased attorney named Bruce Robertson had attempted to implicate Hanline in order to direct suspicion away from his own clients, and had intimidated potential witnesses. A witness had even placed Robertson at McGarry's home on the night of his murder. In addition, DNA testing pointed to Hanline's innocence, and it was established that the woman who testified against him had been on drugs, both on the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> and at the time of her testimony. On November 24, 2014, Hanline was released from Ventura County Court a free man, and in April of the following year, a judge dismissed all charges against him, as the district attorney had decided not to retry the case. Having served 36 years behind bars, Hanline was the longest-incarcerated person whose conviction was reversed in the history of the State of California.|$|E
25|$|EastEnders has {{featured}} seven live broadcasts. For its 25th {{anniversary in}} February 2010, a live episode was broadcast in which Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) was revealed as Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) killer. Turner was told only 30minutes before the live episode {{and to maintain}} suspense, she whispers this revelation to former lover and current father-in-law, Max Branning, in the very final moments of the live show. Many other cast members only found {{out at the same}} time as the public, when the episode was broadcast. On 23 July 2012, a segment of that evening's episode was screened live as Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) carried the Olympic Flame around Walford in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In February 2015, for the soap's 30th anniversary, five episodes in a week featured live inserts throughout them. Episodes airing on Tuesday 17, Wednesday 18 and Thursday 19 (which featured an hour long episode and a second episode) all featured at least one live insert. The show revealed that the killer of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was her younger brother, Bobby (Eliot Carrington), during the second episode on Thursday, after a ten month mystery regarding who killed her. In a flashback episode which revisited the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> Bobby was revealed to have killed his sister. The aftermath episode, which aired on Friday 20, was completely live and explained in detail Lucy's death. Carrington was told he was Lucy's killer on Monday 16, while Laurie Brett (who plays Bobby's adoptive mother, Jane) was informed in November, due to the character playing a huge role in the cover-up of Lucy's murder. Bywater only discovered Bobby was responsible for Lucy's death on the morning of Thursday, 19 November, several hours before they filmed the scenes revealing Bobby as Lucy's killer.|$|E
