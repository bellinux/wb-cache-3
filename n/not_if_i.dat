500|$|In early 1850, Dickinson {{wrote that}} [...] "Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, {{a very great}} town this is!" [...] Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died {{suddenly}} of [...] "brain congestion" [...] at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, and some of my friends are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of evening is sad– it was once my study hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would <b>not</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to {{cooperate}} with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. [...] Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. [...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would <b>not,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were you, get too far from the original, as the President likes it. [...] Perhaps you can make him like it better." ...|$|E
500|$|During the two {{or three}} years that Mary Shelley spent writing the Spanish and Portuguese Lives from 1834 or 1835 to 1837, she also wrote a novel, Falkner (1837), {{experienced}} the death of her father, William Godwin, started a biography of him, and moved to London after her son, Percy Florence Shelley, entered Trinity College, Cambridge. She had more difficulty with these Lives than with the other volumes' biographies, writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: [...] "I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish & Portugeeze [...] Lives – This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, & the difficulty of getting books & information". According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor of the Spanish and Portuguese Lives, Spanish books were hard to come by in England and not much was known regarding Shelley's subjects. However, Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: [...] "The best is that the very thing which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting – namely – the treading in unknown paths & dragging out unknown things – I wish I could go to Spain." [...] While living in Harrow, she refused to go to the British Library in London, writing: [...] "I would <b>not</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could – I do not like finding myself a stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating [...] to their own". At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of [...] "feminist protest" [...] others see it as [...] "matter of comfort and practicality", since the reading rooms were [...] "noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated". Shelley's continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that [...] "there is always a sense of an engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what seems accurate". Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by people who knew the authors, and when translations of the authors' works were unavailable or poor, she provided her own.|$|E

2500|$|About {{three months}} since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in sundry booksellers' hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, {{in which a}} letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by {{one or two of}} them taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care <b>not</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never be.

2500|$|Case 3. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with frequent}} vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures {{at the age}} of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to look at me, and he would <b>not.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June Pitt heard Fitzwilliam's {{objection}} {{from the}} Duke of Portland. Pitt assured [...] "that the re-establishment of the Crown of France in such {{person of the}} family of Bourbon as shall be naturally entitled to it was the first and determined aim of the present Ministry". Pitt wished to discuss this with Fitzwilliam in person. On 23 June Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland that he believed the government had moved to the Whig position and that [...] "for my own part I am now ready, not only to adopt the opinion that a junction should take place, as your sentiment, but to advise it as the genuine offspring of my own judgement... as much weight and sway should be given to us as possible. ... In my humble opinion, this junction will not produce half its effect if it is not opened to the world by such marks of real substantial favour and confidence {{on the part of the}} Crown towards us as will mark beyond dispute the return of weight, power and consideration to the Old Whigs...after thirty years' exclusion from patronage in the line of peerage" [...] new Whig peers should be created. He also rejected office except of [...] "going to Ireland, but...it is impossible". However the Duke of Portland and Lord Mansfield implored Fitzwilliam to accept office and when Lord Mansfield saw Fitzwilliam when he came down to London on 28 June he got Fitzwilliam [...] "to admit that if ever he was to take office this was the time". The next day Fitzwilliam met the Duke of Portland and reported that: [...] "I see little prospect of escaping office...the duke...seems so intent upon my accepting, as almost to say that he will <b>not,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do not—I left him last night my reasons for thinking that I should be more serviceable out of office, than in...if I find I have not persuaded him, I must submit". When Pitt met the Duke of Portland on 1 July he offered the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to Fitzwilliam as soon as Lord Westmoreland could be compensated for the loss of it. Therefore, on 3 July Fitzwilliam agreed to join the coalition government as Lord President of the Council for the time being, writing that day to Lady Rockingham: [...] "It is a time when private affection must give way to public exigency".|$|E
