5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, which is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E

Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers, and {{was found in the}} correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily sprout from old wood. This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> var.cunninghamii which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of}} the (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E
5|$|The bombardments also {{affected}} Japanese morale. Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks {{to be more}} terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration. Several of the industrial facilities that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity. This was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> all facilities that were attacked though, and the morale among workers {{in two of the}} bombarded factories was reported to have increased. The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost. However, such attitudes did not contribute to bringing the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government's decision to surrender.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, most {{applications}} {{that do not}} depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, but this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles (and thus contacting many) or for the soils around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Other manufacturers continued to make thorium mantles, but moved their factories to developing countries. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some claiming them to be non-radioactive while using quantities of thorium of up to 259milligrams per mantle.|$|E
