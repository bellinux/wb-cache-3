Additionally, patterns of the influence of <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratios</b> on the phytoplankton community structure, and also similarities between different climate zones were investigated.

Additionally, at high levels of Chl a the relative abundance of Cyanophyta was higher, while the relative abundance of Bacillariophyta was lower. Without limitation of <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratios,</b> diatoms is the dominant group, whilst cyanobacteria dominate at N limitation conditions. Tropical lakes and reservoirs show a dissimilarity with both temperate and polar water bodies; on the other hand, polar lakes and temperate lakes and reservoirs result similar. I conclude that human interventions on water, such as dams construction and nutrient loads, are creating conditions favorable for cyanobacteria across wide spatial scales. The mechanism of this could be through altering Si:P and Si:N due the retention/export of Si, but also by increasing the temperature of the epilimnetic water in reservoirs and decreasing the N:P ratio through land use change.

Fruits from each tree were harvested and weighed separately. Trees were separated in two groups, productivity being higher or lower than 30. 000 Kg ha- 1. Seasonal changes in elements were similar for high and low production trees, excepting for K contents.

In this study, we used laboratory experiments with a primary producer (Nannochloropsis sp.), three different species of protozoan grazers and one mesozooplankton species: two heterotrophic dinoflagellates (Gyrodinium dominans and Oxyrrhis marina), a ciliate (Euplotes sp.) and a rotifer (Brachionus plicatilis) to test the stoichiometric response to five nutrient treatments. We showed that the dependency of zooplankton C:N:P <b>ratios</b> on C: <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratios</b> of their food source varies among species. Similar to the photoautotroph, the two heterotrophic dinoflagellates weakly regulated their internal stoichiometry. In contrast, the strength of stoichiometric regulation increased to strict homeostasis in both the ciliate and the rotifer, similar to crustacean zooplankton.

The agreement between nutrient limitation indices of growth rate and biomass yield suggested that phytoplankton biomass and growth rate were P-limited in southern waters, with more stable conditions during summer. In contrast, a lack of agreement between these indicators showed that phytoplankton growth in potentially P-limited cases in western waters and Victoria Harbour was controlled by physical processes (e. g. strong hydrodynamic mixing and dilution). The limiting factor for phytoplankton growth varied spatially and temporally. In summer, there was a change from physical processes (e. g. the rapid dilution and possible light limitation due to strong turbulent mixing) in hydrodynamically active western waters and Victoria Harbour to P limitation, or N + P co-limitation, in southern and eastern waters with more stable conditions.

40|$|A {{workshop}} {{held at the}} University Medical Center in Groningen, The Netherlands, {{aimed at}} discussing the nutritional situation {{of the population in}} general and the role diet plays during critical windows in the life course, during which the body is programmed for the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are increasingly prevalent as our society ages, and nutrition is well known {{to play an important role}} in determining the risk and the time of onset of many common NCDs. Even in affluent countries, people have difficulties to achieve adequate intakes for a range of nutrients: Economic constraints as well as modern lifestyles lead people to consume diets with a positive energy balance, but low in micronutrients, resulting in increasing prevalence of obesity and suboptimal nutritional status. Information about nutrient density, which refers to the content of micronutrients relative to energy in food or diets, can help identify foods that have a low calorie to <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratio.</b> It thus allows the consumption of diets that cover nutritional needs without increasing the risk of becoming obese. Given the impact a nutrient dense, low energy diet can have on health, researchers, food industry and governments jointly should develop options for affordable, appealing nutrient-rich food products, which, in combination with physical activity, allow for optimal health throughout the life-cours...|$|E
40|$|Metastasis is {{a primary}} reason for cancer {{treatment}} failure. While {{a great deal of}} experimental work has been directed toward metastasis, much of the basic theory remains obscure. In particular, the question of how tumor cells survive to initiate secondary growth at a site distant from their origin despite competition for nutrients from cells in the primary tumor is still open. This thesis addresses this question using mathematical modeling. I developed a system of four ordinary differential equations that expresses the competition between a primary tumor and one of its metastatic offspring. In particular, the model addresses how a secondary tumor can survive with the primary tumor in an environment where nutrients are limited. The masses of both a primary and secondary tumor are modeled along with the dynamics of two nutrients: carbon and nitrogen. The parameters of the model are estimated from biological data whenever possible. The model predicts that one characteristic of importance with regards to tumor growth and competition is a given tumor’s optimal carbon to nitrogen (C:N) <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratio.</b> In general, the outcome of competition between a primary and secondary tumor can be predicted based on which tumor has a higher optimal C:N ratio, meaning the tumor ca...|$|E
40|$|Fish culture ponds are {{commonly}} fertilized to increase fish production through enhancement of the plankton forage base. Many fish culture facilities rely on natural production of zooplankton and aquatic insects as food sources for larval fish. Literature on pond fertilization regimes varies; recommendations range from no fertilization {{to a combination}} of inorganic and organic fertilizers. More research on the interactions among water quality, nutrients, plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) and fertilizers of the appropriate <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratios</b> is needed to move fertilization from an art to a science...|$|R
40|$|Senior thesis {{written for}} Oceanography 444 The {{purpose of this}} study was to {{investigate}} the impact of varying <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratios</b> on growing diatoms in Trevor Channel and Effingham Inlet. The study successfully determined the percentage of actively growing diatoms within a population using a new silica detection method (PDMPO stain). It was found that although the number of actively growing cells is similar in both areas, the percentages of the population that is actively growing are quite different.

40|$|Missisquoi Bay (MB) is a {{temperate}} eutrophic freshwater {{lake that}} frequently experiences toxic Microcystis-dominated cyanobacterial blooms. Non-point sources {{are responsible for}} the high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in the bay. This study combined data from environmental parameters, E. coli counts, high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons, quantitative PCR (16 S rRNA and mcyD genes) and toxin analyses to identify the main bloom-promoting factors. In 2009, nutrient concentrations correlated with E. coli counts, abundance of total cyanobacterial cells, Microcystis 16 S rRNA and mcyD genes and intracellular microcystin. Total and dissolved phosphorus also correlated significantly with rainfall. The major cyanobacterial taxa were members of the orders Chroococcales and Nostocales. The genus Microcystis was the main mcyD-carrier and main microcystin producer. Our results suggested that increasing nutrient concentrations and total nitrogen:total phosphorus (TN:TP) ratios approaching 11 : 1, coupled with an increase in temperature, promoted Microcystis-dominated toxic blooms. Although the importance of <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratios</b> and absolute concentrations on cyanobacterial and Microcystis dynamics have been documented in other laboratories, an optimum TN:TP ratio for Microcystis dominance has not been previously observed in situ. This observation provides further support that <b>nutrient</b> <b>ratios</b> are an important determinant of species composition in natural phytoplankton assemblages.
