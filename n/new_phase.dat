5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a <b>new</b> <b>phase</b> of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{interest}} in magnets with frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions comes from the many <b>new</b> <b>phases</b> found in applied magnetic field. In this Article, we explore some of the <b>new</b> <b>phases</b> which arise in a model with frustrated ferromagnetic interactions, the J_ 1 -J_ 2 -J_ 3 Heisenberg model on a square lattice. Using a combination of classical Monte-Carlo simulation and spin-wave theory, we uncover behaviour reminiscent of some widely-studied frustrated antiferromagnets, but with a number of new twists. We first demonstrate that, for a suitable choice of parameters, the phase diagram as a function of magnetic field and temperature is nearly identical to that of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice, including the celebrated 1 / 3 -magnetisation plateau. We then examine how this phase diagram changes when the model is tuned to a point where the classical ground [...] state is highly degenerate. In this case, two <b>new</b> <b>phases</b> emerge; a classical, finite-temperature spin-liquid, characterised by a "ring" in the spin structure [...] factor S(q); and a vortex crystal, a multiple-Q state with finite magnetisation, which can be viewed as an ordered lattice of magnetic vortices. All of these <b>new</b> <b>phases</b> persist {{for a wide range of}} magnetic field. We discuss the relationship between these results and published studies of frustrated antiferromagnets, together with some of the materials where these <b>new</b> <b>phases</b> might be observed in experiment.

These carbides underwent universal phase transitions along two novel phase-transition routes, namely, B 1 TlI (TlI') and/or B 1 TiB (TiB'), when subjected to pressures. The two routes can coexist possibly {{because of the}} tiny enthalpy differences between the <b>new</b> <b>phases</b> under corresponding pressures.
