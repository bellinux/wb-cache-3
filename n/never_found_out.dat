Lydia Martin of The Miami Herald said Chaiken was being {{manipulative}} not revealing Jenny's killer, so viewers would watch their online series. She {{also wanted to}} know [...] "who the fuck" [...] killed her {{because it did not}} give a [...] "decent" [...] ending to the show. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen stated that Jenny's ending was a dis-service to the character having <b>never</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> who killed her.|$|E
500|$|While South Carolina {{was known}} for legendary hard-knuckled {{political}} consultant Lee Atwater and rough elections, this had been more: Michael Graham, a native writer, radio host, and political operative, would say [...] "I have worked on hundreds of campaigns in South Carolina, and I've never seen anything as ugly as that campaign." [...] In subsequent years there would be persistent accounts trying to tie the anti-McCain smears {{to high levels of}} the Bush campaign: the 2003 book [...] would use it to build up their [...] "evil genius" [...] depiction of Bush chief strategist Karl Rove, while a 2008 PBS NOW program showed a local political consultant stating that Warren Tompkins, a Lee Atwater protégé and then Bush chief strategist for the state, was responsible. In contrast, in 2004 National Reviews Byron York would try to debunk many of the South Carolina smear reports as unfounded legend. [...] McCain's campaign manager said in 2004 they <b>never</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> where the smear attacks came from, while McCain himself never doubted their existence.|$|E
500|$|... "The Rapes of Graff" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Price Peterson of TV.com gave {{a positive}} review. Although he expressed confusion over {{the lack of}} closure, he praised {{other aspects of the}} episode. [...] "My pervasive need for justice left me feeling pretty disappointed when we <b>never</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> who the utterly repulsive villain had been behind these sex crimes... Other than the lack of closure, though, this was a solid, well-written episode and it was nice seeing the (supposed) redemption of Troy. Television reviewer Alan Sepinwall was very positive towards the episode, praising it as a return to form for the series. [...] "Now that's more like it, Veronica Mars. A good self-contained mystery, a suggestion that the show could do okay once Veronica leaves high school, a gratuitously awesome [...] "Arrested Development" [...] double-cameo, the biggest spotlight yet for wisecracking Cliff, and a fine showcase for Jason Dohring, who's becoming so good that Veronica may need to investigate a case of show-stealing." [...] He went on to laud the supporting characters' performances, especially the subplot involving Cliff and Sheriff Lamb: [...] "Cliff and Lamb are my favorite non-Keith adult characters, so any subplot that has one busting on the other gets the Sepinwall seal of approval." ...|$|E

6000|$|That [...] "murder will out" [...] is {{supposed}} to be an unquestionable truism.

2500|$|While in the prison, Sasakawa {{was able}} to {{establish}} connections {{with many of the}} men who had led Japan during the war, and who would go on to reassume these roles after their release. He also came into further contact with Yoshio Kodama, though the exact nature of their prison relationship {{does not seem to have}} been as positive as it had been when they were both members of the PPP. (In prison, Kodama pursued a policy of collaborating with his captors, naming names and making questionable statements that put other prisoners at a disadvantage. As part of this policy, he asked that his testimony about Sasakawa be kept secret, and it would appear that Sasakawa <b>never</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about it.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The British {{securities}} {{were locked}} in a specially constructed underground vault that was rushed into existence three stories beneath the Sun Life Building and were guarded around the clock by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A persistent rumour that the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom were stored there was deliberately spread in Montreal to account for increased activity at the building. The extremely secretive United Kingdom Security Deposit, operating in the vault, arranged {{for the sale of}} Britain's negotiable securities on the New York Stock Exchange {{over the next few years}} to pay for Britain's war expenses. The 5,000 employees of Sun Life never suspected what was stored in their basement, and while unloading the treasure ships, not one crate of the cargo went missing. [...] Even though thousands of people were involved, Axis intelligence agencies <b>never</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about the operation. [...] Hundreds of accountants and bankers worked tirelessly to catalogue the contents of thousands of crates taken off the ships. When they were finished it was determined that $2.5billion (US$ [...] billion in [...] ) had been shipped from the UK to Canada without one ship being lost.|$|E

Radley Flynn and no fewer than twenty-two other small part players and choristers. [...] It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked.... August 1951 was the end of an era. Cynthia Morey, who joined the Company just before the defections, wrote: [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> precisely why this great exodus took place.... We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable". [...] Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, [...] "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [...] ... I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; to spend all those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement. [...] But I suppose a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted." [...] Richard Walker, Kenneth Sandford and others also criticised Evans's temperament and methods. [...] She retired as stage director in 1953, the year that her husband died, but she was engaged to coach new D'Oyly Carte principals in their roles for some years thereafter.|$|E
