5000|$|Explosive content: 0.15 kg of PETN/TNT with a <b>Nitropenta</b> booster charge.|$|E
50|$|Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), {{also known}} as PENT, PENTA, TEN, corpent, {{penthrite}} (or—rarely and primarily in German—as <b>nitropenta),</b> is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol, and is structurally very similar to nitroglycerin. Penta refers to the five carbon atoms of the neopentane skeleton.|$|E
5000|$|In 30 mm caliber {{different}} M-Geschoss {{designs were}} available: the original blunt-nosed Ausf.A had an 85 g filling of <b>nitropenta</b> (PETN), which {{was reduced to}} 72 g in the more streamlined Ausf.C shell (the [...] "missing" [...] B was a practice shell). In comparison, the PGU-13/B HEI round for the GAU-8/A Avenger gun of the A-10 Warthog contains only a 58 g explosive filler, while the 30 mm OFZ shell of Russian GSh-301 and GSh-30-6 cannons has a 48.5 g filler.|$|E
50|$|The SD2 {{submunition}} was a 76 mm long cylinder of cast iron, {{which was}} slightly larger in diameter before its wings deployed. A steel cable 121 mm long was attached via a spindle to an aluminium fuze screwed into the fuze pocket {{in the side}} of the bomblet. The outer shell was hinged and would flip open as two half-cylinders when it was dropped. Additionally, spring-loaded wings at the ends would flip out. The wings at the end were canted at an angle to the airflow, which turned the spindle (connected to the fuze) anti-clockwise as the bomblet fell. After the spindle had revolved approximately 10 times (partially unscrewing itself from the bomb) it released a spring-loaded pin inside the fuze, which fully armed the SD2 bomb. The wings and arming spindle remained attached to the bomb after the fuze had armed itself, as the bomb descended towards the ground. Butterfly bombs contained the kleine Zündladung 34 (kl. Zdlg. 34/Np with a blasting cap and 7 grams of <b>Nitropenta)</b> booster and the main explosive filling consisting of 225 grams of cast Füllpulver 60/40 (Amatol) explosive. The fragmentation density produced by an SD 2 was 1 fragment per m² in 8 meters radius from a ground burst SD 2 bomb; overall, the body of an SD 2 did produce about 250 fragments with a mass of over 1 gram and a still greater number of lighter fragments. The fragments were generally lethal to anyone within a radius of 10 m and could inflict serious fragmentation injuries (e.g. deep penetrating eye wounds) as far away as 100 m. Butterfly bombs were usually painted either straw yellow (desert camouflage), or, if fitted with the DoppZ (41) or (41) A fuze, dark green or grey.|$|E
40|$|Explored {{here are}} the ''after-burning'' effects for explosions of <b>Nitropenta</b> (NP) charges in air. Detonation of the charge {{transforms}} the solid explosive (C HNO 5 8412, also known as PETN) into gaseous products that are rich in carbon and CO, which subsequently act as a fuel. When these hot ({approximately} 3500 K) gases mix with air, rapid combustion (after-burning) takes place. The dynamics of this exothermic process was studied in ''pressure calorimeter'' experiments performed at EMI...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} on the reflection of spherical blast waves from planar surfaces. The blast waves were created by the detonation of 0. 5 -g spherical charges of a new explosive called <b>NITROPENTA.</b> The scale of the experiments was about 1 / 1000 per kiloton. Diagnostics included schlieren photography and a high-speed pressure measurement system. A parametric series of height-of-burst (HOB) experiments were conducted over hydrodynamically smooth and rough surfaces. Peak pressure measurements were used to construct isobaric HOB curves. We found that the experimental HOB curves were significantly below those based on the von Neumann two-shock theory in the transition region between regular and Mach reflection. This effect surpresses the extended "knees" in the HOB curves in the low pressure regime (Delta p equal or smaller than 1 bar). This trend was confirmed by comparison with data from large-scale field tests that employed much larger charges (1 to 500 kg) ...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure the airblast environment generated by the detonation of buried HE charges. Spherical 0. 5 -g charges of <b>Nitropenta</b> were used as the HE source. Three ground materials were used: (1) a porous, crushable grout (dry YTONG); (2) a water-saturated grout (wet YTONG); (3) a clay-loam material. Diagnostics consisted of 16 flush-mounted pressure gauges, and single-frame schlieren photography. Analysis of the pressure measurements resulted in an experimental definition of the airblast environment {{as a function of}} ground range (GR) and depth of burst (DOB). Synthesis of these results allowed one to construct airblast DOB curves. As in field tests, we found that airblast wave forms changed character with increasing DOB: for small DOBs, the wave forms had a classical blast wave character; for intermediate DOBs, a "front-porch" waveform was observed; while for deeper bursts, only compressional waveforms were found. The cube-root-scaled crater characteri stics (e. g., depth and volume) were in qualitative agreement with data from field tests. We conclude that the present experimental technique provides a useful tool for parametric investigations of explosion effects in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|Strongly-coupled, non-ideal plasmas with Γ-parameters ≥ 1 in {{the density}} regime up to 10 22 e- /cm 3 and {{temperatures}} between 1 - 10 eV and their interaction with heavy ions beams {{are of interest}} for basic research in ICF and laboratory astrophysics. Especially a deviation from the Zeff 2 behaviour of the energy loss of the ions in the plasma is expected [1]. At the Z 6 experimental area at GSI non-ideal plasmas can be created by shockwaves originating from the detonation of a high explosive, 360 mg <b>Nitropenta</b> (NP) or 55 g RDX. The shockwave compresses Xe-gas in a glass-tube and a plasma layer is formed infront of the schockfront that propagates through the target [2]. The experimental set-up completed in summer and commissioned in a test beam-time in August 2001 ressembles the one used at the ITEP Moscow for measurements with proton beams [3]. temperature Te are the shockwave velocity and initial Xe-gas pressure from which these two parameters can be calculated by a code developed at the ICP, Chernogolovka. The shockwave velocity was diagnosed by two methods, with a streak camera recording the light emission from {{the passage of the}} shock front through the glass tube. Additionally there is a fiber-optical system, consisting of 4 fibers with 300 µm core-diameter which are placed equidistantly in the fiber-holder along the glass tube Each fiber is connected to a photodiode and the signals from the photodiodes are recorded with a TDS 744 oscilloscope. The time-delay between the recorded light-signals on the oscilloscope enabled an online estimation of the shockwave velocity. Target-Nr. Pressure (bar) vsh (mm/µs) vsh (mm/µs) ...|$|E
