Its logical consequence is the need to shape the mentality of the entrepreneurs and make them understand the importance of standards and their value in a competitive market. It is the intention of the authors of this study to disclose the main aspects of standardisation at both Polish and European level, explain the model of standardisation system currently functioning in Poland, and against this background highlight the priorities in the standardisation policy adopted by the European Union, especially as regards some specific subjects, including – among others – problems related with environmental protection and occupational safety. In standardisation system, the problems of occupational safety and environmental protection are dealt with by a large group of standards harmonised with the <b>New</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Directive,</b> which touches on the safety–related issues. Our knowledge of standards speaking the language of business is the challenge of modern times that should not be rejected, as in many cases it determines our competitiveness in the common market.

50|$|Compliance to {{type-approval}} requirements can be {{denoted by}} a third-party marking {{on the back}} of the product (e.g. ABS, TUV,UL, CSA), or by a Type-Approval certificate obtained by a manufacturer and kept on file. The CE mark found {{on the back of}} many electronic devices does not mean that the product has obtained Type Approval in the European Union. The CE mark is the manufacturer's declaration that the system/assembly meets the MINIMUM safety requirements of all the Directives (laws) applicable to it, and of itself, does not signify any Third Party involvement in the design or testing of a system/assembly. Many of the <b>New</b> <b>Approach</b> safety <b>directives</b> do not mandate third party involvement at all (e.g. LVD, EMD), and the ones that do (e.g. PED, MDD, ATEX) only require Notified Body (NoBo) involvement above a certain degree of risk category. When the risk category mandates this involvement, the CE Marking on the system/assembly will be followed by the NoBo number, which right to use is granted by the NoBo after the required design review, testing or auditing, as spelled out in the Conformity Assessment options of each Directive.

This approach is based on the fact, that basically the process of supervision is a learning process where the supervision took the role of teacher, in the sense of supervisors berperana as teachers, and teachers as students of a learning relationship to other learning. The bottom line is that this approach should examine important elements in the next stage of development of teachers to use in establishing a relationship and approach to supervision, where supervisors work together with teachers. This is done, because of differences in the characteristics of the study (teacher). The differences of these characteristics is closely related to two important elements of the effectiveness of teacher professionalism in performing their duties, namely the commitment and ability to think abstraks.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} current challenges that Japanese language teachers are facing in New Zealand secondary schools. There {{have been many}} studies on the challenges of foreign language provision in New Zealand, but my research is different from most others in that its {{focus is on the}} teacher’s perspective. Because of the difficulties of formulating a hypothesis {{due to a lack of}} past studies on this topic from the point of view of the teachers, I needed a research methodology that would allow me to start collecting data without a theoretical framework. For this reason, I adopted grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) as my methodology. The data were collected through two focus group discussions and follow-up individual face-to-face interviews. A total of 12 in-service secondary school teachers of Japanese in the Auckland area, six of whom were native speaker teachers (NSTs) and six non-native speaker teachers (NNSTs), participated in my research. My assumption prior to data collection was that the teachers’ main challenges would be relating to the <b>new</b> teaching <b>approaches</b> or assessments recently introduced under The New Zealand Curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2007 b). However, what emerged as a significantly recurring theme from data analysis was the apparent lack of value being placed on foreign language education due to the “English-is-enough” mind-set that prevails in New Zealand society. Students do not perceive foreign language skills as being relevant career skills and careers advisors in schools do not recommend foreign language study either. As a result, the take-up and retention rates of students studying foreign languages in secondary schools have been declining and, of all the foreign languages, Japanese has been hit the hardest with a 55. 5 percent decrease since 1996. The repercussions of “non-value of foreign language education” are the same for the NSTs and NNSTs of Japanese. They include the need to create learning and teaching resources because of a lack of textbook aligned to learning, teaching and assessment of Japanese in secondary schools; organisation of multi-level classes and inadequate classroom time; and student demotivation to study Japanese because it is not seen as being important for their futures. The teachers were more concerned about these challenges than about the <b>new</b> teaching <b>approaches,</b> intercultural communicative language teaching (iCLT) and task-based language learning (TBLT). This could indicate that teaching Japanese in secondary schools in the current socio-cultural context in New Zealand, could be impeding their transition to the <b>new</b> <b>approaches.</b> Government <b>directives</b> to make foreign language education compulsory and to identify Japanese as a priority language, like those made by the Australian Government, would raise the status of Japanese. However, public attitudes towards the value of foreign language education may take generations to change. In the meantime, the teachers in my research are employing a number of strategies to improve student numbers but their attempts are not always successful. Based on the respective strengths of the NSTs and NNSTs identified in the research, I conclude my thesis with a number of recommendations, which involve active networking and collaboration, to help the teachers resolve some of their challenges as well as to motivate students...|$|R

The New Approach involves the development of legislation specifying only the essential requirements that are general and mandatory. The main principles of the New Approach, Old Approach and Global Approach are given in the course. The core of the course is the New Approach which deals with large families of products.

40|$|Foreword]. This article {{arises from}} private conversations with {{industry}} {{and other sources}} over the past 5 or so years about their general impressions of {{the workings of the}} European Union (EU) Internal Market. Those discussions concerned primarily the development and cementing of the level playing field in the manufacture, sale and use of products subject to EU <b>New</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>directives</b> intended to abolish technical barriers to trade. Those directives are made under Article 100 A of the Treaty of Rome and provide a framework for the manufacture and supply of such products. Whilst the directives themselves are considered generally to be working well, making the level playing field a clearer reality is proving more troublesome. There are many possible reasons for this. One of the most likely is that serious attention is only just starting to be paid to the need for concerted action by the current 15 EU member States to ensure that measures are in place and working properly to check that directives are being fairly and evenly implemented and administered across the EU. However, who or what checks the enforcers to ensure that they understand directives’ requirements properly and place no unnecessary burdens on those affected by them? Government officials in the Member States have policy responsibility for ensuring that directives are implemented and administered faithfully. But disputes concerning a product’s right to bear the CE marking or alleged barriers to trade in such products, for example, {{are more likely to be}} referred to lawyers …… and ultimately the Courts, ending with the European Court of Justice. This is a lengthy and expensive process. Business is calling increasingly for measures to avoid such experiences; to provide faster remedies, and to weed out only the most contentious cases for consideration by the Courts. An Internal Market Ombudsman (IMO) possibly provides one remedy. Such a facility is not without precedent and could hold one of the keys to Making the Internal Market Work!
