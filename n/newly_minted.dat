5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> Gang of Seven, railed against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{declared}} its independence on September 21, 1991 after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow by the CPSU hardliners. Greece {{became the first}} country to recognize the <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> Armenian nation a few days later. Tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan continued to escalate, ultimately leading to {{the outbreak of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh War. Despite a cease-fire in place since 1994, Armenia has yet to resolve its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Soviet Union itself ceased to exist on December 26, 1991 and Armenia became an sovereign independent state in the international stage. The United States recognized Armenia's independence a day before.|$|E

50|$|The coins of Apollodotus II are of {{different}} qualities. Some {{still have the}} realistic portraits characteristic of the earlier Indo-Greek coins, and Bopearachchi attributes these series to {{the western part of}} his kingdom. Others are badly struck and/or have clumsy and distorted portraits, and these Bopearachchi interprets as belonging to <b>newly</b> opened <b>mints</b> in eastern Punjab, presumably struck by Indian celators with little knowledge of Greek engraving skills.|$|R
500|$|In October 1795, <b>newly</b> {{appointed}} <b>Mint</b> Director Elias Boudinot {{ordered that}} the legal fineness of [...]892 (89.2%) silver {{be used for the}} dollar rather than the unauthorized fineness of [...]900 (90%) silver that had been used since the denomination was first minted in 1794. Due largely to a decrease in the amount of silver deposited at the Philadelphia Mint, coinage of silver dollars declined throughout the latter years of the 18thcentury. In 1804, coinage of silver dollars was halted; the last date used during regular mint production was 1803.|$|R
5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} Charles W. Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> senator, Bradley was not chosen as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E

Other contenders were Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and Eritrean Samuel Tsegay. Kenya was the defending champion in the team race.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Mathieu-Philibert Sérurier, 1st Comte Sérurier (8 December 1742 – 21 December 1819) led a {{division}} in the War of the First Coalition and became a Marshal of France under Emperor Napoleon. He was born into the minor nobility and in 1755 joined the Laon militia which was soon sent {{to fight in the}} Seven Years' War. After transferring into the regular army as an ensign, he was wounded at Warburg in 1760. He fought in the Spanish-Portuguese War in 1762. He married in 1779 after a promotion to captain. A <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> major in 1789, the French Revolution sped up promotion so that he was colonel of the regiment in 1792. After leading Army of Italy troops in a number of actions, he became a general of brigade in 1793 and a general of division the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, the <b>newly</b> {{established}} Philadelphia <b>Mint</b> began striking {{cents and}} half cents. Coinage {{of precious metal}} was delayed; Congress required the assayer and chief coiner to each post a security bond of $10,000, a huge sum in 1793. In 1794, Congress lowered the chief coiner's bond to $5,000, and the assayer's to $1,000; President Washington's appointees to those positions were thus able to qualify and take office. Subsequently, silver coinage began that year.|$|R

5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E

5000|$|In 1546, in a {{development}} which {{ultimately led to}} his downfall, Sharington became 'under-treasurer' of a <b>newly</b> re-established <b>mint</b> at Bristol Castle. Despite its title, this position was in effect that of {{the master of the}} mint, and it carried a salary of 200 marks (or £133, 6s, 8d) a year. With a staff of six men, including an engraver, Bristol was the only mint outside London to make gold coins, and also the only one apart from that at the Tower of London to have its own engraver. As well as English coins, it also produced the coinage of Ireland. [...] In 1547, Sharington was appointed to commissions to report on the king's mints and on the Admiralty, as a chantry commissioner for Gloucestershire, Gloucester, and the city of Bristol, and as a Justice of the Peace for Wiltshire.|$|R

In early 16th century he was made a {{high-ranking}} official at the Kraków mint. Soon after, in the year 1504 he moved to Kaunas, where he became prominent and influential citizen. Later Hosius relocated to Vilnius where he headed the <b>newly</b> opened Lithuanian <b>Mint</b> and took the offices of mayor (Castellan) of Vilnius between 1524 and 1535 and Flag-bearer of Vilnius Castle during the years 1528-1535.|$|R
500|$|The obverse {{design for}} the nickel debuting in 2006 was {{designed}} by Franki. [...] It depicts a forward-facing Jefferson based on an 1800 study by Rembrandt Peale, and includes [...] "Liberty" [...] in Jefferson's script. [...] According to Acting Mint Director David Lebryk, [...] "The image of a forward-facing Jefferson is a fitting tribute to [...] vision." [...] The reverse beginning in 2006 was again Schlag's Monticello design, but <b>newly</b> sharpened by <b>Mint</b> engravers. [...] As Schlag's obverse design, on which his initials were placed in 1966, is no longer used, his initials {{were placed on the}} reverse to the right of Monticello.|$|R

500|$|In mid-1835, <b>newly</b> {{appointed}} <b>Mint</b> Director Robert M. Patterson engaged artists Titian Peale and Thomas Sully {{to create}} new designs for American coinage. In an August 1, 1835, letter, Patterson proposed that Sully create an obverse design consisting of Liberty seated on a boulder, holding a [...] "liberty pole" [...] {{in her right hand}} topped by a pileus, the headgear given by the Romans to an emancipated slave. He also asked Sully to create a reverse design consisting of an [...] "eagle flying, and rising in flight, amidst the constellation irregularly dispersed of twenty-four stars". Patterson requested that the bird appear natural; he criticized the eagle designs then in use on the nation's coinage as being unnatural primarily because of the shield placed on the eagle's breast. Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass prepared a sketch based on Patterson's conception, but suffered a stroke, leaving him partially paralyzed. Later in 1835, Christian Gobrecht was hired at the Mint as a draftsman, die sinker, and assistant engraver to Kneass. Although nominally a subordinate, Gobrecht would perform much of the engraving work for the Mint until Kneass' death in 1840, when Gobrecht was appointed chief engraver.|$|R
500|$|One {{provision}} in Morris' legislation called for President Washington to be depicted on the obverse side of every coin {{struck by the}} new mint. The bill passed the Senate after debate, but it was altered in the House of Representatives to instead call for {{the head of an}} allegorical figure representing Liberty to appear. Upon returning to the Senate, the upper house insisted on its version of the design provision. The House rejected the provision for the second time and passed another version of the bill, after which the Senate concurred. The law, known as the Coinage Act of 1792, was signed into law on April 2, 1792, by President Washington. The Act provided for the creation of the United States Mint, and appropriated money to meet the cost of construction of an appropriate facility, and for salaries for employees and officials. The denominations sanctioned under the Act were half cents, cents, half dismes, dismes, quarter dollars, half dollars, dollars, quarter eagles, half eagles and eagles. On July 31, 1792, the foundation stone of the Philadelphia Mint was laid by <b>newly</b> appointed <b>Mint</b> Director David Rittenhouse. Machinery and personnel began occupying the new building by September 1792, and production began on cents in February 1793. In the first year of production at the Mint, only copper coins were minted, as the prospective assayer could not raise the required $10,000 surety to officially assume the position; the 1792 Coinage Act stated that both the chief coiner and assayer were to [...] "become bound to the United States of America, with one or more sureties to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury, in the sum of ten thousand dollars". Later that year, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson appealed to Congress that the amount of the bonds be lowered. On March 3, 1794, Congress lowered the bonds to $5,000 and $1,000 for chief coiner and assayer, respectively.|$|R

25|$|The {{spiritual and}} mystical yearnings of many Jews {{remained}} frustrated {{after the death}} of Isaac Luria and his disciples and colleagues. No hope was in sight for many following the devastation and mass killings of the pogroms that followed {{in the wake of the}} Chmielnicki Uprising (1648–1654), the largest single massacre of Jews until the Holocaust, and it was at this time that a controversial scholar by the name of Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) captured the hearts and minds of the Jewish masses of that time with the promise of a <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> messianic Millennialism in the form of his own personage.|$|E
25|$|In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a {{platform}} that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman Newt Gingrich called the Contract with America, which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the president with a line-item veto, and welfare reform.

25|$|The {{struggles of}} <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> closer Blake Treinen {{in the ninth}} inning {{prompted}} manager Dusty Baker to announce on April 19 that closing duties would be shared between relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover.

Glover earned his first career save on April 22, coming into the ninth inning with two outs and retiring the only batter he faced. However, he landed on the disabled list with a left hip impingement on April 26, and left-handed reliever Matt Grace was recalled.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Eastern Han dynasty, due to natural {{disasters}} and social unrest, {{the economy was}} badly depressed, leading to the massive waste of farmland. Some local landlords and aristocracy established their own strongholds to defend themselves and developed agriculture, which gradually evolved into a self-sufficient manorial system. The system of strongholds and manors also had effects on the economical mode of following dynasties. In addition, because {{of the collapse of}} the imperial court, those worn copper coins were not melted and reminted and many privately minted coins appeared. In the Three Kingdoms period, <b>newly</b> <b>minted</b> coins never made their way into currency. Due to the collapse of the coinage, Cao Wei officially declared silk cloth and grains as the main currencies in 221.|$|E
