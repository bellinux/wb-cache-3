The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E

40|$|Emotional distracters impair {{cognitive}} function. Emotional processing is dysregulated in {{affective disorders}} such as depression, phobias, schizophrenia, and PTSD. Among the processes impaired by emotional distracters, and whose dysregulation is documented in affective disorders, {{is the ability to}} time in the seconds-to-minutes range, i. e. interval timing. Presentation of task-irrelevant distracters during a timing task results in a delay in responding suggesting a failure to maintain subjective time in working memory, possibly due to attentional and working memory resources being diverted away from timing, as proposed by the Relative Time-Sharing model. We investigated the role of the prelimbic cortex in the detrimental effect of anxiety-inducing task-irrelevant distracters on the cognitive ability to keep track of time, using local infusions of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor <b>nomifensine</b> in a modified peak-interval procedure with neutral and anxiety-inducing distracters. Given that some antidepressants have beneficial effects on attention and working memory, e. g., decreasing emotional response to negative events, we hypothesized that <b>nomifensine</b> would improve maintenance of information in working memory in trials with distracters, resulting in a decrease of the disruptive effect of emotional events on the timekeeping abilities. Our results revealed a dissociation of the effects of <b>nomifensine</b> infusion in prelimbic cortex between interval timing and resource allocation, and between neutral and anxiety-inducing distraction. <b>Nomifensine</b> was effective only during trials with distracters, but not during trials without distracters. <b>Nomifensine</b> reduced the detrimental effect of the distracters only when the distracters were anxiety-inducing, but not when they were neutral.

40|$|SUMMARY A 4. linical trial {{using the}} {{anti-depressant}} drug <b>nomifensine</b> in Parkinsonism is reported* Eighteen subjects not receiving levodopa participated.

In {{the treatment of}} Parkinsonism' <b>nomifensine</b> may be considered {{as an alternative to}} amantadine or anticholinergics, especially where depression is an added feature. In a previous study 1 the tetrabydroisoquinoline antidepressant, <b>nomifensine,</b> was shown to be an effective addition to treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. This agent had previously been demonstrated in animals to facilitate both dopa-minergic and noradrenergic transmission in the central nervous system. 2 - 4 It has been suggested, on the basis of animal studies that for optimal anti-Parkinson effect a treatment should augment both dopaminergic and noradrenergic transmission. 5 In the earlier study by Teychenne and his colleagues,' the majority of patients were concomitantly receiving levodopa and this made it difficult to assess the rela-tive anti-Parkinson efficacy of <b>nomifensine.</b> We wished to define more clearly the potency of nomi-fensine used alone as a treatment for Parkinson's disease and so in the present study we included only those patients who had not previously received levodopa or bromocriptine.

40|$|Rats {{learn to}} lever-press for {{phencyclidine}} (PCP; NMDA channel blocker and dopamine uptake inhibitor), MK- 801 (NMDA channel blocker), and <b>nomifensine</b> (dopamine uptake inhibitor) infusions {{directly into the}} shell but not the core subterritory of the nucleus accumbens septi (NAS). PCP, MK- 801 and <b>nomifensine</b> are thought, through different means, to inhibit a final common path: NAS intrinsic GABAergic output neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Independent groups of animals were tested to determine whether infusions of PCP, MK- 801, or <b>nomifensine</b> directly into the core or shell subterritory of the NAS would induce Fos expression within the VTA. Each rat received a total of 26 unilateral infusions (over a 60 min period) of PCP, MK- 801, <b>nomifensine</b> (12 nmol, 1. 2 nmol, or 1. 7 nmol respectively, per 120 nl infusion) or vehicle into either the NAS core or shell; each animal's infusions were "yoked" to the rate and pattern of administration of a rat that had previously learned to lever-press for PCP infusions. The rats were sacrificed and their brains were processed for histological analysis of Fos-immunoreactivity 75 min after the first infusion of drug. Each drug induced significantly more Fos-positive cells within the lateral and medial VTA. MK- 801 and PCP infused into the NAS shell, each induced more Fos within the medial VTA. Overall, Fos induction within the VTA was differentially expressed within the rostral to caudal levels of the VTA. In sum, the present thesis provides preliminary evidence linking suppression of intrinsic NAS GABAergic neurons, via both NMDA receptor and dopamine reuptake blockade, to the activation of neurons within the VTA...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{microdialysis}} {{was used}} to examine the effect of two new catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, Ro 40 - 7592 and OR- 611, on extracellular levels of dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) in rat striatum. The interactions of the COMT inhibitors with <b>nomifensine,</b> clorgyline, and deprenyl were also studied. Ro 40 - 7592 (3 - 30 mg/kg. i. p.) decreased dose-dependently the efflux of HVA, increased that of DOPAC, and tended to increase that of dopamine. Higher doses of OR- 611 (30 - 100 mg/kg, i. p.) also decreased the dialysate level of HVA, increased that of DOPAC, and tended to increase that of dopamine. Ro 40 - 7592 was about ten-fold as potent as OR- 611. Neither of the COMT inhibitors changed dialysate levels of 6 -HIAA. An OR- 611 dose of 10 mg/kg i. p. had no significant effect, in contrast to Ro 40 - 7592, on any of the parameters studied; this dose was thus used to differentiate between the effects of central and peripheral COMT inhibition. Both <b>nomifensine</b> (15 mg/kg, i. p.) and clorgyline (4 mg/kg, i. p.) alone elevated extracellular dopamine levels, and lowered those of DOPAC and HVA, though there were quantitative and temporal differences between the drugs. L-deprenyl (1 mg/kg, i. p.) alone had no significant effect on any of the compounds measured. Ro 40 - 7592 (10 mg/kg, i. p.) potentiated the effect of <b>nomifensine</b> on dopamine efflux, and it tended to increase clorgyline-induced dopamine efflux. DOPAC levels in dialysates were significantly increased by combinations of Ro 40 - 7592 and <b>nomifensine</b> or clorgyline, whereas HVA remained about as low as they were after Ro 40 - 7592 alone. Ro 40 - 7592 had no significant interactions with L-deprenyl. OR- 611 (10 mg/kg, i. p.) did not modify the effects on dopamine metabolism of <b>nomifensine,</b> clorgyline, or L-deprenyl. These data show that Ro 40 - 7592 is a potent centrally active COMT inhibitor, whereas OR- 611 is principally a peripherally active inhibitor. Use of drugs which inhibit brain COMT can considerably modify dopamine metabolism. COMT inhibitors may be of clinical significance in treating Parkinson's disease...|$|E
