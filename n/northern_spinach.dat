50|$|Eulithis populata, the <b>northern</b> <b>spinach,</b> is a moth of {{the genus}} Eulithis in the family Geometridae.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{wingspan}} is 33-38 mm. The forewings are yellow {{marked with}} brown fascia and apical streak with brown chequering on the fringe. The hindwings are plain cream but are rarely {{seen as the}} species usually rests in a very distinctive and characteristic way with the forewings held out at 90° to the body with the hindwings hidden behind them. Some {{other members of the}} genus such as the <b>northern</b> <b>spinach</b> and barred straw rest in a similar way. The species flies at night from June to August [...] and is attracted to light.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoirs}} {{are surrounded}} by the Wyming Brook Nature Reserve {{which is part of}} the Eastern Peak District Moors Site of Special Scientific Interest. Wildlife in the reserve includes <b>northern</b> <b>spinach</b> and common lutestring moths as well as a host of birds both on and off the water. These include crossbill, white-throated dipper, mallard, coot, moorhen and grey heron; occasional visitors include cormorant, Canada goose and osprey. The flora around the reservoirs consist mostly of deciduous and evergreen woodland; in autumn many species of fungi are on display including Jew‘s ear, plums and custard and amethyst deceiver. In recent years Yorkshire Water have conducted trials on releasing different volumes of water from the Lower reservoir and monitoring the effects on the River Rivelin. This has resulted in being able to create better conditions for brown trout spawning and an increase in the population of bullhead.|$|E
