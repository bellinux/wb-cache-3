5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times,</b> <b>in</b> 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration.

As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times,</b> <b>in</b> which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E

One specific mention of the ship is found in a report in The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> 1937, when the newspaper reported West Cobalts arrival in New York on 30 October, ten days after sailing from New Orleans.|$|E

Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very familiar to the audience.|$|E

A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal {{was first}} told about Braunsteiner in early 1964 via a chance {{encounter}} in Tel Aviv {{with someone who}} had seen her performing selections at Majdanek—deciding who was to be assigned to slave labour and who was to immediately be killed in the gas chambers. When he returned to Vienna he had an operative visit one of her relatives to clandestinely collect information. Wiesenthal soon traced Braunsteiner's whereabouts to Queens, New York, so he notified the Israeli police and the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>In</b> spite of Wiesenthal's efforts to expedite the matter, Braunsteiner was not extradited to Germany until 1973. Her trial {{was part of a}} joint indictment with nine other defendants accused of killing 250,000 people at Majdanek. She was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1981 and died in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In Janáček's 70th year (1924) his {{biography}} {{was published by}} Max Brod, and he was interviewed by Olin Downes for The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>In</b> 1925 he retired from teaching, but continued composing and was awarded the first honorary doctorate to be given by Masaryk University in Brno. In the spring of 1926 he created his Sinfonietta, a monumental orchestral work, which rapidly gained wide critical acclaim. In the same year he went to England {{at the invitation of}} Rosa Newmarch. A number of his works were performed in London, including his first string quartet, the wind sextet Youth, and his violin sonata. Shortly after, and still in 1926, he started to compose a setting to an Old Church Slavonic text. The result was the large-scale orchestral Glagolitic Mass. Janáček was an atheist, and critical of the organised Church, but religious themes appear frequently in his work. The Glagolitic Mass was partly inspired by the suggestion by a clerical friend, and partly by Janáček's wish to celebrate the anniversary of Czechoslovak independence.|$|E
