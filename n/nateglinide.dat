40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is a progressive disease with an insidious onset. It {{is thought to}} affect up to 10 % of European and North American populations with a significantly higher incidence in non-White than in White populations. Complications of the disease are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and their management consumes significant healthcare resources. Data from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study have shown that intensive glycemic control reduces the microvascular complications of type 2 disease and that intensive management of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels is insufficient over time to provide such control. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} lowering postprandial plasma (PPG) glucose levels provides some additional glycemic control and recent epidemiologic data suggest reducing PPG levels may be associated with a reduction in mortality. In patients with type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}} inadequately controlled by diet and exercise, <b>nateglinide</b> significantly improved glycemic control compared with placebo; a beneficial effect on both FPG and PPG levels was observed. In active comparator studies, <b>nateglinide</b> {{has been shown to be}} as effective as metformin (in pharmacotherapy-naive patients), acarbose and troglitazone in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) levels. When used in combination with metformin (in patients inadequately controlled on maximum dosages of metformin monotherapy) <b>nateglinide</b> significantly improves glycemic control compared with placebo. In addition, <b>nateglinide</b> has been shown to display pronounced additive effects when added to troglitazone or metformin in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone. <b>Nateglinide</b> was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. The most common adverse event was hypoglycemia, although the incidence was low in comparison with sulfonylureas. The incidence of hypoglycemia was increased in patients using <b>nateglinide</b> in combination with metformin. By controlling HbA 1 c and PPG, <b>nateglinide</b> has the potential to provide substantial health and quality-of-life benefits; however, long-term outcome data and validated quality-of-life assessments are lacking.

A phenylalanine deriv-ative, <b>nateglinide</b> is chemically and phar-macologically distinct from currently avail-able oral antidiabetic agents (1, 2). Animal and human studies have shown that <b>nateglinide</b> taken before meals stimulates the rapid and transient secretion of insulin and reduces or eliminates mealtime glucose excursions with minimal hyperinsulinemia or risk of hypoglycemia (2 – 9). Repaglinide is an insulin secretagogue of the meglitinide class with a faster onset and shorter duration of action than sul-fonylureas (10). In clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, repaglinide provided a similar degree of overall glycemic control to that obtained with glibenclamide but more effectively controlled meal-related glucose excursions (10). Repaglinide is generally well tolerated; however, as with sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia is a potentially dose-limiting side effect (10). Despite sharing a similar mechanism of action by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potas-sium channels in pancreatic -cells (6), the molecular kinetics of <b>nateglinide</b> and repaglinide action differ considerably. <b>Nateglinide</b> imparts a three times more rapid and five times less persistent inhibi-tion of -cell KATP channels than repaglin-ide (11).

40|$|Nicholas Tentolouris, Christina Voulgari, Nicholas Katsilambros 1 st Department of Propaedeutic Medicine, Athens University Medical School, Laiko General Hospital, Athens, GreeceAbstract: Impaired insulin {{secretion}} occurs {{early in}} the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and is chronic and progressive, resulting initially in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and eventually in T 2 DM. As most patients with T 2 DM have both insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, therapy for T 2 DM should aim to control not only fasting, but also postprandial plasma glucose levels. While oral glucose-lowering treatment with metformin and thiazolidinediones corrects fasting plasma glucose, these agents do not {{address the problem of}} mealtime glucose spikes that have been shown to trigger atherogenic processes. <b>Nateglinide</b> is a derivative of the amino acid D-phenylalanine, which acts directly on the pancreatic β-cells to stimulate insulin secretion. <b>Nateglinide</b> monotherapy controls significantly mealtime hyperglycemia and results in improved overall glycemic control in patients with T 2 DM by reducing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) levels. The combination of <b>nateglinide</b> with insulin-sensitising agents, such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, targets both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance and results in reductions in HbA 1 c that could not be achieved by monotherapy with other antidiabetic agents.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter {{study was conducted in}} 152 patients who received either <b>nateglinide</b> (120 mg before three meals daily, n 5 51), glyburide (5 mg q. d. titrated to 10 mg q. d. after 2 weeks, n 5 50), or placebo (n 5 51) for 8 weeks. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide profiles during liquid meal challenges were measured at weeks 0 and 8. At weeks 21 and 7, 19 -point daytime glucose and insulin profiles, comprising three solid meals, were measured. RESULTS — During the liquid-meal challenge, <b>nateglinide</b> reduced the incremental glucose area under the curve (AUC) more effectively than glyburide (D 5 24. 94 vs. 22. 71 mmol z h/l, P, 0. 05), whereas glyburide reduced fasting plasma glucose more effectively than <b>nateglinide</b> (D 5 22. 9 vs. 21. 0 mmol/l, respectively, P, 0. 001). In contrast, C-peptide induced by glyburide was greater than that induced by <b>nateglinide</b> (D 5 11. 83 vs. 10. 95 nmol z h/l, P, 0. 01), and only glyburide increased fasting insulin levels.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: GH causes insulin resistance, impairs glycemic {{control and}} {{increases}} the risk of vascular diabetic complications. Sulphonylureas stimulate GH secretion and this study was undertaken to investigate the possible stimulatory effect of repaglinide and <b>nateglinide,</b> two novel oral glucose regulators, on critical steps of the stimulus-secretion coupling in single rat somatotrophs. METHODS: Patch-clamp techniques were used to record whole-cell ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) and delayed outward K(+) currents, membrane potential and Ca(2 +) -dependent exocytosis. GH release was measured from perifused rat somatotrophs. RESULTS: Both <b>nateglinide</b> and repaglinide dose-dependently suppressed K(ATP) channel activity with half-maximal inhibition being observed at 413 nM and 13 nM respectively. Both compounds induced action potential firing in the somatotrophs irrespective of whether GH-releasing hormone was present or not. The stimulation of electrical activity by <b>nateglinide,</b> but not repaglinide, was associated with an increased mean duration of the action potentials. The latter effect correlated with a reduction of the delayed outward K(+) current, which accounts for action potential repolarization. The latter effect had a K(d) of 19 microM but was limited to 38 % inhibition. When applied at concentrations similar to those required to block K(ATP) channels, <b>nateglinide</b> in addition potentiated Ca(2 +) -evoked exocytosis 3. 3 -fold (K(d) = 3 microM) and stimulated GH release 4. 5 -fold. The latter effect was not shared by repaglinide. The stimulation of exocytosis by <b>nateglinide</b> was mimicked by cAMP and antagonized by the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS. CONCLUSION: <b>Nateglinide</b> stimulates GH release by inhibition of plasma membrane K(+) channels, elevation of cytoplasmic cAMP levels and stimulation of Ca(2 +) -dependent exocytosis. By contrast, the effect of repaglinide was confined to inhibition of the K(ATP) channels...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} renal impairment (RI) (estimated creatinine clearance [Cl(cr) ] or = 1 postbaseline safety evaluation received monotherapy with <b>nateglinide</b> (n = 2, 204), metformin (n = 436), glyburide (n = 293), or placebo (n = 769). Efficacy (HbA(1 c)) was evaluated in pooled data from four studies with similar design using 120 mg <b>nateglinide</b> (n = 544) versus placebo (n = 521). Evaluations were performed in the overall population and subgroups of patients over age 64 years. Specific considerations were given to RI, comorbidity, and baseline HbA(1 c). RESULTS: Patients over age 64 years (n = 1, 170) represented 31. 6 % of the study population. Undiagnosed RI was common in the elderly with 83. 4 % of all patients being in this subgroup. Patients over 64 years with RI had a higher prevalence of cardio- and microvascular comorbidity compared with the overall population and all patients over age 64 years. Statistically significant HbA(1 c) reductions versus placebo were observed with <b>nateglinide</b> in patients over age 64 years and elderly with RI patients at study end point (- 0. 9 % and - 1. 1 % in each subgroup, P < 0. 01). <b>Nateglinide</b> was well tolerated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia in all subgroups, including those with RI and low baseline HbA(1 c). CONCLUSIONS: RI and comorbidity are common in patients over age 64 years with type 2 diabetes. <b>Nateglinide</b> was effective and well tolerated in all treated patients. In subgroups in which metformin and long-acting sulfonylureas must be used with caution, <b>nateglinide</b> had a low risk of adverse events and hypoglycemia...|$|E
40|$|Impaired insulin {{secretion}} occurs {{early in}} the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and is chronic and progressive, resulting initially in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and eventually in T 2 DM. As most patients with T 2 DM have both insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, therapy for T 2 DM should aim to control not only fasting, but also postprandial plasma glucose levels. While oral glucose-lowering treatment with metformin and thiazolidinediones corrects fasting plasma glucose, these agents do not {{address the problem of}} mealtime glucose spikes that have been shown to trigger atherogenic processes. <b>Nateglinide</b> is a derivative of the amino acid D-phenylalanine, which acts directly on the pancreatic β-cells to stimulate insulin secretion. <b>Nateglinide</b> monotherapy controls significantly mealtime hyperglycemia and results in improved overall glycemic control in patients with T 2 DM by reducing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) levels. The combination of <b>nateglinide</b> with insulin-sensitising agents, such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, targets both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance and results in reductions in HbA 1 c that could not be achieved by monotherapy with other antidiabetic agents. In prediabetic subjects with IGT, <b>nateglinide</b> restores early insulin secretion and reduces postprandial hyperglycemia. <b>Nateglinide</b> has an excellent safety and tolerability profile and provides a lifetime flexibility that other antidiabetic agents could not accomplish. The aim of this review is to identify <b>nateglinide</b> as an effective “gate-keeper” in T 2 DM, since it restores early-phase insulin secretion and prevents mealtime glucose spikes throughout the day and to evaluate the results of ongoing research into its potential role in delaying the progression to overt diabetes and reducing its complications and mortality...|$|E

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 20 subjects (10 female, 10 male) with non–insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes were admitted overnight to the General Clinical Research Center on four occasions. In random order, 10 mg glipizide (30 min premeal), 120 mg <b>nateglinide</b> (15 min premeal), 10 mg glipizide plus <b>nateglinide</b> (30 and 15 min premeal, respec-tively), or placebo pills (30 and 15 min premeal) were administered in a double-blind fashion before a standardized breakfast. Blood was drawn for analysis of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide at 0. 05, 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h relative to the meal. RESULTS — The subjects were aged 56 2 years and were moderately obese (BMI 31 1 kg/m 2), with a mean HbA 1 c of 7. 4 0. 4 %. The peak postprandial glucose excursion above baseline was higher with placebo (6. 1 0. 5 mmol/l) than glipizide (4. 3 0. 6 mmol/l, P 0. 002), <b>nateglinide</b> (4. 2 0. 4 mmol/l, P 0. 001), or glipizide plus <b>nateglinide</b> (4. 1 0. 5 mmol/l, P 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a clinical}} syndrome characterised by hyperglycaemia caused by absolute or relative deficiency of insulin. Persistent hyperglycaemia leads to both micro and macrovascular complication, so a treatment goal is recommended. To achieve that various drug either as monotherapy {{or in combination}} is used. MATERIAL AND METHOD Forty patients having type 2 diabetes mellitus were selected randomly, those who are taking <b>nateglinide</b> alone or metformin in combination with <b>nateglinide.</b> Patients were divided in to two groups, each group having 20 patients, group 1 were taking <b>nateglinide</b> 60 mg and group 2 were taking <b>nateglinide</b> 60 mg plus metformin 500 mg. Metabolic parameters that are FPG, PPPG, Fasting, C- Peptide, HDL level, TG Level, LDL level and serum cholesterol were studied before {{and at the end}} of the study that is 16 weeks. RESULT There was significant reduction in FPG and PPPG in both the groups having p value <. 0001. Fasting C-peptide level change was more significant in group 2 than group 1, that is 19. 0...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nateglinide,</b> a novel D-phenylalanine derivative, stimulates insulin release via {{closure of}} KATP {{channels}} in pancreatic β-cell, a primary {{mechanism of action}} it shares with sulfonylureas (SUs) and repaglinide. This study investigated (1) the influence of ambient glucose levels on the insulinotropic effects of <b>nateglinide,</b> glyburide and repaglinide, and (2) {{the influence of the}} antidiabetic agents on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in vitro from isolated rat islets. The EC 50 of <b>nateglinide</b> to stimulate insulin secretion was 14 μM in the presence of 3 mM glucose and was reduced by 6 -fold in 8 mM glucose and by 16 -fold in 16 mM glucose, indicating a glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect. The actions of glyburide and repaglinide failed to demonstrate such a glucose concentration-dependent sensitization. When tested at fixed and equipotent concentrations (~ 2 x EC 50 in the presence of 8 mM glucose) <b>nateglinide</b> and repaglinide shifted the EC 50 s for GSIS to the left by 1. 7 mM suggesting an enhancement of islet glucose sensitivity, while glimepiride and glyburide caused, respectively, no change and a right shift of the EC 50. These data demonstrate that despite a common basic mechanism of action, the insulinotropic effects of different agents can be influenced differentially by ambient glucose and can differentially influence the islet responsiveness to glucose. Further, the present findings suggest that <b>nateglinide</b> may exert a more physiologic effect on insulin secretion than comparator agents and thereby have less propensity to elicit hypoglycemia in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Hereditarily {{diabetic}} Goto-Kakizaki rats were infused for 5 min with saline, containing {{as required}} <b>nateglinide</b> or mixed molecules (HD 154 and HD 166) {{with both a}} <b>nateglinide</b> moiety and a succinic acid ester moiety. The dose of these agents given intravenously amounted to 5. 0 nmol/g body weight in all cases. All agents provoked a comparable early increase in plasma insulin concentration. However, HD 154 and HD 166, but not <b>nateglinide</b> itself, also caused a secondary rise in plasma insulin concentration 30 min after their infusion. It is proposed that mixed molecules formed of both a hypoglycemic sulfonylurea or meglitinide analog and a succinic acid ester may be better able than the antidiabetic agents themselves to evoke a sustained stimulation of insulin release in non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

40|$|AbstractA {{stability}} indicating {{high performance}} {{thin layer chromatography}} (HPTLC) method was developed and validated for determination of two anti-diabetic drugs, <b>nateglinide</b> and metformin hydrochloride in co-formulations. Study was performed on pre-coated silica gel HPTLC plates using chloroform:ethyl acetate:acetic acid (4 : 6 : 0. 1 v/v/v) as the mobile phase. A TLC scanner set at 216 nm was used for direct evaluation of the chromatograms in the reflectance/absorbance mode. Method was validated according to ICH guidelines. The correlation coefficients of calibration curves {{were found to be}} 0. 996 and 0. 995 in the concentration range of 200 – 2400 and 500 – 3000 ngband− 1 for <b>nateglinide</b> and metformin, respectively. The method had an accuracy of 99. 72 % for <b>nateglinide</b> and 100. 08 % for metformin hydrochloride. The method had the potential to determine these drugs simultaneously from dosage forms without any interference of the tablets excipients. <b>Nateglinide</b> and metformin hydrochloride were also subjected to acid, base, oxidation, wet, heat and photo-degradation studies. The degradation products obtained were well resolved from the pure drugs with significantly different Rf values.
