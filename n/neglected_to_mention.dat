5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E

25|$|The {{television}} network was also criticized for allegedly biased coverage {{of events in}} the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, including the Bat Mitzvah massacre in 2002, where the network failed to note that the massacre victims were attending a bat mitzvah celebration for a 12-year-old girl, and <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> that the gunman crashed the event at a crowded banquet hall. When the Palestinian militant Raed Karmi was killed by the Israeli army, Al Jazeera was criticized for failing to mention Israeli accusations about how many people he had killed, which would have provided a context for the story.|$|E

During 10 February, Sacken advanced west to Trilport {{where there was a}} bridge over the Marne. Blücher recalled Sacken, instructing him to march east to Montmirail to rendezvous with Yorck, then clear the highway between there and Vertus.

25|$|The authors <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention,</b> however, that in 1910 Puusepp {{himself had}} {{performed}} surgery on {{the brains of}} three mentally ill patients, sectioning the cortex between the frontal and parietal lobes. He had abandoned these attempts because of unsatisfactory results and this experience probably inspired the invective that was directed at Burckhardt in the 1912 article. By 1937, Puusepp, despite his earlier criticism of Burckhardt, was increasingly persuaded that psychosurgery could be a valid medical intervention for the mentally disturbed. In the late 1930s he {{worked closely with the}} neurosurgical team of the Racconigi Hospital near Turin to establish it as an early and influential centre for the adoption of leucotomy in Italy.|$|E
25|$|The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation {{was created}} in 1888 in Montana. It was created from {{what had once been}} a much larger area of land to be set aside for tribes. The 1888 {{agreement}} <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> any water rights that were reserved for the reservation in relation to the Milk River. Soon there came a huge demand for water by non-Indian settlers which was an issue for the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation. As non-Indian settlers began moving closer to the Fort Belknap Reservation, the settlers claimed rights to the water. The settlers did things such as build dams and reservoirs which prevented the reservation from receiving water needed for agricultural purposes. The settlers used the terms of the Appropriative water system to support their actions claiming that they had appropriated the water before the American Indians living on the reservation had put the water to beneficial use.|$|E

500|$|W. G. Grace, the Victorian era's {{most famous}} cricketer, brought an English team to Australia in 1873–74. Wills {{was desperate to}} play for Victoria against Grace and rival cricketing factions fought over his {{possible}} inclusion. Hammersley, a selector, ensured his omission. Wills toured with the team, playing for country sides. Irked by Wills' constant presence, Grace remarked {{that he seemed to}} regard himself {{as a representative of the}} whole of Australia. It was assumed that, on his homeward journey, Grace would play a final match in the South Australian capital of Adelaide, but he bypassed the city when Kadina, a remote mining town in the Copper Triangle, offered him more money. Wills coached the locals. Played in an open, rock-strewn plain of baked earth, the game was deemed a farce. Wills made a pair and Grace later wrote derisively of the [...] "old Rugbeian" [...] as a has-been. Grace <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> that Wills bowled him, ending with 6/28.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} officially {{in the scientific}} literature by English mycologist Miles Berkeley in an 1873 publication. Berkeley obtained the specimens from Moses Ashley Curtis, which had in turn been sent to him by Ravenel from collections he made at the Santee River in South Carolina in 1846. Although the specimen had been sent with Ravenel's extensive collection notes, Berkeley's description was brief, and he <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the veil. American Curtis Gates Lloyd later disparaged the quality of Berkeley's description, and noted [...] "he was so busy {{that he could not}} take the time to consider the details, and his [...] "description" [...] tells nothing of the leading characters of the species." [...] Charles Horton Peck, upon encountering the fungus in North America, could not identify it using Berkeley's description, and instead had to contact Ravenel to obtain his original collection notes before he could confirm its identity. Peck later wrote a full description of the species. In 1898, Edward Angus Burt placed the taxon in the genus Dictyophora, based on the presence of the veil. Otto Kuntze transferred the taxon to the genus Aedycia (now equivalent with Mutinus), resulting in the synonym Aedycia ravenelii. The mushroom is commonly known as the eastern stinkhorn or Ravenel's stinkhorn.|$|E
500|$|In {{the face}} of this {{speculation}} over Brown's future, his ministers backed him to lead the party, and Harriet Harman and David Miliband denied that they were preparing leadership bids. After Labour lost the Glasgow East by-election in July, Harman, the deputy leader of the party, said that Brown was the [...] "solution", not the [...] "problem"; Home Secretary Smith, Justice Secretary Jack Straw, Schools Secretary Ed Balls and Cabinet Office Minister Ed Miliband all re-affirmed their support for Brown. The deputy Prime Minister under Blair, John Prescott, also pledged his support. Foreign Secretary David Miliband then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid, when on 30 July, an article written by him in The Guardian was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown. In the article, Miliband outlined the party's future, but <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the Prime Minister. Miliband, responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election, and that his article was an attack against the fatalism in the party since the loss of Glasgow-East. Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in {{the face of}} the challenge that emerged in September, as did Business Secretary John Hutton, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and Chief Whip Geoff Hoon.|$|E

500|$|Although some {{survivors}} {{disputed the}} accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded {{with many of the}} survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book History of the Donner Party declined to include some of the more morbid detailssuch as the suffering of the children and infants before death, or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: [...] "Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else." [...] She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.|$|E
500|$|James W. Springer of Northern Illinois University {{reviewed}} Arens' {{book for}} Anthropological Quarterly. He {{hoped that the}} book would in part have a positive legacy, in that it might make anthropologists look more closely and critically at their source material, and praised its criticism of the claims regarding Aztec cannibalism. He nevertheless proclaimed that Arens was [...] "almost certainly wrong", making use of faulty evaluation methods and being excessively critical of any and all claims for cultural cannibalism, failing to prove dishonesty or prejudice on the behalf of Europeans who have claimed evidence for cultural cannibalism. He criticises both Arens' treatment of Staden's claims and his discussion of Iroquois cannibalism, claiming that Arens has <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> many Native American first-hand testaments as to the cannibalistic nature of these people. Ultimately, he dismissively asserted that The Man-Eating Myth [...] "does not advance our knowledge of cannibalism." [...] More favourably, R.E. Downs of the University of New Hampshire reviewed the work for American Ethnologist. Noting that the book was [...] "provocative" [...] in its thesis, he {{felt that it was}} bound to raise many [...] "hackles", and that it would lead future anthropologists to challenge other long-standing beliefs about non-western [...] "primitive" [...] societies, such as that of widespread incest and promiscuity. [...] Ultimately, he remarked that while many anthropologists might dispute Arens' ideas, never again could they claim that the existence of cultural cannibalism was an undisputed fact.|$|E
500|$|Kinsbourne's {{testimony}} was countered {{by that of}} Ward, who noted that if Kinsbourne were correct and persisting measles virus were causing autism, then {{it ought to be}} detectable in the blood, since Kinsbourne himself had stated that MV would travel throughout the body via the bloodstream; he also criticized Kinsbourne's expert report for citing Bradstreet et al.'s case series which had been published in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons. With regard to this study, Ward said that [...] "the cerebrospinal antibody data from the three ASD children included in this manuscript actually argue powerfully AGAINST a persistent measles infection in the brains of these children." [...] Ward also noted that Krigsman had cited research conducted by Vijendra K. Singh of Utah State University which had concluded that more than 80% of children with autism had elevated measles antibodies. However, Ward stated in his expert report that [...] "Unless virtually all cases of autism are caused by measles virus (a position expressly excluded by the MRC, IOM and Cochrane reports), then Singh's work must be in error or there must be an alternate explanation for this finding. We have recently tested anti-measles antibodies in children with ASD and found no differences with control children." [...] Another point of contention was a paper by Paul Ashwood, which had been cited by Kinsbourne in his expert report; however, as Ward noted, Kinsbourne had <b>neglected</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> that Ashwood's paper concluded that [...] "the overwhelming majority of epidemiological, population studies indicate there is no established correlation between vaccinations and autism." [...] Additionally, Ward noted that this paper made no mention of the potential link between MMR and autism.|$|E

At dawn on 30 April, the Austrian Kray and Alvinczi Infantry Regiments seized the Deux-Frères (Two Brothers) redoubt atop Monte Fratelli.
