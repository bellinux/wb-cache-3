40|$|AbstractIt is {{suggested}} that, in the conditions which exist in vivo, one {{head of a}} myosin molecule interacts with another head of the opposite molecule, inside {{the backbone of the}} thick filament. The other head lies outside and can interact with actin. This model is {{based on the fact that}} a dimer of the myosin heads exists and that there is a close correlation between the properties of the dimer and those of the thick <b>filament</b> diameter. In <b>natural</b> <b>filaments,</b> there are myosin molecules in excess and it {{is suggested}} that these molecules have their two heads outside the backbone...|$|R

A variation was the Koosh Kins line, of Koosh balls with cartoon faces and hands. Koosh Kins was made into a comic book mini-series by Archie Comics, where they kept their cartoon-like appearance.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{filaments}} prepared from column-purified rabbit skeletal myosin by slow dialysis exhibit characteristic bipolar {{organization and}} 14 -nm axial subunit spacing. Backbone substructure can be discerned in high resolution micrographs {{in the form}} of striations of 3 [...] 4 -nm width and slight angular tilt {{from the direction of the}} filament axis. Filament backbone diameters vary over the population, although remaining relatively constant for a single filament. Approximately 25 % of the filaments appear poorly stained and frayed, which may be due to collapse on the electron microscope grid. Optical diffraction studies reveal a 43 -nm axial repeat as well as the 14. 3 -nm subunit repeat, indicating a structural homology with <b>natural</b> <b>filaments.</b> A model for synthetic filament aggregation is presented that is consistent with observations of backbone diameter variation, absence of bare zones, and the presence of fraying filaments...|$|R
30|$|Under the {{different}} light sources, such as <b>natural</b> light, tungsten <b>filament</b> lamp, and halogen lamp, {{the same kind}} of color is not the same. The difference is caused by different sources of the “color temperature.” Generally, the image color shows slanting blue when the light color temperature is higher. And the image color shows slanting red when the light color temperature is lower. So how to make the collected images to correctly reflect the real color is a key of research.|$|R
40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{are designed to}} mimic the morphology and mechanical properties of <b>natural</b> ligaments. <b>Filament</b> winding technology has been implemented {{in order to obtain}} a composite material based on a polyurethane matrix (HydroThane™), reinforced with degradable and non-degradable fibers. The mechanical properties of the matrix and fiber have been analysed to define the optimal type, volume ratio and winding angle of the reinforcement. The typical J-shaped stress-strain curve, displayed by natural tendons and ligaments, is reproduced. The mechanical behaviour of HydroThane™ reinforced with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers were modified by varying the winding angle of the fibers. Fibers comprising poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) and PET, individually and in combination, were considered as candidate materials for the reinforcement of a composite ligament augmentation device (LAD). Mechanical and degradation studies demonstrated that, by combining different types of fiber, at a fixed volume fraction and winding angle (20 °), it is possible to optimize mechanical properties and degradation kinetics of the devic...|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila parasitizes environ mental amoebae and, upon inhalation, replicates in alveolar macrophages, thus {{causing a}} life-threatening pneumonia called "Legionnaires' disease. " The opportunistic pathogen employs a bi-phasic life cycle, alternating between a replicative, non-virulent phase and a stationary, transmissive/virulent phase. L. pneumophila employs the Lqs (Legionella quorum sensing) {{system as a}} major regulator of the growth phase switch. The Lqs system comprises the autoinducer synthase LqsA, the homologous sensor kinases LqsS and LqsT, {{as well as a}} prototypic response regulator termed LqsR. These components produce, detect, and respond to the α-hydroxyketone signaling molecule LAI- 1 (Legionella autoinducer- 1, 3 -hydroxypentadecane- 4 -one). LAI- 1 -mediated signal transduction through the sensor kinases converges on LqsR, which dimerizes upon phosphorylation. The Lqs system regulates the bacterial growth phase switch, pathogen-host cell interactions, motility, <b>natural</b> competence, <b>filament</b> production, and expression of a chromosomal "fitness island. " Yet, LAI- 1 not only mediates bacterial intra-species signaling, but also modulates the motility of eukaryotic cells through the small GTPase Cdc 42 and thus promotes inter-kingdom signaling. Taken together, the low molecular weight compound LAI- 1 produced by L. pneumophila and sensed by the bacteria as well as by eukaryotic cells {{plays a major role in}} pathogen-host cell interactions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of C-protein, {{synthetic}} filaments prepared from column-purified myosin exhibit the following features: individual filament diameters are uniform over a long length, but a wide distribution of diameters is apparent over the population; approximately 25 % of the filaments have a frayed appearance and take up stain poorly, whereas the remaining 75 % are well-stained; optical diffraction of well-stained filaments reveals a 14. 3 -nm subunit period and a 43 -nm axial period (Koretz, 1978; Koretz, 1979). Addition of C-protein to myosin before filament formation affects all of these features in a manner related to C-protein concentration. At the physiological ratio of C-protein to myosin in the banded region of the <b>natural</b> thick <b>filament,</b> synthetic aggregates are uniform in diameter over the population and show less than 10 % frays. Whereas the subunit period remains unchanged, the axial period has increased to 114. 4 nm, or eight times the subunit repeat. Above and below the physiological ratio, disorder of a specific nature is apparent. Addition of C-protein after filament formation appears to coat the aggregates so that elements of backbone ultrastructure are obscured, and some evidence of axial period change is visible in diffraction patterns. A model is presented for the binding of C-protein to myosin, and its observed effects on filament structure are {{explained in terms of}} this model...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{magnetic}} ribbon model for molecular cloud filaments. These result from turbulent compression in a molecular cloud {{in which the}} background magnetic field sets a preferred direction. We argue {{that this is a}} <b>natural</b> model for <b>filaments</b> and is based on the interplay between turbulence, strong magnetic fields, and gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion, rather than pure gravity and thermal pressure. An analytic model for the formation of magnetic ribbons that is based on numerical simulations is used to derive a lateral width of a magnetic ribbon. This differs from the thickness along the magnetic field direction, which is essentially the Jeans scale. We use our model to calculate a synthetic observed relation between apparent width in projection versus observed column density. The relationship is relatively flat, similar to observations, and unlike the simple expectation based on a Jeans length argument. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, to appear in Ap...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the contractile proteins actin and myosin, contractile filaments of striated muscle contain other proteins that are important for regulating the structure and {{the interaction of the}} two force-generating proteins. In the thin filaments, troponin and tropomyosin form a Ca-sensitive trigger that activates normal contraction when intracellular Ca is elevated. In the thick filament, there are several myosin-binding proteins whose functions are unclear. Among these is the myosin-binding protein C (MBP-C). The cardiac isoform contains four phosphorylation sites under the control of cAMP and calmodulin-regulated kinases, whereas the skeletal isoform contains only one such site, suggesting that phosphorylation in cardiac muscle has a specific regulatory function. We isolated <b>natural</b> thick <b>filaments</b> from cardiac muscle and, using electron microscopy and optical diffraction, determined the effect of phosphorylation of MBP-C on cross bridges. The thickness of the filaments that had been treated with protein kinase A was increased where cross bridges were present. No change occurred in the central bare zone that is devoid of cross bridges. The intensity of the reflections along the 43 -nm layer line, which is primarily due to the helical array of cross bridges, was increased, and the distance of the first peak reflection from the meridian along the 43 -nm layer line was decreased. The results indicate that phosphorylation of MBP-C (i) extends the cross bridges from the backbone of the filament and (ii) increases their degree of order and/or alters their orientation. These changes could alter rate constants for attachment to and detachment from the thin filament and thereby modify force production in activated cardiac muscle...|$|R
40|$|Nanocrystals and {{nanostructures}} {{are often}} cited as candidate materials that can be engineered to exhibit enhanced or entirely new properties for use in different applications. The textile industry has also demonstrated a remarkable capability to incorporate both <b>natural</b> and manmade <b>filaments</b> into yarns and fabrics to satisfy {{a wide range of}} physical parameters that survive the manufacturing processes and are tailored to specific application environments. Along this line of reasoning and foreseeing the aforementioned textile industry’s capabilities, this new seed-level NTC project proposed the development of next-generation functional fabrics (named here electronic textile or e-textile) utilizing single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) composites. This exciting area of research in e-textile is motivated by discovery of bond extension in charged nanotubes (i. e., piezoelectric (PZT) effect in nanotubes). Our proposed nanotube-based fabrics, particularly after appropriate heat treatment, could become an enabling technology for a variety of macroscopic textile related applications such as actuation and shape modification of membrane structure, lightweight RF sensor system and power generation. In short, our objectives are: (1) nanotube-based fibers processing and fabrication, (2) development of CNT-base...|$|R
40|$|Water-soluble polyisocyanopeptides (PICs) are a {{new class}} of {{synthetic}} polymers that mimic <b>natural</b> protein-based <b>filaments.</b> Their unique semiflexible properties combined with a length of several hundred nanometers have recently enabled a number of biomedical applications ranging from tissue engineering to cancer immunotherapy. One crucial step toward the further development of PICs for these applications is the efficient and controlled synthesis and purification of PIC-biomolecule conjugates. Considering the large size of PICs and the biomolecules to be conjugated, conjugation reactions do usually not proceed to completion due to steric effects. As a consequence, purification of the reaction mixture is necessary to separate the obtained bioconjugates from unreacted biomolecules. As {{a direct result of the}} semiflexible nature of PICs, standard polymer and protein purification methods based on molecular weight have not been successful. Here, we introduce a new affinity-based purification method utilizing biotin as an affinity tag. PICs decorated with a controlled and tunable density of biotin molecules (biotinPICs) were efficiently bound to and eluted from a monoavidin resin in buffered aqueous solution. Using these biotinPICs, two different protein conjugates were synthesized, one carrying the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and the other T-cell activating anti-CD 3 antibodies. The resulting biotinPIC-protein conjugates were successfully obtained in high purity (> 90 %) and without any loss of protein activity. The high purity greatly simplifies the analysis of biotinPIC bioconjugates, such as the determination of the average number of biomolecules conjugated per biotinPIC chain. Most importantly, it allows for the direct and straightforward application of the obtained bioconjugates in the desired applications. The new method developed may further be adapted for the purification of other advanced bioconjugates that are difficult to obtain in high purity with the available standard methods...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{objective}} of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility fiber-reinforced turbine components through a design and manufacturing study. The motivation for using composites is to reduce weight and simplify manufacturing especially at high production volumes. In addition, natural fiber composites are implemented for applicable components to reduce environmental impact. Existing steel designs provided by major manufacturers are used as models. These are re-designed using composite materials, maintaining original geometry as much as possible. The components selected for composite design are the turbine penstock, scroll case, guide vanes, runner (impeller) and draft tube. In addition, {{the design of a}} composite fish ladder is presented to show the application of composites to other elements of hydroelectric power. Once the structural and mechanical design was complete, material and manufacturing costs were analyzed. The choice of materials was based upon loading requirements, the runner required a high strength random reinforcement carbon fiber sheet molding compound (SMC) while a glass fabric and rovings provided adequate strength for the guide vanes, scroll case, penstock and outer walls of the fish ladder while minimizing the cost. A flax fabric was selected for the design of the draft tube additionally using a bio-based PLA resin. The inner sections of the fish ladder use a flax fabric and polypropylene pultrusion. Manufacturing methods for each were selected based on geometry and cost. The complex shape of the runner was most easily formed using compression molding, which also reduced the cost as compared to hand lay up. A comparison between hand lay up and vacuum infusion was completed for the guide vanes and scroll case. Hand lay up was chosen for the draft tube as it is the most commercially proven method for the manufacture of components using <b>natural</b> fibers. <b>Filament</b> winding, the method used for the penstock would be the ideal method of manufacture but it has yet to be completed in a commercial setting with natural fibers. Results show the cost of most parts is dominated by tooling (molds) for the components as the research focused on a small run of ten parts, assumed to be for research and testing purposes. However, the contribution of tooling can be cut in half if the run size is doubled. The design and manufacturing analysis does support the use of composite materials in hydroelectric turbines and the costs associated with their manufacture are within reasonable parameters for industry...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the current}} {{standard}} model of Cosmology, matter in the Universe arranges itself along a network of filamentary structure. These filaments connect the main nodes of this so-called 'Cosmic Web', which are clusters of galaxies. Although its large-scale distribution is clearly characterized by numerical simulations, constraining the dark matter content of the cosmic web in reality {{turns out to be}} difficult. The natural method of choice is gravitational lensing. However, the direct detection and mapping of the elusive filament signal is challenging and in this work we present two methods,specifically tailored to achieve this task. A linear matched filter aims at the detection of the smooth mass component of filaments and is optimized to perform a shear decomposition that follows the anisotropic component of the lensing signal. Filaments clearly inherit this property due to their morphology. At the same time, the contamination arising from the central massive cluster is controlled in a <b>natural</b> way. The <b>filament</b> 1 σ detection is of about κ 0. 01 - 0. 005 according to the filter's template width and length, enabling the detection of structures out of reach with other approaches. The second, complementary method seeks to detect the clumpy component of filaments. The detection is determined by the number density of sub-clump identifications in an area enclosing the potential filament, as it was found within the observed field with the filter approach. We test both methods against Mock observations based on realistic N-Body simulations of filamentary structure and prove the feasibility of detecting filaments with ground-based data.
