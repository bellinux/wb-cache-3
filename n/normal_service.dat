5|$|In 1963, three Avro 748s were {{in service}} {{and two of}} Skyways Coach-Air's Dakotas were {{converted}} to freighters. During the winter of 1962–63, the 748s continued to operate a <b>normal</b> <b>service</b> out of Lympne. In October 1964, Skyways Coach-Air moved out of its London offices and all operations were now at Lympne, although a sales office was retained in London. The Cinque Ports Flying Club was restarted in 1964 by Barry Damon and had 120 members by 1968. The club aircraft were a Beechcraft Bonanza, Beechcraft Musketeers and a Bölkow Monsun.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, freight and World War II traffic helped pay {{off some}} of the debt the SIRT had accumulated, and briefly made the SIRT profitable. During the second World War, all of the east coast {{military}} hospital trains were handled by the SIRT, with some trains stopping at Arlington on Staten Island to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The need to transport war material, POW trains, and troops, made the stretch of the Baltimore & New York Railway between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill extremely busy. The B also operated special trains for important officials such as Winston Churchill. On June 25, 1946, a fire wrecked the terminal at Saint George killing three people, injuring twenty-two people, and causing damage worth $22,000,000. The fire destroyed the ferry terminal and the four slips used for Manhattan service, the terminal for Staten Island Rapid Transit trains. <b>Normal</b> <b>service</b> was not restored until July 13, 1946. Bids to build a temporary terminal went out on August 21, 1946. The construction of a replacement terminal was promised by Mayor William O'Dwyer on February 10, 1948. The new terminal opened on June 8, 1951, with ferry, bus and rail service all within one building. Previous portions of the terminal were phased into service at earlier dates. The new terminal cost $23 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} {{production}} aircraft were {{delivered to the}} 6th Fighter Regiment of the VVKJ, based at Zemun, in early 1939. The pilots subjected them to considerable additional testing, before they entered <b>normal</b> <b>service</b> around mid-year. The remaining six entered service during the remainder of 1939. The aircraft were delivered without radios or armament, which were fitted in VVKJ workshops. In October 1939, the IK-2s were transferred to the 4th Fighter Regiment in Zagreb until licence-built Hawker Hurricanes were delivered from Zemun, after which the IK-2s were {{to be transferred to}} the 5th Fighter Regiment in Niš. By the end of 1940, all the production IK-2s were concentrated in the 107th Fighter Squadron of the 34th Fighter Group, which consisted solely of IK-2s. This was only an interim allocation, as the other squadron of the group was equipped with Hurricanes, {{and as soon as the}} 107th Fighter Squadron could be equipped with Hurricanes, the IK-2s were to move to the 5th Fighter Regiment. The threat of war overtook this planned deployment, and on 13 March 1941, the IK-2s of the 107th Fighter Squadron were moved to Bosanski Aleksandrovac near Banja Luka, under the command of Kapetan Zarko Vukajlović.|$|E

50|$|During the Great Fast, {{a special}} service book is used, {{known as the}} Lenten Triodion, which {{contains}} the Lenten texts for the Daily Office (Canonical Hours) and Liturgies. The Triodion begins during the Pre-Lenten period to supplement or replace portions of the regular services. This replacement begins gradually, initially affecting only the Epistle and Gospel readings, and gradually increases until Holy Week when it entirely replaces all other liturgical material (during the Triduum even the Psalter is eliminated, and all texts are taken exclusively from the Triodion). The Triodion is used until the lights are extinguished before midnight at the Paschal Vigil, at which time it is replaced by the Pentecostarion, which begins by replacing the <b>normal</b> <b>services</b> entirely (during Bright Week) and gradually diminishes until the <b>normal</b> <b>services</b> resume following the Afterfeast of Pentecost.|$|R
