50|$|A {{proposed}} bus {{rapid transit}} line running from Downtown Saint Paul to Woodbury, named the Gold Line, is proposed to be built by 2022. The line would cost $485 million in 2021 dollars with 45% of that coming from federal sources. The Gateway Corridor Commission estimates 8,600 weekday riders by 2040. Buses would run 90% of the time on new roads that run next to existing <b>roads</b> and <b>highways.</b> <b>Service</b> would be every 10 minutes during peak times and 20 - 30 during other times.

40|$|Price {{levels and}} {{movements}} on gasoline and diesel markets are heavily debated among consumers, policy-makers, and competition authorities alike. In this paper, we empirically investigate {{how and why}} price levels differ across gasoline stations in Germany, using eight months of data from a novel panel data set including price quotes from virtually all German stations. Our analysis specifically explores the role of station heterogeneity in explaining price differences across gasoline stations. Key determinants of price levels across fuel types {{are found to be}} ex-refinery prices as key input costs, a station's location on <b>roads</b> or <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> areas, and brand recognition. A lower number of station-specific services implies lower fuel price levels, so does a more heterogeneous local competitive environment...|$|R

40|$|A lot of {{research}} works have been made concerning <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area or solar technology and acquired great achievements. However, unfortunately, few works have been made combining the two topics together of <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> areas and solar energy saving to make a systemic research on solar technology application for <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area. In this paper, taking West Lushan <b>highway</b> low-carbon <b>service</b> area in Jiangxi Province of China as the case study, the advantages, technical principles, and application methods of solar energy technology for <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area including solar photoelectric technology and solar water heating technology were discussed based on the analysis of characteristics of <b>highway</b> low-carbon <b>service</b> area; the system types, operation mode, and installing tilt angle of the two kinds of solar systems suitable for <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> areas were confirmed. It was proved that {{the reduction of the}} cost by electricity savings of solar system was huge. Taking the investment of the solar systems into account, the payback period of solar photoelectric systems and solar water heating systems was calculated. The economic effect of the solar systems in West Lushan <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area during the effective operation periods was also calculated and proved very considerable...|$|R
