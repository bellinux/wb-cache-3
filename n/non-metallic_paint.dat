500|$|Klein {{bicycles}} were {{famous for}} their paintwork, and offered {{a large number of}} custom colours and patterns. The paint used was a Durethane enamel <b>non-metallic</b> <b>paint</b> that cost up to [...] per gallon. The Klein logo was debossed into the frame by painting the frame in the colour of the logo, then applying a mask and painting the pattern.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The article {{presents}} a detail corrosion model, {{taking into account}} its material chemical composition, the surface layer quality, corrosion environment properties and corroding conditions, the kind of used inhibitor, its concentration, coating type, its quality. The article shows the dependence of the corrosion rate with the required detail lifetime. The paper shows the effect of material phase composition, detail surface layer quality integral parameter, detail surface moisture membrane thickness, corrosive environment aggressiveness, corrosive environment temperature, the concentration of H ions, a corrosion inhibitor, as well as coatings on the corrosion rate. The {{article presents}} the coating influence degree on the corrosion rate for <b>non-metallic</b> <b>paint</b> and varnish and powder coatings as well as metal galvanic coatings. The article presents {{the effect of the}} detail surface layer quality complex parameter, which characterizes the rate of detail corrosion after mechanical treatment for non-heat treated and heat-strengthened details. Key words: Corrosion resistance Corrosion rate The quality of the surface layer Corroded Coverage details Complex parameter of surface layer details Inhibito...|$|E
50|$|For 2008, {{only minor}} changes {{were applied to}} the Santa Fe. A {{navigation}} system made by LG was offered and the Infinity sound system and the power glass sunroof were made standard on Limited models. The <b>non-metallic</b> white <b>paint</b> trim was dropped, leaving the pearl white as the only white color available on the Santa Fe.|$|R
50|$|With the mid-1977 {{introduction}} of Versailles, Lincoln {{was the first}} American car manufacturer to produce a two-stage base-coat/clear-coat paint process for their mid-sized luxury sedan. For 1978, this new two-stage paint process was expanded to both the Mark V and Continental, (for metallic colors only). This process produced a rich, deep, and especially glossy finish, because the paint pigment was protected beneath a layer of high-gloss clear acrylic enamel. <b>Non-metallic,</b> solid <b>paint</b> colors still continued to use the traditional, single-stage paint process (no clearcoat).|$|R
40|$|Government {{regulations}} have mandated production phase-outs {{of a number}} of solvents, including 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, an ozone-depleting chemical (ODC). This solvent was used extensively in the production of the Reusable Solid Rocket Motors (RSRMs) for the Space Shuttle. Many tests have been performed to identify replacement cleaners. One major area of concern in the selection of a new cleaner has been compatibility. Some specific areas considered included cleaner compatibility with <b>non-metallic</b> surfaces, <b>painted</b> surfaces, support materials such as gloves and wipers as well as corrosive properties of the cleaners on the alloys used on these motors. The intent {{of this paper is to}} summarize the test logic, methodology, and results acquired from testing the many cleaner and material combinations...|$|R
40|$|Graffiti are {{increasingly}} observed on urban and peri-urban buildings and their removal requires a huge financial outlay by {{local governments and}} agencies. Graffiti are not usually removed immediately, but rather over the passage of time, viz. months or even years. In this study, which forms part of a wider research project on graffiti removal, different methods (gravimetric analysis, examination of digital images, colour and infrared measurements) were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of accelerated ageing tests (involving exposure to humidity, freeze-thawing cycles and NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 salts) for graffiti painted on stone. Silver (metallic) and black (<b>non-metallic)</b> graffiti spray <b>paints</b> were applied to two types of igneous rock (granite and rhyolitic ignimbrite) and one sedimentary rock (fossiliferous limestone, i. e., biocalcarenite). The metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> graffiti spray <b>paints</b> acted differently on the stone surfaces, both chemically and physically. Older graffiti were found to be more vulnerable to weathering agents. The ageing test with NaCl and particularly Na 2 SO 4, both applied to granite, proved the most severe on the paints, yielding more detrimental and faster artificial ageing of the type of material under study...|$|R
40|$|In {{years have}} seen the advent of new types of {{automotive}} antennas, such as blade or &# 039;shark-fin&# 039; antennas and conformal planar roof mounted antennas. In many cases it is desirable to paint these antennas to improve {{the appearance of the}} vehicle. In this communication we present an investigation of the effect that both metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> two-pack polyurethane <b>paint</b> has on a structure radiating at approximately 1. 5 GHz (GPS Ll-band), with a particular emphasis on the impedance bandwidth and radiation performance...|$|R
