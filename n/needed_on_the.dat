5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is <b>needed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E

5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed.

In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him {{all the way to the}} Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910.

5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are <b>needed.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three years of the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty fought a battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it <b>needed.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research E. J. Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{transfer}} of the Crystal Palace from Hyde Park to Sydenham Hill between 1851 and 1854 created a major tourist attraction in the then rural area south of London, and the LB opened a branch line from the Brighton main line at Sydenham to the site in 1854. While this was under construction the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway also planned a line from Crystal Palace, to a new station at Battersea Wharf, {{at the southern end of}} the new Chelsea Bridge. Despite its location, the new station was called Pimlico. It opened on 27 March 1858, but was very much regarded as a temporary terminus, composed of a small number of wooden huts, and positioned immediately next to a proposed bridge over the Thames. Shortly afterwards the LB leased most of the lines of the new railway, and built a further connection from Crystal Palace to the Brighton main line at Norwood Junction, thereby providing itself with a route into west London, although it was recognised that a terminus would be <b>needed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side of the river.|$|E

5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force <b>needed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of home leave, on 17 June 1915 Manstein was reassigned as {{assistant}} general staff officer of operations to the Tenth Army, commanded by Max von Gallwitz. Soon promoted to captain, he learned first-hand how to plan and conduct offensive operations as the Tenth Army undertook successful attacks on Poland, Lithuania, Montenegro, and Albania. During offensive operations at Verdun in early 1916, Manstein was stationed with Gallwitz and his staff at a new headquarters near the action. He next served as a staff supply officer under General Fritz von Below and chief of staff Fritz von Lossberg at a command post near the River Somme; the area {{was the scene of}} several battles {{over the course of the}} war. British and French operations from July to November 1916 forced a German withdrawal over the winter to the Hindenburg Line, a series of defensive positions between Verdun and Lens. Manstein continued to serve under Below until October 1917, when he was transferred as chief of staff to the 4th Cavalry Division, serving in Riga during the German occupation of the area. As a result of the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, Manstein's unit was no longer <b>needed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front; he was reassigned to the 213th Infantry Division near Reims. The German Imperial Army saw some minor successes in the area but was beginning to lose the war. The armistice was signed on 11 November 1918.|$|E

40|$|Title: The {{influence}} of professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with {{patients with a}} depressive disorder and these patients’ <b>needs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quality of the therapeutic relationship. Background: The strength of the therapeutic relationship correlates with patient outcomes, for example: improved quality of life, reduced symptom severity, improved global functioning, satisfaction with treatment, higher community living skills, and better medication adherence. Previous studies have demonstrated the {{influence of}} patients’ needs and professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with patients <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quality of the therapeutic relationship. There is uncertainty about the therapeutic relationship between patients with a depressive disorder, specifically in depressive patients with severe mental illness, and mental health care professionals. Aim: In order to improve patient outcomes, the influence of professionals’ perceived difficulty with patients and patients’ <b>needs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> therapeutic relationship was explored. Research question: “What is the influence of professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with patients with a depressive disorder and these patients’ <b>needs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quality of the therapeutic relationship?” Method: An exploratory, cross-sectional design was {{used to describe the}} relationship among professionals’ perceived difficulty with patients and patients’ <b>needs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quality of the therapeutic relationship at baseline. Results: In regards {{to the quality of the}} therapeutic relationship, patients appreciated positive collaboration with respect to emotional difficulties and positive clinician input. In 92 % of the patients there were ‘no’ or ‘met’ health and social needs. In 8 %, patients reported ‘unmet’ needs. Professionals rated 40 % of the patients as ‘difficult’. Conclusion: This study showed a significant contribution of professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with patients <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quality of the therapeutic relationship, in contrast to patients’ needs. Recommendations: To improve patient outcomes, it is recommended that professionals focus on: providing more information about treatment, psychological distress, company, being stern, and mutually agreement upon goals...|$|R
