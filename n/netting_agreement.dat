5000|$|When {{a company}} goes into {{insolvent}} liquidation, any mutual debts between {{the company and}} a creditor intending to prove in the liquidation will be set-off. [...] However, the right of set-off is not mandatory, and can be waived by a creditor provided this does not prejudice other creditors. Any creditor who extended credit to the company {{at a time when}} it had notice of the company's insolvency (excluding balance sheet insolvency for these purposes) cannot set-off. The Insolvency Act has incorporated ISDA Model Netting legislation (pre-2007 form) and so any <b>netting</b> <b>agreement</b> relating to financial contracts will prevail over the statutory insolvency set-off provisions.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{extends the}} model of Klein and Inglis (2001) by {{taking into account the}} effect of a <b>netting</b> <b>agreement,</b> e. g. an ISDA Master Agreement, and the effect of {{portfolio}} diversification on the price of vulnerable European options. The model considers options traded mutually between two option writers one of which may default. Based on this model the credit-risk adjusted price of an option is a conditional price with respect to the portfolio of options to which it is added. Using a numerical approximation (Monte-Carlo simulation), netting and portfolio effects are shown to increase the credit-risk adjusted value of a trading position. The paper shows that the price which a counterparty is willing to receive (pay) for selling (buying) an option, is less (more) than the usual price if the option has a credit risk mitigation effect on the existent portfolio...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{estimation}} of credit exposure arising from a portfolio of interest rate derivatives. The estimation is performed using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results are compared to the exposure obtained under the current exposure method provided by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). We show that the simulation method provides a much richer set of information for credit risk managers. Also, depending on the current exposure {{and the nature of}} the transactions, the BIS method can fail to account for potential exposure. All test portfolios benefit significantly from a <b>netting</b> <b>agreement,</b> but the BIS approach tends to overestimate the risk reduction due to netting. In addition we examine the impact of antithetic variates and different time-discretizations. We find that a discretization based on derivatives' start and maturity dates may reduce simulation time significantly without loosing generality in exposure profiles. Antithetic variates have a small effect. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis conducts three {{different}} empirical studies and finds {{that some of}} the pre- 2007 risk assessment model could underestimate the systemic risk of the banking sector and justifies an overhaul. First, it simulates the contagion impact of the UK interbank market. Subject to a number of assumptions (<b>netting</b> <b>agreement,</b> seniority, etc), it finds that the contagion is much severer if the simulation uses consolidated data than using unconsolidated data. Second, the thesis tests whether the riskiness of banks can be mitigated by peer interbank monitoring. Applying to UK market, the thesis finds little evidence of market discipline. The results are attributed to the lenders’ assumption of “too-big-to-fail” and the shortness of loan maturity. Last, the thesis investigates whether banking sector difficulties are preceded by macroeconomic distress. In contrast to most existing studies, the thesis finds that economy still thrives in the “pre-crisis” in terms of increasing GDP growth and the recession is generally associated with the “post-crisis” period. The inconsistency of results is very likely due to imprecise crisis identification of earlier studies which identify crises too late on the basis of “event studies”...|$|E
40|$|According to the Romanian law {{the debtor}} that faces {{financial}} difficulties {{of a certain}} extent can be {{the object of the}} insolvency procedure, regulated by Law no. 85 / 2006 concerning the insolvency procedure. Because the insolvent debtor is no longer trustworthy to its contractual partners and cannot execute the assumed obligations, there is a risk that these contracts cease, or the services that are incumbent on contractual parties are not executed. This is why, {{it is very important to}} know within the insolvency procedure and, especially during the judicial reorganization period, what will be the treatment of contracts concluded prior to the opening of this procedure and still not executed, the so-called “contracts under execution”. Also, after clarifying the concept of contract under execution, it is important to establish who has the right to opt between their continuation, or their cancellation. On the other hand, there are presented the special rules provided by Law no. 85 / 2006 for some categories of contracts concluded prior to the opening of the insolvency procedure, such as: labor, lease, commission contracts, master of <b>netting</b> <b>agreement</b> or contracts concluded intuitu personae or by a debtor that is the owner of a leased building, etc...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the legal environment of netting agreements covering financial contracts. It concludes that an international instrument {{should be developed}} capable of improving the effectiveness of netting agreements in mitigating systemic risk. To this end, two {{different aspects of the}} enforceability of netting agreements are considered: (i) the general enforceability of netting, and (ii) the possibility of precluding the operation of netting a mechanism by way of a regulatory moratorium for considerations of systemic stability. The first part of the study presents the use of netting and the various forms it may take before going on to explain the benefits and drawbacks of enforceable netting agreements. Benefits for individual firms consist in lower counterparty risk and more favourable capital requirements. Benefits for the financial market as a whole flow from greater financial market stability since the contagion of systemically relevant institutions by the default or insolvency of another institution is limited, thus helping to avoid systemic effects. Additionally, the use of netting arrangements can improve overall market liquidity. A potential drawback of enforceability of netting, in certain situations, is that the operation of a netting mechanism could actually work against the purpose of systemic stability where the transfer of parts of the business of an insolvent financial institution to a solvent bridge entity would enhance or maintain value {{to a greater extent than}} the operation of a <b>netting</b> <b>agreement</b> would. Regulatory authorities are considering under which conditions a moratorium to halt the netting mechanism until the situation is solved could avoid this threat to systemic stability. The second part of the {{study examines}} whether there is the potential to support the purpose of enhanced systemic stability by way of international harmonisation of private and insolvency law. As regards the issue of general enforceability, the global picture of netting legislation is heterogeneous. Given the great practical relevance of the matter, an international instrument could be very useful. As to the issue of private law consequences of regulatory moratoria, the absence of a harmonised framework appears to lead to actual cross-border inconsistency and legal uncertainty as regards financial contracts that are governed by a foreign law. Taking these to aspects into account, this paper recommends that work on developing an international instrument be undertaken. The final part of the study suggests a set of preliminary guidelines for the development of suchan instrument. In the light of the findings of the previous sections, a mixed, two-step approach is recommended. First, a non-binding instrument could be developed, serving as a benchmark and reservoir of legal solutions in respect of the relevant issues. Secondly, isolated aspects relating to both the general enforceability of netting and the accommodation of a regulatory moratorium in foreign private and insolvency law could be dealt with in an international Convention, in particular where cross-border situations involving netting require uniformity of applicable legal rules...|$|E
40|$|Central {{banks and}} private banks alike have {{advocated}} {{greater use of}} interbank <b>netting</b> <b>agreements</b> {{in recent years in}} order to reduce potential for transmitting economic shocks through interbank markets. This paper provides a model of an interbank payment market and shows that one sideeffect of greater netting of interbank claims is a redistribution of bank default risk away from interbank claimants toward non-bank creditors of banks, including the deposit insurer. Interbank <b>netting</b> <b>agreements</b> thus involve a trade-off between reduced interbank credit-risk exposure and increased concentration of bank default risk on other sets of bank creditors.
