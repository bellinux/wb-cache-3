Carey took off with a section of 43 Squadron—a number of sections from the squadron had already scrambled— at 11:15. They intercepted He 111s bombing ships 15 miles off Tynemouth. Carey and his wingman, Sergeant Peter Ottewill engaged and downed a He 111, although it took the combined ammunition of both Hurricanes to do so. Ottewill headed off the He 111 while Carey attacked. When the German pilot attempted to climb for cloud cover, Ottewill joined the attack. The Heinkel landed on the sea with both engines stopped and sank. The pilot. Oberfeldwebel Fritz Wiemer, was later rescued and became a prisoner of war. The remainder died in a field hospital.

3000|$|... i The {{conditions}} for acquisition of citizenship {{on the basis}} of application (naturalization) are defined in Section 7 of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Nationality</b> Act (2005 : 51). It should be added that Norway, Sweden and Denmark have different definitions of the required time of residence. In Denmark and Norway, time of residence is defined as the time a person has legally stayed in the country. In Sweden, time of residence is defined {{on the basis of}} a principle of fixed residence, meaning that temporary residence permits are not counted (Ot.prp. nr. 41 (2004 – 2005), p. 93). This implies that in many cases, there will be no major differences between the requirements for time of residence that in practice are applied in Sweden and Norway respectively.|$|R

50|$|Her {{tapestries}} {{were often}} blamed for not expressing Norwegian {{art and culture}} enough. And {{at this time in}} Norway, <b>Norwegian</b> <b>nationality</b> was important. In the 1890s and early 1900s art was (among other things) about identifying the typical Norwegian essence. But Frida Hansen responded to the criticism by making art that was more international, such as the decorative art of Morris. One of Frida Hansen's works hangs in the Royal Palace in Oslo, there are two national rugs designed by Gerhard Munthe, but woven by Frida. Munthe believed that she was the best in the country for the task. Carpets hanging in the castle are from the saga of Sigurd the Crusader. The design was first drawn on carton and later transferred to the loom. Often a workshop consisted of people with different tasks: one person who dyed yarn and arranged cardboard, and the weaver who transferred to the loom, but with Frida she did everything herself. She usually created full size cartoons, dyed the yarn and took care of the transfer. Frida was technically adept.|$|R

30|$|Seen {{in light}} of the Swedish Citizenship act from 2001 and the {{amendments}} to Danish naturalization policy during recent years, the process leading up to the new <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Nationality</b> Act of 2005 is quite interesting. Liberal as well as restrictive views can be identified in the preparatory documents, along with rhetorical elements that are similar both to the Swedish and Danish debates. While the Swedish committee was characterized by basic consensus, and its proposals were included in full in the government’s bill and also later in the text of the act, the white paper from the Norwegian committee (NOU 2000 : 32) is characterized by dissenting opinions in several aspects. The committee majority recommended a liberalization of the law, including acceptance of dual citizenship, and their arguments were similar to their Swedish counterparts. The minority, however, drew on arguments from the Danish debate, and wished to preserve the principle of unitary citizenship and raise the barriers to naturalization. Interestingly, it was the views of the minority that were included most prominently in the proposal for a new act on citizenship submitted by the Centre-Right Government in 2004 (Ot.prp. nr. 41 (2004 – 2005)). The proposal was enacted 1 September 2006 and remains in force, with a few minor changes since the enactment.|$|R
40|$|Museums are {{implicated in}} the {{national}} project of identity formation; exhibition narratives can be reaffirming and equally contestable. Citizens confront culture, memory, history, and myth in the museum narrative which may enable {{a sense of belonging}} and inclusion or which may serve to exclude. I consider {{the extent to which the}} OHC can be understood as a project which supports and promotes an inclusive Norwegian national identity. The museum tells of Norway’s Nazi occupation during the Second World War and of the arrest and deportation of Norwegian Jewish citizens to death camps with the connivance of fellow-citizens as either actors or bystanders. The story challenges the dominant Norwegian narrative of the war period. I reflect on ways in which museum visitors experience a diverse portrayal of <b>Norwegian</b> <b>nationality,</b> in line with the national story of commitment to human rights and multiculturalism. My thesis seeks to establish whether there is a new identifiable Norwegian national consciousness evolving from the narrative of the Centre, as presented in its exhibition, regarding the experiences of Norwegian Jews during the Second World War. The key research question considered is: How is the Oslo Holocaust Museum contributing to the narrative of the national story of Norway in relation to human rights education and multiculturalism? Data was collected by means of semi structured interviews from 7 key OHC staff and from a sample of 20 English-speaking visitors to the museum, who were interviewed in July and August 2011. Questions focused on visitors’ perceptions of the exhibition in general and on their understandings of its messages for and about Norway today. My argument is that the OHC narrative, premised on human rights and democratic values, has the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of common citizenship and human rights in a Norway that is increasingly becoming multicultura...|$|R
40|$|Background The Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpatient Clinic (OAEOC) {{experienced}} a 5 – 6  % annual increase in patient visits between 2005 and 2011, which {{was significantly higher}} than the 2 – 3  % annual increase among registered Oslo residents. This study explored immigrant walk-in patients’ use of both the general emergency and trauma clinics of the OAEOC and their concomitant use of regular general practitioners (RGPs) in Oslo. Methods A cross-sectional survey of walk-in patients attending the OAEOC during 2 weeks in September 2009. We analysed demographic data, patients’ self-reported affiliation with the RGP scheme, self-reported number of OAEOC and RGP consultations during the preceding 12  months. The first approach used Poisson regression models to study visit frequency. The second approach compared the proportions of first- and second-generation immigrants and those from the four most frequently represented countries (Sweden, Pakistan, Somalia and Poland) among the patient population, with their respective proportions within the general Oslo population. Results The analysis included 3864 patients: 1821 attended the Department of Emergency General Practice (“general emergency clinic”); 2043 attended the Section for Orthopaedic Emergency (“trauma clinic”). Both first- and second-generation immigrants reported a significantly higher OAEOC visit frequency compared with Norwegians. Norwegians, representing 73  % of the city population accounted for 65  % of OAEOC visits. In contrast, first- and second-generation immigrants made up 27  % of the city population but accounted for 35  % of OAEOC visits. This proportional increase in use was primarily observed in the general emergency clinic (42  % of visits). Their proportional use of the trauma clinic (29  %) was similar to their proportion in the city. Among first-generation immigrants only 71  % were affiliated with the RGP system, in contrast to 96  % of Norwegians. Similar finding were obtained when immigrants were grouped by <b>nationality.</b> Compared to <b>Norwegians,</b> immigrants from Sweden, Pakistan and Somalia reported using the OAEOC significantly more often. Immigrants from Sweden, Poland and Somalia were over-represented at both clinics. The least frequent RGP affiliation was among immigrants from Sweden (32  %) and Poland (65  %). Conclusions In Norway, immigrant subgroups use emergency health care services in different ways. Understanding these patterns of health-seeking behaviour may be important when designing emergency health services...|$|R
