5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E

25|$|In {{an age of}} {{increasing}} globalization, where a growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.|$|E

25|$|Some Tuam {{residents}} have now {{called for an}} investigation into the town's Grove Hospital, which had also been run by the Bon Secours order. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> claimed their children or siblings were buried on the site from the 1950s right up until the late 1970s, although the order denies that there was a graveyard on the site. Galway County Council has stipulated that an archaeologist must monitor excavation work on the site in order to preserve any remains which may be buried there.|$|E
25|$|The {{archives}} of Ebla show {{reference to a}} number of biblical sites, including Hazor, Jerusalem, and as a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> claimed, to Sodom and Gomorrah mentioned in Genesis as well. Ebla and Amorites at Hazor, Kadesh (Qadesh-on-the-Orontes), and elsewhere in Amurru (Syria) bordered Canaan in the north and northeast. (Ugarit may be included among these Amoritic entities.) The collapse of the Akkadian Empire in 2154BC saw the arrival of peoples using Khirbet Kerak Ware pottery, coming originally from the Zagros Mountains (in modern Iran) east of the Tigris.|$|E

25|$|Network effects become {{significant}} after {{a certain}} subscription percentage has been achieved, called critical mass. At the critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is {{greater than or equal}} to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the good is determined by the user base, this implies that {{after a certain}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the value exceeding the price.|$|E
25|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> died {{trying to}} climb the mountain. An Australian Army Sergeant, Christopher Donnan, died in December 1971 when he fell down a steep slope. There is a plaque {{at the point where}} he was last seen. In August 1995 an Israeli backpacker died after he sprained his ankle and stayed behind while his group continued. He {{subsequently}} wandered off the track and fell into a ravine in the pre-dawn darkness. His body was found about a week later. On 30 July 2005 58-year-old Bob Martin, a marketing manager at Air Niugini, suffered a heart attack and died near the summit.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} sexual {{partners}} people have had in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above (see Pareto principle). About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases consistently demonstrate {{a small percentage of the}} studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random (with sexual partners from throughout a population) or within their social groups (assortative mixing).|$|E

500|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{claimed to}} have seen Anne's ghost at Hever Castle, Blickling Hall, Salle Church, the Tower of London, and Marwell Hall. The most famous account of her reputed {{sighting}} {{has been described by}} paranormal researcher Hans Holzer. In 1864, Major General J.D. Dundas of the 60th Rifles regiment was quartered in the Tower of London. As he was looking out the window of his quarters, he noticed a guard below in the courtyard, in front of the lodgings where Anne had been imprisoned, behaving strangely. He appeared to challenge something, which to the General [...] "looked like a whitish, female figure sliding towards the soldier". The guard charged through the form with his bayonet, then fainted. Only the General's testimony and corroboration at the court-martial saved the guard from a lengthy prison sentence for having fainted while on duty. [...] In 1960, Canon W. S. Pakenham-Walsh, vicar of Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, reported having conversations with Anne.|$|E
2500|$|Public opinion has {{generally}} been favorable towards Woodman's work.

2500|$|A {{very small}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{reportedly}} had an abnormal allele that resulted primarily in {{a reduction of}} 17,20-lyase activity, rather than both the hydroxylase and lyase activities as described above. In these people the defect {{had the effect of}} an isolated impairment of sex steroid (e.g., DHEA in the adrenal, but also gonadal testosterone and estrogens) synthesis, whereas mineralocorticoid (e.g., aldosterone) and glucocorticoid (e.g., cortisol) levels remain normal.|$|E

Since its {{inception}} in 2001, increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> donated blood, usually through groups such as Christian solidarity missions, or family Bar-Bat Mitzvas, especially during seasonal traditional pilgrimage times, such as Passover and Easter.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> criticised the show's {{editing and}} {{production}} methods. Contestants Syed Ahmed and Tre Azam accused {{the show of}} dumbing down their appearances for entertainment. Gerri Blackwood said that her boardroom scene was filmed again {{to make it look}} better. Alan Sugar himself revealed in his autobiography (but did not criticise) that the boardroom scenes are edited to create tension. Jokes and light hearted encounters are cut out, and Alan is seen [...] "banging the table".|$|E
2500|$|The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China {{has complained}} about their members being [...] "followed, detained, interrogated and threatened" [...] for {{reporting}} on the crackdown on Falun Gong. Foreign journalists covering a clandestine Falun Gong news conference in October 1999 were accused by the Chinese authorities of [...] "illegal reporting". Journalists from Reuters, the New York Times, the Associated Press {{and a number of}} other organisations were interrogated by police, forced to sign confessions, and had their work and residence papers temporarily confiscated. Correspondents also complained that television satellite transmissions were interfered with while being routed through China Central Television. Amnesty International states that [...] "a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> received prison sentences or long terms of administrative detention for speaking out about the repression or giving information over the Internet." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{widespread}} use of carmine-based dyes in food and cosmetic products, a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been found to experience [...] occupational asthma, food and cosmetic allergies (such as allergic rhinitis and cheilitis), IgE-mediated [...] respiratory hypersensitivity, and in rare cases [...] anaphylactic shock. In 2009 the FDA ruled that labels of cosmetics and food that include cochineal extract must include that information on their labels [...] (under the name [...] "cochineal extract" [...] or [...] "carmine"). In 2006 the FDA stated it found no evidence of a [...] "significant hazard" [...] to the general population. [...] In the EU authorities list carmine as additive E120 in the list of EU-approved food additives. An artificial, non-allergenic cochineal dye is labeled E124. The directive governing food dyes approves the use of carmine for certain groups of foods only, but is still found in several products particularly alcoholic beverages.|$|E

2500|$|Dan Brown {{repeatedly}} {{said in his}} defense that history cannot be plagiarized and therefore the accusations of the two authors were false. Leigh stated, [...] "It's not that Dan Brown has lifted certain ideas because a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> done that before. It's rather that he's lifted the whole architecture – the whole jigsaw puzzle – and hung {{it on to the}} peg of a fictional thriller". Dan Brown has admitted some of the ideas taken from Baigent and Leigh's work were indispensable to the book but stated that there were many other sources also behind it. However, he claimed that neither he nor his wife had read Baigent and Leigh's book when he produced his original [...] "synopsis" [...] of the novel. Among Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh's arguments were that the given name of the character Sir Leigh Teabing's is the same of Richard Leigh's surname, and that [...] "Teabing" [...] is an anagram of [...] "Baigent".|$|E
2500|$|For example: [...] " [...] Whoever {{intentionally}} attributes a lie against me, {{should prepare}} {{his seat in}} the Fire." [...] This is a mutawatir hadith in its wordings {{because it has a}} minimum of seventy-four narrators. In other words, seventy-four companions of Muhammad have reported this hadith at different occasions, all with the same words. The number of those who received this hadith from the Companions is many times greater, because each of the seventy four Companions has conveyed it to a number of his students. Thus the total number of narrators of this hadith has been increasing in each successive generation and has never been less than seventy-four. All these narrators who now are hundreds in number, report it in the same words without even a minor change. This hadith is therefore mutawatir in its wording, because it cannot be imagined reasonably that such a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> colluded to coin a fallacious sentence in order to attribute it to Muhammad.|$|E
