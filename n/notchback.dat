25|$|Standard seating choices by model {{included}} a <b>notchback</b> bench seat with cloth or Morrokide vinyl {{in the base}} GP, a pillowed velour cloth <b>notchback</b> bench seat in the LJ or Strato bucket seats in cloth or Morrokide in the SJ. The Strato buckets were optional on the base GP and a 60/40 split bench was optional on both base and LJ models. Viscount leather upholstery was available with bucket seats on SJ models.|$|E
25|$|A revised {{rear panel}} on <b>notchback</b> and {{hatchback}} models had new Firebird-styled taillights and ventilation extractor grills were eliminated on trunk and hatch lids.|$|E
25|$|Inside, Strato bucket {{seats and}} console were still {{standard}} equipment with Morrokide vinyl or cloth upholstery, or a no-cost optional <b>notchback</b> bench seat with either trims. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and door panel trim.|$|E
50|$|The Buick and Oldsmobile were {{introduced}} with fastback coupe styles, while the Chevy and Pontiac received <b>notchbacks.</b> Four-door fastback sedan models were also available. An interesting design compromise was non-lowering rear door windows on four-door sedans and wagons, which also reverted to full window frames while two-doors including El Caminos retained frameless glass. Performance applications include the Chevrolet Malibu F41 and M80, Pontiac LeMans GT, Oldsmobile 442 and Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, Harry Ferguson Research {{purchased}} 3 Mustang <b>notchbacks</b> {{and converted}} them to 4x4 {{in an attempt}} to sell potential clients on their FF AWD system. A similar system was used in the Ferguson P99 Formula One car, and would go on to be featured in the Jensen FF, widely considered the first AWD passenger car. As in the Jensen FF, the AWD Mustangs also featured an ABS braking system, long before such a feature was commonplace.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982 ASC and McLaren {{equipped}} 2 EXPs with sunroofs, true <b>notchbacks,</b> ground effects, {{and charged}} aspiration. ASC (American Sunroof Corporation) did the cosmetic modifications and McLaren made the performance modifications. One has the following modifications: supercharger, turbocharger, tighter steering, 1 inch shorter ride height, Recaro racing seats, TRX suspension, Koni shocks, twin fuel pumps, fuel injection, machined uprights (for wheel clearance), enhanced power steering, and portion-valved brakes. This EXP ASC McLaren makes 120HP and 137 ft/lb of torque. Ford added their own removable sunroofs, ground effects, [...] "bubblebacks", and spoilers {{to save money}} and later turbocharged EXPs themselves {{to make the same}} amount of power. The other EXP has yet to be spotted.|$|R
25|$|VW {{expanded}} its product line in 1961 {{with the introduction}} of four Type 3 models (Karmann Ghia, <b>Notchback,</b> Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the U.S.A for the Variant.|$|E
25|$|Opera windows {{had fallen}} into disuse by the mid-1980s, as {{changing}} automotive styles {{moved away from the}} upright <b>notchback.</b> Smaller, more aerodynamic cars made opera windows appear gaudy or out of place. Contemporary examples of opera windows are sometimes found on modified or customized automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The two {{fastback}} models (along {{with the}} Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon) proved unpopular, possibly {{because they did}} not appeal to Buick's older, more conservative customer base. With the introduction of the new front wheel drive Century in 1982 (see below), the existing <b>notchback</b> sedan and wagon models were transferred to the Regal line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cars had}} a light, but strong semi-unit {{body with a}} {{perimeter}} frame. Because of the encircling frame, passengers stepped down into the vehicles. Hudson's step-down design made the body lower than contemporary cars. It offered passengers the safety of being surrounded by the car's chassis with a lower center of gravity. In addition to the added safety of being surrounded by the car's chassis, the step-down also allowed Hudson to gain weight savings provided through unibody construction, making for a well-performing automobile. The cars featured slab-sided bodies with fully integrated fenders. Brougham and sedans were fastbacks while convertibles and coupes were <b>notchbacks.</b> A character line ran from the front to back further lowering the car even more visually, so [...] "the new Hudson looked like a dream car straight from the auto show." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1978, GM {{downsized}} its intermediate line, reducing wheelbase by {{four inches}} and curb weight by {{nearly half a}} ton. The Century name was now applied to the entire range except for the coupe, which retained the Regal name. A fastback coupe ("aeroback") and aeroback sedan were added (the body was shared with the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon), which was a revival of an appearance used in the late 1940s on the Buick Super {{and again in the}} late 1960s on the Buick Skylark. It was also offered as a station wagon and two- and four-door <b>notchbacks.</b> The car was over a foot shorter, several inches narrower, and several hundred pounds lighter than its predecessor. V6 engines were still standard due to fuel economy regulations. Big block engines were gone and the new base powerplant was Buick's new [...] V6, introduced specifically for the Century and Regal. The [...] V6, and the Chevrolet 305 V8 were options. The Pontiac [...] and [...] replaced the Chevrolet engine for 1979.|$|R

The Pontiac 265 cuin L and 301 cuin L replaced the Chevrolet engine for 1979.|$|R
25|$|The {{hatchback}} coupe {{features a}} lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat. The <b>notchback</b> sedan {{had the lowest}} price {{and is the only}} Vega model with an enclosed trunk. The Safari wagon has fixed rear-side glass and a swing-up liftgate. A panel delivery based on the wagon was sold through the 1975 model year. It has steel panels in place of the rear-side glass, and an additional enclosed storage area. An auxiliary front passenger seat was optional.|$|E
25|$|The 1966 Grand Prix {{received}} only minor appearance revisions from the 1965 edition {{including a new}} more rounded split grille and new taillight trim. Inside, a revised instrument panel included a squared off gauge panel and new Strato bucket seats in either Morrokide or cloth upholstery with higher seatbacks and more contoured cushions for improved lateral support. The Strato buckets were standard equipment along with a console, but a <b>notchback</b> bench seat with center armrest was a no-cost option.|$|E
25|$|Again, the 1973 GTO {{option was}} offered on two models {{including}} the base Le Mans coupe or the LeMans Sport Coupe. The base LeMans coupe featured a cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat while the more lavish Le Mans Sport Coupe had all-vinyl interiors with Strato bucket seats or a <b>notchback</b> bench seat with folding armrest. The Le Mans Sport Coupe also had louvered {{rear side windows}} from the Grand Am {{in place of the}} standard triangular windows of the base Le Mans.|$|E
25|$|To address {{feedback}} from customers about the Open Sports lacking daily-use practicality, the designers at TVR created a fixed-head <b>notchback</b> coupe body. This body was fitted {{to the same}} semi-spaceframe chassis to create a car that {{became known as the}} TVR Coupe. As with previous models, it was offered with the choice of several engines, including the Ford 100E sidevalve, the Coventry Climax FWA, and the 1489cc MGA engine. When the Ford sidevalve was selected, the customer had the further option of fitting a Shorrock supercharger. One of the Coupes was used by the factory as a demonstrator model, and was driven by Mike Hawthorn.|$|E
25|$|Toyota started {{production}} {{of the first generation}} series Camry in March 1982 at the Tsutsumi plant. Designated the model code V10, when fitted with S-series gasoline engines it was known as the SV10, SV11, or SV12 depending on the exact version. Likewise, the C-series diesel versions are identified by the CV10 and CV11 codes. Released to the Japanese market on 24 March 1982, Toyota issued the V10 series as a four-door <b>notchback</b> sedan retailing at the Toyota Corolla Store dealerships. At the same time, a twinned model—the Toyota Vista—launched as a rebadged Camry sold at separate Toyota Vista Store locations. Five-door liftback versions of the Vista came to the market in August 1982, although outside of export markets the Camry remained exclusively a sedan. These cars served above the comparably sized Toyota Carina and Corona in the Toyota hierarchy. Unlike the preceding Celica Camry, exports were achieved with the first generation Camry to Australia, Europe, and North America.|$|E
25|$|The Alfetta saloon was {{launched}} in 1972, equipped with a 1.8-litre four-cylinder. It was a three-box, four-door <b>notchback</b> saloon (Berlina in Italian) with seating for five designed in-house by Centro Stile Alfa Romeo; the front end was characterised by twin equally sized headlamps connected to a central narrow Alfa Romeo shield by three chrome bars, while the tail lights were formed by three square elements. At the 1975 Brussels Motor Show Alfa Romeo introduced the , 108PS (DIN) Alfetta 1.6 base model, easily recognizable by its single, larger round front headlights. Meanwhile, the 1.8-litre Alfetta was rebadged Alfetta 1.8 and {{a few months later}} mildly restyled, further set apart from the 1.6 by a new grille with a wider central shield and horizontal chrome bars. Engines in both models were Alfa Romeo Twin Cams, with two overhead camshafts, 8-valves and two double-barrel carburettors. Two years later the 1.6 was upgraded to the exterior and interior features of the 1.8.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} Neon {{was introduced in}} January 1994 and manufactured until August 1999. It was available as a four-door <b>notchback</b> sedan and a two-door <b>notchback</b> coupe. Available engines were SOHC and DOHC versions of Chrysler's 2.0L 4-cylinder engine producing [...] at 6,000rpm and [...] at 5,000rpm or [...] at 6,500rpm and [...] at 5,600rpm, respectively; transaxle options were a 3-speed Torqueflite automatic or a five-speed manual.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1975, the Monza Towne Coupe was {{introduced}} — a <b>notchback</b> body-style with a conventional trunk featuring different sheetmetal than the 2+2 hatchback, but sharing its windshield, front fenders, and doors. [...] It features single round headlamps, {{instead of the}} dual rectangular headlamps on the 2+2. [...] The Towne Coupe was offered {{in response to the}} sales success of the Ford Mustang II <b>notchback</b> coupe and its luxury version, the Mustang II Ghia. The Towne Coupe is [...] shorter and [...] lighter than the 2+2 and has slightly more rear head room.|$|E
2500|$|As in {{previous}} years, base Delta 88 and Royale models differed mainly in {{exterior and interior}} trim. Base Deltas had a full bench seat available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery, while Royales had a <b>notchback</b> bench seat with armrest or optional 60/40 <b>notchback</b> bench, also available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl trim. All 88s featured an all-new instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer and heater/air conditioning controls moved {{to the center of}} the dash above the radio from the left side of the dash, and continued with the [...] "Message Center" [...] bank of warning lights. The new dash was highlighted with woodgrain trim. The dimmer switch moved from the floor to the turn-signal lever.|$|E
2500|$|Sales of {{convertibles}} were dropping and AMC did {{not have}} the resources to design separate fastback and <b>notchback</b> hardtops that were available on the Mustang and on the second-generation Plymouth Barracuda, so the AMC designer team under Richard A. Teague penned only one body style, [...] "a smooth semi-fastback roofline that helped set Javelin apart from other pony cars." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second-generation Barracuda, {{though still}} a [...] {{wheelbase}} A-body sharing many components with the Valiant, was given Barracuda-specific styling {{and its own}} range of models including convertibles and fastback and <b>notchback</b> hardtops. [...] A wide range of engines were available on the Barracuda throughout its production lifecycle, from a 145-hp 225 cubic-inch (3.7L) Slant Six, up through high-compression small- and big-block V8s.|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 Sunbird, {{based on}} the Chevrolet Vega and Monza's equivalent, joined the line. It was first offered as a <b>Notchback,</b> with a Hatchback body style added in 1977. The Vega Wagon body style was added in 1978, Sunbird Safari Wagon, {{replacing}} the Astre Safari Wagon. The Sunbird was offered in its rear-wheel-drive configuration through the 1980 model year. (Sunbird Safari wagon through 1979.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1980 {{model year}} lineup {{consisted}} of a base 2+2 hatchback and <b>notchback</b> and 2+2 sport hatchback; [...] the 151-cubic-inch (2.5-liter) four-cylinder engine remained standard; the only engine option was the 3.8 liter (231 CID) Buick V6. Chevrolet decided to shelve the antiquated design and let base models of the Chevrolet Camaro and the new Chevrolet Citation X-11 hold the division's place sporty-coupe market.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, the CHP ordered 400 Special Service Package <b>notchback</b> coupes (394 {{were built}} by Ford {{and shipped to}} the CHP), and at least 4 cars were SSP hatchbacks. [...] These four hatchbacks were painted and {{equipped}} {{in the same manner}} as the SSP coupes. [...] They were produced under a different 6-digit Fleet DSO number than the SSP coupes, and were retained for use and evaluation by the CHP. [...] One of these hatchbacks exists in private hands.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the {{decision}} was made to drop the LaSalle at least three wood and metal mockups had been made for potential 1941 LaSalle models. One was based on the <b>notchback</b> GM C platform which ended up being shared by the Cadillac Series 62, Buick Roadmaster and Super, the Oldsmobile 90 and the Pontiac Custom Torpedo. A second was based on the fastback GM B platform which ended up being shared by the Cadillac Series 61, the Buick Century and Special, the Oldsmobile 70 and the Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo. A third was a modified <b>notchback</b> design, derived from the fastback B-body, but described as [...] "A-body-like", that ended up being used by the Cadillac Series 63. Any or all of these could have ended up being part of the next LaSalle line. However, it has been inferred that of the three, the third design was most likely to have been a LaSalle, with that platform being assigned exclusively to LaSalle, and that the second design, whose platform was shared with the Series 61, was the next most likely. In 1941 sales of the Cadillac Series 61 and 63 were 29,258 and 5,030 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, a new {{instrument}} panel continued the wraparound cockpit theme of previous models with new African Crossfire Mahogany facing on the dashboard, console and door panels, which was [...] "real" [...] wood {{in contrast with}} the simulated woodgrain material found in most car interiors during that time. The Strato bucket seats were completely new with higher seatbacks and integrated headrests in Morrokide or scivvy cloth trims, and optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support, with a <b>notchback</b> bench seat offered as a no-cost option.|$|E
2500|$|The 1968 model {{had a new}} grille with {{headlights}} arranged horizontally, {{although the}} body was essentially the same car from the windshield back. The 'long hood, short deck' style with a more upright roofline and a <b>notchback</b> rear was followed too, as was the new trend for concealed headlights on the XL and LTD. One other change for 1968 was that the base V8 engine increased from 289 to [...] Standard equipment included courtesy lights, a cigarette lighter, a suspended gas pedal, and padded front seat backs.|$|E
2500|$|The Astre {{features}} Pontiac's trademark split grill, emblems {{and steering}} wheel with an upgraded interior trim to help differentiate {{itself from the}} Chevrolet Vega. Other styling differences compared to the Vega include [...] 1973 model Astres have a black-finish grill and clear parking lamp lenses on all models, and chrome headlight bezels on non-GTs. Taillight lenses (same as the Vega) have a chrome trim piece surround. The 1974-1977 models have first generation Firebird-styled taillights (also shared with the 1973/74 Ventura) on the <b>notchback</b> and hatchback.|$|E
2500|$|Built on the H-body platform, {{the car was}} {{available}} in hatchback, <b>notchback,</b> wagon, and panel delivery body styles. The Astre shared the aluminum-block 2.3liter inline-four engine with the Vega through 1976, while the final 1977 models used Pontiac's all-iron 2.5liter inline-four engine. The Astre was cancelled with the Vega {{at the end of}} the 1977 model year, although the wagon continued for 1978 and 1979, rebadged as part of the Pontiac Sunbird line. The word [...] "" [...] is French for [...] "star", a shared naming convention for the Vega.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} trim remained virtually unchanged from 1973, with standard seating choices, including Strato bucket seats with center console or <b>notchback</b> bench seat with an armrest and cloth or Morrokide upholstery. The bucket seats were available with optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support. However, the real African Crossfire Mahogany trim {{was replaced by}} a simulated material for the instrument panel due to splintering problems on 1973 models; the [...] "real" [...] wood was continued on the console and door panels for another two years. Also, a new cut-pile carpeting replaced the nylon loop rugs of previous years.|$|E
2500|$|The Hornet {{was offered}} as a two-door and four-door <b>notchback</b> sedan in its {{introductory}} year. The hardtop (no [...] "B" [...] pillar) coupe body style was not continued from the 1969 Rambler American. A four-door station wagon variant named the [...] "Sportabout" [...] {{was added to the}} 1971 lineup. Also for 1971, the SC/360 was added. This was a [...] V8 powered compact muscle car that was available only as a two-door sedan. (The tire pressure sticker on the first 1970 models hinted at the SC/360). For 1973, a semi-fastback hatchback coupe with fold down rear seats was added to the lineup.|$|E
2500|$|The Hudson Jet was {{unveiled}} in December 1952 at the Hotel Astor in New York City. Hudson {{was the only}} make fully committed to stock car racing, so both the founder of NASCAR, Bill France, Sr., and Hudson driver, Tim Flock, the Grand National champion, participated. [...] For the 1953 model year, the Jet was the only new nameplate among the domestic automakers. In its introductory year, the Jet was available in either Standard or Super-Jet trim levels, with two- and four-door sedan body styles. Unlike the fastback [...] "step-down" [...] bodied Hudson full-size cars, the Jet {{was designed as a}} three-box <b>notchback.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The AMC Cavalier {{was part}} of three other prototypes that hinted at some of AMC's future {{production}} vehicles. In 1966, the Cavalier became part of [...] "Project IV" [...] touring the auto show circuit. This group of four show cars included the Vixen (a 4-seat coupe with [...] "flying buttress" [...] rear roof pillars), the AMX prototype (a 2-seat coupe that evolved into the real production car), and the AMX II (a <b>notchback</b> hardtop that was [...] longer than the AMX). At the time, none of the concept cars carried the Rambler nameplate, which AMC started phasing out in 1966 in favor of AMC.|$|E
2500|$|Oldsmobile also {{introduced}} the Jetstar I for 1964. [...] Not {{part of the}} Jetstar 88 line, the Jetstar I instead was a direct competitor to the Pontiac Grand Prix in the same $3,500 price range. Jetstar I's shared the <b>notchback</b> body style with the Starfire along with its more powerful [...] 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but with less standard equipment and a lower price tag. [...] Jetstar I's are distinguishable from the Starfire and Jetstar 88 in that the rear window on the Jetstar I is concave, rather than convex. [...] Oddly, Oldsmobile teamed the [...] Rocket engine with a very unsuitable transmission in the Jetstar I...the Jetaway (Super Turbine 300) two-speed unit with [...] "switch pitch" [...] converter.|$|E
