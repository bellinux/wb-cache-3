40|$|Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) is {{a leading}} thin film {{photovoltaic}} (PV) material due to its near ideal bandgap of 1. 45 eV and its high optical absorption coefficient. The typical CdTe thin film solar cell is of the superstrate configuration where a window layer (CdS), the absorber (CdTe) and a back contact are deposited onto glass coated with a transparent electrode. Substrate CdTe solar cells where the above listed films are deposited in reverse are not common. In this study substrate CdTe solar cells are fabricated on flexible foils. The properties of the Molybdenum back contact, Zinc Telluride (ZnTe) interlayer and CdTe absorber on the flexible foils were studied and characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Substrate curvature and film flaking was observed during the fabrication {{as a result of}} differences in thermal expansion coefficients between the substrate and the deposited films, and also due to impurity diffusion from the foil into the film stack. In order to overcome this problem diffusion barriers where used to eliminate contamination. Silicon dioxide (SiO 2), silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) and molybdenum nitride (MoxNy) were used as such barriers. Electrical characterization of completed devices was carried out by Current-Voltage (J-V), Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) and Spectral Response (SR) measurements. Roll-over was observed in the first quadrant of J-V curves indicating the existence of a back barrier due to a Schottky back contact. The formation of <b>non-rectifying</b> <b>contact</b> to p-CdTe thin-film {{is one of the major}} and critical challenges associated with the fabrication of efficient and stable solar cells. Several materials (ZnTe, Cu, Cu 2 Te, and Te) were studied as potential candidates for the formation of an effective back contact...|$|E
40|$|Metal to {{semiconductor}} contacts can {{be divided}} into two groups: rectifying contacts and non-rectifying contacts. For a <b>non-rectifying</b> <b>contact,</b> which is also known as an ohmic contact, there is an electrical junction between the metal and semiconductor that has a linear current&ndash;voltage (I-V) characteristic (as with Ohm&rsquo;s law). A low resistance ohmic contact allows the carriers to flow easily in both directions between the metal and semiconductor. Ohmic contacts are essential for most semiconductor devices e. g. p-n diodes, Schottky diodes, metal&ndash;oxide&ndash;semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), metal&ndash;semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) and so on. Lower and lower ohmic contact resistance is desired as the dimensions of devices decrease and nanotechnology demands better means of creating electrical access to devices. &nbsp;Continued improvement in the performance of ohmic contacts requires better characterisation of such contacts. In order to study the properties of ohmic contacts, the parameter specific contact resistivity (SCR) was introduced by [Chang et al., 1971]. Accurate test structures and evaluation techniques needed to be developed to obtain the values of SCR and the transmission line model (TLM), the circular transmission line model (CTLM) and the cross-bridge Kelvin resistor test structure (CBKR) are the most commonly used techniques. Although they have their advantages in either analytical expressions or fabrications, their disadvantages are obvious as well. In this work, new ohmic contact test structure, the two-contact circular test structure, has been developed for determining SCR. The evaluation techniques are also presented and demonstrated by using finite element modelling (FEM). Experimental results are reported for different metal to semiconductor ohmic contacts to verify the two-contact circular test structure. As examples of contacts to two-dimensional (2 -D) semiconductor layers (relatively no vertical voltage drop in the semiconductors), the values of SCR of Ni to heavily doped n-type epitaxial 3 C-SiC and Ti to lightly doped n-type epitaxial 3 C-SiC ohmic contacts were determined to be (0. 8 - 5. 7) E- 6 ohm cm 2 and (3. 0 - 7. 5) E- 4 ohm cm 2 respectively using the proposed test structure and its corresponding evaluation technique. For contacts to bulk semiconductors (3 -D circumstances compared to 2 -D circumstances, where semiconductor vertical voltage drop is significant), the values of SCR of Ni to p-type bulk Ge and Ti to n-type 4 H-SiC substrate ohmic contacts were determined to be (2. 3 - 27) E- 6 ohm cm 2 and (1. 8 - 2. 5) E- 3 ohm cm 2 respectively. Furthermore, an investigation of the effect of low energy implantation on the properties of Au/Ni/Ti contacts to heavily doped n-type epitaxial 3 C-SiC has been undertaken using the proposed test structure and its corresponding analytical equations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} devoted to the results of a {{diffusion}} welding technique applied {{to solve the problem of}} packaging for large area SiC Schottky diodes. To supply low defect density substrates for fabrication of 0. 3 cm 2 Schottky diodes TDI defect-reducing technology was used. Diodes were fabricated on CVD grown low-doped 4 H-SiC single epitaxial layer without edge termination. Double layer Ni-Au and triple layer Ti-Ni-Au sputter metallization were used for Schottky <b>contacts</b> fabrication. <b>Non-rectifying</b> backside <b>contacts</b> were provided by Ni-Au metallization. Diodes were tested on-wafer and delivered for dicing, and packaging. To decrease the parasitic spreading resistance the thickness of initial sputter metallization was increased by diffusion welded 30 µm metal foil. Combined thick and plane metal layers make it possible to perform the clamp mode package used in power electronics. This scheme of packaging ensures current takeoff from the whole contact area and allows operating temperatures up to 600 °C. The forward current-voltage characteristics measured at 75 A measured for packaged diodes yields 250 A/c...|$|R
