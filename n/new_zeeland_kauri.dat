In the "exploitation" type of colony, a small number of european immigrants were conquerors, governors, missionaries, landowners, lawyers, merchants, military or civil servants and belonged to a superiors class, whereas the natives were doing most of the actual work. 							In the "colonization" type, the native population, which was very scarce, has been dislodged and some cases exterminated and the work was done by the immigrants or imported slaves. 							Argentina, Uruguay, the South of Brazil and Chile belong to the "colonization" type as also most of the United States, Canada, Australia and <b>New</b> <b>Zeeland,</b> whereas most of the Latin- American republics were colonies of the "exploitation type". 							To-day these countries, especially those of English origin, enjoy a high income level, because the access to education and technical knowledge enabled the population to get the benefit of a high productivity. 							As to the countries of Spanish origin, before the second world war, Argentina and Uruguay had a per capita income very close to that of the English origin countries, but comparing with the year 1950, although Argentina is in a higher position than other Latin-American countries, her income level is lower than that of ten countries of Western Europe.

To address this question, the effects of these adverse situations, histopathological changes in hippocampal pyramidal cells and aging process were investigated. Forty eight <b>New</b> <b>Zeeland</b> white male rabbits were divided into six groups and all of them were housed in similar conditions, with 2 animals per cage in a temperature-controlled colony room under light–dark cycle. All experimental animals were fed on standard rabbit commercial pellets and different social situations such as food deprivation, inequality in food intake, and unstable social status were applied to experimental groups during eight weeks. Afterward, lipofuscin accumulation and apoptosis, as main markers of aging, were compared to the control group by Long Ziehl Nelseen staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL reaction) assay to reveal the rate of lipofuscin pigment accumulation and TUNEL-reactive apoptotic bodies in the hippocampal pyramidal cells. Serum cortisol level was also measured. Inequality in social situation raised chronic stress (i. e. food deprivation, social inequality and instability) and caused significant changes in lipofuscin accumulation in hippocampal pyramidal cells in comparison to the control group (p< 0. 005). The results also showed {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of apoptotic to normal cells in all of the stressed groups compared to the control group (p< 0. 05).

Arteries and veins were carefully removed with as little connective tissue as possible and placed in cold physiological salt solution (PSS). The arterial and venous rings were mounted in 10 ml isolated organ baths, bathed in Kerbs maintained at 37 °c with 95 % O 2 plus 5 % CO 2. The rings were then placed under different resting tensions. After initial application of tension, tissues were left to equilibrate for a 60 min period. Then all tissues were exposed to cumulative concentration of NA (1 nM- 300 µM). Following complete washout, the preparations were left for 45 minutes to re-equilibrate. Then all preparations were contracted with KCl (Krebs solution, sodium free and high KCl, 125 mM) and allowed to contract for 5 - 10 min. Following complete washout with normal Krebs an additional 30 minutes equilibration period was allowed. Then cumulative concentration-response curves (CCRS) to NA obtained by increasing the concentration-response curves (CCRC) to NA obtained by increasing the concentration of the agonist in half-log increments. In contraction responses to NA aorta, ear artery and ear vein were the most sensitive preparations (pD 2 values: 9. 96, 7. 04 and 7. 8 respectively).

Selection experiments for specific behaviours have been successfully accomplished in a variety of species such as foxes, mink and chickens and high heritabilities were estimated for some traits. In some countries like <b>New</b> <b>Zeeland</b> and USA, behavioural reaction to human handling has been included in selection of beef cattle. In horses, as animals are often dispersed in a variety of environmental conditions, it is still difficult to estimate genetic parameters for behavioural traits. However, Behavioural similarities in animals issued from the same sire or belonging to the same breed are observed in foals and adult horses both in freely expressed behaviours (play, distance to the dam) as well as in reactions to experimental situations (emotional or learning tests). Stereotypic behaviours seem to appear more frequently in some breeds and / or families. Individual variations in foals behaviour can be observed at early ages and seem to predict some adult tendencies. It seems therefore that including some behavioural traits in selection is possible in horses especially since the first estimated heritabilities are promising. A chronological review of the history of research in behavioural genetics is presented with a particular interest for horses...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the human}} {{activities}} that introduce chemical substances in the marine environment {{is the use of}} antifouling paints on ships hulls. Many formulations of these paints include biocides like organotins as tributyltin (TBT) or triphenyltin (TPT). The use of the organotin compound TBT as biocides in antifoulings for ship hulls or mariculture structures protection, associated or not to TPT, has demonstrated to cause lethal or sublethal damage in many marine species (FENT, 1996), even at ppt concentrations (ALZIEU, 1998). This toxicity has led to a progressive control of the application of organotin compounds in France, in the United Kingdom, in the USA, in Japan, Australia and <b>New</b> <b>Zeeland</b> and also in Germany, Sweden and Demark since the late eighties (CHAMP, 2000). The use of organotins in antifoulings is to be globally banned by IMO (International Maritime Organization- www. imo. org), but the ban originally scheduled to 2003 has not yet entered in force, because the required number of countries ratifying it was reached only by late 2007 (see References for details). These compounds are considered a threat to marine life in areas with intense naval activities and can act as endocrine disruptors in marine invertebrates, mainly gastropods (FIORONI; OEHLMANN...|$|R
40|$|Serology {{remains the}} only way to monitor the {{effectiveness}} of vaccination of humans and animals against rabies. Many techniques for determining the level of rabies antibodies have been described, and all of the methods used rabies viruses as antigen. Indeed attenuated viruses can revert to a more virulent form, and inactivated virus may produce serious side effects. Anti-idiotype Ab can induce protective immune response against rabies virus, its means that anti-idiotype Ab can be used as surrogate antigen in serological test. The aim {{of this study is to}} prepare the anti-idiotype antibody (anti-idiotype Ab) as diagnostic kit in rabies serological test. Polyclonal anti-idiotype Ab were prepared in laying chickens and purified using affinity chromatography column for IgY. Rabbit anti dog immunoglobuline were prepared used <b>New</b> <b>Zeeland</b> White strain, and dog anti rabies serum were prepared from rabies immunized dog. For the preparation of the kit, it takes a few stages, i. e. the making of stocks A, stocks B and prototype diagnostic kit. Stocks A is a mixture of S. aureus Cowan I intact in solution of Tris Buffer HCl with rabbit anti dog serum in various comparisons (v/v). Stocks B is a mixture of rabies anti-idiotype Ab with rabies antibody (IgG anti rabies) are harvested fro...|$|R
