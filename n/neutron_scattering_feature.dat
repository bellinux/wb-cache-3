The low-energy effective Hamiltonian of this compound is derived by integrating out the excited crystal field states. It is {{shown that the}} pairwise interaction in the effective Hamiltonian is renormalized by all the other Tb$_ 2 $Ti$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $ ions {{in the system and}} dynamically generate frustration. The phase diagram of Tb$_ 2 $Ti$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $ in the single tetrahedron approximation is calculated. It is shown that Tb$_ 2 $Ti$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $ is in a singlet state which is a linear combination of all frustrated two-in/two-out states. Motivated by experimental results, the diffuse <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> of Tb$_ 2 $Ti$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $ is obtained within the single tetrahedron approximation. This diffuse <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> captures semi-quantitatively most of the experimental <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>features.</b> The magnetization of Tb$_ 2 $Ti$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $ in the single tetrahedron approximation is calculated.

40|$|Conventional {{crystalline}} magnets {{are characterized}} by symmetry breaking and normal modes of excitation called magnons with quantized angular momentum ħ. <b>Neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> correspondingly <b>features</b> extra magnetic Bragg diffraction at low temperatures and dispersive inelastic scattering associated with single magnon creation and annihilation. Exceptions are anticipated in so-called quantum spin liquids as exemplified by the one-dimensional spin- 1 / 2 chain which has no magnetic order and where magnons accordingly fractionalize into spinons with angular momentum ħ/ 2. This is spectacularly revealed by a continuum of inelastic <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> associated with two-spinon processes {{and the absence of}} magnetic Bragg diffraction. Here, we report evidence for these same key features of a quantum spin liquid in the three-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet NaCaNi_ 2 F_ 7. Through specific heat and <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> measurements, Monte Carlo simulations, and analytic approximations to the equal time correlations, we show that NaCaNi_ 2 F_ 7 is an almost ideal realization of the spin- 1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a pyrochlore lattice with weak connectivity and frustrated interactions. Magnetic Bragg diffraction is absent and 90 % of the spectral weight forms a continuum of magnetic scattering not dissimilar to that of the spin- 1 / 2 chain but with low energy pinch points indicating NaCaNi_ 2 F_ 7 is in a Coulomb phase. The residual entropy and diffuse elastic scattering points to an exotic state of matter driven by frustration, quantum fluctuations and weak exchange disorder. Comment: 21 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAqueous {{solutions}} of polyelectrolytes are studied here {{by means}} of <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering,</b> with emphasis on backbone hydrophobicity and counter ion specific effects. Ionene polyelectrolytes with varying chain charge density and different counter ions are considered. Their <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> data <b>feature</b> a number of aspects and trends that clearly deviate from the predictions of the existing theory. Ionenes challenge the current hydrophilic-hydrophobic classification of water-soluble polyelectrolytes. The hydrophobic character of their hydrocarbon backbone emerges only for very low chain charge densities (at 15 % of charged monomers), which is significantly lower than for other polyelectrolytes with a more complex structure. Universality in the counter ion specific effect seen in ionene solutions with Br(-) or F(-) counterions is established. The polyelectrolyte peak in the scattering spectra of Br-ionenes disappears beyond a specific charge concentration, which is identical across all ionene chain charge densities. In addition, scattering spectra of Br-ionenes and F-ionenes feature contrasting temperature trends, which are accentuated with decreasing chain charge density. Our interpretation of the F-Br effect, based on the different hydration properties of the counter ions, is supported by additional NMR measurements on ionenes with mixed counter ion clouds. Overall, the study of ionene polyelectrolytes points clearly {{to the need for}} combining the scaling concepts with those of ion specificity, to obtain a theoretical framework encompassing the wealth of phenomena occurring in polyelectrolyte solutions...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{high-resolution}} scanning tunneling {{spectra of}} the electron-doped cuprate Pr 0. 88 LaCe 0. 12 CuO 4 (T_c = 24 K). We {{find that the}} spectral fine structure below 35 meV is consistent with strong coupling to a bosonic mode at 16 meV, in quantitative agreement with early tunneling spectra of Nd 1. 85 Ce 0. 15 CuO 4. Since {{the energy of the}} bosonic mode is significantly higher than that (9. 5 - 11 meV) of the magnetic resonance-like mode observed by inelastic <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering,</b> the coupling <b>feature</b> at 16 meV cannot arise from strong coupling to the magnetic mode.

40|$|The <b>neutron</b> inelastic <b>scattering</b> {{cross section}} of 23 Na has been {{measured}} {{in response to the}} relevant request of the OECD-NEA High Priority Request List, which requires a target uncertainty of 4 % in the energy range up to 1. 35 MeV for the development of sodium fast-cooled reactors. The measurement was performed at the GELINA facility with the Gamma Array for Inelastic <b>Neutron</b> <b>Scattering</b> (GAINS), <b>featuring</b> eight high purity germanium detectors. The setup is installed at a 200 m flight path from the neutron source and provides high resolution measurements using the (n, n'g) - technique. The sample was an 80 mm diameter metallic sodium disk prepared at IRMM. Transitions up to the seventh excited state were observed and the differential gamma cross sections at 110 º and 150 º were measured, showing mostly isotropic gamma emission. From these the gamma production, level and inelastic cross sections were determined for neutrons energies up to 3837. 5 keV. The results agree well with existing data and the evaluated nuclear data libraries in the low energies, and provide new experimental points in the little studied region above 2 MeV. Following a detailed review of the methodology used for the gamma efficiency calibrations and flux normalization of GAINS data, an estimated total uncertainty of 2. 2 % was achieved for the inelastic cross section integrals over the energy ranges 0. 498 - 1. 35 MeV and 1. 35 - 2. 23 MeV, meeting the required targets.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effects of chain size on the {{structure}} and dynamics of ethylene glycol (EG) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) intercalated in graphite oxide (GO). To this end, EG {{as well as a}} PEO series of increasing chain length have been studied by means of high-resolution inelastic neutron spectroscopy. The neutron experiments are complemented by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman scattering. We find that EG is accommodated in a layer of thickness ∼ 3 Å within the GO substrate and adopts a preferential, yet largely disordered, gauche conformation. Longer PEO chains give rise to a layer thickness in the range ∼ 3. 0 - 3. 4 Å characterized by planar zigzag (trans-trans-trans) conformations. Moreover, we observe a strong reduction of vibrational motions for the confined EG and polymer phases, as clearly evidenced by the disappearance, shift, and/or broadening of mode-specific inelastic <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> spectral <b>features,</b> {{as well as by the}} complete suppression of crystallization.

This {{property}} has been exploited {{in the study of}} soft matters, especially biological macromolecules. When a polarized <b>neutron</b> beam is <b>scattered</b> off a polarized hydrogenous sample, the otherwise large hydrogen incoherent cross section is drastically reduced while the coherent signal is significantly increased. Past experiments have demonstrated the potentials and benefits of polarized <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> from soft materials. The main technical challenge of polarized <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> from biological matters lies at sample polarization.

The future of polarized <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> in biology may rest largely in neutron protein crystallography. Polarization of protein crystals is much easier to accomplish, since protein crystals are typically rather small (<< 1 mm) and only require small and easy- to-operate polarization apparatuses.
