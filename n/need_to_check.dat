The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E

These {{criteria are}} defined in Section 4(3) as the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the suitability of investments for the trust, and the importance of diversification. Section 4(2) requires that, having exercised their power of investment, trustees must regularly refer back to the standard investment criteria to check that they are being fulfilled. This does little more than restate what is given in the Trustee Investments Act 1961, however, and this provision has been criticised for not defining [...] "suitable". In Cowan v Scargill [...] Ch 270 Megarry VC suggested that trustees have an overriding duty to invest solely in the financial interests of beneficiaries, unless the trust instrument laid down otherwise. So even though the National Union of Mineworkers' leader, Arthur Scargill, wanted the mineworkers' pensions to be reinvested in the British Coal industry and keep jobs, the court held that because this would make less money than other investments it would be a breach of trust. Subsequent case law has qualified this controversial principle, such as Harries v The Church Commissioners for England [...] 1 WLR 1241, and it is a point of ongoing debate. It is assumed by academics that, if a trust suffered a loss {{as a result of a}} trustee investing in unsuitable areas, the trustee would be liable for breach of trust.|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Bob Daily and directed by David Grossman. Filming for the episode began on July 11, 2011. The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year."

500|$|Arnold Wayne Jones {{from the}} Dallas Voice gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, writing that the show [...] "has all of the Material Girl's majesty and fetishistic eroticism, merged with lots of disturbing, violent imagery and a huge catalog of songs". Jones {{concluded}} that Madonna was more provocative than before with the release. Chuck Campbell from The Republic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that [...] "an ambitious woman like Madonna will not let herself become a nostalgia act". He added that Madonna makes that clear every time she goes on tour: [...] "she's living in the moment, and she's all about her newest material." [...] The Advocates review for the release was positive, saying that the DVD affirms the fact that Madonna's [...] "musical reign continues". Entertainment Focus Pip Ellwood felt that the highlights of the record were the live performances of [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". He concluded the review by saying that [...] " [...] Making perfect use of her dancers, the video screens and the sets, the MDNA World Tour is one of [...] most spectacular to date and she still performs with the passion and the energy she always has done.

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the release three out of five stars, saying that [...] "there are unexpected musical moments that do make MDNA World Tour worth hearing", including the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". However, he felt that the CD release was unnecessary since the album would be a better experience with its video.|$|E
500|$|The primary game mode of SpaceChem {{depicts the}} {{internal}} workings of a Reactor, mapped {{out to a}} 10×8 regular grid. [...] Each reactor has up to two input and up to two output quadrants, and supports two waldos, red and blue, manipulated through command icons placed on the grid. [...] The player adds commands from an array to direct each waldo independently through the grid. [...] The commands direct {{the movement of the}} waldo, to pick up, rotate, and drop atoms and molecules, and to trigger reactor events such as chemical bond formation. [...] The two waldos can also be synchronized, forcing one to wait for the other to reach a synchronization command. [...] The reactors may support specific nodes, set by the player, that act where atomic bonds can be made or broken, where atoms can undergo fission or fusion, or where logic decisions based on atom type can be made. As such, the player is challenged to create a visual program to accept the given inputs, disassemble and reassemble them as necessary, and deliver them to the target output areas to match the required product. The product molecule does not need to match orientation or specific layout of the molecules as long as the molecule is topologically equivalent with respect to atoms, bonds, and bond types; however, in larger puzzles, these factors will influence the inputs to downstream reactors. While the two waldos can cross over each other without harm, collision of atoms with one another or with the walls of the reactor is not allowed; such collisions stop the program and force the player to re-evaluate their solution. Similarly, if a waldo delivers the wrong product, the player will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> their program. The player successfully completes each puzzle by constructing a program capable of repeatedly generating the required output, meeting a certain quota.|$|E
