40|$|The {{environment}} structure conceptual {{models of}} the Systematic Approach to Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting technique of Carr and Elsberry are applied to all Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclones during January 1994 - June 1997. Whereas {{three of the four}} synoptic patterns from the western North Pacific could be applied with relatively small modifications, a new High (H) amplitude synoptic pattern was defined to classify the situations with large meridional penetrations of mid-latitude troughs deep into the Southern Hemisphere tropics. Some changes in terminology were required to describe the <b>synoptic</b> <b>regions</b> that have characteristic track directions. All 1592 cases during the period could be described by these four synoptic patterns and 11 <b>synoptic</b> <b>regions.</b> Important track changes were found to be associated with transitions between these <b>synoptic</b> patterns and <b>regions.</b> Three binary tropical cyclone interactions defined for the Western North Pacific were adapted for use in the Southern Hemisphere with considerable success. A preliminary climatology of occurrences for the synoptic pattern/region combinations, ions, transitions between combinations, and binary tropical cyclone interactions are calculated. Sequences of synoptic analyses related to these transitions are described to aid in theapplication.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study extends {{an earlier study}} (White 1995) of {{the application of the}} Systematic Approach to tropical cyclone track forecasting of Carr and Elsberry to the eastern and central North Pacific, and contrasts these cases with those in the western North Pacific. The data sample is first expanded to seven years (1990 - 1996). Modifications to the environment structure conceptual models are: (1) introduction of two Dominant Ridge <b>synoptic</b> <b>regions</b> named Ridge Poleward and Ridge Equatorward based on the bowed orientation of the subtropical anticyclone; and (2) combining the Weak Westerlies and Accelerating Westerlies into just one <b>synoptic</b> <b>region</b> called Midlatitude Westerlies. Only eight synoptic pattern/region combinations are needed to classify all of the 1858 cases. Additions to the transitional mechanisms include: (1) the formation and dissipation of the mid-level low; (2) monsoon trough formation; and (3) orography. A new transition climatology reveals that a large fraction of transitions occur between the regions of the Standard pattern. Subtropical Ridge Modulation and Vertical Wind Shear are determined {{to be the most important}} transitional mechanisms. Synoptic analysis sequences are provided to illustrate the synoptic pattern/regions and the primary transitions. [URL] Naval Postgraduate School, Code MR/M...|$|R

40|$|This report {{continues}} {{the development of}} the Systematic Approach to tropical cyclone track forecasting by Carr and Elsberry (1994) with specific application to the western Pacific region. Five years (1989 - 93) of 12 -h Naval Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) analyses are examined for every tropical cyclone to establish a climatology of Environment Structure characterizations. Frequencies of the four Synoptic Patterns and the six <b>Synoptic</b> <b>Regions</b> are calculated, and characteristic tracks while in each of the Pattern/Region combinations are provided. A four-year subset of NOGAPS analyses is used in a reproducibility test in which three trainees attempted to achieve the same Environment Structure assignments as an experienced forecaster. Approximately 81 % of the Synoptic Patterns, 86 % of the <b>Synoptic</b> <b>Regions,</b> and 77 % of the Pattern/Region combinations were correctly assigned by the trainees. However, certain Pattern/Region combinations were found to be poorly identified, which indicated a need for some new training materials. Approximately 81 % of the Pattern/Region transitions to a correct or similar combination were detected by the trainees. About 72 % of these correct/similar transitions were identified within + 12 h of the actual transition, and 88 % were identified within + 24 h. Certain transitions were consistently missed, which again indicates a need for improved descriptions and training. Refinements of the Meteorological Knowledge Base of the Systematic Approach were {{made on the basis of}} the five year climatology and reproducibility test.

(1997) of the Systematic Approach to tropical cyclone (TC) track forecasting meteorological knowledge base to the Southern Hemisphere has been extended to eight seasons (1990 - 91 through 1997 - 98), which includes 145 (90) cyclones in the South Indian (Pacific) region. A total of 3257 synoptic pattern/region classifications could be described in the context of only four synoptic patterns and 11 <b>synoptic</b> <b>regions.</b> Updated track summaries in each pattern/region combination, and the recurring (more than three) environment structure transitions are provided.

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this report {{are those of the}} authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of Defense. This Meteorological knowledge base for application of the Systematic Approach to Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting in the Atlantic basin follows from similar knowledge bases previously developed for the western North Pacific, the eastern and central North Pacific, and the Southern Hemisphere. A common environment structure terminology has been adopted in which three synoptic patterns (Standard, Poleward, and Midlatitude) are found in each of these basins. Each basin also has a special pattern, which in the Atlantic is the Upper-level low. The conceptual models for these synoptic patterns with their associated <b>synoptic</b> <b>regions</b> are described here via a conceptual model, analysis examples, and the characteristic track segments within each region. A climatology of occurrences in each patter/region for the 1568 cases during 1990 - 98 is prepared. The second key element in the knowledge base is the transitional mechanisms that change the environment structure and thus change the tropical cyclone steering flow. Conceptual models for these mechanisms are presented and illustrated with sequences of analyses. A climatology of recurring (at least four occurrences in nine years) transitions is prepared to indicate the most common track changes during these transitions.

40|$|The Sprite and Upper Atmospheric Lightning Imager (ISUAL) {{on board}} the Taiwanese {{satellite}} Formosat- 2 accomplished its first decade operating in orbit. A comprehensive method defining the standardized elve anomaly occurrence rate using limb-viewed observation is demonstrated. We revisit the occurrence of elves during El Niño and La Niña and extend the time series analysis to November 2015. The variation in the enhanced elve anomalies occurrence density (AEOD) follows the change in sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the SSTA-Horseshoe, SSTA-Pacific, and SSTA-Indian Ocean during the warm and cold phases. However, the variation in lightning flash density anomalies (ALFD) is rather ambiguous. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) correlation with the Elve Anomaly Index (EAI) remains significant in Tahiti, while the best correlation between SOI and elves {{is found in the}} western/central Pacific Ocean with a correlation coefficient as high as 0. 7. In the Indian Ocean the 10 -year time frame correlation is moderate, but the relation is obvious during the transition phase between a strong El Niño following La Niña in the <b>region</b> where the <b>synoptic</b> circulation is affected. The weaker convection available potential energy (CAPE) in the upwelling <b>synoptic</b> circulation <b>region</b> provides an environment conducive to the development of elve-producing thunderstorms.

40|$|Based on {{the linear}} theory of Rossby wave propagation, {{regional}} wave propagation patterns associated with extreme generalized frosts (GF) over {{the center and}} northwest of Argentina were identified in the Austral Hemisphere. Using the stationary wavenumber (Ks) {{it is possible to}} show the regions where the Rossby waves may or may not propagate. For different wavenumbers it was found the corresponding waveguides for two basic states related to winters with occurrence of extreme (maximum and minimum) GF. As it would be expected from the theory the Ks distribution emphasize the jet stream as efficient waveguides, having its maximum zonally orientated. For the basic states analyzed it was found wavenumbers 6 and 7 along the subtropical jet. However for the polar jet, there were some differences in the wavenumbers distribution but wavenumber 3 was the most predominate at high latitudes. From the wave theory analysis the main features that favor the large occurrence of GF are: i) an intense subtropical jet and a well define subpolar jet close to the South America; ii) an inhibition region of Rossby wave propagation (Ks= 0) near the continent; iii) a strong band of meridional vorticity gradient over the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, the characteristics that do not favor GF are: 1) a weak subtropical jet near South America; 2) a less defined subpolar jet over the Pacific Ocean; 3) Rossby wave inhibition region over the continent coincident with the entrance of <b>synoptic</b> systems <b>region</b> in South America. In summary, the two basic states showed opposite influence on the Rossby wave propagation. It seems that the maxima occurrence of GF is dependent of the interaction of the subtropical and subpolar waveguides near the South American continent [...] Pages: 1555 - 156...|$|R

The station was established in 2002 to measure aerosols and trace gases in the lower troposphere and is operated by Environment and Climate Canada (Macdonald et al. 2011). In this <b>region,</b> <b>synoptic</b> scale climatology is controlled by the Aleutian Low and the Pacific High. In winter, the zonal flow is generally stronger, and the Aleutian Low causes a more southwesterly flow over British Columbia. In summer, the intensified Pacific High causes more a northwesterly flow over the south coast of British Columbia (Klock and Mullock 2001). PBL influence was found to occur mostly during spring and summer and less frequently in late autumn and winter (Gallagher et al. 2011, 2012). Biogenic processes characterized during the Whistler Aerosol and Cloud Study 2010 (WACS 2010), which was a large measurement campaign with a focus on aerosols and clouds, have also been shown to be important at the station during late spring and summer (e.g., Ahlm et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2012; Pierce et al. 2012; Wainwright et al. 2012; Wong et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|During the 2010 summer, {{a severe}} drought {{impacted}} Western Russia, including regions surrounding Moscow and Belgorod (about 700 [*]km south of Moscow). The drought {{was accompanied by}} high temperatures. Moscow recorded 37. 8 °C (100 °F) {{for the first time}} in over 130 years of record keeping. The record heat, high humidity, dry weather, and smoke from forest fires caused increased human mortality rates in the Moscow region during the summer. The excessive heat and humidity in Western Russia were the result of atmospheric blocking from June through mid-August. The NCAR-NCEP reanalyses were used to examine blocking in the Eastern European and Western Russia sector during the spring and summer seasons from 1970 to 2012. We found that drier years were correlated with stronger and more persistent blocking during the spring and summer seasons. During these years, the Moscow region was drier in the summer and Belgorod during the spring seasons. In the Moscow region, the drier summers were correlated with transitions from El Niño to La Niña, but the opposite was true in the Belgorod <b>region.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> flow regimes were then analyzed and support the contention that dry years are associated with more blocking and El Niño transitions...|$|R
40|$|The European Mediterranean {{region is}} governed by a {{characteristic}} climate of summer drought {{that is likely to}} increase in duration and intensity under predicted climate change. However, large-scale network analyses investigating spatial aspects of pre-instrumental drought variability for this biogeographic zone are still scarce. In this study we introduce 54 mid- to high-elevation tree-ring width (TRW) chronologies comprising 2186 individual series from pine trees (Pinus spp.). This compilation spans a 4000 -km east–west transect from Spain to Turkey, and was subjected to quality control and standardization prior to the development of site chronologies. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify spatial growth patterns during the network’s common period 1862 – 1976, and new composite TRW chronologies were developed and investigated. The PCA reveals a common variance of 19. 7 % over the 54 Mediterranean pine chronologies. More interestingly, a dipole pattern in growth variability is found between the western (15 % explained variance) and eastern (9. 6 %) sites, persisting back to 1330 AD. Pine growth on the Iberian Peninsula and Italy favours warm early growing seasons, but summer drought is most critical for ring width formation in the eastern Mediterranean <b>region.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> climate dynamics that have been in operation for the last seven centuries have been identified as the driving mechanism of a distinct east–west dipole in the growth variability of Mediterranean pines...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{fires are}} an {{important}} source to carbonaceous aerosols in the Western United States (WUS). We quantify the relative contribution of biomass burning to black carbon (BC) in the WUS mountain ranges by analyzing surface BC observations for 2006 from the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environment (IMPROVE) network using the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. Observed surface BC concentrations show broad maxima during late June to early November. Enhanced potassium concentrations and potassium/sulfur ratios observed during the high-BC events indicate a dominant biomass burning influence during the peak fire season. Model surface BC reproduces the observed day-to day and <b>synoptic</b> variabilities in <b>regions</b> downwind of but near urban centers. Major discrepancies are found at elevated mountainous sites during the July-October fire season when simulated BC concentrations are biased low {{by a factor of}} two. We attribute these low biases largely to the underestimated (by more than a factor of two) and temporally misplaced biomass burning emissions of BC in the model. Additionally, we find that the biomass burning contribution to surface BC concentrations in the USA likely was underestimated in a previous study using GEOS-Chem (Park et al., 2003), because of the unusually low planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights in the GEOS- 3 meteorological reanalysis data used to drive the model. PBL heights from GEOS- 4 and GEOS- 5 reanalysis data are comparable to those from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Model simulations show slightly improved agreements with the observations when driven by GEOS- 5 reanalysis data, but model results are still biased low. The use of biomass burning emissions with diurnal cycle, synoptic variability, and plume injection has relatively small impact on the simulated surface BC concentrations in the WUS...|$|R
40|$|Faculty of Science 0207022 dThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is {{a country}} that has {{developed}} rapidly over the past thirty years. Future development is going to be hampered by the enormous shortage of fresh water in the country. It is critically important that a strategic management plan for water resource management be developed to avoid a water crisis for the population and environment. The first step in managing water resources is to understand the sources and sinks of fresh water. Clearly, {{one of the most important}} sources of water to any environment is precipitation and the atmospheric processes and characteristics that promote or diminish the likelihood of rainfall over an area. The synoptic circulation of a region, as well as the thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere, are important for both frontal and convectively activated rainfall. In the past little detailed research has been conducted over the UAE and surrounding regions to classify and characterise atmospheric processes. This study represents the first attempt to develop a synoptic circulation climatology for the <b>region.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> circulation patterns have been classified at both the surface and 500 hPa layer over a period of seven years (1995 - 2001). In addition, the UAE is located under the descending limb of the Hadley circulation. As in other parts of the globe, this has severe implications for the vertical thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere. Atmospheric stability over the UAE has been evaluated for the period of seven years. The implications of descending air have been determined with respect to the thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere as a function of time and space. Vertical Radiosonde data collected over the same seven year period at the Abu Dhabi International Airport have been analysed to determine the frequency of occurrence and nature of absolutely stable layers in the atmosphere. Six circulation patterns that dominate the flow at both the surface and in the upper atmosphere at 500 hPa have been identified from the synoptic climatology. The dominant circulation pattern at the surface and upper atmosphere are the Siberian high and the Subtropical high, respectively. The Siberian high occurs at the surface predominantly during the winter season with a maximum frequency of occurrence in January (48...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence {{that changes in}} the stratosphere {{can have an impact}} on the surface. While observational results show a surface response of about 0. 5 - 1 m/s, modeling studies can show a signal two times and in a particular extreme, four to eight times larger. In this thesis, an investigation of this extreme result revealed the model's characteristic timescale associated with the leading mode of variability was unrealistically large, which ultimately led to the exaggerated responses. Numerous experiments confirmed the tropospheric setup lay in a transition zone in the model's parameter space, teetering between an eddy-driven jet (1) coexisting with or (2) being well-separated from the subtropical jet. Modest shifts in the peak equilibrium temperature profile in either direction removed the bimodal behavior reducing the timescale associated with the internal variability. Subsequently, the response associated with a stratospheric perturbation was greatly reduced and consistent with those found in observations. Composites of the observed mid-tropospheric Northern Annular Mode (NAM) anomalies persisting much longer than normal reveal a lower stratospheric signal, while there was a much weaker signal under normal conditions, suggesting the lower stratosphere has a role in increasing the persistence of the NAM. Using this framework, the following mechanism was proposed. When the lower stratospheric winds sufficiently weaken, there is an increased wave drag in the lower stratosphere which then projects onto the annular modes. (cont.) The negative phase of the annular mode can continue as long as both the lower stratospheric winds remain weak and the wave source is sufficient. Model runs with lower stratospheric winds that were always sufficiently weak or always too strong showed no significant tropospheric response to any extreme stratospheric events. Similarly, shifting mountains into the polar region appeared to shift the wave drag away from <b>synoptic</b> eddy feedback <b>region.</b> In either of these two cases, none of the model runs exhibited signs of a tropospheric response, consistent with the wave drag projection onto the annular mode having a key role in allowing the stratosphere to affect the tropospheric circulation. by Cegeon J Chan.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{results of the}} first three years of radon time series and radon {{gradient}} observations at the Cabauw site in the Netherlands (51. 971 °N, 4. 927 °E). Two 1500 L dual flow loop, two filter radon detectors with a sensitivity better than 40 mBq m- 3 are installed at the site, ensuring that gradients can be defined to the required precision every hour. The inlets are mounted on the main meteorological tower at 20 m and 200 m above ground level. The Cabauw site, located 50 km inland on a polder in an agricultural region, has a simple orography with surface elevations changing by a few metres at most within a 20 km radius. The radon gradient observations are part of our larger program to characterise turbulent mixing processes throughout the lower atmosphere. The two other related measurement projects are the continuous hourly measurements of radon gradients in the surface layer on a 50 m tower at Lucas Heights, Australia (34. 053 ºS, 150. 981 ºE; see Chambers et al, this conference), and campaign-style measurements of radon profiles up to altitudes of 4000 m above ground level using light aircraft (see Williams et al., this conference). We observe well pronounced absolute radon and radon gradient signals at Cabauw, influenced by atmospheric processes occurring on seasonal, synoptic, and diurnal time scales. Seasonal variability - the lowest radon concentrations were observed in winter and summer, when the dominant air mass fetch was the Atlantic Ocean. In spring and autumn, concentrations were generally high, as the air mass fetch was primarily over western and/or central Europe. Even when the fetch was oceanic during the latter seasons, it was often over the North Sea where radon concentrations are perturbed by land emissions. In autumn, radon concentrations from the mainland European fetch were more than three times larger than the corresponding concentration from the Atlantic/North Sea <b>regions.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> variability - the radon signal is typically a combination of local and remote influences. Synoptic and diurnal components can be separated by comparing the radon signal at 20 m and 200 m, and by using wind speed as a selecting condition. For most of the data, the diurnal signal is strongly pronounced in the 20 m data, especially when wind speeds are lower than 3 ms- 1. In low wind conditions, local influences dominate and the radon signal is predominantly a combination of local source variations and diurnal changes in the local mixing depth. On the other hand, under high wind conditions (> 7 ms- 1) the remote signal dominates at both levels, reflecting variations in the radon source function over a wider fetch area, the geographic extent of which is defined by the radon half-life and prevailing wind conditions. The separation of these two signals provides an opportunity to compare subsets of radon time series and gradient observations with a column or regional model and thus evaluate mixing and transport schemes characteristic for the site and the region. Diurnal variability - diurnal composite plots show that the 20 m signal is characterized by an early morning maximum and early afternoon minimum, predominantly reflecting changes in the boundary layer mixing depth on this time scale. The amplitude of this cycle ranged from 450 mBq m- 3 in winter to 1460 mBq m- 3 in spring. The 200 m Cabauw data exhibited a modest mid-morning maximum, consistent with upward mixing of radon from the surface as the nocturnal inversion breaks down. European Geosciences Unio...|$|R
