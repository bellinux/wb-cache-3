There have been several different edits of the same recording of the theme song over the years.|$|E
25|$|This kind of song {{is called}} a keerthanam or a kriti. There are other {{possible}} structures for a kriti, which may in addition include swara passages named chittaswara. A chittaswara consists only of notes, and has <b>no</b> <b>words.</b> Still others have a verse {{at the end of}} the charana, called the madhyamakāla. It is sung immediately after the charana, but at double speed.|$|E

25|$|Some {{spaces of}} the tables are not filled, {{but this does not}} mean that there are <b>no</b> <b>words</b> which would fit. The sounds a, e (end-firm when stressed) and i, u (short) can not be start-firm and {{consequently}} the word having them in the next-to-last stressed syllable can not be of the first and the third accentuation pattern. Some of the declensional types include few words, for example there are only two words of the third accentuation pattern in the fifth declension: sūnùs and lietùs. The number of words (Dictionary of contemporary Lithuanian language / Dabartinės Lietuvių kalbos žodynas; the fourth issue, 2000) of the declensional patterns can be checked in the section above.|$|E
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} for a law to be authentically interpreted, recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation, for which rules of law have been formulated. The words of a law must be understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be taken in another sense, or the rules of law dictate another interpretation. In all interpretations, however, the meaning of the words is to be preferred which favours equity rather than strict justice. The provisions of a previous statute are not presumed to be changed beyond the express meaning of the words of a new law. <b>No</b> <b>words</b> of a law are ever presumed to be superfluous. In interpreting a law the words must be considered in their context. When the words of a law are doubtful the presumption is in favour of the subjects, not of the lawgiver.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} Hesiod's {{complaints}} about poverty, life on his father's farm {{could not have}} been too uncomfortable if Works and Days is anything to judge by, since he describes the routines of prosperous yeomanry rather than peasants. His farmer employs a friend (Works and Days 370) as well as servants (502, 573, 597, 608, 766), an energetic and responsible ploughman of mature years (469 ff.), a slave boy to cover the seed (441–6), a female servant to keep house (405, 602) and working teams of oxen and mules (405, 607f.). One modern scholar surmises that Hesiod may have learned about world geography, especially the catalogue of rivers in Theogony (337–45), listening to his father's accounts of his own sea voyages as a merchant. The father probably spoke in the Aeolian dialect of Cyme but Hesiod probably grew up speaking the local Boeotian, belonging to the same dialect group. However, while his poetry features some Aeolisms there are <b>no</b> <b>words</b> that are certainly Boeotian. His basic language was the main literary dialect of the time, Homer's Ionian.|$|E

Taft supported the effort to get Justice Hughes to resign from the bench and accept the Republican presidential nomination. Once this was done, Hughes tried to get Roosevelt and Taft to reconcile, as a united effort was needed to defeat Wilson. This occurred on October 3 in New York, but Roosevelt allowed only a handshake, and <b>no</b> <b>words</b> were exchanged.
