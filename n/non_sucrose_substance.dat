In rats trained to respond for sucrose pellets on nose poking fixed ratio 1 (FR 1) schedule, dialysate DA increased in the shell {{but not in the}} core during active responding as well as under extinction in the presence of sucrose cues. In rats responding for sucrose on lever pressing FR 1 schedule we observed a strengthening of DA transmission both in the shell and in the core.

Furthermore, E 4 orf 4 targets protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) to this complex and to chromatin.

Knockdown of the Acf 1 homolog, WSTF, inhibits E 4 orf 4 -induced cell death.

The obese diabetic db/db mouse, which has defects in leptin receptor, displays enhanced neural responses and elevated behavioral preference to sweet stimuli.

An administration of leptin into lean mice suppressed responses of peripheral taste nerves (chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal) to sweet <b>substances</b> (<b>sucrose</b> and saccharin) without affecting responses to sour, salty, and bitter substances. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of activities of taste receptor cells isolated from circumvallate papillae (innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve) demonstrated that leptin activated outward K+ currents, which resulted in hyperpolarization of taste cells. The db/db mouse with impaired leptin receptors showed no such leptin suppression. Taste tissue (circumvallate papilla) of lean mice expressed leptin-receptor mRNA {{and some of the}} taste cells exhibited immunoreactivities to antibodies of the leptin receptor. Taken together, these observations suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target for leptin, and that leptin may be a sweet-sensing modulator (suppressor) that may take part in regulation of food intake.

40|$|There {{is a close}} {{relationship}} between histone acetylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling that is not fully understood. We show that acetylation of histone H 3 tails affects SWI/SNF (mating type switching/ <b>sucrose</b> <b>non</b> fermenting) and RSC (remodels structure of chromatin) remodeling in several distinct ways. Acetylation of the histone H 3 N-terminal tail facilitated recruitment and nucleosome mobilization by the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers SWI/SNF and RSC. Tetra-acetylated H 3, but not tetra-acetylated H 4 tails, increased the affinity of RSC and SWI/SNF for nucleosomes while also changing the subunits of SWI/SNF that interact with the H 3 tail. The enhanced recruitment of SWI/SNF due to H 3 acetylation is bromodomain dependent, but is not further enhanced by additional bromodomains found in RSC. The combined effect of H 3 acetylation and transcription activators is greater than either separately which suggests they act in parallel to recruit SWI/SNF. Besides enhancing recruitment, H 3 acetylation increased nucleosome mobilization and H 2 A/H 2 B displacement by RSC and SWI/SNF in a bromodomain dependent manner {{and to a lesser}} extent enhanced ATP hydrolysis independent of bromodomains. H 3 and H 4 acetylation did not stimulate disassembly of adjacent nucleosomes in short arrays by SWI/SNF or RSC.

40|$|Taste plays {{a crucial}} role in the life of honey bees as their {{survival}} depends on the collection and intake of nectar and pollen, and other natural products. Here we studied the tarsal taste of honey bees through a series of behavioral and electrophysiological analyses. We characterized responsiveness to various sweet, salty and bitter tastants delivered to gustatory sensilla of the fore tarsi. Behavioral experiments showed that stimulation of opposite fore tarsi with <b>sucrose</b> and bitter <b>substances</b> or water yielded different outcomes depending on the stimulation sequence. When sucrose was applied first, thereby eliciting proboscis extension, no bitter substance could induce proboscis retraction, thus suggesting that the primacy of sucrose stimulation induced a central excitatory state. When bitter substances or water were applied first, sucrose stimulation could still elicit proboscis extension but to a lower level, thus suggesting central inhibition based on contradictory gustatory input on opposite tarsi. Electrophysiological experiments showed that receptor cells in the gustatory sensilla of the tarsomeres are highly sensitive to saline solutions at low concentrations. No evidence for receptors responding specifically to sucrose or to bitter substances was found in these sensilla. Receptor cells in the gustatory sensilla of the claws are highly sensitive to sucrose. Although bees do not possess dedicated bitter-taste receptors on the tarsi, indirect bitter detection is possible because bitter tastes inhibit sucrose receptor cells of the claws when mixed with sucrose solution. By combining behavioral and electrophysiological approaches, these results provide the first integrative study on tarsal taste detection in the honey bee...|$|R
40|$|Trehalose- 6 -phosphate (T 6 P) is {{required}} for carbon utilization during Arabidopsis development, and its absence is embryo lethal. Here we show that T 6 P accumulation inhibits seedling growth. Wild-type seedlings grown on 100 mM trehalose rapidly accumulate T 6 P and stop growing, but seedlings expressing Escherichia coli trehalose phosphate hydrolase develop normally on such medium. T 6 P accumulation likely results from much-reduced T 6 P dephosphorylation when trehalose levels are high. Metabolizable sugars added to trehalose medium rescue T 6 P inhibition of growth. In addition, Suc feeding leads to a progressive increase in T 6 P concentrations, suggesting that T 6 P control over carbon utilization is related to available carbon for growth. Expression analysis of genes from the Arabidopsis trehalose metabolism further supports this: Suc rapidly induces expression of trehalose phosphate synthase homolog AtTPS 5 to high levels. In contrast, T 6 P accumulation after feeding trehalose {{in the absence of}} available carbon induces repression of genes encoding T 6 P synthases and expression of T 6 P phosphatases. To identify processes controlled by T 6 P, we clustered expression profile data from seedlings with altered T 6 P content. T 6 P levels correlate with expression of a specific set of genes, including the S 6 ribosomal kinase ATPK 19, independently of carbon status.

This study aimed to elucidate the role of SNF 3 (<b>Sucrose</b> <b>Non</b> Fermenting 3) as a glucose sensor and its possible role in contributing to the fitness and survivability of C. glabrata in glucose-limited environment. The SNF 3 knockout strain was constructed and subjected to different glucose concentrations to evaluate its growth, biofilm formation, amphotericin B susceptibility, ex vivo survivability and effects on the transcriptional profiling of the sugar receptor repressor (SRR) pathway-related genes. The SNF 3 Δ strain showed a retarded growth in low glucose environments (0. 01 % and 0. 1 %) in both fermentation and respiration-preferred conditions but grew well in high glucose concentration environments (1 % and 2 %). It was also found to be more susceptible to amphotericin B in low glucose environment (0. 1 %) and macrophage engulfment but showed no difference in the biofilm formation capability. The deletion of SNF 3 also resulted in the down-regulation of about half of hexose transporters genes (4 out of 9). Overall, the deletion of SNF 3 causes significant reduction in the ability of C. glabrata to sense limited surrounding glucose and consequently disrupts its competency to transport and perform the uptake of this critical nutrient. This study highlighted the role of SNF 3 as a high affinity glucose sensor and its role in aiding the survivability of C. glabrata particularly in glucose limited environment...|$|R

Quality of the raw material depends on complex impact of number of factors, like natural, climatic, agritechnical, and varietal. Currently, there are some negative factors, like decreasing of soil fertility, increasing of soil's infectious background, prevalence of the foreign hybrid sorts of sugar beets which are vulnerable for local pathogens. These factors cause the increase of the diseases of sugar beets' root system – fusarium decay and vascular bacteriosis. The explorations of sugar beets' crops {{for many years in}} different areas of Central-Chernozem region have revealed high damage for yield from these diseases. In some years the loss of yield was up to 50 %. The determination of impact of bacterial infections on the processes of forming of the chemical composition of sugar beets' roots and the accumulation of sugar in sugar beets' roots is the very important task for science and production. The researches have been done in the laboratory of store and production raw materials, in the Laboratory of immunity, in the department of biotechnology of the FSTSO “All-Russian research institute for sugar beet and sugar named after A.

Intensity judgments were higher in cancer patients with respect to sweet (for median and high concentrations, P< 0. 05), salty (for all concentrations, P< 0. 05), and bitter tastes (for median concentration, P< 0. 01). Hedonic function increased with the increase of the stimuli only for the sweet taste. A negative linear correlation was found between sour, bitter, and salty concentrations and hedonic score. Both in cancer patients and in healthy subjects, hedonic judgments increased with the increase of the stimulus for the sweet taste (r= 0. 978 and r= 0. 985, P= 0. 004 and P= 0. 002, respectively), and decreased for the salty (r=- 0. 827 and r=- 0. 884, P= 0. 084 and P= 0. 047, respectively) and bitter tastes (r=- 0. 990 and r=- 0. 962, P= 0. 009 and P= 0. 001, respectively). For the sour taste, the hedonic scores remained stable with the increase of the stimulus in noncancer controls (r=- 0. 785, P= 0. 115) and decreased in cancer patients (r=- 0. 996, P= 0. 0001). The hedonic scores for the sweet taste and the bitter taste were similar in cancer patients and healthy subjects, and these scores were significantly higher in cancer patients than in healthy subjects for most of the concentrations of the salty taste and all the concentrations of the sour taste. The present study suggests that cancer patients, compared to healthy individuals, have a normal sensitivity, a normal liking for pleasant stimuli, and a decreased dislike for unpleasant stimuli. Moreover, when compared to controls, they show higher hedonic scores for middle and high concentrations of the salty taste and for all concentrations of the sour taste. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these changes observed in cancer patients translate into any alteration in dietary behavior and/or food preferences...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the taste}} of food have been implicated as a {{potential}} cause of reduced dietary intake among cancer patients. However, data on intensity and hedonic responses to the four basic tastes in cancer are scanty and contradictory. The present study aimed at evaluating taste intensity and hedonic responses to simple beverages in 47 anorectic patients affected by gastrointestinal cancer and in 55 healthy subjects. Five suprathreshold concentrations {{of each of the}} four test <b>substances</b> (<b>sucrose</b> in black current drinks, citric acid in lemonade, NaCl in unsalted tomato juice, and urea in tonic water) were used. Patients were invited to express a judgment of intensity and pleasantness ranging from 0 to 10. Mean intensity scores directly correlated with concentrations of sour, salty, bitter, and sweet stimuli, in both normals and those with cancer. Intensity judgments were higher in cancer patients with respect to sweet (for median and high concentrations, P < 0. 05), salty (for all concentrations, P < 0. 05), and bitter tastes (for median concentration, P < 0. 01). Hedonic function increased with the increase of the stimuli only for the sweet taste. A negative linear correlation was found between sour, bitter, and salty concentrations and hedonic score. Both in cancer patients and in healthy subjects, hedonic judgments increased with the increase of the stimulus for the sweet taste (r 1 / 4 0. 978 and r 1 / 4 0. 985, P 1 / 4 0. 004 and P 1 / 4 0. 002, respectively), and decreased for the salty (r 1 / 4 ?? 0. 827 and r 1 / 4 ?? 0. 884, P 1 / 4 0. 084 and P 1 / 4 0. 047, respectively) and bitter tastes (r 1 / 4 ?? 0. 990 and r 1 / 4 ?? 0. 962, P 1 / 4 0. 009 and P 1 / 4 0. 001, respectively). For the sour taste, the hedonic scores remained stable with the increase of the stimulus in noncancer controls (r 1 / 4 ?? 0. 785, P 1 / 4 0. 115) and decreased in cancer patients (r 1 / 4 ?? 0. 996, P 1 / 4 0. 0001).
