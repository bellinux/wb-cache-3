5000|$|Team {{members of}} the Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE), said they were pleased with the {{performance}} of their apparatus and the data they acquired during USMP-2. While dendrite growth was taking place, two 35 mm cameras took photographs for post-mission analysis. When a dendrite growth cycle was completed, the small crystalline structure was re-melted and another grown at a different [...] "supercooling" [...] temperature. Dendrites were grown at 20 different levels of supercooling ranging up to approximately 1.3 degrees Celsius. Supercooling is the slow cooling of a liquid to below its <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> point, but due to its purity, does not solidify. The level of supercooling is determined by the difference between the temperature of the liquid and its <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> point. IDGE was a fundamental materials science experiment performed in the microgravity environment of space in order to increase understanding of the solidification processes.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States alone, it {{has been}} {{estimated}} that frost accounts for approximately $1 billion in crop damage each year. As P. syringae commonly inhabits plant surfaces, its ice nucleating nature incites frost development, freezing the buds of the plant and destroying the occurring crop. The introduction of an ice-minus strain of P. syringae to the surface of plants would incur competition between the strains. Should the ice-minus strain win out, the ice nucleate provided by P. syringae would no longer be present, lowering the level of frost development on plant surfaces at <b>normal</b> water <b>freezing</b> temperature - 0 C. Even if the ice-minus strain does not win out, the amount of ice nucleate present from ice-plus P. syringae would be reduced due to competition. Decreased levels of frost generation at <b>normal</b> water <b>freezing</b> temperature would translate into a lowered quantity of crops lost due to frost damage, rendering higher crop yields overall.|$|R

Crystal growth under such conditions may behave different from normal textbook knowledge which generally assumes low supersaturation. Ice particles may get an unordered structure, with high surface energy such that the equilibrium saturation pressure over such an ice particle is higher than that for normal ice.

Furthermore we observe characteristic quantum mechanical features like Bose-Einstein statistics of the occupation numbers of the <b>normal</b> modes, <b>freezing</b> of the heat conductivity and the influence of the entanglement within the chain on the current.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to stimulus–reward learning, rats with lesions of peri- and postgenual ACC were tested on a variety of Pavlovian conditioning tasks. Lesioned rats learned to approach a food alcove during a stimulus predicting food, and responded normally for conditioned reinforcement. They also exhibited <b>normal</b> conditioned <b>freezing</b> and Pavlovian– instrumental transfer, yet were impaired at autoshaping. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, a further task was developed in which approach to the food alcove was under the control of 2 stimuli, only 1 of which was followed by reward.

40|$|The {{application}} of ultrasound during immersion freezing of broccoli was studied and particular attention {{was given to}} the effects on freezing time, microstructure, firmness and drip loss of broccoli. Broccoli florets were immersion frozen in an ultrasound-assisted freezer at two frequencies and four different power levels. The results showed that the total freezing time and times required for pre-cooling, phase change and sub-cooling stages of broccoli were significantly reduced by the {{application of}} ultrasound-assisted freezing (UAF) at 150 (30 kHz) or 175 W (20 kHz) power level and with judicious combination of process parameters (exposure time, ultrasound irradiation temperature and pulse mode).

50|$|Second, the icephobicity {{implies the}} ability to prevent ice {{formation}} on the surface. Such ability is characterized by whether a droplet of supercooled water (below the <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> temperature of 0 C) freezes at the interface. The process of freezing can be characterized by time delay of heterogeneous ice nucleation. The mechanisms of droplet freezing are quite complex and can depend on the temperature level, on whether cooling down of the droplet is performed {{from the side of}} the solid substrate or from vapor and by other factors.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{supercooling}} is a last resort for animals. The best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible. As an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids, as this is a thermodynamically unstable state. The fluids eventually reach the supercooling point, which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> point. Animals unintentionally undergo supercooling and are only able to decrease the odds of freezing once supercooled. Even though supercooling is essential for survival, there are many risks associated with it.|$|E
5000|$|As this {{supercooled}} {{saline water}} reaches unfrozen seawater below the ice, {{it will cause}} the creation of additional ice. Water moves from high to low concentrations, and the brine possesses a lower concentration of water, therefore attracting surrounding water.  Due to the cold temperature of the brine water, the newly attracted water freezes.  If the brine channels are relatively evenly distributed, the ice pack grows downward evenly. However, if brine channels are concentrated in one small area, the downward flow of the cold water, now so saline that it cannot freeze at its <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> point, begins to interact with unfrozen seawater as a flow. Just as hot air from a fire rises as a plume, this cold, dense water descends as a plume. Its outer edges begin to accumulate a layer of ice as the surrounding water, cooled by this jet to below its freezing point, ices up. A brinicle has now been formed, resembling an inverted [...] "chimney" [...] of ice enclosing a downward flow of this supercooled, supersaline water.|$|E
50|$|Most known ice-nucleating {{bacteria}} are plant pathogens. These pathogens can cause freezing injury in plants. In the United States alone, {{it has been}} estimated that frost accounts for approximately $1 billion in crop damage each year. The ice-minus variant of P. syringae is a mutant, lacking the gene responsible for ice-nucleating surface protein production. This lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice formation. Both strains of P. syringae occur naturally, but recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific genes, enabling the creation of the ice-minus strain. The introduction of an ice-minus strain of P. syringae to the surface of plants would incur competition between the strains. Should the ice-minus strain win out, the ice nucleate provided by P. syringae would no longer be present, lowering the level of frost development on plant surfaces at <b>normal</b> water <b>freezing</b> temperature (0°C).|$|R

She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact, and is unable to touch a <b>normal</b> person without <b>freezing</b> them.|$|R
40|$|One {{millimeter}} sized shoot-tips excised from {{rooted in}} vitro plants {{of the genera}} Musa and Ensete were successfully cryopreserved with the droplet vitrification technique. We show that the loading phase can be prolonged up to 7 h and that the optimal length of PVS 2 treatment is 30 - 50 min at 0 degreesC. Ultra rapid freezing and thawing rates proved to be essential for high and reproducible post-thaw regeneration rates. This results in an increase of 23 - 46 % compared to the <b>normal</b> cryovial <b>freezing</b> protocol. When the optimal procedure was applied to 56 accessions belonging to eight different genomic groups of Musa spp. and one Ensete spp., an average of 52. 9 % post-thaw regeneration was obtained.

50|$|Under some {{atmospheric}} conditions, {{snow crystals}} may encounter supercooled water droplets. These droplets, {{which have a}} diameter of about 10 µm in, can exist in the liquid state at temperatures as low as , far below the <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> point. Contact between a snow crystal and the supercooled droplets results in freezing of the liquid droplets {{onto the surface of}} the crystal. This process of crystal growth is known as accretion. Crystals that exhibit frozen droplets on their surfaces are often referred to as rimed. When this process continues so that the shape of the original snow crystal is no longer identifiable, the resulting crystal is referred to as graupel. Graupel was formerly referred to by meteorologists as soft hail. However, graupel is easily distinguishable from hail in both the shape and strength of the pellet and the circumstances in which it falls. Ice from hail is formed in hard, relatively uniform layers and usually falls only during thunderstorms. Graupel forms fragile, oblong shapes and falls in place of typical snowflakes in wintry mix situations, often in concert with ice pellets. Graupel is also fragile enough that it will typically fall apart when touched.|$|E
50|$|The surface {{environment}} {{does not}} play a decisive role {{in the formation of}} ice and snow. The density fluctuations inside drops result in that the possible freezing regions cover the middle and the surface regions. The freezing from the surface or from within may be random. However, in the strange world of water, tiny amounts of liquid water theoretically still are present, even as temperatures go below minus 48 C (minus 55 F) and almost all the water has turned solid, either into crystalline ice or amorphous water. Below minus 48 C (minus 55 F), ice is crystallizing too fast for any property of the remaining liquid to be measured.The freezing speed directly influences the nucleation process and ice crystal size. A supercooled liquid will stay in a liquid state below the <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> point when it has little opportunity for nucleation; that is, if it is pure enough and has a smooth enough container. Once agitated it will rapidly become a solid.During the final stage of freezing, an ice drop develops a pointy tip, which is not observed for most other liquids, arises because water expands as it freezes. Once the liquid is completely frozen, the sharp tip of the drop attracts water vapor in the air, much like a sharp metal lightning rod attracts electrical charges. The water vapor collects on the tip and a tree of small ice crystals starts to grow. An opposite effect has been shown to preferentially extract water molecules from the sharp edge of potato wedges in the oven.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{for the formation of}} ice clouds was discovered by Tor Bergeron. The Bergeron process notes that the saturation vapor pressure of water, or how much water vapor a given volume can contain, depends on what the vapor is interacting with. Specifically, the saturation vapor pressure with respect to ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure with respect to water. Water vapor interacting with a water droplet may be saturated, at 100% relative humidity, when interacting with a water droplet, but the same amount of water vapor would be supersaturated when interacting with an ice particle. [...] The water vapor will attempt to return to equilibrium, so the extra water vapor will condense into ice {{on the surface of the}} particle. These ice particles end up as the nuclei of larger ice crystals. This process only happens at temperatures between 0 C and -40 C. Below -40 C, liquid water will spontaneously nucleate, and freeze. The surface tension of the water allows the droplet to stay liquid well below its <b>normal</b> <b>freezing</b> point. When this happens, it is now supercooled liquid water. The Bergeron process relies on supercooled liquid water (SLW) interacting with ice nuclei to form larger particles. If there are few ice nuclei compared to the amount of SLW, droplets will be unable to form. A process whereby scientists seed a cloud with artificial ice nuclei to encourage precipitation is known as cloud seeding. This can help cause precipitation in clouds that otherwise may not rain. Cloud seeding adds excess artificial ice nuclei which shifts the balance so that there are many nuclei compared to the amount of supercooled liquid water. An overseeded cloud will form many particles, but each will be very small. This can be done as a preventative measure for areas that are at risk for hail storms.|$|E
40|$|Retinitis pigmentosa is a {{heterogeneous}} group of inherited retinal disorders {{in which the}} photoreceptor cells degenerate. A line of transgenic mice expresses a mutant opsin gene that encodes three missense mutations near the amino terminus, including P 23 H, which {{is the basis for}} a common form of dominant retinitis pigmentosa. By studying the photoreceptor cells of these mice and their normal littermates, we found that: (1) opsin was routed correctly, (2) the concentration of opsin in the disk membranes appeared <b>normal</b> by <b>freeze</b> fracture analysis, (3) the amount of disk membrane shedding was normal, but (4) the basal disks of the outer segments were disorganized, indicating defective disk membrane morphogenesis. Defective disk membrane morphogenesis appears to result in the formation of fewer mature disks, thus accounting for observed gradual shortening of the photoreceptor outer segments with age. We suggest that abnormal disk membrane morphogenesis is the primary cellular defect that leads to blindness, and that it arises from the inability of nascent disk membranes, containing normal and mutant opsin, to interact normally with each other...|$|R

50|$|Climate {{change and}} the {{associated}} changing weather patterns occurring worldwide have a direct effect on biology, population ecology, and the population of eruptive insects, such as the mountain pine beetle (MPB). This is because temperature is a factor which determines insect development and population success. Mountain Pine Beetle are a species native to Western North America. Prior to climatic and temperature changes, the mountain pine beetle predominately lived and attacked lodgepole and ponderosa pine trees at lower elevations, as the higher elevation Rocky Mountains and Cascades were too cold for their survival. Under <b>normal</b> seasonal <b>freezing</b> weather conditions in the lower elevations, the forest ecosystems that pine beetles inhabit are kept in a balance by factors such as tree defense mechanisms, beetle defense mechanisms, and freezing temperatures. It is a simple relationship between a host (the forest), an agent (the beetle) and the environment (the weather & temperature). However, as climate change causes mountain areas to become warmer and drier, pine beetles have more power to infest and destroy the forest ecosystems, such as the whitebark pine forests of the Rockies. This is a forest so important to forest ecosystems that {{it is called the}} “rooftop of the rockies”. Climate change has led to a threatening pine beetle pandemic, causing them to spread far beyond their native habitat. This leads to ecosystem changes, forest fires, floods and hazards to human health.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The neuropeptide {{vasoactive}} intestinal peptide (VIP) {{is widely}} {{distributed in the}} adult central nervous system where this peptide functions to regulate synaptic transmission and neural excitability. The expression of VIP and its receptors in brain regions implicated in learning and memory functions, including the hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, raise the possibility that this peptide may function to modulate learned behaviors. Among other actions, the loss of VIP has {{a profound effect on}} circadian timing and may specifically influence the temporal regulation of learning and memory functions. Results In the present study, we utilized transgenic VIP-deficient mice and the contextual fear conditioning paradigm to explore the impact of the loss of this peptide on a learned behavior. We found that VIP-deficient mice exhibited <b>normal</b> shock-evoked <b>freezing</b> behavior and increases in corticosterone. Similarly, these mutant mice exhibited no deficits in the acquisition or recall of the fear-conditioned behavior when tested 24 -hours after training. The VIP-deficient mice exhibited a significant reduction in recall when tested 48 -hours or longer after training. Surprisingly, we found that the VIP-deficient mice continued to express circadian rhythms in the recall of the training even in those individual mice whose wheel running wheel activity was arrhythmic. One mechanistic explanation is suggested by the finding that daily rhythms in the expression of the clock gene Period 2 continue in the hippocampus of VIP-deficient mice. Conclusion Together these data suggest that the neuropeptide VIP regulates the recall of at least one learned behavior but does not impact the circadian regulation of this behavior. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{in order to develop}} test methods and procedures for measuring the variation of the stress intensity factor through the thickness in bimaterial specimens containing cracks within and parallel to the bond line using the frozen stress photoelastic method. Since stress freezing materials are incompressible above critical temperature, and since thick plates are to be employed which tend to produce a state of plane strain near the crack tip, the interface near tip fracture equations reduce to the classic form for homogeneous materials. Moreover, zero thickness interfaces do not exist when materials are bonded together. It was decided early on that it would be important to insure a uniform straight and accurate crack tip region through the thickness of the body to reduce scatter in the SIF distribution through the thickness. It was also observed that rubberlike materials which were desired to be modeled exhibited significant tip blunting prior to crack extension and that some blunting of the tip would provide a more realistic model. It should be noted that, in <b>normal</b> stress <b>freezing</b> photoelastic work, it is considered good practice to avoid utilizing data near bond lines in photoelastic models due to the bond line stresses which inevitably develop when two parts are bonded together. Thus, the present study involves certain exploratory aspects in deviating from standard practice in stress freezing work. With the above ideas in mind, several different test methods were investigated and are described in the following sections and appendices.

We use the neural network to find the mapping between features and subjective test scores. We optimize the network structure and the feature selection through a cross validation procedure, using training samples extracted from both VQEG and LIVE video databases.
