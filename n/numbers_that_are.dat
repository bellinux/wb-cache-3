25|$|Algebraic {{numbers are}} those that are a {{solution}} to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers.

50|$|In France roads <b>that</b> <b>were</b> in {{the care}} of the {{national}} government were prefixed by “RN” (later just “N”) and had a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> unique across all of France.

The advent of motorways meant an extension to both the British and the French methods of roads identification.|$|R
25|$|Because zero {{is neither}} {{positive}} nor negative, the term nonnegative is sometimes {{used to refer}} to a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> either positive or zero, while nonpositive is {{used to refer to}} a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> either negative or zero. Zero is a neutral number.|$|R
25|$|The {{generalized}} Bernoulli {{numbers are}} certain algebraic numbers, defined similarly to the Bernoulli <b>numbers,</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> related to special values of Dirichlet -functions {{in the same}} way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.|$|E
25|$|This sample program {{implements}} the Sieve of Eratosthenes to {{find all}} the prime <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> less than 100. nil is the ALGOL 68 analogue of the null pointer in other languages. The notation x of y accesses a member x of a struct y.|$|E
25|$|The Rado graph {{may also}} be formed by a {{construction}} resembling that for Paley graphs. Take as the vertices of a graph all the prime <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> congruent to 1 modulo 4, and connect two vertices by an edge whenever {{one of the two}} numbers is a quadratic residue modulo the other (by quadratic reciprocity and the restriction of the vertices to primes congruent to 1 mod 4, this is a symmetric relation, so it defines an undirected graph). Then, for any sets U and V, by the Chinese remainder theorem, the <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> quadratic resides modulo every prime in U and nonresidues modulo every prime in V form a periodic sequence, so by Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions this number-theoretic graph has the extension property.|$|E
50|$|Tax profit or {{taxable profit}} {{is used to}} {{distinguish}} between accounting profit or earnings (the <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> generally referred to in financial results for public companies and quoted in the press).

50|$|In {{the same}} way that when summing the squares of the digits (and working in base 10) each number above 243(=3*81) {{produces}} a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> strictly smaller, when summing the cubes of the digits each number above 2916(=4*729) produces a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> strictly smaller.|$|R
50|$|A semiperfect number <b>is</b> {{a natural}} <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{equal to the}} sum of all or some of its proper divisors. A semiperfect <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> equal to {{the sum of all}} its proper divisors is a perfect number.

25|$|Most GSM {{mobile phones}} have 112, 999 and 911 as pre-programmed {{emergency}} <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> always available.

The GSM network can also update the list of well-known emergency numbers when the phone registers to it.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} to the ancient Greeks that square roots of {{positive}} whole <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not perfect squares are always irrational numbers: numbers not expressible as a ratio of two integers (that is to say they cannot be written exactly as m/n, where m and n are integers). This is the theorem Euclid X, 9 almost certainly due to Theaetetus dating back to circa 380BC.|$|E
25|$|Another {{equivalent}} {{formulation of}} the same problem involves congruent numbers, the <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> areas of right triangles whose three sides are all rational numbers. By multiplying the sides by a common denominator, any congruent number may be transformed into the area of a Pythagorean triangle, from which {{it follows that the}} congruent numbers are exactly the numbers formed by multiplying a congruum by the square of a rational number. Thus, there is no square congruum if and only if the number1 is not a congruent number. Equivalently, it is impossible for a square (the geometric shape) and a right triangle to have both equal areas and all sides commensurate with each other.|$|E
500|$|This proof {{relies on}} the fact <b>that</b> zero <b>is</b> the only nonnegative <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> less than all inverses of integers, or {{equivalently}} <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> larger than every integer. This is the Archimedean property, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> verified for rational numbers and real numbers. Real numbers may be enlarged into number systems, such as hyperreal numbers, with infinitely small numbers (infinitesimals) and infinitely large numbers (infinite numbers). When using such systems, notation 0.999... is generally not used, as there <b>is</b> no smallest <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no less than all [...] (This [...] is implied {{by the fact that}} [...] implies [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|Every {{practical}} <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not a {{power of}} two is semiperfect.|$|R
2500|$|A semiperfect number <b>is</b> {{a natural}} <b>number</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{equal to the}} sum of all or some of its proper divisors.

[...] Most {{abundant}} numbers are also semiperfect; abundant numbers which are not semiperfect are called weird numbers.|$|R
25|$|Because the congrua {{are exactly}} the <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> four times the area of a Pythagorean triangle, and {{multiplication}} by four does not change whether a number is square, {{the existence of a}} square congruum is equivalent to the existence of a Pythagorean triangle with a square area. It is this variant of the problem that Fermat's proof concerns: he shows {{that there is no such}} triangle. In considering this problem, Fermat was inspired not by Fibonacci but by an edition of Diophantus published by Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac. This book described various special right triangles whose areas had forms related to squares, but did not consider the case of areas that were themselves square.|$|E
25|$|In 1225, Fibonacci was {{challenged}} {{to find a}} construction for triples of square <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> equally spaced from each other, forming an arithmetic progression, and for the spacing between these numbers, which he called a congruum. One way of describing Fibonacci's solution is that the numbers to be squared are the difference of legs, hypotenuse, and sum of legs of a Pythagorean triangle, and that the congruum is four times {{the area of the}} same triangle. In his later work on the congruum problem, published in The Book of Squares, Fibonacci observed that it is impossible for a congruum to be a square number itself, but did not present a satisfactory proof of this fact.|$|E
25|$|Hasse {{diagrams}} can visually {{represent the}} elements and relations of a partial ordering. These are graph drawings where the vertices are {{the elements of}} the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both the edges and the relative positioning of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element x is smaller than (precedes) y then there exists a path from x to y that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An instructive exercise is to draw the Hasse diagram for the set of natural <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the divides relation).|$|E

25|$|Polysomy is a {{condition}} found in many species, including fungi, plants, insects, and mammals, in which an organism {{has at least one}} more chromosome than normal, i.e., there may be three or more copies of the chromosome rather than the expected two copies. Most eukaryotic species are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes, whereas prokaryotes are haploid, containing a single chromosome in each cell. Aneuploids possess chromosome <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not exact multiples of the haploid number and polysomy is a type of aneuploidy. A karyotype is the set of chromosomes in an organism and the suffix -somy is used to name aneuploid karyotypes. This is {{not to be confused with}} the suffix -ploidy, referring to the number of complete sets of chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|In all these, {{a process}} is defined for loading the indenter, {{measuring}} the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> consistent with our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods {{has shown that the}} hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E
