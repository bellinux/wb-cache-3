5|$|Another {{executive}} order, also in 1948, made {{it illegal}} to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race. A third, in 1951, established the Committee on Government Contract Compliance (CGCC). This committee ensured defense contractors did <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> because of race.|$|E

In 2016, {{it was decided}} to open all roles to women in 2018; women had not been permitted to join the Combat Arms. The British Army is an equal-opportunity employer (with some exceptions due to its medical standards), and does <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> based on race, religion or sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

5|$|Other European {{countries}} had awards that did <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> against class or rank; France awarded the Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honour, established 1802) and The Netherlands gave the Order of William (established in 1815). There was a growing feeling {{among the public}} and in the Royal Court that a new award was needed to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man's lengthy or meritorious service. Queen Victoria issued a Warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856 (gazetted 5 February 1856) that officially constituted the VC. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E
5|$|The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is a non-elected {{government}} body in Singapore established in 1970, the main function {{of which is}} to scrutinize most of the bills passed by Parliament to ensure that they do <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> against any racial or religious community. If the Council feels that any provision in a bill amounts to a differentiating measure, it will report its findings to Parliament and refer the bill back to Parliament for reconsideration. The Council also examines subsidiary legislation and statutes in force on 9 January 1970. One member of the PCMR is nominated by the Chairman to the Presidential Elections Committee, which is empowered to ensure that candidates for the office of President have the qualifications required by the Constitution. The President also appoints and dismisses the chairman and members of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony ("PCRH"), established by the , on the advice of the PCMR, and the PCMR is responsible for determining whether PCRH members who are not representatives of major religions in Singapore have distinguished themselves in public service or community relations in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The Sultan of Brunei's {{stake in}} the {{ownership}} of the hotel drew controversy in April 2014 when he initiated {{the first phase of}} a three-phase plan to adapt Brunei's legal system to include aspects of Sharia law implicating his approval of the persecution of homosexuals in the complex legal system there (a two part system involving separate courts and legislation for Islamic and non-Islamic citizens). In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by issuing a statement asserting that it does <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> on the basis of sexual orientation. Fashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all of the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} {{remarkable}} for its time in several respects. It did <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> against pupils {{on the grounds}} of religious persuasion (at a time when most public schools had an Anglican emphasis); it included pupils from non-conformist and Jewish families. Also, unlike other established independent schools, it was a day school (although there were in early days a handful of boarders, no boarding department ever became established). It also promoted a practical and progressive scheme of education which was well ahead of its time. It was the first school in England to include science on the curriculum and to include scientific experiments as part of its teaching. It also offered education in commercial subjects. This did not, however, diminish the excellence of its teaching in the subjects traditionally favoured by independent schools, and it sent classical and mathematical scholars to Oxford and Cambridge throughout the nineteenth century. These included the classicist, theologian and Shakespearean scholar Edwin Abbott Abbott (whose mathematical exploration of a world in other than three dimensions, Flatland, is still in print and who returned to the school as headmaster) and H. H. Asquith, who though educated as a classical scholar {{went on to become the}} British Prime Minister.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Runnymede {{published}} {{a collection of}} essays by leading thinkers on race and class, considering the relationship between social class and race equality.

25|$|In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act became law, and it {{provided}} comprehensive civil rights protection {{for people with}} disabilities. Closely modeled after the Civil Rights Act and Section 504, the law was the most sweeping disability rights legislation in American history. It mandated that local, state, and federal governments and programs be accessible, that employers with more than 15 employees make “reasonable accommodations” for workers with disabilities and <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> against otherwise qualified workers with disabilities, and that public accommodations such as restaurants and stores <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> against people with disabilities and that they make “reasonable modifications” to ensure access for disabled members of the public. The act also mandated access in public transportation, communication, and {{in other areas of}} public life.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} warning time, the CH {{systems were}} built {{close to the}} shore facing out to sea, placing them {{as close to the}} enemy as possible. This meant they provided no information for friendly fighters {{on the way to the}} attack, or of enemy aircraft once they crossed the coast. For these areas, Dowding planned to rely on the existing Observer Corps (OC) system that Fighter Command inherited from ADGB. Using different equipment, the reports from CH and the ROC were sometimes contradictory, and the volume of information supplied by the national network was overwhelming. An added problem was the lack of identification of the aircraft; CH could <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> between friendly and hostile aircraft at that time, and the OC could <b>not</b> <b>discriminate</b> between friendly and enemy fighters when they were flying at high altitude.|$|E

25|$|Two {{common types}} of toss-ups include buzzer-beaters and {{pyramidal}} tossups.

God in Sikhism, like the Sant tradition of the Bhakti movement, has no gender.|$|E
