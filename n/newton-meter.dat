40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relative importance of the different static stabilizers of the posterolateral corner of the knee in cadavers. METHODS: Tests were performed with the application of a varus and external rotation force to the knee in extension at 30 and 60 degrees of flexion using 10 cadaver knees. The forces were applied initially to an intact knee and then repeated after a selective sectioning of the ligaments into the following: section of the lateral collateral ligament; section of the lateral collateral ligament and the popliteofibular complex; and section of the lateral collateral ligament, the popliteofibular complex and the posterolateral capsule. The parameters studied were the angular deformity and stiffness when the knees were submitted to a 15 <b>Newton-meter</b> varus torque and a 6 <b>Newton-meter</b> external tibial torque. Statistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and Tukey's tests. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the lateral collateral ligament was important in varus stability at 0, 30 and 60 degrees. The popliteofibular complex was the most important structure for external rotation stability at all angles of flexion and was also important for varus stability at 30 and 60 degrees. The posterolateral capsule was important for varus stability at 0 and 30 degrees and for external rotation stability in extension. Level of evidence: Level IV (cadaver study) ...|$|E

40|$|Earthquakes in China show an {{empirical}} relation between seismic moment (M_ 0) and the areal distribution of Modified Mercalli intensities VI and VIII (log M_ 0 = 16. 66 + 0. 91 log A^(VIII) and log M_ 0 = 14. 35 + 1. 16 log A^(VI), where A and M_ 0 are measured in squared kilometers and <b>Newton-meter,</b> respectively). The empirical relations {{may be used}} to estimate M_ 0 for historical earthquakes in China to within a factor of three, on average, when sufficient isoseismal data exist. This observation and an extensive collection of isoseismal maps are used to estimate M_ 0 for large earthquakes that occurred along the margins of the Ordos block during the last 700 yr. Focal parameters of the historical events are inferred from the orientation and displacements across Quaternary faults. Average rates of crustal deformation are then estimated from the 700 -yr historical record with formulas that relate the occurrence rate of seismic moment in a region to rates of crustal strain. The Shanxi and northern Ningxia graben systems are situated along the eastern and northwestern edges of the Ordos block, respectively. Normal faults in the two systems trend northeasterly and are characterized by a component of right-lateral slip. The deformation resulting from slip during earthquakes in each of the respective fault systems is estimated at about 0. 5 to 1. 0 mm/yr of both right-lateral shear and north by northwest extension. The Weihe graben system bounds the southern edge of the Ordos block, strikes easterly and conjugate to the Shanxi and northern Ningxia fault systems, and exhibits left-lateral normal fault displacements. The average rate of deformation across Weihe is described by about 1. 0 mm/yr of north by northwest extension and 1. 5 mm/yr left-lateral east-west shear. The Hetao fault system delineates the northern edge of the Ordos block and displays Quaternary faults similar in orientation and mechanism to that observed in Weihe. Although mapped faults in Hetao exhibit evidence of Quaternary displacement, crustal deformation rates are not estimated because there exists no historical record of large earthquakes in the area. In southern Ningxia, at the southwest boundary of the Ordos block, deformation occurs by slip on left-lateral strike-slip faults oriented in an easterly azimuth and thrust faults with strikes ranging from southeast to south. The average deformation rate in southern Ningxia is found to be about 4. 0 mm/yr of east by northeast contraction and 10. 0 mm/yr of left-lateral shear. Deformation of each of the fault systems is consistent with a regional compressive stress that trends northeast and results in an average of about 3. 0 mm/yr each of contraction at N 70 °E and extension of N 160 °E across the entire region. Inasmuch as uncertainties in estimates of M 0 for historical earthquakes are about a factor of three, a similar uncertainty is attached to rates of crustal strain determined in this manner...|$|E

Design requires the CubeSat to de-spin after deployment and direct its antenna to track Earth nadir position. The one degree of freedom controller is developed for the TechEdSat, which is a CubeSat with a payload that allows for the assumption that rotation pitch and yaw rates are sufficiently close to zero. Satellite torqueing disturbances are modeled with reaction wheel noise for a more complete system analysis. Sensor noise is unmodeled. Frequency domain and time domain analyses are presented; the entire system bandwidth operates at 0. 08 hertz with 43. 2 decibels of gain and 67. 7 o of phase margin. During nominal operations, pointing accuracy with perfect state knowledge assumption maintains position with steady state error of 13. 7 arc seconds and oscillates by 16. 7 arc seconds {{at a rate of}} 0. 7 mHertz.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University clinic center. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand three hundred fifty-five men and 1, 429 women (aged 73. 6 ± 2. 85) who reported no mobility limitation. MEASUREMENTS: Unilateral knee extensor isokinetic strength of participants was obtained. Participants were followed over a median of 5. 90 years for the onset of SML, defined as two consecutive reports of a lot of difficulty or inability to walk one-quarter of a mile or climb 10 steps. Deciles of knee extension strength relative to body weight were evaluated to identify cutpoints most predictive of incident SML. Cutpoints were then compared with prevalence of having slow gait speed (< 1. 22 m/s) and mortality. RESULTS: Two sex-specific knee extension strength cutpoints were found. High and low risk of SML corresponded to less than 1. 13 <b>newton-meters</b> (Nm) /kg (1 st decile) and more than 1. 71 Nm/kg (6 th decile) in men and less than 1. 01 Nm/kg (3 rd decile) and more than 1. 34 Nm/kg (7 th decile) in women, respectively. Moderate risk was defined as being between the low- and high-risk cutpoints. Individuals with knee extension strength in the high- and moderate-risk categories {{were more likely to have}} a gait speed less than 1. 22 m/s (hazard ratio (HR) = 7. 00, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 5. 47 - 8. 96 and HR= 2. 14 7. 00, 95 % CI= 1. 73 - 2. 64, respectively) and had a higher risk of death (HR= 1. 77, 95 % CI= 1. 41 - 2. 23 and HR= 1. 51, 95 % CI= 1. 24 - 1. 84, respectively) than individuals in the low-risk category.

40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} offer several design advantages {{which may}} be exploited in prosthetic joint research and development: they are light-weight, have low cost, are easy to manufacture, have high-reliability, and {{have the ability to}} be designed for displacement loads. Designing a mechanism to perform optimally under displacement rather than force loading allows underlying characteristics of the swing phase of gait, such as the maximum heel rise and terminal swing to be developed into a prosthetic knee joint. The objective of this thesis was to develop a mechanical add-on compliant link to an existing prosthetic knee which would perform to optimal standards of prosthetic gait, specifically during the swing phase, and to introduce a feasible method for increasing proprioceptive feedback to the amputee via transferred moments and varying surface tractions on the inner part of a prosthetic socket. A finite elements model was created with ANSYS to design the prosthetic knee compliant add-on and used to select the geometry to meet prosthetic-swing criteria. Data collected from the knee FEA model was used to apply correct loading at the knee in a SolidWorks model of an above-knee prosthesis and residual limb. Another finite element model was creating using COSMOSWorks to determine the induced stresses within a prosthetic socket brought on by the compliant link, and then used to determine stress patterns over 60 degrees of knee flexion (standard swing). The compliant knee add-on performed to the optimal resistance during swing allowing for a moment maxima of 20. 2 <b>Newton-meters</b> (N-m) at a knee flexion of 62 degrees. The moments applied to the prosthetic socket via the compliant link during knee flexion and extension ranged from 5. 2 N-m (0 degrees) in flexion, to 20. 2 N-m (62 degrees) in extension and induced a varying surface tractions on the inner surface of the socket over the duration, thus posing a possible method of providing proprioceptive feedback via surface tractions.

Quadriceps torque (mean + SE) measured in <b>newton-meters</b> for group 1 at the 1. 04 rad/sec speed showed the surgical leg significantly weaker (P< 0. 001) than the non-surgical leg when tested at the initial test (101. 6 + 18. 2 vs. 189. 6 + 17. 2) and at release from rehabilitation (157. 4 + 13. 3 vs. 176. 3 + 15. 2). Torque measured at the other 4 speeds reached non-significance by the second or third week of rehabilitation. Isokinetic testing for groups 2 and 3 showed surgical leg strength significantly weaker (P< 0. 05) at the initial test and at week 1 of rehabilitation for the 5 testing speeds, with 85 % return of strength by weeks 2 or 3. Strength recovery for all 3 groups showed no significant weakness between legs for hamstring torque after the initial or after the first week of rehabilitation. Percent of knee extensor torque achieved by the knee flexor muscles of the surgical leg for the 3 groups showed significantly greater (P< 0. 001) values only for the initial test at speeds 1. 04 and 2. 09 rad/sec. Measures of total work, average power, and endurance calculated from work tests showed little change in muscle endurance between legs. These data indicate that quadricep muscle function is negatively affected following arthroscopic meniscectomy. Release from rehabilitation when surgical to non-surgical leg strength is between 85 % to 90 X appears to be a valid measure for most patients, which indicates age alone does not appear to be a limiting factor in regaining strength.
