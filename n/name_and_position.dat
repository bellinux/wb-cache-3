Eulogizing Irving before the Massachusetts Historical Society in December 1859, his friend, the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, acknowledged Irving's role in promoting American literature: [...] "We feel a just pride in his renown as an author, not forgetting that, to his other claims upon our gratitude, he adds also that of having been the first to win for our country an honourable <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>position</b> in the History of Letters".|$|E

[...] Prien {{surfaced}} and fired a single shot from his 88 mm deck gun to stop the ship but instead the Bosnia made steam and began radioing an alert ('SSS') along with its <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>position.</b> [...] Prien then immediately fired an additional four rounds of which three hit the ship, prompting its crew to abandon ship. [...] U-47 rendered assistance to the crew of Bosnia, bringing them aboard the submarine and helping {{to set up a}} lifeboat which had capsized during the crew's escape. [...] A Norwegian vessel also arrived and took all of the survivors aboard. [...] Following its departure, Prien fired a single torpedo which wrecked the ship which sunk with its load of sulfur almost immediately. [...] The 2,407 ton Bosnia became the second British vessel, and first freighter, sunk after Athenia.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Livingston the Elder was {{the first}} member of the family to obtain the patent on the [...] that would later become {{identified}} with his family. His son Robert Livingston Jr. established the first country seat on Livingston Manor in the 1730s when he built Clermont, reserving the entire [...] that fronted on the river for himself. He designed Clermont carefully to be a working farm as well as an estate, to be made financially viable when portions further inland were leased in portions to tenant farmers. The sweeping view of the lands further emphasized the Livingstons' dominance over many of the lands visible. This, as well as Clermont's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>position,</b> strategically overlooking the Hudson and its commercial traffic, was influenced strongly by European feudal practices, setting a pattern other estates in Livingston Manor were to follow long after his lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|American Horse the Younger gained {{influence}} {{during the}} turbulence of the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877. [...] After {{news of the}} death of Chief American Horse the Elder at the Battle of Slim Buttes, Manishnee (Can not walk, or Played out)” seized an opportunity and assumed the name “American Horse.” American Horse the Younger was not related to American Horse the Elder, son of Old Chief Smoke. [...] He was the son of Sitting Bear, leader of the True Oglalas, a band of Oglala opposed to the Smoke people In 1890, American Horse the Younger told Charles A. Eastman that he succeeded to the <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of his uncle American Horse the Elder who was killed at Sim Buttes in 1876. [...] Later, American Horse the Younger claimed that American Horse the Elder was not killed at Slim Buttes, but rather a minor chief Iron Plume or Iron Shield. [...] He also claimed that he personally killed Captain William J. Fetterman with his war club in the Fetterman Fight during Red Cloud’s War. [...] As a result, the identities and accounts of American Horse the Elder and the American Horse the Younger have been blended by some historians. Like his great friend Crazy Horse, there are no known photographs or drawings of Chief American Horse the Elder. [...] “The Oglalas seem incapable of clearing up the tangle.” ...|$|E

The professor's visible preference for the youth of secure prospects, had not so much discouraged as stung him; and in a moment of irritation at the professor's treatment, and the exulting hopes of his unconscious friend, he had sworn to himself, that the first involuntary token of regard from the young lady towards one or the other, should decide him whether to win <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>position</b> for her sake, or to carry his slighted passion to the utmost parts of the earth, and never again see her face.|$|E
6000|$|Hampstead {{had refused}} to join the party. He was not at present in a {{condition}} to join any social gathering. But, omitting him, a family party had been collected. Lord and Lady Persiflage were there, with Lady Amaldina and her betrothed. The Persiflages had taken the matter up very strongly, {{so that they may}} have been said to have become George Roden's special patrons or protectors. Lord Persiflage, who was seldom much in earnest about anything, had determined that the Duca di Crinola should be recognized, and was supposed already to have spoken a word on the subject in a very high quarter indeed. Vivian, the Private Secretary, was there. The poor Marquis himself was considered unable to come down into the dining-room, but did receive his proposed son-in-law up-stairs. They had not met since the unfortunate visit made by the Post Office clerk to Hendon Hall, when no one had as yet dreamed of his iniquity; nor had the Marchioness seen him since the terrible sound of that feminine Christian name had wounded her ears. The other persons assembled had in a measure become intimate with him. Lord Llwddythlw had walked round Castle Hautboy and discussed with him the statistics of telegraphy. Lady Amaldina had been confidential with him as to her own wedding. Both Lord and Lady Persiflage had given him in a very friendly manner their ideas as to his <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>position.</b> Vivian and he had become intimate personal friends. They could, all of them, accept him with open arms when he was shown into the drawing-room, except Lady Kingsbury herself.

"You are aware--or probably, in this half-educated age, {{you are not}} aware--that {{the country}} round {{some parts of the}} Amazon is still only {{partially}} explored, and that a great number of tributaries, some of them entirely uncharted, run into the main river. It was my business to visit this little-known back-country and to examine its fauna, which furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and monumental work upon zoology which will be my life's justification. I was returning, my work accomplished, when I had occasion to spend a night at a small Indian village at a point where a certain tributary--the <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of which I withhold--opens into the main river. The natives were Cucama Indians, an amiable but degraded race, with mental powers hardly superior to the average Londoner. I had effected some cures among them upon my way up the river, and had impressed them considerably with my personality, so that I was not surprised to find myself eagerly awaited upon my return. I gathered from their signs that someone had urgent need of my medical services, and I followed the chief to one of his huts. When I entered I found that the sufferer to whose aid I had been summoned had that instant expired. He was, to my surprise, no Indian, but a white man; indeed, I may say a very white man, for he was flaxen-haired and had some characteristics of an albino. He was clad in rags, was very emaciated, and bore every trace of prolonged hardship. So far as I could understand the account of the natives, he was a complete stranger to them, and had come upon their village through the woods alone and in the last stage of exhaustion.|$|E
