40|$|The Collective Article “New Mediterranean Biodiversity Records” of the Mediterranean Marine Science journal {{offers the}} means to publish {{biodiversity}} records in the Mediterranean Sea. The current article has adopted a country-based classification and the countries are listed according to their geographic position, from west to east. New biodiversity data are reported for 7 different countries, although one species reported from Malta is new for the entire Mediterranean basin, and is presumably also present in Israel and Lebanon (see below, under Malta). Italy: the rare native fish Gobius kolombatovici is first reported from the Ionian Sea, whilst the alien jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica and the alien fish Oplegnathus fasciatus are first reported from the entire country. The presence of O. fasciatus from Trieste is concomitantly the first for the entire Adriatic Sea. Finally, the alien bivalve Arcuatula senhousia is reported {{for the first time}} from Campania (Tyrrhenian Sea). Tunisia: a bloom of the alien crab ortunus segnis is first reported from the Gulf of Gabes, where it was considered as casual. Malta: the alien flatworm Maritigrella fuscopunctata is recorded in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, on the basis of 25 specimens. At the same time, web searches include possible unpublished records from Israel and Lebanon. The alien crab P. segnis, already mentioned above, is first formally reported from Malta based on specimens collected in 1972. Concomitantly, the presence of Callinectes sapidus in Maltese waters is excluded since based on misidentifications. Greece: the Atlantic <b>northern</b> <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> Penaeus atzecus, previously known from the Ionian Sea from sporadic records only, is now well established in Greek and international Ionian waters. The alien sea urchin Diadema setosum is reported for the second time from Greece, and its first record from the country is backdated to 2010 in Rhodes Island. The alien lionfish Pterois miles is first reported from Greece and concomitantly from the entire Aegean Sea. Turkey: the alien rhodophyte Antithamnion hubbsii is first reported from Turkey and the entire eastern Mediterranean. New distribution data are also provided for the native fishes Alectis alexandrina and Heptranchias perlo. In particular, the former record consists of a juvenile measuring 21. 38 mm total length, whilst the latter by a mature male. Cyprus: the rare native cephalopod Macrotritopus defilippi, and the alien crab Atergatis roseus, sea slug Plocamopherus ocellatus and fish Cheilodipterus novemstriatus are first recorded from the entire country. Lebanon: the alien crabs Actaea savignii and Matuta victor, as well as the alien fish Synanceia verrucosa, are first recorded from the entire country. In addition, the first Mediterranean record of A. savignii is backdated to 2006, whilst the high number of M. victor specimens observed in Lebanon suggest its establishment in the Basin. The Atlantic fishes Paranthias furcifer and Seriola fasciata, and the circumtropical Rachycentron canadum, are also first reported from the country. The P. furcifer record backdates its presence in the Mediterranean to 2007, whilst S. fasciata records backdate its presence in the eastern Mediterranean to 2005. Finally, two of these latter species have been recently ascribed to alien species, but all three species may fit the cryptogenic category, if not a new one, better. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Pulse {{trawling}} {{is currently}} the best available alternative to beam trawling in the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> Crangon crangon and Sole Solea solea (also known as Solea vulgaris) fisheries. To evaluate the effect of repetitive exposure to electrical fields, <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{were exposed to the}} commercial electrodes and pulse settings used to catch <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (shrimp startle pulse) or Sole (Sole cramp pulse) 20 times in 4 d and monitored for up to 14 d after the first exposure.

The lowest survival at 14 d (57. 3 %) occurred in the Sole cramp pulse treatment, and this was significantly lower than in the group with the highest survival, the procedural control (70. 3 %). No effect of electrical stimulation on the severity of IBV infection was found. The lowest percentage of molts occurred in the repetitive mechanical stimulation treatment (14. 0 %), and this was significantly lower than in the group with the highest percentage of molts, the procedural control (21. 7 %). Additionally, the mechanically stimulated <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> that died during the experiment had a significantly larger size than the surviving individuals. Finally, no effect of the shrimp startle pulse was found. Therefore, it can be concluded that repetitive exposure to a cramp stimulus and mechanical stimulation may have negative effects on the growth and/or survival of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp.</b> However, {{there is no evidence that}} electrical stimulation during electrotrawls would have a larger negative impact on <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> stocks than mechanical stimulation during conventional beam trawling...|$|R

To find ways of reducing this by-catch, experiments were carried out with a Nordmøre type sorting grid during two trips on a research vessel and three trips on a commercial vessel. The results depended strongly on the catch composition in the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery. If the catch composition did not cause clogging problems with the sorting grid, it met the objectives it was designed for. The reduction of fish (> 70 %) and benthos (65 %) in the catch was quite high. The commercial <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> catch was reduced by 15 %.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{developed}} and utilized a complex model approach to investigate the impact of stage-specific transport processes on the development and spatial distribution of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) post-larvae and juveniles in the German Bight. First, we focused on drift processes during the pelagic larval stage by coupling an individual-based model for egg and larval development 'off-line' to a 3 D hydrodynamic model utilizing the Lagrangian method. Secondly, we investigated tidal-induced transport processes after juvenile settlement. To determine the tidal cycle, the model coupling was accomplished 'on-line' by resolving the individual-based model and hydrodynamic model with the same time step. The vertical migration of juveniles, a prerequisite for the selective tidal stream transport (STST), was modelled as a sub-grid scale physical process (balance of forces: gravitation, buoyancy, Stoke's friction and dynamic uplift) and considered complex particle dynamics. We applied the model to test temperature and salinity cues as possible tidal indicators utilized by juvenile <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Our results indicated that transport processes could significantly change the timing and spatial distribution of post-larval abundance. We also showed that the small-scale hydrodynamic forcing acting on the bodies of juvenile <b>brown</b> <b>shrimps</b> was sufficient {{to account for the}} vertical migration required to use STST. For both investigated tidal cues STST performing juvenile <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> were transported on-shore.

In 1990, the lowest reported landings of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimps</b> in Germany coincided with severe economic problems for the shrimp fisheries.

40|$|Winter fishery“ on <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{does not}} imply a special type of fishery. It merely means the {{continuation}} of the standard fishing procedure of parts of the fleet during wintertime, when the majority of the mostly smaller vessels stay in harbour due to generally unfavourable weather conditions for their activity. During 1990 to 1999 mean European wide landings in January and February summedup to 854 tonnes making up to only 4 % of the mean annual landings (21 805 t). While German vessels landed 0. 7 % (68. 7 t) of their mean annual landings during that period, the other countries caught about 7 % of their individual, mean annual landings at the same time. The Netherlands and Denmark contributed highest tonnages of 580 and 110 tonnes, respectively, to the total European landings, making up 81 % of them. As about 70 % of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> may carry eggs in January, the winter fishery took a mean total of about 2. 15 x 1012 <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> eggs out of the stocks in that period annually. As there is no reliable assessment available concerning the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> stocks, it is despite of these high losses of eggs not possible to trace a negative effect of the winter fishery in scientific terms.

40|$|Fisheries {{targeting}} <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) in the North Sea in European {{waters are}} largely unregulated {{in terms of}} landings and effort. A license system exists, but this did not prevent the current situation of overcapacity of the shrimp fleet. The governments of the North Sea <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries (Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, United Kingdom) have shown little interest in management of the shrimp fisheries, {{which leads to a}} consequent lack of action to establish a management system for shrimp, as well as little resources for research and monitoring. Initiatives in the Netherlands of the industry to self-manage their fisheries, in terms of effort limitation and/or landing, were not accepted by the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM). Due to a lack of research, no ecological arguments for effort limitation were available and therefore any proposals by the industry to limit fishing effort and/or landings were deemed illegal price manipulations. Although the need for management was expressed by the industry, environmental NGOs, as well as scientists (ICES WGCRAN), the issue of management of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries was at a standstill.

To {{examine the effect of}} salinity on behavioral thermoregulation in a marine evertebrate ectotherm, we acclimated juvenile and sub-adult common <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon, L.) to salinities of 10, 20 and 30 PSU and investigated their thermal preference in an annular chamber system using the gravitational method for temperature preference determination.

Temperature preference differed by sex and male shrimp selected significantly higher temperatures at 10 PSU when compared to females.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} Louisiana {{estuaries}} have indicated {{a central role}} of Spartina alterniflora marshes in supporting production of the commercially important <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Farfantepenaeus aztecus. <b>Brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> are an estuarine-dependent species and spend one to three springtime months in estuaries as small juveniles, with highest shrimp densities found at marsh edges. Later estuarine and offshore production of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> is correlated both with marsh area and with abundance of smaller juveniles found in unvegetated open bays near marshes. This paper investigates the idea that open bays are an additional important nursery habitat for Louisiana <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp,</b> with bays possibly supporting the bulk of shrimp populations even while shrimp densities expressed on a square meter basis are lower in the bays. To assay possible differences in shrimp abundances and residency in marsh ponds vs. adjacent open bays, springtime field work was conducted in 2004 - 2006 near the Louisiana University Marine Consortium Laboratory at Cocodrie, Louisiana. Seine surveys showed similar-sized shrimp were present in marsh ponds (< 20 m in diameter) and an adjacent open bay (< 1 m deep, 2 km in diameter) and that shrimp were twice as dense in the marsh ponds. Natural C, N, and S isotope tags provided distinctive labeling of shrimp from marsh ponds versus bays; shrimp residency appeared high in both areas with < 10 % of shrimp present as immigrants from other areas. Widely spaced collections from several Louisiana bay systems and also Galveston Bay, Texas showed that the S isotope tags provided the most general tags for marsh origins, with low S isotope values of 1 - 9 頩n shrimp muscle tissue consistently indicating marsh origins. Importance of marshes for <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> production across Terrebonne and Barataria Bays, Louisiana was evaluated with S isotopes using spring 2005 collections.

40|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) {{fishery is}} {{economically}} {{one of the}} most important fisheries in the North Sea. Fishing is unregulated, apart from the number of licenses and technical measures. The fishery has long been considered sustainable in terms of the effect on the target species, even though annual stocks are not regularly assessed. Average landings constantly increased annually and since 2000 have been 40 % higher than in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Because <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> lack a clear age structure and reproduce almost year-round, an agebased stock assessment is not possible. In the absence of a formal estimate of stock size, it is difficult to judge whether current fishing practices can still be considered sustainable. Here, we use annual survey data collected during peak occurrence in late summer to obtain a depth- and area-stratified, swept-area estimate for the period 1970 – 2015. The resulting estimate of the total commercial-size shrimp biomass varied between 4000 and 21 000 tonnes over the years. Both parametric and non-parametric methods arrived at very similar results. In combination with length-based mortality estimates (as a proxy for production/biomass ratio), knowledge on the seasonal occurrence, catchability, gear efficiency, and their variation, total adult annual biomass production was estimated. Values ranged between 38 000 and 216 000 tonnes and overlapped at the lower end with total annual commercial landings, which varied between 8000 and 38 500 tonnes, indicating that in some years (1977, 1998, 2007), the larger part of the total <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> production was harvested. Annual <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> landings have gradually increased since the series started, whereas no trend in standing biomass and production was detected.

However, understanding the economic effects of hypoxia is critical to evaluating consequences for marine resources and fisheries.

This estuarine ecosystem also provides essential nursery habitat for North Carolina’s most important commercial <b>shrimp</b> species, the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Farfantepenaeus aztecus). Previous research has shown a causal relationship between severe levels of hypoxia and increased mortality and avoidance behavior among fish and crustacean species.

Overall, temperature was the best environmental indicator of commercial shrimp catches. Catches of blue shrimp varied directly and of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> indirectly with the SOI in their dominant areas, suggesting that the two species are influenced by El Niño con-ditions in different ways...|$|R
40|$|The fishery for <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) in the North Sea {{is carried}} out by more than 600 vessels, with total annual <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{landings}} of around 20, 000 t. Due to the small mesh size used, the catches also contain large amounts of unwanted by-catch. To find ways of reducing this by-catch, experiments were carried out during a one-year period with a sieve net rigged in a <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> beam trawl. It was tested for its selective properties and an evaluation was made of its operational characteristics. The loss of commercial shrimp catch when using a sieve net was 15 % or less in favourable conditions. Certain components of the catch can. however, lead to a distortion of the outlet with a reduction of the commercial catch of over 30 %. It is likely that technical alterations to the outlet can prevent this. The sieve net showed very poor selective properties for commercial fish species with a length below 10 cm. Above 10 cm the selection improved with increasing length. Especially for Age 1 and older fish, this selective device serves its purpose. A significant reduction of non-commercial fish and invertebrates was also observed...|$|R
40|$|Among {{other tasks}} the “Working Group on Crangon Fisheries and Life Cycle” of the “International Council for the Exploration of the Sea” {{collects}} data on landings and {{effort in the}} North Sea <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries by country. Landings per unit effort data are calculated and all are compared on basis of long-term series {{as well as on}} seasonal basis. The development for each country is described and compared for the year 2001 to the ten-year average from 1992 to 2001 were possible, as some data are missing especially for the Netherlands. While the Dutch and British fleets increased their landings substantially in 2001 compared to the previous years, Danish,German and Belgian fishermen had reduced landings. There are regional differences in fishing pattern between the countries, especially Denmark versus the rest of Europe. Effort measures remain incomparable between the countries, and fluctuations in landings per unit effort data seem to be in a normal biological range, giving no reason for concern at present for the situation of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> stocks in the North Sea. An improvement of the data basis is required and possibly achievable by the EU logbook system being in force for <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries as well...|$|R
40|$|The Ministry of Agriculture, Conservation and Food quality, Producer organisations of the Dutch shrimp {{fisheries}} and NGO’s (Stichting de Noordzee and Waddenvereniging) have underlined {{the importance of}} sustainable harvesting of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> in the North Sea and Wadden Sea. Also they would like the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery to meet the conditions of an MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) certificate. The first principle that the shrimp fishery needs to fulfil in order to acquire an MSC-label states that the stock should not be overfished. The biomass dynamic model has been investigated. This model does not need demographic data and was used successfully in Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The model only needs {{the total amount of}} shrimp landings and an index of catches per unit of effort (CPUE) to assess the stock. The main assumptions of the model are (1) the stock under study is a single stock and (2) the available index (CPUE, catch per unit of effort series) describes the trends in the population well. The main conclusion from the study is that the applicability of the biomass model for a reliable stock assessment of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> needs considerably more study and data collection...|$|R
