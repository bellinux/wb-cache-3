25|$|The Australian Hydrographic Service is {{an element}} of the RAN, and serves both {{military}} and civilian functions. The headquarters of the agency is at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales. Hydrographic services provided by the AHS include the mapping and surveying of undersea terrain and irregularities on and under the water's surface (known collectively as hydrography), the provision of nautical charts and other publications, such as tide tables and Notices to Mariners. Over 400 paper charts are produced by the AHS, with conversion of these to electronic <b>navigational</b> <b>chart</b> format due to be completed in 2011.|$|E
