40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{program for the}} simulation of elastic wave propagation and scattering in three-dimensional (3 -D) cylindrical coordinates based on the first-order velocity-stress finite-difference scheme on staggered grids. Both Liao's and Lindman's absorbing boundary conditions are implemented for the exterior boundaries to efficiently truncate the computation domain for elongated 3 -D well logging problems. Symmetric and anti-symmetric boundaries in azimuthal and axial directions are also implemented in the code to further {{reduce the size of}} the problem. Included {{for the first time with}} this code are very large and complex geometrical structures such as the whole <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> housing of a sonic well-logging tool which typically involves hundreds of millions of unknowns. The calculation for such a large problem only takes a couple of days on a four- processor SGI Power Challenge machine. Different types of <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> models are studied for sonic logging tools. Simulation results show that different <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeves</b> vary widely in delaying and attenuating the pipe waves which travel along the tool housing. A new <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> structure with three horizontal slot sections for every vertical slot period is proposed for better performance. A dipole source is found to produce much cleaner waveforms than a monopole source. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Overend et al [68] {{designed}} a viscometer {{to measure the}} viscosity of slurries that {{have a tendency to}} settle. This viscometer consists of a rotating ribbed rotor surrounded by a stationary slotted sleeve; this system is then placed eccentrically within an inclined rotating bowl. It, is claimed that this overcomes most of the difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate measurements for these types of mixtures. If the mixture being sheared within the annulus does not represent the true composition of the slurry being, tested then the results are expected to be inaccurate. The presence of sediment {{at the bottom of the}} rotor or the formation of large masses of particles within the flow domain will affect the accuracy of the measurements obtained. This dissertation studies the amount of flow through the <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the region, or regions, of low shear rate within the flow domain. Assuming that end-effects are unimportant and that the slurries can be replaced by a single-phase fluid, three two-dimensional models are proposed. These models are designed to capture the large-slot construction of the sleeve and the, approximate, non-Newtonian behaviour of the slurries. The first two models solve analytically (using a regular perturbation scheme) and numerically (using a finite volume method) the moderate-and large-Reynolds-number flow, and the third model uses a finite volume method to study the flow patterns developed by pseudoplastic fluids. The results show that the mixing of the slurry is expected to be enhanced by moving the concentric system (i. e., the rotor and the <b>slotted</b> <b>sleeve)</b> close to the rotating bowl and using low to moderate speeds for the rotor and bowl. In addition, when the cylinders rotate in the same directions, two (counter-rotating) eddies are present within the flow domain; whereas, only one eddy (rotating counter-clockwise) is ++present when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions. The presence of eddies in the former situation inhibits the flow through the sleeve; while, for moderate rotorspeeds, the flow through the sleeve is enhanced in the latter. When the slurry assumed pseudoplastic, we observe a region of low shear rate located near the dividing streamline present within the flow field. The distribution of shear rate within the flow field is shown to be affected by factors such as the rate of diffusion of the apparent viscosity and the value of the power law index. Therefore, this study suggests that for certain types of slurries, concentrations of particles exist within the domain and that the mixing of slurries can be impeded by the presence of eddies within the main flow field...|$|R
