5|$|Local {{residents}} have {{developed their own}} style in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> placing it around the recipients neck is a goodwill and love gesture. They make a type of sarong, called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. Like the other islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of quilting.|$|E

5|$|In {{a three-part}} series {{published}} between February and May 1994, Brock attempts to save San Francisco {{as it is}} besieged by an army of goblins. Morbius the Living Vampire and the Demogoblin are magically transported from New York; Morbius joins Brock to defeat the goblins, led by criminal-turned-politician Charles Palentine (who wears a magic necklace which controls the goblins). Palentine uses fear of the goblin attacks to seize control {{of the city and}} convince its citizens to burn it down. Demogoblin takes the <b>necklace,</b> <b>and</b> the liberated goblins attack Palentine. Demogoblin then leads the goblins across the Golden Gate Bridge, ordering them to leap to their deaths. Demogoblin and Morbius then leave for New York. Of DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1994, Venom: Enemy Within #2 was number 286; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Ã„lvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram {{and it was still}} frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in {{order to protect}} against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.|$|E

Ganon recognizes Tetra's Triforce <b>necklace,</b> <b>and</b> realizes she is the {{incarnation}} of Princess Zelda he is seeking. Link's Rito allies and Valoo save Link and Tetra from Ganon. The King of Red Lions brings the two back to the underwater realm, explaining it is the legendary kingdom of Hyrule, which the goddesses submerged long ago to contain Ganon while the people fled to the mountaintops. The King of Red Lions reveals himself to be Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule, the last King of Hyrule, and Tetra is his heir, Zelda, keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> an orange.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{found in}} colonial-era texts {{such as one}} by John Murraya missionary in British India and Jainism scholar, states the main image carved in Cave5 {{is that of a}} Jaina figure. According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.Sundaraarchaeologists, and {{supported}} by local legends, the statue is of an ancient king; in a photograph of the statue taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the Ushnisha lump that typically goes with Buddha's image. The statue has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, a <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> a chest-band; it wears a Hindu Yajnopavita thread and its head is stylistically closer to a Jina head than a Buddha head. These features suggest the statue may be of a king represented with features of various traditions. According to Carol Radcliffe BolonAssistant Curator at the Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art, the date and identity of the main statue in Cave5 remains enigmatic.|$|E

5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E
5|$|Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip, but Chip protects Sonic {{and calls}} {{all of the}} Gaia temples {{together}} to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia. The Gaia Colussus seemingly destroys Dark Gaia, but Dark Gaia is not finished with them or the Earth yet, and consumes the entire world in darkness, becoming Perfect Dark Gaia in the process. Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic, allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet, but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic. Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface, before returning himself {{to the inside of}} the planet; he leaves behind his <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> some parting words. Sonic places the necklace on his hand as a bracelet to remind him of their adventure together before speeding off with Tails, flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, {{people began}} {{treasure}} hunting at Buckton Castle, and in 1767 {{there were reports}} that one such venture had discovered a gold <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> a silver vessel, though these artefacts have since been lost. This prompted the interest of local antiquarians and several visited in the 18th and 19th centuries, often drawing plans of Buckton Castle. In the 20th century it was suggested that the castle may have been an Iron Age hillfort, however a study of hillforts in Cheshire and Lancashire found that Buckton Castle was topographically different from these sites. Excavation in the 1990s demonstrated that the site was medieval, with no sign of earlier activity. It was also suggested that the castle was a ringwork â€“ a type of fortification where earthworks formed {{an integral part of the}} defence. However, this was before archaeologists established that the first phase of the castle was a curtain wall and the earthworks seen today are the result of the collapse of the structure. Buckton is now considered to be an enclosure castle, with stone walls forming the key defence.|$|E

5|$|The Brazil Parure {{is one of}} {{the newest}} items of {{jewellery}} in the collection. In 1953, the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds. It had taken the jewellers Mappin & Webb an entire year to collect the perfectly matched stones. The necklace has nine large oblong aquamarines with an even bigger aquamarine pendant drop. The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable. She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a tiara made to match the necklace. The tiara is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines. Seeing that the Queen had so liked the original Coronation gift that she had a matching tiara made, the Government of Brazil decided to add to its gift, and in 1958 it presented Elizabeth II with a bracelet of oblong aquamarines set in a cluster of diamonds, and a square aquamarine and diamond brooch.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl <b>necklace</b> <b>and</b> headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at her reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E
