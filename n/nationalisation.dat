5|$|Russell {{is careful}} to {{indicate}} that his support for <b>nationalisation</b> rests {{on the assumption that}} it can be accomplished under the auspices of a robust democracy, and that it may be safeguarded against statist tyranny. If either condition fail, then <b>nationalisation</b> is undesirable. In delivering this warning, Russell emphasises the distinction between ownership and control. He points out that <b>nationalisation</b> – which would allow the citizens to collectively own an industry – would not guarantee any of them control over the industry. In the same way, shareholders own parts of companies, but the control of the company ultimately rests with the CEO (Russell 1938:235).|$|E
5|$|After <b>nationalisation</b> after World War II the National Coal Board spent £500,000 on modernising the mine's {{infrastructure}} {{to give it}} the capability for annual production of 315,000tons, however manpower shortages and geological problems caused the pit to close in 1966.|$|E

40|$|Our logit models explain {{positive}} or negative short–term market reactions due to equity transfers in China. In contrast to former studies, we classify transfers into private transactions, privatisations, transfers among state–owned enterprises (SOEs) and <b>nationalisations.</b> We control for uncompensated transactions, transfers of holding rights, replacements of the CEO and related party transactions. Privatisations trig–ger positive responses, whereas <b>nationalisations</b> cause declining stock prices. The market appreciates reforms in the state–owned sector if reorganisations include the transfer of holding rights and not just replacing the CEO. Uncompensated transfers and non–transparent transactions of related parties diminish gains for minority shareholde...|$|R

5|$|The E {{remained}} {{part of the}} GWR until <b>nationalisation</b> at {{the beginning}} of 1948, when (with the exception of Ealing Broadway station) it was transferred to the London Transport Executive. Ealing Broadway remained part of British Railways, as successors to the GWR.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>nationalisation</b> of British Rail in 1948, Marylebone was {{initially}} kept open as a long-distance station. New services were introduced, including the Master Cutler service to Sheffield and the South Yorkshireman to Bradford, {{but they were}} not well-used. From 1949, all local services towards High Wycombe and Princes Risborough were routed into Marylebone, although the frequency of trains was reduced two years later.|$|E
5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

50|$|In 1967, <b>nationalisations</b> {{transformed}} the government into the largest employer in the country. The state expanded rapidly into virtually every sector. It {{was involved in}} everything from retailing to import-export trade and even baking. This created an environment ripe for corruption.|$|R
50|$|The social {{democratic}} {{governments in the}} post war period introduced measures of social reform and wealth redistribution through state welfare and taxation policy. For instance the newly elected UK Labour government carried out <b>nationalisations</b> of major utilities such as mines, gas, coal, electricity, rail, iron and steel, and the Bank of England. France {{claimed to be the}} most state controlled capitalist country in the world, carrying through many <b>nationalisations.</b> In the UK the National Health Service was established bringing free health care to all for the first time. Social housing for working-class families was provided in council housing estates and university education was made available for working-class people through a grant system.|$|R
5|$|Expelled former ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema {{launched}} the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), taking a strong anti-ANC position within its ultra-left economic platform, such as {{calling for the}} expropriation of land without compensation and the <b>nationalisation</b> of South Africa's mines and the South African Reserve Bank.

5|$|Following <b>nationalisation</b> of Britain's {{railways}} in 1948, {{the station}} transferred under British Railways to the Eastern Region although the old LTSR network west of Gasworks Junction {{was controlled by}} the London Midland Region. On 20 February 1949 the whole LTS line {{was transferred to the}} Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} decade after <b>nationalisation</b> {{services}} to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies meant {{a wider variety of}} locomotives operating services on the branch. For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight diesel train on the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's sharp bends and the branch reverted to steam operations.|$|E
50|$|After the war, and {{the second}} wave of <b>nationalisations,</b> Amiot {{concentrated}} on shipbuilding at his Cherbourg works, (Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie). There he built various small craft, including racing vessels. Among these ships were the fast missile boats, built for Israel, which escaped from Cherbourg while under embargo in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, {{the centre}} was {{established}} as a pontifical institute and, in 1964, because of the policy of <b>nationalisations,</b> it was transferred from Tunis to Rome, where it received the support of Pope Paul VI as an instrument for interreligious dialogue, [...] "in keeping with the new spirit of the Second Vatican Council".|$|R
50|$|The Bank of England Act 1946 (c 27) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom {{which came}} into force on 1 March 1946.

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed <b>nationalisation</b> of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale <b>nationalisation</b> {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1964 riot in Hama and other cities, the radicals were on the retreat and the Aflaqites regained control for a brief period. Bitar formed a new government which halted the <b>nationalisation</b> process, reaffirm respect for civil liberties and private property. However, these policy changes did not win sufficient support, and the population at large still opposed Ba'ath Party rule. The upper classes continued to disinvest capital and smuggle capital out of the country, and the only foreseeable solution to this loss of capital was continuing with <b>nationalisation.</b> The party's left-wing argued that the bourgeoisie would never be won over unless they were given total control over the economy as they had before. It was this power struggle between the moderate Aflaqites who dominated the National Command of the Ba'ath Party and the radicals who dominated the Syrian Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party which led to the 1966 coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of <b>nationalisation,</b> {{interchanges}} were provided between the lines previously belonging to the three different companies that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period had slowed considerably and only one station was opened during the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|As he {{politically}} structured the Parisian resistance, Brossolette {{succeeded in}} convincing the network leaders {{to create a}} temporary Resistance Party under De Gaulle's leadership after the war, focused on promoting ambitious social transformations while avoiding the predictable enmity and chaos of post-Liberation times. This political and social plan, including <b>nationalisations</b> and price controls, inspired the March 1944 Conseil national de la Résistance program and was implemented after war.|$|R
25|$|Baltic German {{outlying}} estates were frequent {{targets of}} local Bolsheviks (as {{portrayed in the}} film, Coup de Grâce) and the combination of local Bolsheviks and nationalists following independence brought about land <b>nationalisations</b> and a displacement of Baltic Germans from positions of authority. Baltic Germans of Livonian Governorate found themselves in two new countries, both of which introduced sweeping agrarian reforms aimed at the large land owners, absolute majority of whom were Germans.|$|R
25|$|Quebec Premier Adélard Godbout {{adopted a}} policy of {{investing}} 10 million dollars per year in rural electrification. However, in 1944 the government changed, and the new premier Maurice Duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy. Local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas. Duplessis remained in power until 1960, {{and during that time}} there were no further <b>nationalisations</b> of companies, and Hydro-Québec mostly served the Montreal area.|$|R
5|$|In {{their new}} form the {{locomotives}} {{were similar in}} outline to the N15 class, though suffered from the expectation amongst crews that they were an improved version of this type. Despite this, their ability to accelerate well was {{put to good use}} on cross-country trains between main lines. The class saw service into <b>nationalisation</b> in 1948. All had been withdrawn by 1957, with none preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{last years}} of Chelvanayakam were {{personally}} difficult. He had financial problems {{as a result of}} the government not paying him compensation for the <b>nationalisation</b> of two plantations in which he had shares.

5|$|The total tonnage of coal {{produced}} by the coalfield increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79 separate collieries and production was 1,250,000tons per annum. The peak years for production were 1900 to 1920. However decline took hold {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-1930s, 12 at <b>nationalisation</b> when the National Coal Board was created on 1 January 1947, under the Coal Industry <b>Nationalisation</b> Act 1946, 5 in 1959 and none after 1973. Despite some investment in new infrastructure, particularly at Norton Hill, thin seams made production expensive, limiting profit and investment. The conversion of Portishead power station from coal to oil and reduced national demand together with competition from more economical coalfields led to the closure of the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, in September 1973.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the polls}} running in his favor, Mitterrand {{announced}} his candidacy in the 1988 presidential election. He proposed a moderate programme (promising [...] "neither <b>nationalisations</b> nor liberalisation") and advocated a [...] "united France," [...] {{and laid out}} his policy priorities in his [...] "Letter to the French People." [...] He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.
