40|$|The {{studies showed}} that {{stability}} of the oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions depended statistically significantly on concentration of <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifier</b> (sodium caseinate) as well as concentration of synthetic emulsifiers (sodium dodecyl sulfate &ndash; SDS or Tween 60) added to the emulsifying mixtures. The highest stability of the emulsions evaluated towards creaming was observed in samples containing 2 wt% <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifier</b> and 1 wt% Tween 60 or 0. 4 wt% SDS. Increase of concentration of the synthetic emulsifiers decreased surface protein concentration and average droplet diameter D[4, 3] what contributed to the higher thermodynamic stability of the emulsions. It was also noticed that those process caused higher retention of lemon aroma (negative values of Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficients calculated between concentrations of emulsifiers and aroma intensities). The lowest release of lemon odour from o/w emulsions was observed in sample stabilized by mixture composed of 2 wt% sodium caseinate with 1 wt% Tween 60. The achieved results suggest, that mixtures composed of sodium caseinate with synthetic emulsifiers, particularly with Tween 60 may be applied to manufacture food emulsions containing no more than 30 wt% oil which belong to the low fat mayonnaises...|$|E

Moreover, emulsions stabilized by heat treated mixtures enriched in 11 S produced gel after high pressure homogenization. Emulsions produced from 75 % of 7 S and 25 % of 11 S without or with heat treatment at 70 degrees C showed the smallest droplets, indicating a synergistic effect between them.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to formulate low-fat gravy mixes for curries using oilseeds, which are known to function as <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers,</b> namely cashew nuts, and sesame, watermelon and poppy seeds. The functionality of oilseeds was determined in terms of water- and fat-absorption capacities and emulsifying properties. These oilseeds were used as oil replacements in the preparation of vegetable- or legume-based curries. Traditional oil-based samples served as a control for comparison of quality. The prepared curries were analysed for fat content and sensory attributes. A part of the gravy mix was also frozen and used after 30 days for the preparation of legume-based curry. Results revealed that the fat content of oilseeds ranged from 48 to 53 %; protein content, 17 – 29 %; emulsification capacity, 58 – 62 %; and emulsion stability, 200 – 233 %. Formulated gravy mixes resulted in 70 – 80 % lesser oil in curries in comparison with the control. The sensory attributes of low-fat vegetable curry were similar to those of the control; however, low-fat legume-based preparations were found to have significantly lower sensory quality. In curries made out of frozen curry mixes, the sensory attributes of cashew nut-based curry were similar to those of the control. It can be concluded that <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers</b> or oilseeds can be used as oil replacements in the preparation of low-fat gravy mix for Indian curries...|$|R

Industry has responded by trying to identify natural alternatives to synthetic functional ingredients within these products. In this study, the ability of Maillard conjugation products, and several legume proteins were investigated to act as nature-derived or <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers</b> in oil-in-water emulsions fortified with hydrophobic nutraceuticals. Casein-coated oil droplets enriched with lutein were highly unstable to flocculation near their isoelectric point due to the reduction in electrostatic repulsion. However, casein-dextran-coated droplets were stable, which was attributed to strong steric repulsion by the dextran moiety. The casein-coated droplets were unstable to aggregation in the gastric phase of a simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT), whereas the casein-dextran-coated ones were still stable, which was again attributed to increased steric repulsion.

It thus seemed unlikely {{that it would be}} possible to purify PilS protein from serovar Typhi. To allow protein purification, a gene fusion, which would encode the fusion protein with PilS attached to a His-tag, was prepared, and the tagged protein was purified by affinity methodology.

Next, the effect on pilS gene expression of exposure of serovar Typhi to solutions containing bile salts was investigated.

30|$|Nevertheless, heavy {{crude oil}} is a complex mixture of {{hundreds}} of thousands of compounds. The asphaltenes act as <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers.</b> Other active surface components of crude oil include naphthenic acids, resins, porphyrins, etc. (Langevin et al. 2004). The presence of these component increases the complexity of crude oil emulsion, as the molecules can interact and reorganise at the oil–water interface. In that case, to transport heavy crude using emulsion technology involves three stages such as producing the O/W emulsion, transporting the formed emulsion and separating the oil phase from the water phase. However, recovering the crude oil entails breaking the oil-in-water emulsion. To achieve the separation stage the following techniques have been developed which include thermal demulsification, electro-demulsification, chemical demulsification, freeze–thaw method, pH modification, addition of solvent and demulsification by membranes (Ashrafizadeh and Kamran 2010; Yan and Masliyah 1998). The use of surfactants and water to create a stable oil-in-water emulsion with {{heavy crude oil}} to improve its transportability by pipeline has been a topic of several investigations with a series of patents.

But until now the influence of high-pressure homogenization on the functionality of proteins itself has only been scarcely studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the influences of high-pressure homogenization on the functional properties of lupin proteins of different lupin species because these proteins exhibit good functionality and can be applied as <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers</b> in food systems. Especially, the influences on the emulsifying and gelling properties of lupin proteins were studied. The gel strength and the emulsifying capacities of L. albus proteins were increased significantly after high-pressure homogenization with pressures up to 150 MPa at 35 and 60 °C, respectively. The protein solubilities were only barely influenced by homogenization. Completely different results were obtained for L. angustifolius proteins. The emulsifying properties could not be enhanced by high pressure homogenization, which might be due to the presence of different protein fractions in protein isolates of these two species. These results imply that high-pressure homogenization has interesting potential for enhancing functional properties of lupin proteins of L. albus L., while the functional properties of L. angustifolius proteins after homogenization remained similar. High-pressure homogenization is therefore likely to be a tool for enhancing protein functionality, especially for proteins having inferior functionality due to heat treatment or prior processing...|$|R

As these two restrictive conditions decrease dramatically the oil yield, enzymatic and electric treatments were considered. Oil yields similar to those obtained by expression at 100 °C were achieved by optimizing the crushing conditions.

For the efficient treatment of the transition layer, it is necessary clearly to understand the structure and composition of the layer. In this paper, the physical structure and chemical composition of the layer were systematically, layer by layer and phase by phase, analyzed by modern instrumental methods The results show that (1 ）the layer is an emulsion which is composed of oil, water and suspended solids. The water phase has characteristics of weak alkaline, high salinity and viscous polymer. The oil phase contains many <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers</b> such as colloid, asphaltene and so on.

Consumer demand is leading food companies toward a clean label policy, and natural ingredients are the way to go. Modern forestry biorefineries offer an attractive option; novel plant-based hydrocolloids, such as spruce galactoglucomannans (GGM), are available in large quantities. Here we test their functionality and compare it with that of known food stabilizers. Rapeseed oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions stabilized by GGM and their carboxymethyl derivatives (CMGGM) were characterized in detail in terms of droplet size distribution, surface charge, and polysaccharide composition in the aqueous phase and on the droplet surface. The emulsifying and stabilizing capacities of GGM and CMGGM were compared to those of known stabilizers, namely, corn fiber gum (CFG) and gum arabic (GA), the latter of which is the gold standard in food emulsions. During high-pressure homogenization, GGM and CMGGM enabled the formation of emulsions with an average droplet size (D[3, 2]) of about 400 nm and stabilized the droplets against creaming more effectively than GA (D[3, 2] = 1. 27 µm).

The emulsions were characterised under accelerated storage conditions (40 °C) up to 30 days. Physical stability was evaluated by analysing the creaming rate, mean particle size distribution and mean droplet size, viscosity and rheological properties, while chemical stability was assessed through the measurement of primary and secondary oxidation products. The rheological behaviour and creaming stability of the emulsions were dramatically improved by using xanthan gum, whereas the concentration of WPI and the addition of encapsulated OMW phenolics did not result in a significant improvement of physical stability.

Responses such as oxidation measured by PV and TBARS, hardness, color, pH and sensory characteristics were compared with those of a commercial sausage (CON). The mixture containing highly methyl-esterified pectin, tex-tured soybean proteins and isolated soybean proteins, as emulsifier agent, reduced the hardness (EXT: 21. 69 ± 0. 98 and MIX: 20. 17 ± 2. 76 N) and the pH (EXT: 5. 46 ± 0. 03 and MIX: 5. 29 ± 0. 01) of the samples and increased the concentration of peroxides (EXT: 0. 10 ± 0. 01 and MIX: 0. 15 ± 0. 01 meq/kg) when com-pared with samples formulated only with TSP (28. 57 ± 2. 54 N, pH of 6. 92 ± 0. 04 and PV 0. 07 ± 0. 01 meq/ kg). These effects were likely caused by the anionic character of the emulsifier. However, no sensory difference was observed between the sausages containing highly methyl-esterified pectin, textured soybean proteins and isolated soybean proteins submitted to the extrusion process (EXT) and the control sausages, suggesting that the formulation proposed in this study can be a potential alternative for the further development of sausages that have functional properties or are free of artificial additives...|$|E
40|$|There is {{interest}} {{in the production of}} emulsions by low-energy methods because no expensive equipment is required thus making emulsion formation inexpensive and simple to implement. The goal of this research is to establish the major factors that affect emulsion formation using low-energy methods and possible applications of the emulsions and nanoemulsions formed by this method. Lastly, the use of <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers</b> with low- and high-energy methods was investigated. Initially, formation of nanoemulsions using isothermal low energy methods was investigated with a model system (hexadecane, Brij 30). Preliminary experiments showed that nanoemulsions could only be formed when the surfactant was initially mixed in with the oil phase. The major factors that affected particle size included order of addition, surfactant concentration, and storage temperature, while addition rate and stirring speed had minimal effects. The optimal formulation conditions were determined to be at a surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR) of 0. 375, an addition time of 5 minutes, and a stir speed of 700 rpm for both spontaneous emulsification and emulsion phase inversion methods. Additionally, emulsions could be stored for up to a month at temperatures less than 25 °C without showing any instability. Experiments were then carried out to establish which factors affect nanoemulsion formation when using food grade ingredients and the spontaneous emulsification method. Droplet size decreased with increasing SOR and was smallest when the non-ionic surfactant Tween 80 was utilized. In order for spontaneous emulsification to occur, the surfactant had to be initially dissolved in the organic phase rather than the aqueous phase. Oil composition affected particle size with medium chain triglycerides (MCT) forming the smallest droplets followed by flavor oils and then long chain triglycerides forming the largest droplets. However, no physiochemical correlation could be made between oil characteristics and particle size. The results obtained using spontaneous emulsification were then compared to those obtained using emulsion phase inversion and similarities were found, implying a common underlying mechanism for the two methods. Next, the formation of nanoemulsions using the spontaneous emulsification method was demonstrated in a model food system: a gelatin-based dessert. The influence of preparation and storage conditions on nanoemulsion formation and stability were investigated. Droplet size decreased with increasing preparation temperature. Translucent filled hydrogels could be formed by incorporating nanoemulsions into the gelatin system. Optical and rheological properties remained unchanged with emulsion incorporation into a model gelatin gel and commercial gelatin dessert. The use of spontaneous emulsification to produce nanoemulsions may be helpful in the production of functional food gels. Finally, sunflower phospholipids were investigated as an emulsifier using spontaneous emulsification. Initial particle diameter was influenced by phospholipid composition, phospholipid concentration, initial phospholipid location, and storage time. Relatively large emulsion droplets (d 3 ̆e 10 mm) could be formed which means it is possible to form emulsions using <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers</b> when fine droplets are not essential. However, often fine droplets are more desirable so the use of sunflower phospholipids with the high energy method of microfluidization was also investigated to see if an w- 3 fatty acid nanoemulsion delivery system could be formed. Relatively small droplets (d 3 ̆c 150 nm) could be formed by optimizing the phospholipid type and concentration. These results suggest that sunflower phospholipids are a viable emulsifier choice to form nanoemulsions and have added benefits due to their low allergenicity and non-genetically modified sources...|$|R

In this work Lysozyme (Lyz) was conjugated with gum Arabic (GA) {{in order to}} be applied in mayonnaise, at which the presence of both preservative and emulsifier is essential. Interestingly, the Lyz-GA conjugate exhibited improved functional properties and antibacterial activity. In order to approve the results of this study, the Lyz-GA conjugate was applied to mayonnaise as a <b>natural</b> preservative and <b>emulsifier.</b> Application of the Lzy-GA conjugate in mayonnaise expedited the death rate of both S. aureus and E. coli K- 12. The observation proved that conjugations of Lyz with GA increased the spectrum of its application in food products with improved antibacterial activity. Surprisingly, investigation of emulsion stability and rheological properties confirmed the improved emulsification role of Lyz-GA conjugate with a higher elasticity in the mayonnaise. Mayonnaise including conjugates showed a linear rheological response and shear-thinning behavior. Sensory analysis of the mayonnaise with Lyz-GA conjugate was completely consistent with the commercial one. Taken together, our results suggest that conjugation of Lyz with GA made possible the application of a <b>natural</b> preservative and <b>emulsifier</b> in food and pharmaceutical industries, whereas Lyz alone does not have a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity or emulsifying properties...|$|R
40|$|Food {{proteins}} form a {{class of}} <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifiers.</b> Also, due to their high nutritional value and generally-recognized-as-safe (GRAS) status, they make a popular choice as encapsulating agents for bioactive lipids. However, their efficacy {{in the ability to}} confer emulsion oxidative stability is scarcely reported in literature. The main objective of this investigation was to study the influence of processing on the structural characteristics of interfacial food proteins in Menhaden oil-in-water emulsion systems, and relate these characteristics to emulsion oxidative stability. Being the foremost immediate physical barrier around the oil drop, the interfacial protein layer might confer effective protection of the oil from oxidative deterioration if strategically designed. ^ Three different food proteins with distinct characteristics were experimentally studied: (i) sodium caseinate (∼ 24 kDa) —which has a random-coiled structure; (ii) bovine β-lactoglobulin (∼ 18. 4 kDa) —which is globular and encompasses a β-barrel in its native state; and (iii) soy β-conglycinin (7 S) (∼ 180 kDa in trimeric form), which is globular, much larger in size, and has a predominant β-sheet structure. A number of ways were identified which improved the efficacy of these proteins in protecting the encapsulated Menhaden oil against oxidation, depending on the conformation of the protein. In the case of sodium caseinate, homogenization at higher pressure levels, the use and subsequent vaporization of a food-grade volatile solvent to induce drop shrinkage, and limited transglutaminase treatment of the interfacial layer were all found to be useful in promoting oxidative stability. For the globular β-lactoglobulin, momentary preheating to the molten globule state, before homogenization at ambient temperature, had a noteworthy impact on improving oxidative stability due to increased surface aggregation while retaining the original protein stiffness. As for soy 7 S, trypsinization was successful in improving the functionality of the native control at neutral and alkaline pH; it was likely due to the induced formation of β-sheets oriented close to the oil surface which reinforced the protection of oil, in addition to protein unfolding that promoted protein-oil hydrophobic interaction. Based on mathematical modeling, the aforementioned successful methods caused a similar effect, i. e. a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the interfacial protein layer. ...|$|R

40|$|The 19 th Gums & Stabilisers for the Food Industry Conference: Hydrocolloid MultifunctionalityNowadays {{there is}} a high {{interest}} of food industry to develop nutritional food products. This concept promoted the development of bio-based structures to encapsulate bioactive compounds and thus enhance their physical and chemical stability during storage until the consumption. In this field nanotechnology can offers several advantages, not only improving water solubility but also in the increase of bioavailability of lipophilic bioactive compounds. Omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω- 3 fatty acids) are known for their functional properties such as: improving cardiovascular health, decrease inflammation, increase cognitive function, and influence on neurological and visual development. However, ω- 3 fatty acids are highly susceptible to oxidation, have an intense odour and present low water solubility, which makes its direct application in foods extremely difficult. In order to reduce these problems, the nanoencapsulation, through the use of nanoemulsions can be used. In this work, Lactoferrin (Lf), a protein derived from milk {{with a wide range of}} reported biological activities (e. g. antioxidant, antimicrobial and cancer prevention) was used as <b>natural</b> <b>emulsifier</b> for the development of oil-in-water nanoemulsions. Nanoemulsions were produced with a high-pressure homogenizer applied for 5 cycles at 20000 psi. Different Lf concentrations (0. 2; 0. 6; 1; 2; 3; 4 and 5 % (w/w)) were tested. The nanoemulsions physical properties were evaluated in terms of size and ζ- potential measurements using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and by surface tension using the Ring method. The morphology of nanoemulsions were analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The physical and chemical stability of these nanoemulsions was assessed during 50 days, at storage temperatures of 4 ºC and 25 ºC, being the chemical stability of nanoemulsions was evaluated by antioxidant activity measurements using DPPH radical scavenging assay. Results showed that according to the Lf concentration used different properties were obtained. Nanoemulsions with Lf concentrations between 2 and 5 % (w/w) presented sizes around 160 nm and a ζ-potential higher than + 30 mV. For concentrations below 2 % (w/w), nanoemulsions presented sizes around 200 nm and a ζ- potential bellow + 30 mV. It was noticed that higher Lf concentrations lead to smaller sizes and higher ζ-potential values. By increasing the Lf concentration was observed a decrease on superficial tension of nanoemulsions. TEM measurements showed that nanoemulsions particles have defined spherical shape. Results also showed that nanoemulsions with Lf concentration above 2 % (w/w) present better properties (smaller sizes and higher ζ-potential) so the storage stability of these nanoemulsions were assessed. Nanoemulsions stored at 4 ºC did not exhibit significant variations in size and ζ-potential values, while at 25 ºC the nanoemulsions suffered an size increase (around 35 nm compared to initial value) and a reduction in ζ-potential (around 20 mV compared to initial value) during storage. At these conditions, it was also observed that nanoemulaions with Lf concentrations of 2 and 3 % (w/w) present an instability (variations of size and ζ-potential) after 14 days of storage at 25 ºC, while for higher Lf concentrations (4 and 5 % (w/w)) the changes only start to be noticed latter (after 29 days of storage). Antioxidant activity did not demonstrate significant changes before and after storage at both temperatures (IC 50 was around 14 mg/g of solution). This work provides important information that can be useful for the design of nanoemulsions aiming the encapsulation of lipophilic compounds for pharmaceutical and food applications. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The {{emulsification}} performance, {{stability and}} competitive adsorption of two <b>natural</b> food <b>emulsifiers,</b> sugar beet pectin (SBP) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) have been investigated. Both {{can reduce the}} surface tension and emulsify oil in water. However, due to their different structure and conformation they operate via different mechanisms. Using 15 % middle chain triglycerides (MCTs) oil, the amounts of SBP and HPMC adsorbed in emulsions made with these individually and in mixtures were determined. The interfacial concentration (Γ) for SBP stabilized emulsion was ∼ 1. 25 mg/m 2 and for HPMC 3. 5 mg/m 2. The higher adsorption of HPMC was due to multilayer adsorption, whereas SBP adsorbed as a monolayer. Competitive adsorption between SBP and HPMC was also investigated. When the HPMC concentration approached that of adsorbed SBP, the effect of HPMC became dominant and at 1. 5 wt. % controlled the behaviour of the mixed emulsions, which were then almost independent of SBP. The minor role of SBP was mainly to decrease the proportion of large droplets in the emulsion. A model to describe the competitive adsorption between SBP and HPMC is propose...|$|R
40|$|Background: Perceptions of food {{products}} start when flavor compounds are released from foods, transported and appropriate senses {{in the oral}} and nose are triggered. However, the long-term stability of flavor compounds in food product {{has been a major}} concern in the food industry due to the complex interactions between key food ingredients (e. g., polysaccharides and proteins). Hence, this study was conducted to formulate emulsion-based beverage using <b>natural</b> food <b>emulsifiers</b> and to understand the interactions between emulsion compositions and flavor compounds. Results: The influences of modified starch (x 1), whey protein isolate (x 2), soursop flavor oil (x 3) and deionized water (x 4) on the equilibrium headspace concentration of soursop volatile flavor compounds were evaluated using a four-component with constrained extreme vertices mixture design. The results indicated that the equilibrium headspace concentration of soursop flavor compounds were significantly (p < 0. 05) influenced by the matrix and structural compositions of the beverage emulsions. Interface formed using modified starch and whey protein isolate (WPI) proved to be capable of inhibiting the release of volatile flavor compounds from the oil to the aqueous phase. Modified starch could retard the overall flavor release through its hydrophobic interactions with volatile flavor compounds and viscosity enhancement effect. Excessive amount of modified starch was also shown to be detrimental to the stability of emulsion system. However, both modified starch and WPI showed to be a much more effective barrier in inhibiting the flavor release of flavor compounds when used as individual emulsifier than as a mixture. Conclusions: Overall, the mixture design can be practical in elucidating the complex interactions between key food components and volatile flavor compounds in an emulsion system. These studies will be useful for the manufacturers for the formulation of an optimum beverage emulsion with desirable emulsion properties and desirable flavor release profile...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Since skin moisturization may be {{achieved}} by both actives and chosen carrier, plant stem cells, squalene and <b>natural</b> alkyl polyglucoside <b>emulsifier</b> may be potential components of contemporary cosmetic products. The aim {{of the study was}} in vivo evaluation of the skin irritation potential and the efficacy of Alpine Rose stem cells incorporated into li-posomes and olive oil squalene as ingredients of moisturizing creams, with respect to the novel emulsifier used for creams’ stabilization. Methods. With the employment of noninvasive skin biophysical measurements, skin hydration (EC), transepi-dermal water loss (TEWL), erythema index (EI) and viscoelas-ticity were measured on 76 healthy volunteers. In the first phase, skin irritation after a 24 -hour occlusion and the long-term efficacy of creams (a 21 -day study) on healthy skin were evaluated. Phase II of the study focused on the cream efficacy assessment after a 6 -day treatment of sodium lauryl sulfate-irritated skin. Results. After a 24 -hour occlusion, there were no significant changes in the EI for any tested sample. In {{the second phase of the}} study, the EI was not significantly altered for the cream containing squalene, while the application of all active samples resulted in a significant reduction of TEWL. In both phases of the study an EC increase was recorded, espe-cially for the squalene-containing cream. Conclusion. Due to the lack of skin irritation and skin barrier impairment along with the marked hydration effect, it could be said that the in-vestigated actives incorporated into alkyl polyglucoside emulsi-fier-stabilized creams may be safely applied as ingredients for "tailor-made" cosmetic moisturizers intended for normal and dry skin care, whereas olive oil squalene could be used for the treatment of irritated or sensitive skin as well.
