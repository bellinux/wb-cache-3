5|$|On microscopy, {{the tumor}} cells are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are tumor cells around the <b>neuropil,</b> {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are tumor cells around a blood vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E
5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics {{have been shown to be}} relevant to humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most <b>neuropil</b> regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E

The results showed that, the 5 -HT-immunoreactive cells were located in all the four <b>neuropils</b> of optic ganglia. Immunoreactivity of 5 -HT was detected in anterior medial protocerebrum <b>neuropils</b> (AMPN), and {{the inner and outer}} lateral beside olfactory lobe (OL) of deutocerebrum. The presence of NPY-immunoreactive cells was found in all the four <b>neuropils</b> of the optic ganglia. NPY-immunoreactivity occurred in the anterior median cell cluster, lateral cell cluster of protocerebrum, and cell cluster beside OL and AMPN. SP-immunoreactivity was found in medulla terminalis (MT) of optic ganglia, and lateral cell cluster of protocerebrum and posterior lateral cell cluster of tritocerebrum. β-Ep-immunoreactive cells were in MT only.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction In insects, the optic lobes consist of three nested <b>neuropils</b> beneath the photoreceptive retina: the lamina, the medulla and the lobula complex. In coleopterans, as in several other insect orders, the lobula complex is divided into two discrete <b>neuropils,</b> a lobula and a lobula plate. The lamina, medulla and lobula are columnar <b>neuropils</b> sequentially linked by optic chiasmata, whereas the planar lobula plate receives uncrossed axons from the medulla and lobula and is characterized by wide-field tangential neurons [1]. Studies on dipterous insects have shown that these neurons, often having very large axon diameters, are tuned to visual flow-field stimuli by virtue of integration of signals carried by small-field directional motion-sensitive neurons originating retinotopically in the lobula and medulla [2]. Along wit...|$|R
40|$|The central complex (CX) {{is a set}} of <b>neuropils</b> in {{the center}} of the fly brain that have been implicated as playing an {{important}} role in vision-mediated behavior and integration of spatial information with locomotor control. In contrast to currently available data regarding the neural circuitry of <b>neuropils</b> in the fly's vision and olfactory systems, comparable data for the CX <b>neuropils</b> is relatively incomplete; many categories of neurons remain only partly characterized, and the synaptic connectivity between CX neurons has yet to be fully determined. Successful modeling of the information processing functions of the CX <b>neuropils</b> therefore requires a means of easily constructing and testing a range of hypotheses regarding both the high-level structure of their neural circuitry and the properties of their constituent neurons and synapses. To this end, we have created a web application that enables simultaneous graphical querying and construction of executable models of the CX neural circuitry based upon currently available information regarding the geometry and polarity of the arborizations of identified local and projection neurons in the CX. The application's novel functionality is made possible by the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory, a platform for collaborative study and development of fruit fly brain models...|$|R

25|$|In rat, the DNLL has a {{prominent}} columnar organization. Nearly all neurons are stained for GABA, {{especially in the}} central part of the nucleus, and the remaining GABA negative cells are interspersed with the positive, and often stain for glycine. Two populations of GABA+ cells are visible: larger, lightly stained cells that project to the contralateral IC, and smaller, darker stained cells that project ipsilaterally. GABAergic axon terminals form dense groups surrounded by GABA-lemniscal fibers throughout the nucleus, and synapse on both somata and in the <b>neuropil.</b> Glycinergic axon terminals, on the other hand, are more finely localized, with the majority of recipient neurons located laterally in the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} {{is concerned}} with how the brain {{is affected by the}} stimulation of its information processing provided by its surroundings (including the opportunity to interact socially). Brains in richer, more-stimulating environments, have increased numbers of synapses, and the dendrite arbors upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during neurodevelopment, but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Capillary vasculation also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The <b>neuropil</b> (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more neurons.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>neuropils</b> have {{a diverse}} {{role in the}} nervous system, it is {{difficult}} to define a certain overarching function for all <b>neuropils.</b> For instance, the olfactory glomeruli function as sorts of way-stations for the information flowing from the olfactory receptor neurons to the olfactory cortex. The inner plexiform layer of the retina is a little more complex. The bipolar cells post-synaptic to either rods or cones are either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on whether the bipolar cells have sign-inverting synapses or a sign-conserving synapses.|$|R
40|$|Each fall, eastern North American monarch {{butterflies}} (Danaus plexippus) use a time-compensated {{sun compass}} to migrate to their overwintering grounds in central Mexico. The sun compass mechanism involves the neural integration of skylight cues with timing information from circadian clocks {{to maintain a}} constant heading. The neuronal substrates for the necessary interactions between compass neurons in the central complex, a prominent structure of the central brain, and circadian clocks are largely unknown. To begin to unravel these neural substrates, we performed 3 D reconstructions of all <b>neuropils</b> of the monarch brain based on anti-synapsin labeling. Our work characterizes 21 well-defined <b>neuropils</b> (19 paired, 2 unpaired), {{as well as all}} synaptic regions between the more classically defined <b>neuropils.</b> We also studied the internal organization of all major <b>neuropils</b> on brain sections, using immunocytochemical stainings against synapsin, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Special emphasis was placed on describing the neuroarchitecture of sun-compass-related brain regions and outlining their homologies to other migratory species. In addition to finding many general anatomical similarities to other insects, interspecies comparison also revealed several features that appear unique to the monarch brain. These distinctive features were especially apparent in the visual system and the mushroom body. Overall, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the brain anatomy of the monarch butterfly that will ultimately aid our understanding of the neuronal processes governing animal migration...|$|R

2500|$|In insects, many neurons have cell {{bodies that}} are {{positioned}} {{at the edge}} of the brain and are electrically passive—the cell bodies serve only to provide metabolic support and do not participate in signalling.

2500|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} is {{the stimulation}} of the brain by its physical and social surroundings.

With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity, leading to an increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Environmental enrichment also enhances capillary vasculation, providing the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The <b>neuropil</b> (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands, thickening the cortex. Research on rodent brains suggests that environmental enrichment may also lead to an increased rate of neurogenesis.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundDuring {{development}} neurons {{are generated}} by sequential divisions of neural stem cells, or neuroblasts. In the insect brain progeny of certain stem cells form lineage-specific sets of projections that arborize in distinct brain regions, called clonal units. Though {{this raises the}} possibility that the entire neural network in the brain might be organized in a clone-dependent fashion, {{only a small portion of}} clones has been identified. ResultsUsing Drosophila melanogaster, we randomly labeled one of about 100 stem cells at the beginning of the larval stage, analyzed the projection patterns of their progeny in the adult, and identified 96 clonal units in the central part of the fly brain, the cerebrum. Neurons of all the clones arborize in distinct regions of the brain, though many clones feature heterogeneous groups of neurons in terms of their projection patterns and neurotransmitters. Arborizations of clones overlap preferentially to form several groups of closely associated clones. Fascicles and commissures were all made by unique sets of clones. Whereas well-investigated brain regions such as the mushroom body and central complex consist of relatively small numbers of clones and are specifically connected with a limited number of <b>neuropils,</b> seemingly disorganized <b>neuropils</b> surrounding them are composed by a much larger number of clones and have extensive specific connections with many other <b>neuropils.</b> ConclusionsOur study showed that the insect brain is formed by a composition of cell-lineage-dependent modules.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in developmental neurosciences is to understand the establishment and maintenance of specific membrane contacts between axonal, dendritic, and glial processes in the <b>neuropils,</b> which eventually secure neuronal connectivity. However, underlying cell recognition events are pivotal in other tissues as well. This brief review focuses on the pleiotropic functions of a small, evolutionarily conserved group of proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in cell recognition. In Drosophila, this protein family comprises Irregular chiasm C/Roughest (IrreC/Rst), Kin of irre (Kirre), and their interacting protein partners, Sticks and stones (SNS) and Hibris (Hbs). For simplicity, we propose to name this ensemble of proteins the irre cell recognition module (IRM) after the first identified member of this family. Here, we summarize evidence that the IRM proteins function together in various cellular interactions, including myoblast fusion, cell sorting, axonal pathfinding, and target recognition in the optic <b>neuropils</b> of Drosophila. Understanding IRM protein function will help to unravel the epigenetic rules by which the intricate neurite networks in sensory <b>neuropils</b> are formed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a positive-strand RNA {{virus that}} infects European honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) {{and has been}} {{isolated}} from the brains of aggressive bees in Japan. DWV {{is known to be}} transmitted both vertically and horizontally between bees in a colony and can lead to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in bees. In environmentally stressful conditions, DWV can contribute to the demise of a honeybee colony. The purpose of the current study is to identify regions within the brains of honeybees where DWV replicates using in-situ hybridization. Results In-situ hybridizations were conducted with both sense and antisense probes on the brains of honeybees that were positive for DWV as measured by real-time RT-PCR. The visual <b>neuropils</b> demonstrated detectable levels of the DWV positive-strand genome. The mushroom bodies and antenna lobe <b>neuropils</b> also showed the presence of the viral genome. Weaker staining with the sense probe in the same regions demonstrates that the antigenome is also present and that the virus is actively replicating in these regions of the brain. Conclusion These results demonstrate that in bees infected with DWV the virus is replicating in critical regions of the brain, including the <b>neuropils</b> responsible for vision and olfaction. Therefore DWV infection of the brain could adversely affect critical sensory functions and alter normal bee behavior. </p...|$|R

The concentrations of <b>neuropil</b> within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Recent {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the source and target neurons for the diffusible neuronal messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) in the nervous system of the locust. Here we compare the neuroarchitecture of NO signaling between dif-ferent sensory systems. The available neuroanatomical data implicate NO in sen-sory processing for modalities as diverse as mechanoreception, vision, olfaction, gustation and hearing. All respective first-order sensory <b>neuropils</b> are innervated by NOS-containing interneurons. The corresponding sensory receptor neurons lack NOS but seem to express soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), the main receptor mol-ecule for NO in the nervous system. The axonal projections of sensory neurons must therefore be considered the primary target of NO in these sensory <b>neuropils.</b> An exception is the antennal olfactory system where sGC is apparently expressed in interneurons, in partial colocalization with NOS. We discuss these anatomical findings {{in relation to the}} spatiotemporal charac-teristics of NO signaling. Many sensory <b>neuropils</b> are organized into maps that reflect neuronal response properties (i. e., tuning or receptive fields). A local release of NO within such maps will therefore most strongly affect neurons with similar coding properties. If sensory receptor activity triggers NO synthesis locally in the map, this mechanism could link groups of similarly tuned receptors dynamically according to stimulus intensity. Furthermore, we explore the functional implica-tions of differences between sensory systems in the anatomy of NOS-expressing interneurons, using the compound eye and the thoracic tactile system as examples...|$|R
40|$|Neuroanatomical {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the architecture and organization among <b>neuropils</b> are highly conserved within any order of arthropods.

However, relationships among what are considered to be paraphyletic groups or among the stem arthropods have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. The present parsimony analyses of independent neuroarchitectural characters from 27 arthropods and lobopods demonstrate relationships that are congruent with phylogenies derived from molecular studies, except for the status of the Onychophora. The present account describes the brain of the onychophoran Euperipatoides rowelli, demonstrating that the structure and arrangements of its neurons, cerebral <b>neuropils</b> and sensory centres are distinct from arrangements in the brains of mandibulates.

40|$|International audienceThe visual {{systems of}} {{vertebrates}} {{and many other}} bilaterian clades consist of complex neural structures guiding {{a wide spectrum of}} behaviors.

In this review we argue that the profound conservation of genetic and developmental steps generating the eye and its target <b>neuropils</b> in fish and fruit flies supports a homology between some core elements of bilaterian visual circuitries.

40|$|AbstractMost insects have simple eyes (ocelli), in {{addition}} to compound eyes. Although the ocelli can detect only changes in light intensity averaged over their large visual field, they do play various roles {{in the behavior of}} insects, as they have advantages over compound eyes in terms of photic sensitivity and the speed of signal transmission. I summarize here our present knowledge on the neural organization of ocellar systems of a number of insects, and propose that they can be classified into three types: (1) the “cockroach type” ocellar system where signals from the photoreceptors first converge onto a small number of second-order neurons, and then diverge to a large number of third-order neurons which project into a number of target <b>neuropils</b> of the brain; (2) the “bee type” ocellar system where photoreceptor signals are passed to various target <b>neuropils</b> by a large number of second-order neurons; and (3) the “locust type” ocellar system where ocellar signals are transmitted to various target <b>neuropils</b> by both second- and third-order neurons. I propose that: (1) the “cockroach type” ocellar system can be characterized as a sensitive type where higher sensitivity is attained because of the higher ratio of convergence of photoreceptor signals onto second-order neurons; (2) the “bee type” ocellar system is a fast type where a high speed of signal transmission is attained at the possible cost of sensitivity; and (3) the “locust type” ocellar system is an intermediate type where both speed and sensitivity are emphasized. A possible phylogenetic relationship between the three types of ocellar systems is discussed...|$|R
