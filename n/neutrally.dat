Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. <b>neutrally),</b> which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E
5|$|Weber's ideal {{bureaucracy}} is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated {{lines of}} authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) {{on the basis of}} written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented <b>neutrally</b> and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.|$|E
5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, Letters proved equally popular. Dutch and German translations were rapidly produced, {{and prompted}} by constant demand, editions appeared {{in such places}} as Dublin, Paris and Maastricht. In lieu of a second volume of letters, Crèvecœur produced an expanded French version (Lettres d'un cultivateur américain) that was published in 1784. The French version, which removed the fictional persona of James, {{is presented as a}} series of documents that have been <b>neutrally</b> edited, providing greater documentary detail but at the expense of artistry.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain <b>neutrally</b> buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|With {{a sizable}} oily liver and low-density tissues, the Pacific {{electric}} ray is almost <b>neutrally</b> buoyant and can hover {{in the water}} column with very little effort. Propulsive power is provided by the muscular tail, while the disc is held rigid. Telemetry studies have shown that this species swims primarily at night, when it enters reefs and other habitats with high terrain relief, and spends most of the day in nearby open areas buried in sediment. It is nomadic and solitary, though several individuals may rest within the same area.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and <b>neutrally.</b> Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, {{and the power of the}} State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E

25|$|While most {{cephalopods}} float (i.e. are <b>neutrally</b> buoyant {{or nearly}} so; in fact most cephalopods are about 2–3% denser than seawater), they achieve this in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Like coastal {{demersal}} fish, {{deep sea}} demersal fish {{can be divided}} into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic fish are negatively buoyant and benthopelagic fish are <b>neutrally</b> buoyant.|$|E
25|$|Deep sea benthic {{fish can}} be divided into {{strictly}} benthic fish and benthopelagic fish. Usually, strictly benthic fish are negatively buoyant, while benthopelagic fish are <b>neutrally</b> buoyant. Strictly benthic fish stay in constant contact with the bottom. They either lie-and-wait as ambush predators or move actively over the bottom in search for food.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{histidine}} {{is positively}} charged and interacts {{well with the}} negative charges found {{on the surface of}} 2,3-BPG, Serine has a <b>neutrally</b> charged side chain at physiological pH, and interacts less well. This change results in less binding of 2,3-BPG to fetal Hb, and as a result oxygen will bind to it with higher affinity than adult hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Downward release {{exists in}} the {{following}} parts of the body: the shoulder blades (supported by the rib cage), the tailbone, and in the foot at the heel (Calcaneus), and the first and fifth metatarsals (the three of which serve as primary contact points with the ground). The shoulders should not be thrown back, but simply relaxed <b>neutrally.</b>|$|E
25|$|Surface-supplied divers may be {{required}} to work in mid-water or on the bottom. They must be able to stay down without effort, and this usually requires weighting. When working in mid-water the diver may wish to be <b>neutrally</b> buoyant or negative, and when working on the bottom he will usually want to be several kilos negative.|$|E
25|$|While phonetic {{differences}} also decrease {{with greater}} formality, Quebec and European accents are readily distinguishable in all registers. Over time, European French has exerted {{a strong influence}} on Quebec French. The phonological features traditionally distinguishing informal Quebec French and formal European French have gradually acquired varying sociolinguistic status, so that certain traits of Quebec French are perceived <b>neutrally</b> or positively by Quebecers, while others are perceived negatively.|$|E
25|$|When underwater, a diver often {{needs to}} be <b>neutrally</b> buoyant so that the diver neither sinks nor rises. A state of neutral {{buoyancy}} exists when the weight of water that the diver displaces equals the total weight of the diver. The diver uses a BC to maintain this state of neutral buoyancy by adjusting the BC's volume and therefore its buoyancy, in response to various effects which alter the diver’s overall volume or weight.|$|E
25|$|To remain <b>neutrally</b> buoyant, gas {{is added}} to the BC when the diver is {{negative}} (too heavy), or vented from the BC when the diver is too buoyant (too light). There is no stable equilibrium depth for a diver. Any change in depth from a position of neutrality result in a force toward an even less neutral depth, so buoyancy control is a continuous and active procedure—the diving equivalent of balance, in a positive feedback environment.|$|E
25|$|Free divers {{may also}} use weights to {{counteract}} buoyancy of a wetsuit. However, {{they are more}} likely to weight for neutral buoyancy at a specific depth, and their weighting must take into account not only the compression of the suit with depth, but also the compression of the air in their lungs, and the consequent loss of buoyancy. As they have no decompression obligation, they do not have to be <b>neutrally</b> buoyant near the surface at the end of a dive.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} 'unwritten doctrines' (in Greek, ἄγραφα δόγματα, ágrapha dógmata) {{refers to}} doctrines of Plato taught inside his {{school and was}} first used by his student Aristotle. In his treatise on physics, he wrote that Plato had used a concept in one dialogue differently than 'in the so-called unwritten doctrines.' Modern scholars who defend {{the authenticity of the}} unwritten doctrines ascribed to Plato lay stress on this ancient expression. They hold that Aristotle used the phrase 'so-called' not in any ironic sense, but <b>neutrally.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} of Katawa Shoujo is choice-based, {{in which}} the player reads through text and occasionally has the {{chance to respond to}} prompts with a variety of preset responses. The decisions made initiate possible events or dialogue within the story. Depending on the choices made by the player, the story branches into multiple forks. Each of these paths chronicle Hisao's deepening and eventually romantic relationship with one of the five main female characters (or lack thereof), which may variously end well, badly, or <b>neutrally.</b>|$|E
25|$|Not all {{of these}} words are stably masculine. Native English speakers, among others, tend to treat kuzo (acousin) and amiko (afriend) as gender-neutral, and nepo (agrandson/grandchild), bubo (abrat), and koko (arooster/chicken) are often {{ambiguous}} as well. Once such a word is used ambiguously by {{a significant number of}} speakers or writers, it can no longer be assumed to be masculine. Language guides suggest using all ambiguous words <b>neutrally,</b> and many people find this the least confusing approach—and so the ranks of masculine words gradually dwindle.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of genetic mutations neither assist, change the appearance of, nor bring harm to individuals. Through {{the process of}} genetic drift, these mutated genes are <b>neutrally</b> sorted among populations and survive across generations by chance alone. In contrast to genetic drift, natural selection is not a random process because it acts on traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Natural selection and random genetic drift are constant and dynamic parts of life and over time this has shaped the branching structure in the tree of life.|$|E
25|$|The Rouse profile characterizes {{sediment}} concentrations {{because the}} Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling {{under the weight}} of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not <b>neutrally</b> buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.|$|E
25|$|The {{buoyancy}} {{force on}} the diver is {{the weight of the}} volume of the liquid that they and their equipment displace minus the weight of the diver and their equipment; if the result is positive, that force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the density of the water. The density of fresh water is about 3% less than that of ocean water. Therefore, divers who are <b>neutrally</b> buoyant at one dive destination (e.g. a fresh water lake) will predictably be positively or negatively buoyant when using the same equipment at destinations with different water densities (e.g. a tropical coral reef).|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Speaker {{has been}} a member of the {{governing}} party, current Speaker Darryl Plecas being an exception; however, while holding the office of Speaker that MLA must act <b>neutrally</b> and treat all other MLAs impartially, and to preserve this impartiality the Speaker follows Speaker Denison's rule in breaking ties. The Speaker presides over the debates and procedures of the Legislative Assembly. The Speaker enforces the Rules of Procedure, commonly referred to as the Standing Orders. Any disputes or procedural rulings are made according to the Standing Orders or, in absence of a rule governing a specific situation, to parliamentary precedence and convention. The Speaker does not vote, except in the case of a tie.|$|E
25|$|The models {{described}} {{on this page}} describe {{the evolution of a}} single site within a set of sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire locus by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving <b>neutrally.</b> If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. This approach allows one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another set of parameters describing the variance in the total rate of substitution across sites.|$|E
25|$|When {{the suit}} is being used correctly, the bubble inside it is {{relatively}} small, and its movement is not important. The bubble may be large {{for a variety of}} reasons: if a diver has ascended without venting the suit; if the valve supplying gas to dry suit fails in the open position; or if the diver is over-weighted, and extra air has been added to the suit at some point to make the diver <b>neutrally</b> buoyant. The size of the bubble can be minimised by being correctly weighted and venting excess gas from the suit on ascent. Some divers ensure that the bubble remains {{at the top of their}} body by using the buoyancy compensator to counteract any excess weighting, keeping only the minimum gas necessary to avoid squeeze inside the drysuit.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{possible}} to calculate the required ballast given the diver and all his or her equipment, this is not done in practice, as all the values would have to be measured accurately. The practical procedure is known as a buoyancy check, and is done by wearing all the equipment, with the tank(s) nearly empty, and the buoyancy compensator empty, in shallow water, and adding or removing weight until the diver is <b>neutrally</b> buoyant. The weight should then be distributed on the diver to provide correct trim, and a sufficient part of the weight should be carried {{in such a way that}} it can be removed quickly in an emergency to provide positive buoyancy at any point in the dive. This is not always possible, and in those cases an alternative method of providing positive buoyancy should be used.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or <b>neutrally</b> charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Barotrauma {{of descent}} {{is caused by}} {{pressure}} differences between the increasing ambient pressure and the internal pressure of gas filled spaces of the diver's body and equipment. The skills of equalization are simple but essential to avoid injury. More complex, but also more straightforward in practice, is buoyancy control and the associated control of descent rate. The diver {{is expected to be}} competent to control, and particularly, limit, the descent rate by adjustment of buoyancy of the buoyancy compensator, and when applicable, the dry suit. The diver must be able to limit descent rate to match the ability to equalize, particularly the ears, and to stop the descent quickly without going into an uncontrolled ascent if there is a problem, or when the desired depth has been reached. In most cases the bottom provides a physical limit to descent, but this is not always the case, and it is generally considered bad form to hit the bottom at speed. A skilled diver will stop at the desired distance above the bottom and stay at that depth, <b>neutrally</b> buoyant, and ready to proceed with the dive. These skills require practice, and are not usually fully developed after typical entry level recreational certification.|$|E
500|$|... a [...] "stage" [...] is a {{cylinder}} holding reserve, travel or deco gas. They are usually carried [...] "side slung", clipped {{on either side}} of the diver to the harness of the backplate and wing or buoyancy compensator, rather than on the back, and may be left on the distance line to be picked up for use on return (stage dropped). Commonly divers use aluminium stage cylinders, particularly in fresh water, because they are nearly <b>neutrally</b> buoyant in water and can be removed underwater with less effect on the diver's overall buoyancy.|$|E
500|$|The {{interrogation}} minigame {{involves the}} players character interrogating a suspect. A graph shows the suspect's [...] "stress level" [...] which oscillates {{in a sort}} of pseudo-sine wave. The player must choose to act either aggressively, calmingly or <b>neutrally</b> towards the suspect. These actions will raise, lower or maintain the stress level. A horizontal target range is highlighted on the chart, which the player must aim for the stress level to be within in order to advance the interrogation. A marker next to the graph indicates how advance the interrogation. The player must complete interrogation within a set time limit to succeed.|$|E
500|$|Nominal {{compounds}} {{are quite}} frequent. Some derivational verbal suffixes are rather productive, e.g. jar- 'to speak', jarilts- 'to speak with each other'. Formally, the independent words derived using verbal suffixes can roughly {{be divided into}} three classes: final verbs, {{which can only be}} used sentence-finally, i.e. -na (mainly future or generic statements) or –ø (second person imperative); participles (often called [...] "verbal nouns"), which can be used clause-finally or attributively, i.e. -san (perfect-past) or -maar ('want to'); and converbs, which can link clauses or function adverbially, i.e. -ž (qualifies for any adverbial function or <b>neutrally</b> connects two sentences) or -tal (the action of the main clause takes place until the action expressed by the suffixed verb begins).|$|E
500|$|From his {{own work}} {{and the work of}} his {{students}} Bohr and Henry Moseley, Rutherford knew that the positive charge of any atom could always be equated to that of an integer number of hydrogen nuclei. This, coupled with the atomic mass of many elements being roughly equivalent to an integer number of hydrogen atoms - then assumed to be the lightest particles - led him to conclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei. He named such particles protons. Further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed; he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of previously-unknown <b>neutrally</b> charged particles, which were tentatively dubbed [...] "neutrons".|$|E
500|$|Since {{it is not}} a fast swimmer, {{the goblin}} shark may be an ambush predator. Its low-density flesh and large oily liver make it <b>neutrally</b> buoyant, {{allowing}} it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection. Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized jaws can snap forward to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic ligaments associated with the mandibular joint, which are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; when the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially [...] "catapult" [...] the jaws forward. At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) {{on the floor of the}} mouth drops, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey.|$|E
500|$|Dormand {{had been}} brought up a Christian, an {{allegiance}} which continued into adulthood, when {{he sat on the}} parochial church council. He described his adoption of atheism as the result of [...] "some years of very considerable thought", and once freed from the fear of offending religious constituents, his atheism became more outspoken in the Lords; in July 2000 he called for the disestablishment of the Church of England. He helped form the All Party Humanist Group, and became Vice-President of the British Humanist Association. [...] As a former teacher, he sought parity in schools for religions and humanism, seeking to have both described <b>neutrally</b> rather than propagated. [...] After his death, Michael Turnbull, the former Bishop of Durham, wrote in The Times of how Dormand had pursued this and other causes [...] "without prejudice" [...] and with [...] "a warm affection for others".|$|E
