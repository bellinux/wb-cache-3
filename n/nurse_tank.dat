40|$|AbstractIn an {{accident}} in southwest Iowa, USA in 2012, an anhydrous ammonia <b>nurse</b> <b>tank</b> vented its entire cargo of 5500 L (1500 gallons) of liquid ammonia to the atmosphere. Follow-up {{study of the}} failed tank revealed a through-crack along a weld used to connect the tank to its running gear. Side-angle ultrasound examinations were performed on 532 used anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks to measure the locations, sizes, and orientations of flaw indications. The tanks examined had manufacture dates ranging from 1952 to 2011. A total of 83 indications were found {{in or near the}} leg welds of 50 of these 532 tanks. Several factors suggest that these indications are fatigue cracks, not the stress corrosion cracks more commonly detected in nurse tanks. These findings suggest that roughly 9 % of the 200, 000 nurse tanks in the U. S. <b>nurse</b> <b>tank</b> fleet may contain leg-weld fatigue cracks. Nurse tanks are the only large, pressurized packages for hazardous cargo that do not contain manways; thus, their interior walls cannot be inspected for flaws with magnetic particle or fluorescent dye penetrant methods. Since the tank interior is inaccessible, side-angle ultrasound is the only detection method capable of detecting cracks in nurse tanks initiating at both interior and exterior tank surfaces. For this reason, the authors recommend that side-angle ultrasound be considered for use in periodic <b>nurse</b> <b>tank</b> inspections...|$|E
40|$|Improving the {{uniformity}} of {{anhydrous ammonia application}} Each year Iowa corn growers apply {{more than a billion}} pounds of nitrogen as anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) as crop fertilizer. During the application process some of the ammonia vaporizes, changing from liquid to gas, which causes application inefficiencies. This publication reports recommendations to improve the {{uniformity of}} anhydrous application that were the result of a series of field experiments using conventional and nonconventional methods. Anhydrous ammonia begins as a liquid under its own pressure inside the field <b>nurse</b> <b>tank.</b> The pressure in the tank depends on the temperature of the ammonia.

40|$|Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic {{material}} that is transported from distribution centers to farm fields in steel pressure vessels called <b>nurse</b> <b>tanks.</b> Numerous accidents have occurred in which <b>nurse</b> <b>tanks</b> failed and ammonia was released, often with explosive force. The majority of such accidents are caused by stress corrosion cracking of the tank steel. Stress corrosion cracking {{is caused by the}} combination of stress in the tank 2 ̆ 7 s steel and the corrosive effect of ammonia. Neutron diffraction analysis was used to map the residual stress state in and near circumferential welds from two used anhydrous ammonia <b>nurse</b> <b>tanks,</b> one manufactured in 1966 and the other manufactured in 1986. Notched SA 455 steel test specimens were held under tensile load (stress concentration factors of 40 to 80 MPam) while immersed in NH 3 for seven months to generate crack propagation rate data. The results from these measurements were then used to predict stress corrosion crack growth rates for various pre-existing crack sizes at various temperatures. These data may be useful for estimating safe service lifetimes of <b>nurse</b> <b>tanks</b> that contain cracks...|$|R
40|$|Penaeus monodon-type {{baculovirus}} (MBV) is {{a horizontal}} transmission virus disease especially found in marine shrimp. Even though sanitization of MBV contamination in shrimp hatcheries by using clean seawater or chemicals has been recommended, {{the prevalence of}} the disease in larvae is still frequently reported. This study is carried out {{in an attempt to}} improve previous sanitization methods by using the upwelling flow-through vessel developed for this study. Eggs of Penaeus monodon were obtained from infected broodstocks collected from the wild. Decontamination of MBV was performed using three methods. Treatment 1 : The eggs were continuously rinsed with chlorinated seawater for 1 min and transferred to a <b>nursing</b> <b>tank.</b> The eggs were allowed to hatch and reared to the postlarval stage in a <b>nursing</b> <b>tank.</b> Treatment 2 : The eggs were rinsed with chlorinated seawater for 1 min and hatched in the upwelling vessel. Following hatching, the nauplius larvae were reared to the postlarval stage in a <b>nursing</b> <b>tank.</b> Treatment 3 : The eggs were bathed with 20 mg/l iodophore for 30 s and hatched in the upwelling vessel. Following hatching, the nauplius larvae were reared to the postlarval stage in a <b>nursing</b> <b>tank.</b> There was no MBV observed in shrimp at the nauplius stage in all treatments. However, at day 11, when larvae developed to postlarva 1, the infection was found in the shrimp of treatment 1. At day 15 (postlarva 5) ...|$|R

40|$|In This Issue: Postemergence Shattercane Control in Corn Algae and Moss Control {{in water}} and stock Tanks New Registrations Postemergence Shattercane Control in Corn Postemergence control of {{shattercane}} in corn is limited. Bladex 80 W or 90 DF used with vegetable oil or a surfactant can be used before corn exceeds the 4 -leaf stage. The Bladex label does not claim shattercane control. Our observations are this treatment stunts small shattercane plants but may not kill them. Similar results may be obtained with 2 qt. /A atrazine used with crop oil concentrate. Tandem used with Bladex or atrazine will improve activity. Similarly, Prowl used with Bladex or atrazine before the 5 -leaf stage of corn improves activity compared to the triazine alone. While these treatments don 2 ̆ 7 t kill the shattercane, they set it back, allowing the corn {{to get ahead of}} the cane. This sets the stage for effective control with cultivation.

30|$|Sea bass {{fingerlings}} {{at approximately}} 90  days post-hatch (dph) {{were obtained from}} private hatcheries, including Chachoengsao (CHAC), Chon Buri (CHON), Chumphon (CHUM), and Samut Songkram (SAMU). The CHAC and SAMU stocks originated from wild populations of the Bang Pakong and Meklong Rivers, respectively, in the upper Gulf of Thailand. The CHON stock was founded from broodstock obtained from cage culture operations along {{the east coast of}} the Gulf of Thailand, mainly in Chon Buri Province. The CHUM stock originated from wild populations of the Chumphon River, which runs through the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand. These hatchery populations represent primary sources of seed stocks for Asian sea bass farming in Thailand (Department of Fisheries 2016; Senanan et al. 2015). In general, the hatcheries produced sea bass fry from group mating with a sex ratio of 1 : 2 (male:female). About 18 – 24 brood fish, aged 3 – 5  years with body weight of 4 – 5  kg were stocked in each spawning tank (2 [*]×[*] 4 [*]×[*] 2.5  m 3). They were injected with 1  ml of synthetic hormone (Suprefact) under the dorsal fin, in the afternoon, to induce gamete maturation. Spawning normally took place 24 – 28  h post-injection (second night). Eggs were collected at 38 – 40  h (second morning) post-spawning and transferred to <b>nursing</b> <b>tanks</b> (1.5 [*]×[*] 2.5 [*]×[*] 1  m 3), where larvae were reared until 20 dph. Fry were then transferred to concrete tanks (2 [*]×[*] 4 [*]×[*] 1  m 3) and size graded at 30 and 60 dph at the hatcheries to minimize cannibalism.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A spreadsheet‐based manure {{transport}} and land application decision tool, MANURE$HAUL, {{was developed to}} provide farmers, custom applicators, and others involved with manure management a manure cost and labor calculator for liquid manure systems using top‐loading <b>tank</b> spreaders and <b>nurse</b> <b>tanks.</b> The manure hauling capacity was {{a function of the}} machinery set selected, manure tank capacity, and hauling distance. Manure {{transport and}} application costs were a function of spreader tank capacity and hauling distance. Representative 175 ‐, 350 ‐, 700 ‐, and 1, 400 ‐cow dairy farms were compared to evaluate hauling time and machinery costs for a range of machinery sets, hauling distances, and nutrient values for the manure applied. Equipment ownership and operating costs were calculated for agitation, pumping, manure transport, land application, and incorporation. Equipment ownership and operating costs ranged from 0. 32 ¢/L of manure hauled per year (1. 18 ¢/gal) for a 175 ‐cow dairy using a 11400 ‐L (3000 ‐gal) spreader with an average hauling distance of 1. 6 km (1 mile) and broadcast application with tillage incorporation to 0. 50 ¢/L (1. 91 ¢/gal) for a 1400 ‐cow farm with slurry injection and an average hauling distance of 6. 4 km (4 mile) with two 34100 ‐L (9000 ‐gal) spreaders and four nurse trucks for over‐the‐road transport. Two nurse trucks supplying a tractor‐drawn spreader became more cost‐effective than two tractor‐drawn spreaders alone at a hauling distance of about 4. 8 km (3 mile). Injection application increased the number of days needed for manure application compared to a broadcast application with tillage incorporation, but when the time for tillage incorporation was included the total time needed for field operations with injection was less than broadcast with incorporation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} waste management practices of purchasing, handling, storage, and disposal of agricultural chemicals, petroleum products, and maintenance residuals. One-hundred surveys were returned by agricultural producers from three Nebraska counties selected based on unique environmental and waste management issues. Twenty-four questions concerning agricultural chemicals and 16 questions directed to petroleum products and maintenance residuals are discussed. A follow-up interview with 45 respondents was conducted “on-site” to gain insight into their reported practices, perceptions, and actual practices. Most farmers (66 %) tended to purchase pesticides in 3. 8 to 10 L (1 - 2. 5 gal) containers and most (79 %) were willing to participate in a recycling program for pesticide containers. Most of the respondents burned soft/hard plastic and paper pesticide containers, or returned the metal containers to the supplier. Few farmers took pesticide containers to landfills, or buried or stored containers in their field. Most farmers (76 %) applied left-over diluted chemical residues or rinsates evenly on the field just sprayed. Eighty-one percent of the farmers stored pesticides and 89 % stored fertilizers at locations greater than 31 m (101 ft) from a water source. Only 9 % of the respondents indicated they had containment barriers for stationary bulk pesticides, fertilizer storage <b>tanks,</b> or transportable <b>nurse</b> <b>tanks.</b> Seventy-nine percent of the respondents and 84 % of the interviewed farmers did not record or monitor volumes of petroleum storage. Farmers tended to have trash dumps (62 %) and junk piles (57 %) on their farmsteads. Geographic location within the state and size of the farmstead had an effect on whether the farms had dumps. Most farmers (94 %) felt they used appropriate recycling methods to deal with waste products. However, over half of the farmers were unaware of the location of the petroleum (oil) recycling station. Most farmers (94 %) indicated they felt they purchased replacement items based on long life instead of lowest price...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Nursing postlarvae of Penaeus merguiensis in {{the same}} tank as rearing always results in low {{survival}} rates, around 30 %. One reason is that stocking density for P 1 is too high for postlarvae grown to P 20 size. Another {{reason may be that}} it is impossible to sufficiently clean a tank containing culture stock. In order to overcome the first constraint and to test whether the second is valid, rearing of nauplii to early postlarval stage was done in one tank, then early postlarvae were moved to another <b>tank</b> for <b>nursing</b> to P 20. Rearing was done in rectangular, concrete tanks (5 m Ã— 5 m Ã— 2 m) of 50 ton capacity, with an initial stocking density of 20 - 40 nauplii/â„“. Chaetoceros sp. at a density of 3 - 4 Ã— 104 cell/ml, or Tetraselmis sp. at 1 - 3 Ã— 104 cell/ml were fed to zoea stage, then rotifer was given when the larvae metamorphosed to mysis stage. Within 8 - 10 days, when all of the larvae metamorphosed to postlarval stage, they were transferred to the <b>nursing</b> <b>tank.</b> Postlarval <b>nursing</b> was done in rectangular, concrete tanks with a capacity of 12 or 30 tons. The stocking rate was 12 postlarvae/â„“ in the 12 -ton tanks and 8 postlarvae/â„“ in the 30 -ton tanks. The early postlarvae were fed constantly with brine shrimp, and the older postlarvae were fed 4 - 5 times daily with squid meat. Fifty to seventy percent of seawater was exchanged, and siphoning of food remnants was done daily. The postlarvae grew to an intermediate size (1. 0 - 2. 5 cm total length) for stocking in grow-out ponds within 12 to 20 days. The results of rearing in 50 -ton tanks with an initial stocking density of 20 - 25 postlarvae/â„“, 25 - 30 postlarvae/â„“ and 30 - 40 postlarvae/â„“ produced survival rates of 74. 3 %, 63. 6 % and 47. 6 %, respectively. The survival rate for nursing in 12 -ton tanks, with stocking density of 12 postlarvae/â„“ was 85. 0 % and for 30 -ton tanks with stocking density of 8 postlarvae/â„“ was 61. 7 %. These results seem to indicate that the rearing and nursing of shrimp would be more efficient if carried out in separate tanks...|$|R
