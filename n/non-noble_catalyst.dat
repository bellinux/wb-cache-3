The heats of chemisorption (Q) for all involved adspecies, activation barriers (Delta E) and enthalpy changes (Delta H) for forward and reverse reactions were evaluated. The calculations indicated that both the dissociation of CH, and the dissociation of CO, are rate-determining steps and that they are promoted by each other. A small amount of OH radical may account for the lower activity for the CO 2 -reforming of methane. The activity sequence of catalysts is Fe>Ni>Rh>Ru>Ir>Pd>Pt>Cu.

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFCs) are currently based on high cost {{materials such as}} Nafion® membrane and Pt based catalysts. The high cost and limited abundance of noble metal hinder the commercialization of such fuel cells. For the future hydrogen economy, alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AAEMFCs) offer advantages of the potential use of non-Pt group metal catalysts, low-cost membranes (e. g. polysulfone based membranes) and cheaper bipolar plate (e. g. stainless steel). The research described in this thesis focused on {{the research and development}} of alternative anion conducting membranes and catalyst materials for fuel cells. Quaternary 1, 4 -diazabicyclo-[2. 2. 2]-octane (DABCO) polysulfone (QDPSU) was synthesized with different degree of substitution (DS) and characterized. The higher DS showed the better ionic conductivity; 0. 015 S cm- 1 for DS 58, 0. 027 S cm- 1 for DS 80 and 0. 039 S cm- 1 for DS 106 at 50 oC and 100 % relative humidity (RH). Based on the QDPSU, a thin PTFE-QDPSU composite membrane was prepared. Compared to the pristine QDPSU membrane, the composite membrane exhibited a better mechanical strength (32 MPa, maximum strength), less swelling and lower water uptake. The ionic conductivity of the composite membrane was 0. 051 S cm- 1 at 55 oC and 100 % RH. In fuel cell tests, power densities of 146 mW cm- 2 and 103 mW cm- 2 were achieved using oxygen and air, respectively. Severe degradation was found during preliminary experimental investigation on the KOH loaded polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane including an ammonia smell came out the bottle and anode methanol solution turns yellow brown color in fuel cell tests. The QDPSU membrane was absorbed with phosphoric acid and tested in an intermediate temperature fuel cell. It was found that the higher DS, the higher membrane conductivity. When the DS reached 180 %, the QDPSU polymer cannot form ii a film with a suitable mechanical strength for the fuel cell application. A high power density of 400 mW cm- 2 was achieved using DS 106 of PA/QDPSU membrane at 150 oC and atmospheric pressure. Pd supported on carbons pre-treated in 5 % nitric acid, 0. 07 M phosphoric acid, 0. 2 M potassium hydroxide or 10 % hydrogen peroxide and evaluated in a half-cell. All Pd/C catalysts gave Tafel slopes close to 60 mV dec- 1. Mass activities, measured at 0. 025 V, for the 0. 07 M H 3 PO 4 and 0. 2 M KOH treated carbon deposited with Pd were 6 mA mg- 1 Pd. Pre-treatments using 5 % HNO 3 and 10 % H 2 O 2 lead to an unfavorable effect on the morphology of Pd/C (metal particle agglomeration). Metal macrocycle based catalysts were examined for the ORR in alkaline media. FePc/KJB was found more active catalyst than the other metal macrocycles (CoPc, CoTMPP). The stability study in half-cell tests suggests that the FePc/KJB catalyst showed no degradation. The FePc/KJB was heat-treated under N 2 atmosphere and 800 oC. The electrochemical behavior for ORR was characterized in half cell and single cell tests. The electron transfer number (n) of FePc/KJB-H 8 was calculated to be 3. 9 for ORR at - 0. 4 V. In AAEMFC, the peak power densities were 13. 5 and 9. 2 mW cm- 2 for Pt/C and FePc/KJB-H 8 under the same operating conditions, respectively. A direct methanol carbonate fuel cell using anion exchange materials and <b>non-noble</b> <b>catalyst</b> was demonstrated. The MEA performance using <b>non-noble</b> <b>catalyst</b> Acta 4020 was superior to the Pt/C based MEA. A maximum power density of 4. 5 mW cm- 2 was achieved at 50 oC using 6. 0 M methanol and 2. 0 M K 2 CO 3.

Fe to TPTZ mole ratios of 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, 1 : 5, 1 : 6, and 1 : 7 were used to prepare the precursor complexes. X-ray diffraction and surface electrochemical techniques were used to characterize these catalysts (Fe-Nx/C), and revealed that when the amount of TPTZ in the precursor complex was increased, the decomposition of Fe-Nx sites, which are considered active sites for the ORR, was effectively reduced, resulting in higher Fe-Nx site density and thus improving the catalysts' ORR activity. This beneficial effect was validated through rotating disk electrode tests {{and analysis of the}} ORR kinetics catalyzed by these catalysts. The obtained results showed that as the Fe to TPTZ mole ratio in the precursor complex was decreased, the catalytic ORR activity of Fe-Nx/C increased monotonically in the mole ratio range of 1 : 2 - 1 : 6.

We have also estimated turnover frequencies per surface atom at various overpotentials and conclude that the activity enhancement for Ni–Mo relative to pure Ni is due to a combination of increased surface area and increased fundamental catalytic activity...|$|R
5000|$|Flowing {{electrolyte}} designs use a {{more open}} matrix that allows the electrolyte to flow either between the electrodes (parallel to the electrodes) or through the electrodes in a transverse direction (the ASK-type or EloFlux fuel cell). In parallel-flow electrolyte designs, the water produced is retained in the electrolyte, and old electrolyte may be exchanged for fresh, in a manner analogous to an oil change in a car. More space is required between electrodes to enable this flow, and this translates into an increase in cell resistance, decreasing power output compared to immobilized electrolyte designs. A further challenge for the technology is how severe the problem of permanent blocking of the cathode is by K2CO3; some published reports have indicated thousands of hours of operation on air. These designs have used both platinum and <b>non-noble</b> metal <b>catalysts,</b> resulting in increased efficiencies and increased cost.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRational {{development}} of efficient photocatalytic systems for hydrogen production requires understanding the catalytic mechanism and {{detailed information about}} the structure of intermediates in the catalytic cycle. We demonstrate how time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy in the microsecond time range {{can be used to}} identify such intermediates and to determine their local geometric structure. This method was used to obtain the solution structure of the Co(I) intermediate of cobaloxime, which is a <b>non-noble</b> metal <b>catalyst</b> for solar hydrogen production from water. Distances between cobalt and the nearest ligands including two solvent molecules and displacement of the cobalt atom out of plane formed by the planar ligands have been determined. Combining in situ X-ray absorption and UV/Vis data, we demonstrate how slight modification of the catalyst structure can lead to the formation of a catalytically inactive Co(I) state under similar conditions. Possible deactivation mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Non-noble</b> metal Ni/NaX <b>catalyst</b> was {{prepared}} {{and used in}} the hydrogenolysis of aqueous glycerol. Characterization by XRD, SAED, H(2) chemisorption, ICP and NH(3) -TPD techniques disclosed that the proper strong acid sites {{were responsible for the}} high activity and selectivity. Over Ni/NaX catalyst, conversion of glycerol reached 86. 6 % with 94. 6 % selectivity to glycols including 1, 2 -proplyene glycol and ethylene glycol under 6. 0 MPa H(2) pressure at 200 A degrees C after 10 h reaction. Additionally, the effects of time, temperature, and H(2) pressure were investigated in detail...|$|R
30|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an effective}} wet-chemical approach to achieve spherical hollow microstructures of assembled 2 D Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes and Ni-MOF nanoflakes. This approach leads to favorable Ni/Co-MOF nanoflake spherical microstructures with many exposed active sites. When applied in supercapacitors and the ORR, the Ni/Co-MOF exhibits remarkable performances {{with a specific}} capacitance of 530.4  F g− 1 at 0.5  A g− 1 (higher than that of Ni-MOF (306.8  F g− 1) and ZIF- 67 (168.3  F g− 1)), good rate capability, and robust cycling performance with no capacity fading after 2000 cycles. Besides, Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes {{can be used as}} an advanced <b>non-noble</b> metal <b>catalyst</b> for the ORR with its excellent oxygen reduction catalytic activity, good durability, and good methanol tolerance. Taking their robust electrochemical performance in supercapacitors and ORR into account, our work provides a new concept to design and synthesize rationally tunable structures of 2 D MOF nanoflakes to improve the electrochemical performance for energy storage and conversion.|$|R
