40|$|An <b>event</b> <b>coded</b> {{configurable}} {{analog circuit}} block {{that forms the}} building block of a programmable analog array is presented. The de- sign of the event block is inspired from the behavior of biological neurons that process signals in analog domain and transmit them as spike events. In the configurable event block implemented here, no events are trans- mitted when the signals are relatively constant thereby leading to lower energy dissipation and better utilization of resources in analog arrays. The block diagram and the circuit schematics of the <b>event</b> <b>coded</b> configurable analog block are described.

40|$|In logical {{theories}} of change {{it is common}} to consider two types of objects that provoke change: 1) actions that are carried out by agents, and 2) events which occur externally, without agent intervention. In this paper we argue for the existence of a special type of event, which we call <b>natural</b> <b>events.</b> An <b>event</b> is called <b>natural</b> if its occurrence {{is the result of a}} natural process. For example, if a ball is dropped it is natural that it hits the ground. Thus, the event of the ball hitting the ground is considered <b>natural.</b> A <b>natural</b> <b>event</b> can be prevented by actions or events that intervene and change the nature of the process leading to the event. If no such intervening events occur, then the <b>natural</b> <b>event</b> has to occur. Hence, this third type of "change provoking" entity, the <b>natural</b> <b>event,</b> may be the result of some agent's prior action(s). Thus, in general, <b>natural</b> <b>events</b> need not be external. In this paper, we discuss the need to introduce explicitly the notion [...] ...|$|R

At present, computer generated displays present simplified approximations of the dynamics in <b>natural</b> <b>events.</b> Very little is known about how the differences between <b>natural</b> <b>events</b> and computer simulations influence perceptual processing.

40|$|Objectives : The aims of {{this study}} were to develop {{reportable}} <b>event</b> <b>codes</b> that are applicable to the national hemovigilance systems for hospital blood banks, and to present expansion strategies for the blood banks. Materials and Methods : The data were obtained from a literature review and expert consultation, followed by adding to and revising the established hemovigilance code system and guidelines to develop reportable <b>event</b> <b>codes</b> for hospital blood banks. The Medical Error Reporting System-Transfusion Medicine developed in the US and other <b>codes</b> of reportable <b>events</b> were added to the Korean version of the Biologic Products Deviation Report (BPDR) developed by the Korean Red Cross Blood Safety Administration, then using these codes, mapping work was conducted. We deduced outcomes suitable for practice, referred to the results of the advisory councils, and conducted a survey with experts and blood banks practitioners. Results : We developed reportable <b>event</b> <b>codes</b> that were applicable to hospital blood banks and could cover blood safety - from blood product safety to blood transfusion safety - and also presented expansion strategies for hospital blood banks. Conclusion : It was necessary to add 10 major categories to the blood transfusion safety stage and 97 reportable <b>event</b> <b>codes</b> to the blood safety stage.
