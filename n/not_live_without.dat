25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>without</b> the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

5000|$|Noyce wrote widely, penning {{not just}} books, poems and {{scholarly}} articles, but also contributing to climbing guidebooks. His Scholar Mountaineers {{was a study}} of twelve writers and thinkers who had an association with mountains; these were Dante, Petrarch, Rousseau, Ferdinand de Saussure, Goethe, Wordsworth, Keats, Ruskin, Leslie Stephen, Nietzsche, Pope Pius XI and Robert Falcon Scott. In the introduction Noyce says that he chose these figures because: ... each has made his particular contribution to a certain feeling in us, a feeling which would not be quite the same had these men <b>not</b> <b>lived.</b> <b>Without</b> their example, our appreciation and exertions among hills would be the weaker.|$|R
500|$|Let {{the object}} of affection be {{snatched}} away by death, and how is all the pain ever inflicted upon them avenged! The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, {{now that they are}} forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ... How did I feel this when my daughter, Allegra, died! While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it appeared to me as if I could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>without</b> her.|$|E

Many {{settlements}} were situated along the White Volta river which runs {{all the way through}} Ghana, from north to south, eventually dumping into the Atlantic. Other settlements, such as the rock shelters of southwestern Ghana and southeastern Côte d'Ivoire were along near the Atlantic coast. [...] They also kept domesticated dogs and goats and cattle.|$|E
2500|$|Fisher told {{a hunting}} mate {{that he was}} {{renewing}} his commitment to his faith and marriage because he [...] "could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>without</b> his family", possibly hinting that he would consider suicide over divorce. According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss {{is not unusual for}} an individual traumatized by divorce while an adolescent. In the weeks before her death, Mary told several friends {{that she was going to}} divorce Fisher. According to a neighbor of theirs, they had a loud argument on April 9, at 10:30pm, approximately ten hours before their house blew up in an explosion.|$|E

If you gave her half of all that is coming to you, of course I must remain here because you could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> here <b>without</b> me. Your income would be quite insufficient.

2500|$|Controversy arose over why Koestler allowed, consented to, or (according to some critics) {{compelled}} his wife's simultaneous suicide. She {{was only}} fifty-five {{years old and}} {{was believed to be}} in good health. In a typewritten addition to her husband's suicide note Cynthia Koestler wrote that she could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>without</b> her husband. Reportedly, few of their friends were surprised by this admission, apparently perceiving that Cynthia lived her life through her husband and that she had no [...] "life of her own". Her absolute devotion to Koestler can be seen clearly in her partially completed memoirs. Yet according to a profile of Koestler by Peter Kurth: ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>without</b> them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.|$|E
2500|$|When Britain and France {{went to war}} in 1793, the U.S. {{was caught}} in the middle. The 1778 treaty of {{alliance}} with France was still in effect, yet most of the new country's trade was with Britain. War with Britain became imminent in 1794, after the British seized hundreds of American ships that were trading with French colonies. Madison believed that the United States was stronger than Britain, and that a trade war with Britain, although risking a real war by that government, would probably succeed, and allow Americans to assert their independence fully. Great Britain, he charged, [...] "has bound us in commercial manacles, and very nearly defeated the object of our independence." [...] According to Varg, Madison discounted the more powerful British military when the latter declared [...] "her interests can be wounded almost mortally, while ours are invulnerable." [...] The British West Indies, Madison maintained, could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>without</b> American foodstuffs, but Americans could easily do without British manufactures. He concluded, [...] "it is in our power, in a very short time, to supply all the tonnage necessary for our own commerce". Washington avoided a trade war and instead secured friendly trade relations with Britain through the Jay Treaty of 1794. Madison's harsh and unsuccessful opposition to the treaty led to a permanent break with Washington, ending a long friendship. The debate over the Jay Treaty would serve as the catalyst for the creation of the country's first political parties.|$|E

60|$|I {{was afraid}} of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> there <b>without</b> baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I {{contrived}} to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other services, which fire was wanting for at home, without danger or smoke.|$|R

60|$|Now these Christians, weak-kneed some of them, {{began to}} murmur, {{especially}} those who, having {{passed through a}} similar experience in their youth, remembered what starvation meant in that country. Religion, they reflected, was all very well, but without mealies they could <b>not</b> <b>live,</b> and <b>without</b> Kaffir corn {{there would be no}} beer. Indeed, metaphorically, before long they passed from murmurs to shouting, and their shouts said this: Menzi must be invited to celebrate a rain-service in his own fashion {{for the benefit of the}} entire tribe.|$|R

60|$|Two {{more days}} passed. We had {{advanced}} a little way--a very little way--into the larger {{space of the}} Gulf of Siam. Seizing eagerly upon the elation of the first command thrown into my lap, by the agency of Captain Giles, I had yet an uneasy feeling that such luck as this has got perhaps {{to be paid for}} in some way. I had held, professionally, a review of my chances. I was competent enough for that. At least, I thought so. I had a general sense of my preparedness which only a man pursuing a calling he loves can know. That feeling seemed to me the most natural thing in the world. As natural as breathing. I imagined I could <b>not</b> have <b>lived</b> <b>without</b> it.|$|R

Do not in any way dissipate your noble nature! Do not give up your birthright! ...|$|R
