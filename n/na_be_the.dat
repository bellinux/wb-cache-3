30|$|The {{simulation}} {{result for}} the Far traffic case in Fig.  11 illustrates that ANASS increases while CT-H decreases. The {{reason is that}} a lower CT-H value is easier to reach. For example, consider {{a situation in which}} there are six active Spine switches in the network and a Leaf switch has five links with utilization higher than FUT-H. In this situation, if CT-H is 90  %, the given number Na is six, and Na is five if CT-H is 80  %. That means that when CT-H is 80  %, GSSMS sets the timer for activating a Spine switch ON; when CT-H is 90  %, the timer for activating a Spine switch is still OFF. Figure  11 shows that the performance for Half-Far/Half-Near traffic is not very sensitive to CT-H. The reason is that the number of active Spine switches is too small which makes <b>Na</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same when CT-H has different values.|$|E

For an operad O in Ab, let A be a simplicial O-algebra such that Am is generated as an O-ideal by (∑i= 0 m− 1 si(Am− 1)), for m> 1, and let <b>NA</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Moore complex of A. Thend(NmA) =∑Iγ(Op⊗⋂i∈I 1 kerdi⊗⋯⊗⋂i∈Ipkerdi) where the sum runs over those partitions of [m− 1], I=(I 1,…,Ip), p≥ 1, and γ is the action of O on A. B. Let G be a simplicial group with Moore complex NG in which Gn is generated as a normal subgroup by the degenerate elements in dimension n> 1, then d(NnG) =∏I,J[⋂i∈Ikerdi,⋂j∈Jkerdj], for I,J⊆[n− 1] with I∪J=[n− 1]. In both cases, di is the i-th face of the corresponding simplicial object. The former result completes and generalizes results from Akça and Arvasi [I. Akça, Z. Arvasi, Simplicial and crossed Lie algebras, Homology Homotopy Appl. 4 (1) (2002) 43 – 57], and Arvasi and Porter [Z. Arvasi, T. Porter, Higher dimensional Peiffer elements in simplicial commutative algebras, Theory Appl. Categ. 3 (1) (1997) 1 – 23]; the latter completes a result from Mutlu and Porter [A. Mutlu, T. Porter, Applications of Peiffer pairings in the Moore complex of a simplicial group, Theory Appl. Categ. 4 (7) (1998) 148 – 173]. Our approach to the problem is different from that of the cited works. We have first succeeded with a proof for the case of algebras over an operad by introducing a different description of the inverse of the normalization functor N:AbΔop→Ch≥ 0. For the case of simplicial groups, we have then adapted the construction for the inverse equivalence used for algebras to get a simplicial group NG⊠Λ from the Moore complex NG of a simplicial group G. This construction could be of interest in itself...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Generalizing a {{previous}} one-variable “interlace polynomial”, we consider a new interlace polynomial in two variables. The polynomial can be computed in {{two very different}} ways. The first is an expansion analogous to the state space expansion of the Tutte polynomial; the differences are that our expansion is over vertex rather than edge subsets, the rank of the subset appears positively rather than subtracted from the rank of the whole, and the rank and nullity are taken over F 2 rather than R. The second computation is by a three-term reduction formula involving a graph pivot; the pivot arose previously {{in the study of}} interlacement and Euler circuits in four-regular graphs. We consider a few properties and specializations of the two-variable interlace polynomial. One specialization, the “vertex-nullity polynomial”, is the earlier one-variable interlace polynomial. Another, the “vertex-rank polynomial”, is also interesting. Yet another specialization of the two-variable polynomial is the partition function for independent sets in a graph. 1. The polynomial Given a graph G with vertex set V (G), for any subset S ⊂ V (G), let G[S] be the subgraph of G induced by S. Somewhat unconventionally, we shall allow the null graph with no vertices, writing G for the set of graphs including the null graph. In particular, if S is the empty set then G[S] is the null graph of rank and nullity 0. For a matrix A over F 2, let <b>n(A)</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> nullity of A and r(A) its rank. Abusing notation slightly, for a graph G, n(G) and r(G) will denote the nullity and rank of its adjacency matrix. It is a fact from linear algebra that for a symmetric matrix A over F 2 with zero diagonal, r(A) is always even. We are ready to define our two-variable interlace polynomial q(G; x, y) of a graph G of order n as a sum of 2 n terms: q(G; x, y) =...|$|E
