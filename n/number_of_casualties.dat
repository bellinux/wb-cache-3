5|$|During the Battle of Gettysburg, the {{regiment}} suffered 15 killed and 25 wounded or 60 percent. In terms of percentages, this represented {{the regiment}}'s highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> {{in an individual}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the total}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 60 million {{people died in the}} war, {{including}} about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.|$|E
5|$|July 12, 1842– Several {{ships are}} lost and many houses are wrecked when a severe {{hurricane}} crosses the entire coastline, {{resulting in an}} unknown <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|E
50|$|A section {{abstract}} predicted <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> due to cancer, {{however the}} section {{did not contain}} any discussion to support these numbers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> vary {{depending}} on the source some give total numbers as high as 130 with up to 80-100 civilians killed.|$|R
5|$|North and South Korean forces {{suffered}} {{heavily in}} the battle, each side inflicted large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> on one another. The exact <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> are impossible to determine. Both sides {{are known to have}} suffered heavily. Following the counterattack at Inchon, the North Korean units in the sector fled back North, {{no more than a few}} thousand troops from the NK 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea. US Casualties, in the meantime, were relatively light.|$|R
5|$|The high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> was a {{consequence}} of the wooden construction of the building, the poorly marked escape routes and the shortage of safety equipment.|$|E
5|$|Accounts vary {{as to the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties,</b> but {{the most}} {{reliable}} evidence suggests that Jordan lost four killed, ten to twelve wounded, and 355 captured—about 100 escaped. After the battle, Morgan counted eleven dead and forty wounded among the raiders, plus one killed while advancing on the town. Additionally, three civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties.</b> Though some projectiles buried {{themselves in the}} soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.|$|E
50|$|The 40th New York {{also had}} the 2nd highest <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> <b>of</b> any New York Regiment, behind the famous 69th New York Infantry of the Irish Brigade.|$|R
50|$|An Emergency Hospital Service was {{established}} {{at the beginning of}} the war, in the expectation that it would be required to deal with large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many folklore, songs, {{historical}} fictions {{and stories}} originated from the event. Due to large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualty,</b> in Halar region, the word Bhuchar Mori became almost {{synonymous with the}} massacre.|$|R
5|$|The exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> {{sustained}} by the ZNG, the police or the JNA has never been reported; in Zadar, 34 civilians were killed and 120 structures damaged by artillery fire during September and October 1991. A group of 19 JNA officers, including Perišić and Mladić, were tried in absentia and convicted by a Croatian court for war crimes against the civilian population.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{across the}} Carpathians {{was stopped by}} {{the invasion of the}} Mongols that lasted from March 31, 1241 to April, 1242. It was a major watershed in the medieval history of the region: although the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> is disputed, even the most prudent estimates do not go below 15percent of the total population.|$|E
5|$|Aside from rubber collection, {{violence}} in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably Msiri's Yeke Kingdom, the Zande Federation, and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under Tippu Tip, refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the Force Publique with great brutality, during the Congo Arab war. In 1895, a military mutiny broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused a great <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nail {{bombs are}} often used by terrorists, {{including}} suicide bombers, since they cause larger <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> when detonated in crowded places. Nail bombs can be detected by electromagnetic sensors and standard metal detectors.|$|R
5000|$|Grant had {{critics who}} {{complained about the}} high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> that the Union Army {{suffered}} {{while he was in}} charge, but Lincoln would not replace Grant, because, in Lincoln's words: [...] "I cannot spare this man. He fights." ...|$|R
5000|$|Enthusiasm faded {{with the}} {{enormous}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties,</b> the dwindling supply of manpower, the mounting difficulties on the homefront, and the never-ending flow <b>of</b> <b>casualty</b> reports. A grimmer and grimmer attitude began to prevail amongst the general population. The highlight {{only was the}} first use of mustard gas in warfare, in the Battle of Ypres.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> will hopefully be decreased.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the campaign, about 600 men from the regiment– including a batch of reinforcements that arrived in early October– carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December. They did not take part in any large-scale battles, but were involved in fighting off a number of sharp attacks. The exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed in this time.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> CPC <b>casualties</b> was 133,000.|$|R

50|$|An Australian {{standard}} code {{used to describe}} any outside of the hospital incident such as loss of power, communications, a natural disaster (such as flood or bushfire) that threatens to overwhelm or disrupt a hospital or health service capability with large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|R
5|$|The human toll of the Battle of Malvern Hill and the Seven Days Battles {{was shown}} clearly as both capitals, Washington and Richmond, set up {{numerous}} provisional hospitals {{to care for}} the dead, wounded and missing. Ships sailed from the Peninsula to Washington carrying the wounded. Richmond was nearest to the battlefields of the Seven Days, and the immense <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> overwhelmed hospitals and doctors. People from about the Confederacy descended upon Richmond {{to care for the}} conflict's casualties. Graves could not be dug quickly enough.|$|E
5|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> of {{the sinking}} is unclear, {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635people. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.|$|E
5|$|With Wolfe {{dead and}} several other key {{officers}} injured, British troops fell into a disorganised pursuit of the retreating French troops. The 78th Fraser Highlanders were ordered by Brigadier-General James Murray to pursue the French with their swords, but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a floating battery covering the bridge over the St. Charles River as well as militia that remained in the trees. The 78th took the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> of all British units in the battle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Numbers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>casualties</b> in the {{conflict}} vary widely.|$|R
25|$|The German Army Group North buried 1,709 men in Estonia between 24 July and 10 August 1944. Added {{to the men}} {{missing in}} action, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{irrecoverable}} <b>casualties</b> in the period is approximately 2,500. Accounting the standard ratio 1:4 <b>of</b> irrecoverable <b>casualties</b> to wounded, the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> German <b>casualties</b> in the Battle for Tannenberg Line is approximately 10,000 men.|$|R
50|$|Yahara {{disagreed}} with this recommendation, but {{went along with}} it. But {{when it was clear}} that Cho’s samurai-charge methods were not working, but, rather, causing huge <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> among the Japanese infantry, along with loss of territory, Cho relented and allowed Yahara to continue to make tactical and operational decisions.|$|R
5|$|A {{brief period}} of {{inactivity}} followed before the advance continued. On 26 July, {{as a result of}} the casualties that they had suffered earlier in the month, the battalion was withdrawn from the fighting and moved to the rear. Although they undertook security duties, they did not see action again before the war ended on 15 August 1945. During the fighting around Balikpapan the 2/31st Battalion suffered the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> of any Allied unit deployed in the Borneo campaign, losing 44 men killed and 134 wounded.|$|E
5|$|A {{short while}} later a German {{armoured}} column was seen advancing from Oudna, and Frost decided {{to set an}} ambush to try to destroy it; the leading elements of the column, however, surprised a group of paratroopers filling water bottles at a nearby well, the ambush was sprung too early, inflicting only a single casualty. The battalion was understrength, having taken casualties at Oudna, and was running low on ammunition, but it managed to drive off the column with mortar fire; however, this was only a brief respite. Two armoured cars and a tank was seen to be moving towards the battalion from a different direction, reportedly sporting recognition signals of British First Army; Frost sent a party out to greet the vehicles, only {{for them to be}} taken prisoner and it to be revealed that the vehicles were German with captured equipment. The German commander sent one of the captured paratroopers with a message demanding Frost surrender, but he refused to comply; instead he ordered that the radios and mortars were to be destroyed and the battalion would evacuate westwards towards Allied lines, approximately fifty miles away. The battalion managed to withdraw to higher ground, but suffered a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> from the German armour as it did so. Now positioned on the high ground, which consisted of a ridge crowned by two small hills, the paratroopers were attacked by tanks and infantry supported by heavy mortar fire. The battalion suffered a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> but was saved by the unexpected intervention of German aircraft; mistaking their troops for the paratroopers, they knocked out several tanks and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{a bronze}} {{memorial}} plaque, inscribed {{with the name}} of the deceased alongside Britannia and a lion, and a scroll, sent to the next of kin of those had died {{in the service of the}} British Empire. Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately after the end of the war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the failed}} {{uprising}} the Iraqi government organised a strict crackdown against potential opponents, with the Iraqi communist party claiming {{that up to}} 500 Iraqis detainees were subsequently executed in Basra. The Iraqi government never acknowledged the scale and extent of the uprising, and as such there are no exact <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 3-4, 1862 Burke {{personally}} led the Western Sharpshooters in {{two days}} of bitter skirmishes during the Second Battle of Corinth. After the battle Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans appointed Burke as Commandant of Corinth, responsible for securing the town, Confederate prisoners, stragglers, {{and dealing with the}} large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> from both armies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the monthly}} datasets, {{including}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> traffic accidents, <b>casualties</b> and meteorological data, {{the relationship between}} the traffic accidents and meteorological conditions is studied. The results are as follows: (1) There are two peaks <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> traffic accidents, which are the saddle-shaped peak from Apr to Jun and the second peak in Oct respectively. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> traffic accidents in February is the least. The temporal distribution <b>of</b> the <b>casualty</b> is different from that of traffic accident. Most casualties happened in Jul. and the second in Apr. and Oct. The susceptibility of traffic accident and casualty in Hebei, Beijing and Tianjin decreased successionally from high to low. (2) A new result is obtained: in comparison with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> traffic accidents, the correlation between meteorological condition and casualty is higher. The main reason is that the adverse weather conditions always cause drivers fail to control the vehicle or to make right decision. Therefore, the accident causing casualty should be focused on while the monthly weather-related accident is discussed. (3) The correlation coefficient between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualty</b> and precipitation or relative humidity is significantly positive. Otherwise, the correlation coefficient between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>casualty</b> and visibility or pressure is significantly negative. 1...|$|R
