5000|$|Improved Sensitivity: In the past, {{lightning}} detectors, both inexpensive portable {{ones for}} use {{on the ground and}} expensive aircraft systems, detected low frequency radiation because at low frequencies the signals generated by cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning are stronger (have higher amplitude) and thus are easier to detect. However, RF noise is also stronger at low frequencies. To minimize RF <b>noise</b> <b>reception,</b> low-frequency sensors are operated at low sensitivity (signal reception threshold) and thus do not detect less intense lightning signals. This reduces the ability to detect lightning at longer distances since signal intensity decreases with the square of distance. It also reduces detection of intracloud (IC) flashes which generally are weaker than CG flashes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Molecular {{communication}} (MC) {{will enable}} the exchange of information among nanoscale devices. In this novel bioinspired communication paradigm, molecules are employed to encode, transmit and receive information. In the most general case, these molecules are propagated in the medium by means of free diffusion. An information theoretical analysis of diffusion-based MC is required {{to better understand the}} potential of this novel communication mechanism. The study and the modeling of the noise sources is of utmost importance for this analysis. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a mathematical study of the <b>noise</b> at the <b>reception</b> of the molecular information in a diffusion-based MC system when the ligand-binding reception is employed. The reference diffusion-based MC system for this analysis is the physical end-to-end model introduced in a previous work by the same authors, where the reception process is realized through ligandbinding chemical receptors. The <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> is modeled in this paper by following two different approaches, namely, through the ligand-receptor kinetics and through the stochastic chemical kinetics. The ligand-receptor kinetics allows to simulate the random perturbations in the chemical processes of the reception, while the stochastic chemical kinetics provides the tools to derive a closedform solution to the modeling of the <b>reception</b> <b>noise.</b> The ligand-receptor kinetics model is expressed through a block scheme, while the stochastic chemical kinetics results in the characterization of the <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> using stochastic differential equations. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the analytical formulation of the <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> in terms of stochastic chemical kinetics is compliant with the <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> behavior resulting from the ligand-receptor kinetics simulations.

40|$|Smart antennas have {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over conventional omnidirectional antennas. Unlike more traditional antennas, smart antennas are capable of directing their transmissions towards the intended recipient, while limiting the amount of signal transmitted on other directions [1]. This can significantly reduce <b>noise</b> <b>reception,</b> allowing lower transmission power to be used, which obviously reduces power consumption, a critical factor when dealing with mobile computing workstations running off battery power. Heavily utilised frequency spectrum can be more easily reused thanks to the spatial diversity introduced through the use of such smart antennas, and directed data transmission makes cracking into wireless networks or sniffing packets to steal information much more difficult. Work has been carried out to design, construct, integrate and test a complete beam steering control system for the dielectric embedded smart mobile terminal antenna (DE-SMTA). The DE-SMTA consists of a central driven element surrounded by a ring of six passive elements mounted on a circular ground plane and attached to a conductive ground skirt.

40|$|An {{infrared}} (IR) {{wireless network}} standard called Advanced Infrared (AIr) was proposed in April 1997. The new standard provides a dynamic tradeoff between bit rate and transmission range by employing four-slot pulse-position modulation with variable-rate repetition coding. At the media-access control (MAC) layer, carrier-sensing multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is uti-lized. To prevent collisions {{in case of}} hidden terminals, request-to-send and clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) packets are exchanged to reserve the channel. To insure that RTS/CTS exchange works reliably, {{it is necessary to}} maintain reciprocity, which means that the signal-to-noise ratio is symmetric between each pair of transceivers. In practice, however, reciprocity can be violated, due to poor transceiver design, manufacturing tolerances, or ambient light noise. We use a layered simulation approach to investigate the impact of non-reciprocity on the performance of IR wireless LANs. A physical-layer simulator models signal and <b>noise</b> <b>reception,</b> yielding values of the signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio in each receiver.

Despite existing <b>noise</b> <b>reception</b> items, the continuing growth of traffic causes higher levels than the lims allow.

Road traffic noise emission has been measured at two sites in the Netherlands in order to obtain operational and statistical data during a 24 -hour period. These measurements allowed to determine the contribution of various vehicle groups to the L DEN and to examine these in more detail. The results confirm that at some motorway locations, heavy trucks can have a dominant contribution to he L DEN. It was also found that not only tyre noise but also powertrain noise from the exhaust, engine and transmission can contribute significantly at around 80 km/h.

For this purpose, the consequences of different reception limit values for the new Dutch noise legislation have been studied, {{both in terms of}} effects on the population and regarding sustainable energy policy targets. On the basis of a nation-wide noise map containing all wind turbines in The Netherlands, it is calculated that 3 % of the inhabitants of The Netherlands are currently exposed to noise from wind turbines above 28 dB(A) at the faηade.

Design: Prospective study of 10 adult experienced unilateral CI users with bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss. Speech in <b>noise</b> <b>reception</b> (SNR) and sound localization were measured with and without the additional CROS device. SNR was measured by applying speech signals at the untreated/CROS side while noise signals came from the front (S 90 N 0). For S 0 N 90, signal sources were switched. Sound localization was measured in a 12 -loudspeaker full circle setup. To evaluate the subjective benefit, patients tried the device for 2 weeks at home, then filled out the abbreviated Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale {{as well as the}} Bern benefit in single-sided deafness questionnaires. Results: In the setting S 90 N 0, all patients showed a highly significant SNR improvement when wearing the additional CROS device (mean 6. 4 dB, p < 0. 001). In the unfavorable setting S 0 N 90, only a minor deterioration of speech understanding was noted (mean - 0. 66 dB, p = 0. 54). Sound localization did not improve substantially with CROS. In the two questionnaires, 12 of 14 items showed an improvement in mean values, but none of them was statistically significant.
