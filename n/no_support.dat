5|$|Establishment {{and support}} of cadet battalions and rifle clubs, with the caveat that no funding could be {{provided}} out of the Parliamentary grant in respect of any person {{under the age of}} sixteen. This caveat was a compromise introduced on the third reading of the bill; the Commons had provided that <b>no</b> <b>support</b> could be given for a person under sixteen at all, and the Lords wished to remove this restriction. The compromise was to state that <b>no</b> <b>support</b> could come from Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E

At the pope's request, Sigismund Báthory allowed Andrew's mother and Stephen's wife, along with their children, to move to Poland. Zamoyski, who strongly opposed Sigismund Báthory's anti-Ottoman policy, supported Andrew and Stephen.|$|E

Still a fugitive, Massino summoned Vitale, Louis Attanasio and James Tartaglione to his hideout and gave them the order. By this time, even though Rastelli was still officially head of the family, Massino was considered by most mobsters to be the family's street boss and field commander in all but name, as well as Rastelli's heir apparent. According to Vitale, Massino had Bonventre killed for giving him <b>no</b> <b>support</b> {{when he was in}} hiding.|$|E

5|$|After knifing {{another man}} during a fight, {{in an attack}} he claimed was {{triggered}} by the abuse he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison in 1969. That same year his children were taken into the care of the local authority. His wife Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, she received <b>no</b> <b>support</b> from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, David Smith moved in with the girl who became his second wife and won custody of his three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a lorry driver, Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.|$|E
5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite <b>no</b> <b>support</b> and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when they ran out of ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost <b>no</b> <b>support</b> outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with <b>no</b> <b>support</b> system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

Furthermore, a meta-analysis pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.|$|E

5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, {{there seems to be}} <b>no</b> <b>support</b> for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, who was also a royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were {{brought to the attention of}} King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{was running}} {{this time with}} Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina (the elder brother of {{candidate}} Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election). Hamilton now toured New England, again urging northern electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina. Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists to assert their non-support for Adams if there was <b>no</b> <b>support</b> for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president. Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast their votes for Pinckney and Jefferson, and {{would result in the}} former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is <b>no</b> <b>support</b> for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E
