5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1938, he batted [...]343 – behind only batting {{champion}} Jimmie Foxx's [...]349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm going to show 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last year I was overswinging and taking my eye of the ball. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players {{and by the end of}} it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|E

2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig {{was asked if}} he was going to make another Danzig record after Deth Red Sabaoth.

'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked [...] "poison" [...] or not'; for she had read several nice little {{histories}} about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it {{is almost certain to}} disagree with you, sooner or later.|$|E

60|$|Rosemary West, on her {{way home}} from a music lesson at Ingleside, turned aside to the hidden spring in Rainbow Valley. She had not been there all summer; the {{beautiful}} little spot had no longer any allurement for her. The spirit of her young lover never came to the tryst now; and the memories connected with John Meredith were too painful and poignant. But she had happened to glance backward up the valley and had seen Norman Douglas vaulting as airily as a stripling over the old stone dyke of the Bailey garden and thought {{he was on his way}} up the hill. If he overtook her she would have to walk home with him and she was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> So she slipped at once behind the maples of the spring, hoping he had not seen her and would pass on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, curiously enough, {{it is not}} so distant, now," [...] {{the other}} said. [...] "I was a pretty distant {{connection}} of his. He was childless; and the family, generally, don't seem to have been prolific. A good many of them died; and the result was that, the year before I left England, an uncle of mine succeeded to the title. He has no son, and my father was his next brother. My father died, two years ago; and the result is that, to my astonishment, I found that I was next heir to the title. They wanted me to leave the army, when my regiment was ordered out to India; but of course I was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> for my aunt may die, and my uncle marry again and have children. Besides, I was not going to leave, anyhow, just as the regiment was ordered abroad, and might see service.|$|E
60|$|I {{now call}} this stupid, but I have really no more right {{to blame the}} boy who was once I than I have to praise him, and I am {{certainly}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> In his day and place {{he did what he}} could in his own way; he had no true perspective of life, but I do not know that youth ever has that. Some strength came to him finally from the mere struggle, undirected and misdirected as it often was, and such mental fibre as he had was toughened by the prolonged stress. It could be said, of course, that the time apparently wasted in these effectless studies could have been well spent in deepening and widening a knowledge of English literature never yet too great, and I have often said this myself; but then, again, I am not sure that the studies were altogether effectless. I have sometimes thought that greater skill had come to my hand from them than it would have had without, and I have trusted that in making known to me the sources of so much English, my little Latin and less Greek have enabled me to use my own speech with a subtler sense of it than I should have had otherwise.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} writing songs, Walked said, [...] "As a writer, I really look for deep {{feelings}} inside myself to write about. You {{can learn how}} to write creatively with literature and study. You can even call it a craft as some writers do. It’s like a movie, if it isn’t something that is hitting you in a deep place and causing you to have emotions than its probably <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in other people. So, when I’m writing, the things that inspire me are real emotions." ...|$|E

5000|$|In November 2010, Bower denied {{speculation}} that Neighbours would be [...] "sexed up" [...] when it moves to Eleven in 2011.

50|$|The labor {{shortage}} {{may be due}} to {{the reluctance}} of younger generations to become scaffolders. “They even think that it’s a dirty and dangerous job. They are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> kind of work,” said Yu Hang Flord, who has been a scaffolder for 30 years and later became the director of Wui Fai Holdings, a member of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Scaffolders General Merchants Association. “They refuse to step in, although we give them high pay. They are scared of it. Young generations do not like jobs that involve hard work.” Another reason fewer people are becoming scaffolders is that new recruits need to undergo training with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council in order to acquire a license. Older scaffolders generally learned in apprenticeships, and may have been able to gather more hands-on experience.|$|E
5000|$|Mellencamp {{wrote one}} song {{specifically}} for Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel, {{which is the}} exact room where Johnson recorded in November 1936.
