Comedian Jack Benny, {{who once worked}} at Warner Bros., quipped, [...] "Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie". Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio's executive dining room, with the explanation, [...] "I don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> actors when I eat."

500|$|One of {{the first}} ideas Assis had for the film was to show the mons pubis of a {{waitress}} he knew. Though he was unsure how to include this element, the yellow-colored pubic hair matched the book Tempo Amarelo ("Yellow Time"), by sociologist Renato Carneiro Campos. The title of the film was borrowed from the book, in which the author describes the [...] "rotten teeth of children, the color of poverty in the country". Assis {{wanted to create a}} film to show [...] "the face of the Brazilian people. We are from the Third World and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> ourselves".|$|E

In the session, which started at 15:00 local time (...) on Saturday afternoon, Lewis Hamilton took the third out of three possible pole positions of the season, narrowly beating his teammate by 0.04 seconds. Nico Rosberg was frustrated about the result, lamenting that his team had put unnecessary pressure on him by telling him to go faster during his last warm-up lap, saying [...] "e <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that as that was not ideal to put me under pressure like that".|$|E
500|$|While {{earning his}} law degree at Widener University, Tierney founded Tierney & Company Public Relations in 1984, which he financed on his credit card. In 1986, {{he sold the}} company to Lewis Gilman & Kynett. Tierney stayed with Lewis Gilman & Kynett {{and by the time}} he turned twenty-nine he had become {{president}} and CEO of the public relations division. In 1989, he left Lewis Gilman & Kynett and founded Tierney Group, another public relations company, with just three people. One of those people remembers Tierney's saying [...] "We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what everyone else is charging and charge our clients $15 an hour more."

500|$|Many of {{the images}} connect back to his earlier works. The images of life as boat adrift with a leak {{is similar to the}} [...] "Death by Water" [...] section of The Waste Land. Like images about old age and {{experience}} found in East Coker, this image reinforces the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the whole of life and try to see things beyond the limitations of time. Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide the metaphorical sailors to their proper harbour. While connecting back to his earlier works, Eliot also connects back to his family's past; the [...] "Dry Salvages" [...] was part of the landscape his ancestor Andrew Eliott travelled to in 1669.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} writers and {{political}} commentators consider Berlusconi's political success a precedent for the 2016 election of real estate tycoon Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, with most noting Berlusconi's panned Prime Ministerial tenure and therefore making the comparison in dismay. Roger Cohen of The New York Times argued, [...] "Widely ridiculed, endlessly written about, long unscathed by his evident misogyny and diverse legal travails, Berlusconi proved a Teflon politician [...] Nobody who knows Berlusconi and has watched the rise and rise of Donald Trump can fail to be struck by the parallels."

2500|$|The current {{majority}} {{view of the}} Supreme Court supports substantive due process rights {{in a number of}} areas. An alternative to strict originalist theory is advocated by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the Court's supporters of substantive due process rights. Breyer believes the justices <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> cases in light of how their decisions will promote what he calls [...] "active liberty," [...] the Constitution's aim of promoting participation by citizens in the processes of government. That is an approach that ostensibly emphasizes [...] "the document's underlying values" [...] and a broad look at a law's purpose and consequences. Critics charge that such an approach would also give judges the ability to look very broadly at the consequences and unwritten purpose of constitutional provisions, such as the Due Process Clause, thus removing issues from the democratic process.|$|E

The Facilities Services Division spends about $182 million on its 849 consultants, almost $215,000 each. The division's regular employees are paid about $99,000 each. At the time, Senior Deputy Superintendent Ramon Cortines said that consultants may get the work done quickly and correctly, but said he is also concerned about the district's reliance on outside workers. [...] "We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, to reduce the number of consultants," [...] he said.
