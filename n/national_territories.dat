25|$|The 17th Party {{congress}} in 1934, proclaimed {{that the building}} of the material basis for a socialist society had succeeded. The Soviet Union first became an officially socialist society in 1936 when the new constitution was adopted. The new constitution stated that the many socialist nations had transformed on a voluntary basis into a harmonious union. According to the new constitution there were 11 socialist republics, 22 autonomous republics, nine autonomous regions and nine <b>national</b> <b>territories.</b> At the same time, administration was now greatly centralised. All the Republics were now harnessed to serve one common socialist state.|$|E

Dutch nationals {{were arrested and}} returned to the Netherlands, together with most of the broadcasting equipment. Non-Dutch staff were given the option of staying on the ship or returning to the Netherlands – most chose to stay on board. Caroline claimed boarding the ship and removal or destruction of equipment was piracy. The Dutch claimed the ship's Panamanian registration had lapsed in 1987 and it was not under legal protection from any country and that its transmissions breached international regulations which since 1982 had prohibited broadcasting from outside <b>national</b> <b>territories.</b> Several years later some of the seized items were returned to the station.|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} urbanization, {{the populations}} in China’s cities are growing, and the cities themselves are gradually expanding. Competition {{for access to}} the <b>national</b> <b>territory’s</b> resources is also growing. Thus, the quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use is worsening. Quality assessments on <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use can provide a basis for solving this issue. By combining the implications of new urbanization in China, we established an assessment index system relating to the quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use, from the perspective of harmoniously developing spaces for production, living and ecology. A subjective and objective integrated weighting method was developed based on principal component analysis and planning review. Then, a comprehensive discriminative model was established to assess the quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use. The evaluation results showed that harmonious development of spaces for production, living and ecology did not occur in either the ecology-oriented or production-oriented regions. The integrated quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use in the production-oriented region had a significant advantage over that of the ecology-oriented region. The integrated quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use was highest in Changzhou’s city center and vicinity. The results can support the implementation of China’s new urbanization strategy and provide evidence to improve the criteria for the intensive use of national territorial resources...|$|R

500|$|A primary agent used in {{stifling}} {{the local}} extreme nationalist elements was the Germanic SS, which initially merely consisted of local respective {{branches of the}} Allgemeine-SS in Belgium, Netherlands and Norway. These groups were at first {{under the authority of}} their respective pro-National Socialist national commanders (De Clercq, Mussert and Quisling), and were intended to function within their own <b>national</b> <b>territories</b> only. During the course of 1942, however, the Germanic SS was further transformed into a tool used by Himmler against the influence of the less extreme collaborating parties and their SA-style organizations, such as the Hird in Norway and the Weerbaarheidsafdeling in the Netherlands. In the post-war Germanic Empire, these men were to form the new leadership cadre of their respective <b>national</b> <b>territories.</b> To emphasize their pan-Germanic ideology, the Norges SS was now renamed the Germanske SS Norge, the Nederlandsche SS the Germaansche SS in Nederland and the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen the Germaansche SS in Vlaanderen.

[...] A second edition of the Index was published on July 4, 1551, in which the Portuguese censors expanded the list of works prohibited by the theologians of Leuven to include the books catalogued by the Swiss scholar Conrad Gesner in their Bibliotheca Universalis, in addition to other works, seven folios of Gil Vicente among them. This would be the first Portuguese Index to be created, and would be published in all <b>national</b> <b>territories</b> by the Inquisitors who had, according to Inquisition order, to take in and note all found books and report their owners to the Inquisition itself.|$|E

6000|$|Nor can we justifiably {{withhold}} this on any ground {{save our}} conviction that slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions against it are themselves wrong, {{and should be}} silenced and swept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality its universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its extension--its enlargement. All they ask we could readily grant if we thought slavery right; all we ask they could as readily grant, if they thought it wrong. Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it right, as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as being right; but thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them? Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own? In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?
