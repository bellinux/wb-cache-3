5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population could not be met.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique challenges for managing the area. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust, with other landowners, attempt to balance keeping the upland landscape accessible to visitors for recreation, whilst protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and pressure from visitors themselves. An inevitable tension exists between the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many {{millions of people who}} visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E

Additionally, the 283rd Engineer Detachment (Terrain Analysis) provided terrain intelligence <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brigade's mission.

5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E

Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.|$|E
