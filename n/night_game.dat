5|$|In 2005, Cope {{retired after}} 35 {{years as the}} Steelers radio announcer—the longest tenure of any {{broadcaster}} with a single team in NFL history. Cope was honored by the Steelers {{with the release of}} a limited special edition Towel, featuring his name and catch phrases.

Cope led the fans in a towel wave at half time; the Towel that Cope used is now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three seasons, Koufax {{was in and out}} of the Dodger {{starting}} rotation due to injuries. In 1958, he began 7–3, but sprained his ankle in a collision at first base, finishing the season at 11–11 and leading the NL in wild pitches. In June 1959, Koufax set the record for a <b>night</b> <b>game</b> with 16 strikeouts. On August 31, 1959, he surpassed his career high with 18 strikeouts, setting the NL record and tying Bob Feller's major league record for strikeouts in one game.|$|E

50|$|<b>Night</b> <b>Games</b> in Tiger StadiumThe {{tradition}} of playing <b>night</b> <b>games</b> in Tiger Stadium began on October 3, 1931 when LSU defeated Spring Hill 35-0. Several reasons were cited for playing at night such as avoiding {{the heat and}} humidity of afternoon games, avoiding scheduling conflicts with Tulane and Loyola football and giving more fans {{the opportunity to see}} the Tigers play. Attendance increased and night football became an LSU tradition. LSU has also traditionally played better during <b>night</b> <b>games</b> based on winning percentage.|$|R

5|$|In their ninth game, however, third-ranked Virginia Tech {{suffered}} {{its first}} loss. On a Thursday <b>night</b> <b>game</b> at home, the Hokies lost 277 to the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes. Normally, {{a loss to}} the division-rival Hurricanes would have knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, as Miami had the tie-breaking head-to-head victory and was expected to win the remainder of its games. But because Virginia Tech won {{the rest of its}} games and the Hurricanes lost two ACC contests, (Virginia Tech's only ACC loss was to Miami) the Hokies won the Coastal Division championship and qualified for the championship game over Miami.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1977, Sayers was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is still the youngest inductee in its history. On October 31, 1994, at halftime of a Monday <b>night</b> <b>game,</b> the Bears retired his number 40 at Soldier Field, along with number 51, which had been worn by teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee named Sayers to its NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, which comprised the best players of the 1960s at each position. In 1994, Sayers was selected for the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as both a halfback and a kickoff returner; he was the only player selected for multiple positions. In 1999, despite the brevity of his career, he was ranked 22nd on The Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.|$|E

Additionally, for the first time, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches and umpires) wore #42 for the day.

5|$|The {{two teams}} met for a Thursday <b>night</b> <b>game</b> at Blacksburg, {{a time and}} site where the Hokies have {{traditionally}} excelled. In the first quarter, Maryland drove 56yards, but was held to a 46-yard field goal attempt, which was missed by Obi Egekeze. In the next series, Tech quarterback Sean Glennon led the Hokies on an 80-yard drive that culminated in a short pass to Greg Boone for a score. The next series went into the second quarter, and Maryland was again forced to attempt a field goal, which was made good. Hokies tailback Darren Evans then broke away for a 50-yard carry to the Maryland 30-yard line, and later capped it with a one-yard rush into the endzone. Before the half, Tech managed a field goal to expand their lead, 17–3.|$|E
5|$|Atlético had {{its first}} home ground built in 1912 at Paraopeba Avenue, in {{downtown}} Belo Horizonte, {{across the street}} from América's first stadium. The club's main ground for most of its early years, however, was the Presidente Antônio Carlos stadium, which held 5,000 people; it was nicknamed Estádio de Lourdes for the quarter in which it was located. The Antônio Carlos {{was one of the first}} stadiums in Brazil to feature floodlights, and opened on 30 May 1929 with a friendly against Corinthians, won by Atlético 4–2. The following year, the stadium was visited by FIFA president Jules Rimet, who watched a <b>night</b> <b>game</b> for the first time. The stadium fell out of favour when the larger Independência was built in 1950, and remained largely unused by the first team; eventually it was sold by the club to the Belo Horizonte municipality in the 1960s. After decades of legal disputes with the municipal government, the property returned to the club in 1991. It was leased to a shopping mall in 1995, which was built in the following year where the stadium once was, {{across the street from}} Atlético's administrative headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Donning their throwback uniforms, the Steelers {{played the}} Baltimore Ravens {{in their first}} Monday <b>Night</b> <b>game</b> of the season. Multiple Steelers {{starters}} did not play in the game, due to various injuries. After a 3–3 first quarter, Baltimore took a ten-point lead into half time with a field goal and touchdown pass in the second quarter. Rashard Mendenhall—in his first NFL start—left {{the game in the}} third quarter with a season-ending shoulder injury. On Pittsburgh's third drive of the half, Roethlisberger connected with Santonio Holmes for a 38-yard touchdown pass. On the first play of Baltimore's ensuing drive, James Harrison's forced fumble was picked up by LaMarr Woodley and returned 7yards for a touchdown. The two touchdowns within 15seconds took the Steelers from ten points behind to four points ahead. In the final quarter, the Steelers' offense was stopped on the one yard line and Reed kicked his second field goal of the night. Baltimore drove 76yards and tied the game with a touchdown. Neither team was able to score on their final drive as the regulation clock expired.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina rose to No. 7 in the {{national}} college football polls, and the victory over Indiana was followed the next week by a 2817 win over No. 17 Stanford University. The two season-opening wins were followed by six more in succession. The Tar Heels beat Maryland, 4014, on September 20, and Virginia on September 27 by a score of 4820. Prior to the win against Virginia, North Carolina, rose from No. 7 to No. 5 in the polls, and remained at that level after the win. Texas Christian University fell 3110 to the Tar Heels on October 4, and Wake Forest lost to North Carolina, 3012, on October 11. After a week of inactivity, in which the Tar Heels rose to No. 4, North Carolina defeated in-state rival NC State by a score of 207, and after another week and a half, the Tar Heels beat Georgia Tech narrowly, 1613, in a Thursday <b>night</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October 25, Boston College {{traveled}} to Blacksburg, Virginia, home of Virginia Tech, for a Thursday <b>night</b> <b>game</b> broadcast on ESPN. In heavy rain, Virginia Tech's defense dominated {{for most of}} the game. As time ran down, however, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan orchestrated twolate-game touchdown drives, scoring 14points in the final 2minutes to win 1410. The victory seemingly sealed Boston College's route to a national championship game, while the loss potentially jeopardized Virginia Tech's chances of being selected to play in the ACC Championship Game. Over the next two weeks, however, Boston College was upset by Florida State and Maryland. The Eagles rallied to win their final two gamesagainst Miami and Clemsonto clinch the division title. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, was undefeated through the remainder of its schedule, including a division-clinching win over its archrival, Virginia. This meant that the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville would be a rematch between these two division champions.|$|E
5|$|Texas' win, by a {{score of}} 25–22, was the lowest scoring game Texas would {{experience}} all season, {{both in terms of}} points scored by Texas and total points. Fourth-ranked OSU became the highest-ranked non-conference opponent the Longhorns had ever beaten at an opponent's home stadium. The previous high came in 1983 when third-ranked Texas pulled off a 20–7 upset versus fifth-ranked Auburn. Texas became the first non-conference opponent to beat the Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1990, putting an end to a 36-game home victory string over non-conference opponents. The Longhorns also were the first team to beat the Buckeyes in a <b>night</b> <b>game</b> at The Horseshoe and it was UT's 10thstraight victory in a night-game road contest.

The next night the Phillies won, 7–4; Asche and Byrd had two RBIs each and the bullpen was solid. In the third game, Domonic Brown failed to catch a fly ball to left field; three runs scored in a 3–2 loss. The Phillies won the series' final game, 5–3, with a 14th-inning walk-off home run by Chase Utley. After the game, Carlos Ruiz {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with to a concussion sustained in the 11th inning. After the Phillies swept the Braves earlier in the month, the Braves returned the favor in the month's final series for both teams. In game one Kendrick returned to his old ways, allowing three runs in the first inning of a 4–2 loss. The next day, June 28, featured a day-night doubleheader. Hernandez started the afternoon game; two errors and six runs allowed by the bullpen led to a 10–3 loss. In the <b>night</b> <b>game,</b> the Phillies called up Sean O'Sullivan for his season debut and lost 5–1.

5|$|The {{start of}} Johnson's career at League One side Bradford City {{was marred by}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury in a pre-season friendly at Boston United which was expected {{to keep him out}} of the first month of the season. He recovered to make his debut in City's 2006–07 season's opening game at Nottingham Forest as a late substitute. Two weeks later he scored his first Bradford goals by netting twice against his former club Crewe in a 3–0 Bradford victory. Johnson struggled for goals at City, and had only scored another two {{by the time he was}} ruled out for a month after going off at half-time against Chesterfield on 16 December 2006 with a shin injury. He returned to the City team after a six-game absence for a Friday <b>night</b> <b>game</b> with Tranmere Rovers, which ended 1–1. He had a goal disallowed against Yeovil Town a week later for offside. Following a poor run of form, City manager Colin Todd was sacked, with his replacement David Wetherall converting Johnson from a striker to a midfielder after an injury to Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. However, City were relegated after a defeat to Chesterfield with Johnson finishing the season with just four goals.|$|E
