5|$|According to Jim Gaines, {{director}} of the Jesse H.

5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is <b>not</b> <b>well</b> understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale.

High chloride environments can even overcome and attack steel encased in normally protective concrete. Concrete does <b>not</b> survive <b>well</b> in high sulfate environments.

5|$|Benchley's return yielded {{two more}} short films, and his {{high-profile}} prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows, {{including the first}} television entertainment program ever broadcast, an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on the Empire State Building.
