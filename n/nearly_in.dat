The near complete skeleton was named Scelidotherium by Owen, who found it had most of its bones <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> their proper relative positions. At the nearby Monte Hermoso beds the numerous rodents included species allied to the Brazilian tuco-tuco and the capybara.|$|E
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E

25|$|Beach volleyball culture {{includes}} the people, language, fashion, and life surrounding {{the sport of}} modern beach volleyball. With its origins in Hawaii and California, beach volleyball is strongly associated with a casual, beach-centric lifestyle. As it developed <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> parallel with modern surfing, beach volleyball culture shares some similarities with surf culture. The beach bum archetype is one such example.|$|E

25|$|An {{eclipsing binary}} star is a binary star in which the orbit plane of the two stars lies so <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> the line {{of sight of the}} {{observer}} that the components undergo mutual eclipses. In the case where the binary is also a spectroscopic binary and the parallax of the system is known, the binary is quite valuable for stellar analysis. Algol is the best-known example of an eclipsing binary.|$|E
25|$|A {{selection}} algorithm {{chooses the}} kth smallest {{of a list}} of numbers; this is an easier problem in general than sorting. One simple but effective selection algorithm works <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> {{the same manner as}} quicksort, and is accordingly known as quickselect. The difference is that instead of making recursive calls on both sublists, it only makes a single tail-recursive call on the sublist that contains the desired element. This change lowers the average complexity to linear or O(n) time, which is optimal for selection, but the sorting algorithm is still O(n2).|$|E

25|$|After {{the release}} of the film Reds (1981), the star and {{director}} of the picture, Warren Beatty apologized for his Spanish film crew's use of tripwires on horses while filming a battle scene, when Beatty wasn't present. Tripwires were used against horses when Rambo III (1988) and The 13th Warrior (1999) were being filmed. An ox was sliced <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> half during production of Apocalypse Now (1979), while a donkey was bled to death for dramatic effect for the Danish film Manderlay (2005), in a scene later cut from the film.|$|E
25|$|Following France's {{loss in the}} French and Indian War, {{through the}} 1763 Treaty of Paris they ceded control of the land to the British. Colonial {{settlement}} was limited by the Crown to lands east of the Appalachians, {{in order to try}} to end encroachment on Native American lands. The territory of Vermont was divided <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> half in a jagged line running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog. With the end of the war, new settlers arrived in Vermont. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area.|$|E
25|$|The {{hurricane}} struck Texas, {{near the}} mouth of the Rio Grande, and devastated Brownsville, Matamoros, and Bagdad. Because of the devastating effects in these three, state authorities sought help from the governors of Nuevo León and Coahuila. The governor of Nuevo León authorized the state to send over 100 bushels of corn; Coahuila's sent 500 loads of flour. Relief was also sent from Veracruz in two vessels. Agriculturalists in Matamoros were allowed to send their goods to Monterrey for storage. The entire population of Bagdad fled, while Matamoros was left <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> ruins. The official death toll in the area was unknown, but local accounts stated there were at least 26 dead. Entire families disappeared from the area too.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Nepstad, a Senior Scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center {{which focuses}} on {{tackling}} two deforestation issues in Brazil has demonstrated that Brazil's deforestation rates have been cut <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> half in recent years {{through a combination of}} government intervention and economic trends. Since 2004 the country has established more than 200,000 square kilometres of parks, nature reserves, and national forests in the Amazon rainforest. These protected areas, if fully enforced, aim to prevent an estimated one billion tons of carbon from being transferred to the atmosphere through deforestation by the year 2015. The academic evidence suggests that the creation of public lands, through the assignment of property rights, reduces incentives to deforest land for agricultural conversion and has contributed to reduction in land related conflict.|$|E
25|$|An eclipse {{involving}} the Sun, Earth, and Moon can occur {{only when they}} are <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> a straight line, allowing one to be hidden behind another, viewed from the third. Because the orbital plane of the Moon is tilted {{with respect to the}} orbital plane of the Earth (the ecliptic), eclipses can occur only when the Moon is close to the intersection of these two planes (the nodes). The Sun, Earth and nodes are aligned twice a year (during an eclipse season), and eclipses can occur during a period of about two months around these times. There can be from four to seven eclipses in a calendar year, which repeat according to various eclipse cycles, such as a saros.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Griffin's {{division}} {{moved up}} to occupy the junction of the Quaker Road and Boydton Plank Road {{near the end of}} the Confederate White Oak Road Line. Late in the afternoon of March 29, 1865, Sheridan's cavalry occupied Dinwiddie Court House on the Boydton Plank Road without opposition. The Union forces had cut the Boydton Plank Road in two places and were close to the Confederate line and in a strong position to move a large force against both the Confederate right flank and the crucial road junction at Five Forks in Dinwiddie County to which Lee was just sending Pickett's mobile force defenders. The Union Army was <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> position to attack the two remaining Confederate railroad connections with Petersburg and Richmond, if they could take Five Forks.|$|E

We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E
25|$|With {{the seizure}} of Céret, Ricardos placed his army <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> the rear of Bellegarde. After {{receiving}} some reinforcements, he advanced farther to the northeast to the vicinity of Trouillas. At this location, the 7,000 Spanish troops were confronted by the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees led by General of Division Louis-Charles de Flers. At the Battle of Mas Deu on 19 May, Ricardos defeated de Flers {{with the loss of}} 150 killed, 280 wounded, plus three cannons and six ammunition wagons captured. The Spanish lost 34 killed and an unknown number of wounded. The demoralized French soldiers retreated north to the department capital of Perpignan, where a battalion of National Guard mutinied and had to be disbanded. Rather than press on, Ricardos turned back to besiege Bellegarde, which overlooked his main supply route back to Barcelona.|$|E
25|$|Copper-plated zinc, 1982–present. In mid-1982, the coin's {{composition}} {{was changed}} again, {{this time to}} copper-plated zinc. The last mostly-copper cents (95% copper metal composition) were produced by the Denver Mint on October 22, 1982. The copper-plated zinc cent coins are still being produced today. They are composed of an inner core alloy of 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper with an outer plating of pure copper, for an overall composition of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper, and are minted on blanks produced for the Mint by an outside manufacturer (Jarden Zinc Products). Except for the new lighter total coin weight of 2.5grams each, these newer coins are identical in diameter and thickness, and <b>nearly</b> <b>in</b> appearance, to the mostly copper (95%) cents issued before mid-1982, which weighed 3.11grams each.
