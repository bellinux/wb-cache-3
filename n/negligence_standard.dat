40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case where}} adequate <b>negligence</b> <b>standards</b> cannot be defined because actions of defendants before an accident are imperfectly observable. Negligence-based liability rules, which are often considered as the only efficient liability rule {{in the presence of}} multiple tortfeasors, are not feasible in this environment. We propose an insurance-based liability rule as a remedy: Damages are apportioned according to the insurance policies of the defendants. The adjudication is made dependent on the requirement that the injurers have taken out insurance coverage setting the right incentives. The liability rule is easy to characterize, efficient, and avoids the use of punitive damages. Insurance-based liability could also be helpful to mitigate the problem of unobservable avoidance costs...|$|R

2500|$|Traditionally, {{common law}} used {{to allow a}} claim from anybody who had money, but had lost it or had been {{deprived}} of it, from {{a person who had}} received the money without payment, as of right. This action for [...] "money had and received" [...] was, however, limited to money, and was said to be limited to money in physical form. In equity, an action could be brought for return of any property that could be traced, but the courts said liability was limited to people who in some sense had [...] "knowledge" [...] of a breach of trust. In 2001, the Court of Appeal in Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele stated that the touchstone of liability is that a defendant acted [...] "unconscionably". In that case, Akindele, a Nigerian businessman, was sued by the liquidators of the disgraced and insolvent bank, BCCI to return over $6.6m. Akindele said he received this payment, so far as he knew, as part of a legitimate fixed return deal, when in fact BCCI was engaging in a fraudulent scheme to buy its own shares, and thus inflate its share price. Nourse LJ held that on these facts, Akindele had done nothing [...] "unconscionable" [...] and was not liable to return the money. In other cases, however, it is apparent that the standard has been less lenient, and set at negligence. In 1980 in Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd Goff LJ held that if one [...] "ought to know, that it was a breach of trust" [...] when property is received then liability will follow. Accordingly, different courts have differed on the requisite threshold of liability. Some have thought liability for receipt should be limited to [...] "wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make", while others have favoured a simple <b>negligence</b> <b>standard,</b> when a breach of trust would have been obvious to an honest, reasonable person. The latter view is consistent with an unjust enrichment analysis, favoured by the late Peter Birks and Lord Nicholls in extrajudicial writing. This favours strict liability upon receipt of any property, unless it is paid for. If the recipient is not a bona fide purchaser, they must make restitution of the property to the former owner to avoid unjust enrichment. This was an approach adopted by the House of Lords in Re Diplock. However, unlike Re Diplock the modern unjust enrichment analysis would allow a defence, if the recipient had changed her position, for instance by spending money that would not otherwise have been spent, a defence recognised in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale. This approach ends by suggesting that even if the property is paid for, yet the recipient ought to have known that it came from a breach of trust, they will be deemed to have committed an equitable wrong (i.e. like a tort) and must restore the property to the previous owner anyway. It {{remains to be seen whether}} equity's understanding of conscience will align with the standard test for the duty of care in tort.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} optimal <b>negligence</b> <b>standards</b> {{when only}} one of two (future) parties will be informed of the standards. When the informed party is the injurer and acts first, the simple negligence rule is optimal, and under certain conditions, the first best standard of due care is optimal. The informed party will {{have an incentive to}} comply with the standard due to the discontinuity of the negligence rule, whereas the uninformed party may infer this and hence also take appropriate precautions. In general, the optimal policy for the court depends on who acts first and on who the injurer is. Thus, optimal rules are contributory negligence when the informed party is the victim and acts first, no liability when the uninformed party is the injurer and acts first, and strict liability without contributory negligence when the uninformed party is the victim and acts first.

40|$|We analyze {{factors in}} states' {{decisions}} to switch their approaches to hazardous waste liability policy from <b>negligence</b> <b>standards</b> to policies based on strict liability. Many, but not all, states have switched in recent years. We explain {{differences in the}} timing of states' adoption of strict liability into their "mini-superfund" programs using data on states' industrial activities, environmental programs, wealth and education, and political orientation. We test implications of a theoretical model in which states adopt the liability regime (strict versus negligence-based liability) that they see as having greater net benefits. We test this model by estimating a probit equation of {{the presence or absence}} of strict liability in a state hazardous waste cleanup program. We find that the likelihood of a state adopting strict liability is positively associated with the number of large manufacturing plants located in that state, but negatively associated with the number of large mining establishments. We also find that educational attainment of residents, state government resources, effectiveness of other state environmental programs, and political variables are significant determinants of the likelihood of strict liability adoption. Our findings suggest states may view strict liability as better suited to industrial waste sites than to mining pollution, that they may be partly motivated by a "deep pocket" mentality, or that they may anticipate engaging in "precaution targeting" (T. H. Tietenberg, 1989, Land Economics 65 : 4, 305 - 319). Non-adopters may have fewer resources available to confront environmental problems, may not wish to discourage business activity, or may have other programs in place which effectively substitute (at least for a time) for strict liability imposed on parties responsible for hazardous waste releases. ...|$|R

40|$|Judicial {{inconsistencies}} in balancing costs against benefits in legal determinations, {{sometimes referred to}} as the Learned Hand Formula, indicate that the implications are not fully understood. The incorporation of more formal economic cost-benefit analysis by some courts has only served to increase the confusion and wariness about fostering such guidelines for social behavior. This article 2 ̆ 7 s purpose is threefold. One is to demonstrate how the use of cost-benefit analysis necessarily imparts the moral and/or political values of the user into his or her decisions. While the cost-benefit technique is itself value-neutral, its application, as will be shown, requires that some moral choice be made for the cost-benefit implementation. Though the very existence of an underlying value-choice is often obscured by scholars 2 ̆ 7 and judges 2 ̆ 7 presentations of “objective” cost-benefit conclusions (whether deliberately or naively so), the value choices are in fact there and should be elucidated and discussed. The second goal of this article, therefore, is to shed sufficient light on the dimensions of using cost-benefit reasoning so that the reader, whether or not in support of a particular application, can venture knowledgeably into a debate of the value choices attending any cost-benefit argument that might arise. The third {{purpose of this article is}} to demonstrate that cost-benefit reasoning as an adjudicatory process is one that grows naturally out of legal jurisprudence and is not merely an intrusion by another social discipline. Because of the furor created by a particular brand of cost-benefit reasoning (primarily by the adherents of the Chicago School), cost-benefit analysis is often viewed as a callous derivative of economic theory insensitive to our notions of fairness and equity, rather than the tool it can be for facilitating existing constitutional values and mores. Parts II and III cover a more detailed history of <b>negligence</b> <b>standards</b> showing the evolution from the avoidable accident approach to one of weighing and balancing, thereby demonstrating that cost-benefit reasoning is, in fact, organic legal doctrine and not the foreign construct of another discipline.

40|$|Abstract This article {{relates the}} story of the paths of Roman law from the periods {{immediately}} before the gradual dissolution of the Western Roman Empire following the death of Justinian I in 565 A. D. through the several centuries thereafter. This period witnessed an acceleration of the absorption of Roman law into the customary law of the various Germanic groups that now occupied and ruled the former Roman territories, and the recitation of such new law in the form of new law codes promulgated by three major Gothic groupings: the Lombards, the Burgundians and the Salacian Franks. In the main, the new Germanic rulers were attentive to the need for laws that would suit both (1) German customary law as followed for many centuries; with (2) the Roman law to which their Roman constituencies had adhered. Importantly, even such Roman law as would be applied was only a bowdlerized version of Justinian’s contributions, as the Digests and other interpretative parts of the comprehensive Corpus Juris Civilis were somehow lost. Thus for the first several centuries of Germanic rule, the only remnant of written Roman law available was the blunt- edged summarization contained in the Code of Justinian. Germanic law was revolutionized by the new experience of governing stable agricultural communities. The Gothic codes also advanced continental law in many ways that today can be seen as building blocks of emerging western law. Perhaps most significantly, the three law codes studied here demonstrate a preferment for resolution of disputes by means of composition (compensation), and included monetary incentives therefore. By such means the Goths were largely successful in turning their culture away from its kinship origins of violent justice, and towards systems of composition for injury. Further to this end were the adoption of wergeld as an appropriate compensation for a homicide, and also the widespread use of codified tables of composition to be associated with particularized wrongs. These gave an increased likelihood of evenhanded administration of justice, and also a money incentive for the family of a victim to forego mayhem to solve disputes. In addition to blood feud, many other ancient Germanic practices, such as trial by boiling water, were tamed or eliminated in the pursuit of new agricultural societies. And the codes adopted remarkably modern distinctions between intentional and accidental harm, as well as <b>negligence</b> <b>standards</b> that employed uncannily modern standards of duty and proximate cause. In sum, the law codes of the Lombards, the Burgundians and the Salacian Franks provided a civilizing legal bridge between the fall of the Western Empire and the more westernized law codes that would follow in the later Middle Ages...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this case study is to understand and explain fundamental difficulties of employing standard costing in the case company operating globally in manufacturing industry. It is crucial to understand the problematic areas since standard costing system is used for product costing, decision-making and operational control. The secondary objective is to analyse findings and develop solution suggestions for the identified challenging areas. The research used mainly foreign literature and articles from scientific publications to build a sound theoretical framework. The empirical {{part of the study}} used the case company's internal material, interviews, observations, informal discussions and information systems. The data was gathered in 2013 - 2014. The results of this thesis suggest that operational factors, standard costing system and standards maintenance are the areas where most of the standard costing difficulties stem from. Based on the case study, the main problems within the areas are complex operating conditions, lack of tools to control operations, standardized SCS, standard costs deviations from actuals, non-optimal system use, lack of variance analysis on product group level, partial <b>negligence</b> of <b>standards</b> thorough cost audit, and standard costs inadequateness with continuous improvement. Based on the analysed findings of the case study, standard costing improvement suggestions are presented to provide assistance in the difficult areas.
