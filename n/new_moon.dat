On November 22, 2008, one day after the theatrical release of Twilight, Summit confirmed that they would begin working on <b>New</b> <b>Moon.</b> Melissa Rosenberg had been working on adapting the novel prior to Twilights release and handed in the draft for <b>New</b> <b>Moon</b> during Twilights opening weekend in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Twilight Saga: <b>New</b> <b>Moon,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as <b>New</b> <b>Moon,</b> is a 2009 American romantic fantasy film based on Stephenie Meyer's 2006 novel <b>New</b> <b>Moon.</b> It is the second film in The Twilight Saga film series and is the sequel to 2008's Twilight. Summit Entertainment greenlit the sequel in late November 2008, following the early success of Twilight. Directed by Chris Weitz, the film stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner, reprising their roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, and Jacob Black, respectively. Melissa Rosenberg, who handed in a draft of the film script during the opening weekend of Twilight, returned as screenwriter for <b>New</b> <b>Moon</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|In early December 2008, it was {{announced}} that Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke would not be returning to direct the sequel. Hardwicke cited time restrictions as the reason behind her leaving the project. Instead, Chris Weitz, director of The Golden Compass and co-director of American Pie, was hired to direct The Twilight Saga: <b>New</b> <b>Moon.</b> Filming for <b>New</b> <b>Moon</b> began in Vancouver in late March 2009, and in Montepulciano, Italy, in late May 2009.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 2008, {{following}} {{the box office}} success of Twilight, Summit Entertainment confirmed a sequel, called , based on the second book in the series, <b>New</b> <b>Moon.</b> The film was released on November 20, 2009. The Twilight Saga: <b>New</b> <b>Moon</b> was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 20, 2010 through midnight release parties. That same day, Summit Entertainment released Twilight in Forks, a documentary about the primary setting of the Twilight series, Forks, Washington. Topics Entertainment released its own documentary about Forks and the Twilight series on March 16, called Forks: Bitten by Twilight.|$|E

40|$|Ground-dwelling, desert {{invertebrates}} were sampled using pitfall traps during {{six consecutive}} full and <b>new</b> <b>moons</b> {{to test the}} hypothesis that the lunar cycle influences catches. Invertebrates were placed in four functional groups: predaceous arthropods, social insects, detritivores, and herbivores. There were significant differences in the abundance and number of taxa of predaceous arthropods between full and <b>new</b> <b>moons.</b> The catch of total arthropods and detritivores was higher on stable gravel substrates than on mobile sand substrates. Fewer predaceous arthropods were active during full <b>moons</b> than <b>new</b> <b>moons,</b> possibly because of the increased risk of vertebrate predation. Substrate was more likely to influence diversity and abundance of non-predaceous invertebrates than moon phase. Both factors {{must be taken into account}} when designing sampling regimes for biodiversity assessment in deserts. <br/...|$|R
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a <b>new</b> <b>moon,</b> the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> to <b>new</b> <b>moon,</b> is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E

5|$|According to folklore, the priory {{is haunted}} by {{the ghost of a}} monk in a black habit who returns {{annually}} to check that its buried treasure has not been disturbed.

In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed to spot a cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and <b>new</b> <b>moon.</b> For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, Summit Entertainment {{scheduled}} a film adaptation of Eclipse, the third novel in the Twilight series, for release on June 30, 2010. Weitz {{would not be}} able to direct the third film of The Twilight Saga as it would be filming while <b>New</b> <b>Moon</b> would be in post-production. David Slade was therefore confirmed as the director of The Twilight Saga: Eclipse on April 22, 2009.|$|E

Because Catherine Hardwicke had wanted more preparation time than Summit's schedule for the production and release of the sequel would provide, Chris Weitz was selected to direct it in December 2008.|$|E
