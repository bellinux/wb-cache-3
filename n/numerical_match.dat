40|$|Incorporating {{the bond}} order-length-strength (BOLS) notion with the Ising premise, we have modeled the size {{dependence}} of the Neel transition temperature (TN) of antiferromagnetic nanomaterials. Reproduction of the size trends reveals that surface atomic undercoordination induces bond contraction, and interfacial hetero-coordination induces bond nature alteration. Both surface and interface of nanomaterials modulate the TN by adjusting the atomic cohesive energy. The TN {{is related to the}} atomic cohesive/exchange energy that is lowered by the coordination number (CN) imperfection of the undercoordinated atoms near the surface and altered by the changed bond nature of epitaxial interface.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found that {{children}} have difficulty solving proportional reasoning problems involving discrete units until 10 to 12 years of age, but can solve parallel problems involving continuous quantities by 6 years of age. The present studies examine where children go wrong in processing proportions that involve discrete quantities. A computerized proportional equivalence choice task was administered to kindergartners through 4 th-graders in Study 1, and to 1 st- and 3 rd-graders in Study 2. Both studies involved 4 between-subjects conditions that were formed by pairing continuous and discrete target proportions with continuous and discrete choice alternatives. In Study 1, target and choice alternatives were presented simultaneously; in Study 2, target and choice alternatives were presented sequentially. In both studies, children performed significantly worse when both the target and choice alternatives were represented with discrete quantities than when either or both of the proportions involved continuous quantities. Taken together, these findings indicate that children go astray on proportional reasoning problems involving discrete units only when a <b>numerical</b> <b>match</b> is possible, suggesting that their difficulty is due to an overextension of numerical equivalence concepts to proportional equivalence problems...|$|E

Previously, some authors concluded that adults process the numerators and denominators of fractions separately and do not access the global magnitude of fractions. Conversely, others reported evidence suggesting that the global magnitude of fractions is accessed. We hypothesized that in a fraction matching task, participants automatically extract the magnitude of the components but that the activation of the global magnitude of the whole fraction is only optional or strategic. Participants carried out same/different judgment tasks. Two different tasks were used: a physical matching task and a <b>numerical</b> <b>matching</b> task.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we test the {{hypothesis}} that the functional connectivity of the frontal and parietal regions that children recruit during a basic <b>numerical</b> task (<b>matching</b> Arabic numerals to arrays of dots) is predictive of their math test scores (TEMA- 3; Ginsburg, 2003). Specifically, we tested 4 – 11 -year-old children on a matching task during fMRI to localize a fronto-parietal network that responds more strongly during <b>numerical</b> <b>matching</b> than matching faces, words, or shapes. We then tested the functional connectivity between those regions during an independent task: natural viewing of an educational video that included math topics. Using this novel natural viewing method, we found that the connectivity between frontal and parietal regions during task-independent free-viewing of educational material is correlated with children's basic number matching ability, as well as their scores on the standardized test of mathematical ability (the TEMA). The correlation between children's mathematics scores and fronto-parietal connectivity is math-specific {{in the sense that it}} is independent of children's verbal IQ scores. Moreover, a control network, selective for faces, showed no correlation with mathematics performance. Finally, brain regions that correlate with subjects’ overall response times in the matching task do not account for our number- and math-related effects. We suggest that the functional intersection of number-related frontal and parietal regions is math-specific...|$|R

Over the frequency range in which analytic mode matching predictions are available, excellent agreement with point collocation transmission loss predictions is observed for a range of large splitter silencers. The validity of using point collocation to tackle large dissipative silencers is established, as is the computational efficiency of the method and its suitability for tackling dissipative silencers of arbitrary, but axially uniform, cross sections. ...|$|R

We develop an algorithm that starts out from (H, V) and reconstructs set S, when S is a convex polyomino, in polynomial time. At the same time, we show that determining {{the existence of a}} row-convex (column-convex) polyomino or set with connected rows (columns) having assigned orthogonal projections (H, V) is an NP-complete problem. Moreover, by using the algorithm to reconstruct convex polyominoes from their two orthogonal projections we prove that the <b>numerical</b> <b>matching</b> with target sums problem can be solved in polynomial time if its sequences are unimodal...|$|R

It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} experimentally that thin liquid layers may be applied to a solid surface or substrate if a temperature gradient is applied which results in a surface tension gradient and surface traction. Two related problems are considered here {{by means of the}} long-wave or lubrication theory. In the first problem, an improved estimate of the applied liquid coating thickness for a liquid being drawn from a bath is found through asymptotic and <b>numerical</b> <b>matching.</b> Secondly, the theory is extended to consider substrates that are not perfectly wetted but exhibit a finite equilibrium contact angle for the coating liquid. This extension incorporates the substrate energetics using a disjoining pressure functional. Unsteady flows are calculated on a substrate of nonuniform wettability. The finite contact angle value required to stop stress-driven flow is predicted and the resulting steady profiles are compared with experimental results for several values of the applied stress.

The MTGM makes possible the non-destructive determination of beam emittance in the space charge presence [1].

40|$|Abstract. The {{usefulness}} of parameterized algorithmics has often depended on what Niedermeier has called “the art of problem parameterization”. In this paper we intro-duce and explore a novel but general form of parameterization: {{the number of}} numbers. Several classic numerical problems, such as Subset Sum, Partition, 3 -Partition, <b>Numerical</b> 3 -Dimensional <b>Matching,</b> and <b>Numerical</b> <b>Matching</b> with Target Sums, have multisets of integers as input. We initiate the study of parameterizing these problems {{by the number of}} distinct integers in the input. We rely on an FPT result for Integer Linear Programming Feasibility to show that all the above-mentioned problems are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized in this way. In various applied settings, problem inputs often consist in part of multisets of integers or multisets of weighted objects (such as edges in a graph, or jobs to be scheduled). Such number-of-numbers parameterized problems often reduce to subproblems about tran-sition systems of various kinds, parameterized {{by the size of the}} system description. We consider several core problems of this kind relevant to number-of-numbers param-eterization. Our main hardness result considers the problem: given a non-deterministic Mealy machine M (a finite state automaton outputting a letter on each transition), an input word x, and a census requirement c for the output word specifying how many times each letter of the output alphabet should be written, decide whether there exists a computation of M reading x that outputs a word y that meets the requirement c. We show that this problem is hard for W [1]. If the question is whether there exists an input word x such that a computation of M on x outputs a word that meets c, the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable. ...|$|R
