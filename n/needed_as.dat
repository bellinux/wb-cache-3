A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism.

The film is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse. Eventually, Bart finds him in his treehouse, and despite encouragement from former child star Mickey Rooney, Milhouse gives up on his acting career. With the film now cancelled and the producers bankrupt, the directors return to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever <b>needed.</b> <b>As</b> a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Evacuation plans already existed as a {{standard}} procedure for American embassies. At the beginning of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation. As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter evacuation and provide air support if required. In the event, air support was not <b>needed</b> <b>as</b> the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts of Saigon, possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon.|$|E

5|$|Fleetwood {{continued}} to grow without its principal investor, albeit slowly. As a port, it soon faced competition from Lytham and Preston. In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood {{on their way to}} London from Scotland, but that year saw the decline of the town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were now able to travel over hilly terrain, and the railway was extended over Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer <b>needed</b> <b>as</b> a sea link.|$|E
5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is <b>needed,</b> <b>as</b> with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are <b>needed,</b> <b>as</b> around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time.

This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E

5|$|In April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the SWT units would be fitted with new traction equipment provided by Vossloh Kiepe. As part of the re-powering of the fleet, the air operated camshaft and electrical resistance grids will be removed, as well as the EE507 traction motors. The new equipment consists of DC to AC inverters of the IGBT type. This is <b>needed</b> <b>as</b> the replacement traction motors are AC rather than DC.|$|E
5|$|In April, Pietraru {{met with}} the Provisional Government's Alexander Guchkov, and an {{agreement}} was reached regarding the maximum total of troops to be enlisted in the Romanian Corps. Answering to special pleas from Romanian Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu, Guchkov allowed for the recruitment of 30,000 prisoners in his custody. The order was revised by Alexander Kerensky, who reduced that number to 5,000 prisoners, noting that they were sorely <b>needed</b> <b>as</b> working hands in Russia's agriculture and industry. In practice, Quartermaster Ivan Pavlovich Romanovsky only allowed recruitment {{to take place in}} Moscow Military District, ordering that no more than 1,500 prisoners should be taken into account.|$|E
5|$|Maxim Gorky {{tested the}} first Soviet naval helicopter, the Kamov Ka-10 in December 1950 and began her refit in mid-1953. This was planned {{to include a}} {{complete}} overhaul of her machinery while her radar, fire-control systems and anti-aircraft guns were {{to be replaced by}} the latest Soviet systems. Torpedo bulges were to be fitted which would increase her displacement by , with consequent penalties to her speed and range. The navy re-evaluated the scope of the work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship and suspended the refit. Maxim Gorky was sold for scrapping on 18 April 1959 after the navy had decided that she wasn't <b>needed</b> <b>as</b> a missile-test ship.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Morotai, {{part of the}} Pacific War, {{began on}} 15 September 1944, and {{continued}} {{until the end of}} the war in August 1945. The fighting started when United States and Australian forces landed on the southwest corner of Morotai, a small island in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI), which the Allies <b>needed</b> <b>as</b> a base to support the liberation of the Philippines later that year. The invading forces greatly outnumbered the island's Japanese defenders and secured their objectives in two weeks. Japanese reinforcements landed on the island between September and November, but lacked the supplies needed to effectively attack the Allied defensive perimeter. Intermittent fighting continued {{until the end of the}} war, with the Japanese troops suffering heavy loss of life from disease and starvation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research.
