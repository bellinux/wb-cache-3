40|$|AbstractThis report {{addresses}} {{the precipitation of}} helium in polycrystalline UO 2, which deforms the morphology of the grains and their surfaces. The formation of intragranular gas bubbles by the diffused helium can adversely affect the sintering process of ceramic-type nuclear fuel pellets. Helium was injected into pulverized UO 2 particles at 1473 K by hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The specific surface area measured by volumetric gas adsorption instrument implied that small pores should exist on the as-helium-treated sample surface. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy observations showed that numerous shallow basins (approximately 500 nm in radius) with hexagonal fringe were formed on the surface. The basin resembles a ruptured blister whose lid has been forced open. SEM observations showed a uniform polygonal-shaped section of the gas bubble on the fracture surface; this implies that precipitated helium forms a <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> in the grain. These interesting results suggest {{the possibility that the}} rupture of the <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> formed {{in the vicinity of the}} surface is related to the formation of the basin with a hexagonal fringe...|$|E

As a representative example, using the first principles calculations, the recently discovered giant bulk Rashba splitting system BiTeI is shown to fully fulfill all these three conditions.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{residual}} liquids of many tholeiitic basalts and andesites, on cooling, split nto iron-rich and silica-rich fractions, {{which may}} quench to brown glassy globules and clear glass respectively. More commonly, however, cooling is sufficiently slow for the iron-rich liquid to crystallize to globular single crystals of pyroxene. Depending on the cooling rate, these crystallized globules range in shape from spheres to elongated globules bounded by crystal faces. The fine grain {{size of the}} mesostasis of most tholeiites {{is partly due to}} these small crystallized globules. The silica-rich fraction, on the other hand, is more commonly quenched to a glass, and when preserved as globules in the crystal-lized iron-rich fraction, it may be bounded by <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> faces of the surrounding pyroxene.

40|$|Residual strain plays a {{critical}} role in determining the crystalline quality of nitride epitaxial layers and in modifying their band structure; this often leads to several interesting physical phenomena. It is found, for example, that compressive strain in AlxGa 1 -xN layers grown on AlyGa 1 -yN (x<y) templates results in an anti-crossing of the valence bands at considerably much higher Al composition than expected. This happens even in the presence of large and <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> field splitting energy for AlxGa 1 -xN layers. A judicious magnitude of the compressive strain can support vertical light emission (out of the c-plane) from AlxGa 1 -xN quantum wells up to x≈ 0. 80, which is desirable for the development of deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes designed to operate below 250 nm with transverse electric polarization characteristics...|$|E

The chlorite domains break down first forming (001) amorphous layers, that later coalesce to rounded, equant inclusions and finally recrystallize to olivine and spinels plus silica glass.

These glass inclusions often contain precipitated daughter minerals, such as <b>negative</b> <b>crystals</b> of chromite and troilite. Assuming each of these inclusions originally was a single phase having a homogeneous composition, EPMA and LAM-ICP-MS {{data suggest that the}} parent melts were highly silicic and sulphur-rich, and had low abundances of incompatible elements.

Layers of dust-like particles parallel to the seed plate, and strong banding or growth lines may also be apparent. Some stones contain groups of parallel <b>negative</b> <b>crystals.</b> Flux grown alexandrites are more difficult to spot because the colors are convincing and because they are not clean.

40|$|Topological {{insulators}} (TIs) {{have been}} found in strained binary HgTe and ternary I-III-VI 2 chalcopyrite compounds such as CuTlSe 2 which have inverted band structures. However, the non-trivial band gaps of these existing binary and ternary TIs are limited to small values, usually around 10 meV or less. In this work, we reveal that a large non-trivial band gap requires the material having a large <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> field splitting Δ_CF at top of the valence band and a moderately large negative s-p band gap E_g^s-p. These parameters can be better tuned through chemical ordering in multinary compounds.

40|$|This article reports microstructures and {{compositions}} of melt inclusions in anatectic metapelites {{found as}} enclaves within El Hoyazo dacites, in the Neogene Volcanic Province of southeastern Spain. The enclaves represent fragments of continental crust partially melted at similar to 800 - 850 degrees C and 5 - 7 kbar, {{and brought to}} surface rapidly within the host volcanics while they still were in a molten state. Rapid cooling produced the solidification of silicate melt to glass in the rock matrix and in inclusions within minerals. Melt inclusions (MI) are present within nearly all mineral phases in the enclaves, and their associated microstructures indicate a primary or pseudo-secondary origin. The entrapment mechanisms of MI within plagioclase were associated with: (1) the presence of micron-sized solids (mostly graphite) {{on the surface of}} growing crystals; (2) partial resorption of crystals, generation of embayments, and later growth in the presence of melt; and (3) entrapment of melt during crystal growth within crystallographic-controlled planar structures, e. g. on crystal faces. Melt inclusions in garnet are commonly associated with regularly oriented planar discontinuities filled with glass, interpreted either as spaces left between adjacent mineral growth spirals or as crystallographic-controlled cracks generated in-between stages of mineral growth. Melt was trapped or percolated along these microstructures and, later on, necking down phenomena individualized inclusions with <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> shape. Melt inclusions in biotite are abundant, show <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> shape, and parallel cleavage planes. Melt inclusions in cordierite, alkali feldspar and ilmenite are isolated, sparse and sometimes rather large. The composition of glass from all MI is leucogranitic and peraluminous, with small differences among glasses in each mineral host. There is some variation in glass composition within each textural location as well. Compositional heterogeneity can be partially explained by a combination of processes such as generation of boundary layers during mineral growth, crystallization of daughter phases, and hydrogen loss via diffusion through the host. Mean glass compositions in the several textural locations, however, can be tentatively interpreted as reflecting the evolution of melt chemistry during the prograde low-to-medium pressure anatexis of quartz-poor metapelites.

They are either randomly distributed or with preferred orientation within the garnet host and their dimensions vary from less than 5 up to 60 mu m. In the single-phase inclusions quartz, rutile, kyanite and graphite dominate. Biotite, zircon, apatite, monazite and allanite are also common. Two types of multiphase inclusions were recognized, hydrous silicate (Type I) and silicate-carbonate (Type II) ones. The carbon-bearing multiphase inclusions predominantly consist of Mg-siderite + graphite + CO 2 + muscovite + quartz formed by a high density carboniferous fluid rich in Fe, Mg, Si and less Ca, Mn, Al and K trapped in the growing garnet in a prograde stage of metamorphism at high-pressure (HP) conditions.

30|$|Recently, {{a stable}} class of 2 D metal dichalcogenide (MD) materials, GaX (X[*]=[*]S, Se), has {{attracted}} much attention due to their exotic physical and chemical properties, with great promise for applications in fields such as solar energy conversion and optoelectronics [8 – 11]. Layer GaX is constructed by four-atom planes covalently bonded in the sequence of X-Ga-Ga-X with a D 3 h symmetry. Advanced applications often require materials with tunable and reversible electronic properties which can be deliberately modulated by external control parameters. Strain engineering {{has been identified as}} one of the promising routes to tune the electronic behavior and the electron energy low-loss spectra of GaS monolayer (ML) and other 2 D materials [12]. As an alternative, an applied electric field or light offers a novel way to modify the electronic properties over a wide range [13, 14]. For example, a strong electric field perpendicular to the plane of bilayer graphene can induce a significant band gap [15, 16], and the bandgap can also be modulated for BN with two or more layers [17]. However, the effects of the external electric field on the electronic structures of 2 D GaS ML are still unclear. In addition, an intrinsic large <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> field which exists in GaS ML results in an optical anisotropy that the absorption coefficient for E⊥c is about 103  cm− 1, a factor of 30 smaller than for E//c [18]. For optic materials, light emission polarization is closely related to the near band-edge transitions, occurring between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band. By employing an external electric field, the band structure and thus the optical properties of GaS ML can be conveniently modulated to meet the multiple demands of device applications.|$|E

Recent studies {{in other parts of the}} orogen have shown that the rocks of the SNC likely have experienced pressures higher than what was previously described (Janák et al. 2012, Klonowska et al. in press). These latest PT studies along with geochronological dates available suggest that the collision between Baltica and Laurentia has commenced c. 30 m. y. earlier (at ca. 450 Ma) than generally accepted. Samples of kyanite- and garnet-bearing meta-sediments were collected along a profile at Tväraklumparna (Snasahögarna area) and investigated in thin sections using light microscopy followed by BSE imaging, WDS analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Preliminary results show that dominant garnet reaches up to 7 mol. % of Grs content. The garnet commonly contains inclusions of quartz surrounded by radial cracks and grains of polycrystalline quartz.

40|$|International audienceTitanite-bearing microtubes in metabasalts {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as evidence for early microbial life thriving in the oceanic crust up to 3. 5 Ga ago based on similarities with microtubular pitting occurring in modern volcanic glass. An alternative abiogenic origin as ambient inclusions trails (AITs) has been debated but textural evidence {{such as the}} absence of diagnostic terminal inclusions was used to discard this possibility. Here, we describe a variety of microtubes occurring in pyroclastic tuff of the 2. 72 Ga Tumbiana Formation, Western Australia, some of which resemble titanite-filled microtubes reported in metamorphosed Archean pillow basalts. To assess {{the origin of the}} Tumbiana microtubes, we investigated their structure and chemistry and their root zone down to the sub-micrometer scale using a combination of Raman microspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB) milling and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS). We report four types of microtubes. Type 1 comprises calcite microtubes. Type 2 comprises AITs showing terminal pyrite and trails with <b>negative</b> <b>crystal</b> shapes. Type 3 comprises titanite microtubes in chlorite displaying morphologies similar to those reported in ~ 3. 5 Ga old Archean lavas. At the sub-micrometer scale, they display a dendritic structure. Depending on their localization, Type 3 microtubes have been divided in three main sub-types: i) Type 3 A extends in pores filled by chloritized cement, ii) Type 3 B occurs in pyroclasts, and iii) Type 3 C overgrows and thus post-dates Type 2 AITs. Type 4 comprises titanite microtubes confined to quartz and calcite rims. Types 3 and 4 microtubes are terminated by sub-micrometric carbonaceous and/or mineral inclusions. Altogether, these features suggest that the Tumbiana titanite microtubes have formed as dendritic AITs associated with displacement of mineral and/or organic inclusions in pyroclasts and in surrounding void-filling cements during recrystallization. They are therefore unlikely to represent relics of the activity of early microbial life, rather abiotic features formed in the presence of organic matter during burial metamorphism. In that sense, they may represent some sort of indirect evidence for life...|$|E

The number and widths of the multiple ring electrodes are designed to offer online tunability on focusing length by predetermined individual electrode voltages.

Finally, the proposed negative LC lens is fabricated with the capability of realizing different focus lengths in a relatively large aperture of 5 mm and a thickness of 0. 7 mm.
