5000|$|After three albums {{with the}} Runaways (The Runaways, Queens of Noise and Live in Japan), Currie {{went on to}} be a solo artist. She signed a {{contract}} with Mercury saying she would record four records, but she left the Runaways after the third album, thus she was obligated to record another album. She recorded it solo and the result was Beauty's Only Skin Deep for Polygram Records. Marie Currie did a duet with Cherie on her solo record [...] "Love at First Sight". Cherie and Marie went on a US tour in 1977, and when Marie would join Cherie on stage to sing the encores the audience would go wild. Then they went on a Japan tour in 1978. While in Japan, the twins performed on many TV shows. So Cherie ran with the idea of two blonds are better than one, and changed the band name from Cherie Currie to Cherie and Marie Currie. With Marie Currie, she recorded Messin' with the Boys for Capitol Records and Young and Wild for Raven. Messin' with the Boys was released in 1980. Messin' with the Boys received more radio play than Beauty's Only Skin Deep and, the song [...] "Since You Been Gone" [...] off Messin' with the Boys charted number 95 on US charts. Both the single [...] "This Time" [...] and the album Messin' with the Boys made the top 200 on U.S. charts. Cherie and Marie performed on many television shows to support the album; including the Sha Na <b>Na</b> <b>show,</b> and The Mike Douglas Show. Along with the album recordings with Marie, Cherie and Marie sang, wrote, and produced songs for The Rosebud Beach Hotel and its soundtrack called, The Rosebud Beach Hotel Soundtrack. In the film, they acted and sang together. In 1991, Cherie and Marie Currie performed at the Coconut Teaser which was a tribute concert to Paula Pierce, {{she was a member of}} The Pandoras. For the final performance The remaining Pandoras backed the Currie sisters. Currie performed at The Runaways reunion in 1994 with other Runaways Fox and West. Her sister Marie joined the three Runaways on stage and performed with the band. In 1998, Cherie and Marie held a concert at the Golden Apple, in support of their re-released version of Messin' with the Boys. Cherie's ex-band mate West joined Cherie on stage to perform some of the Runaways songs. The Curries and West signed autographs after the show. Young and Wild was released in 1998. It was Cherie and Marie's first compilation album. It contains tracks from Beauty's Only Skin Deep, Messin with the Boys, Flaming School Girls (The Runaways compilation album), and one new track co-written by Marie. In 1999 Rocket City Records released Currie's studio album The 80's Collection. The album contians guest work by Marie Currie.|$|E

40|$|Construction {{industry}} is making progress {{at a high}} pace. The trend {{of the world is}} getting more biased towards the high rise buildings. Deep beams {{are one of the most}} common elements in modern construction having small span to depth ratio. Deep beams are mostly used as transfer girders. This experimental study consists of 16 reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams. These beams were divided into two groups; A and B. Groups A and B consist of eight beams each, having 381 mm (15 in) and 457 mm (18 in) depth respectively. Each group was further subdivided into four sub groups each consisting of two identical beams. Each subgroup was comprised of solid/control beam (without opening), opening above neutral axis (NA), at NA and below NA. Except for control beams, all beams with openings were strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) vertical strips. These eight groups differ from each other based on depth and location of openings. For testing sake, all beams have been loaded with two symmetrical point loads. All beams have been designed based on strut and tie model concept. The outcome of experimental investigation elaborates the difference in the shear behaviour of deep beams based on depth and location of circular openings variation. 457 mm (18 in) deep beam with openings above <b>NA</b> <b>show</b> the highest strength and 381 mm (15 in) deep beam with openings below <b>NA</b> <b>show</b> the least strength.

A similar pattern of results emerged for task satisfaction, particularly in response to high demand-low behavioral control situations. Mediation analyses suggested this was because participants with high NA used more emotion-focused coping strategies.

Diesel engines represent {{a major source}} of particles in the urban scenario. We aimed to modify the composition of diesel particles, by means of different extraction procedures, to relate changes in chemical profile to corresponding indicators of respiratory toxicity. Male BALB/c mice were nasally instilled with saline, or with diesel particles, treated or not, and assigned to five groups: saline (SHAM), intact diesel particles (DEP), and diesel particles previously treated with methanol (METH), hexane (HEX), or nitric acid (NA). Elemental composition and organic compounds were analyzed. Twenty-four hours after nasal instillation, respiratory parameters were measured and lung tissue was collected for histological analysis. Static elastance was significantly increased in groups DEP and MET in relation to the other groups. HEX and NA were different from DEP but not significantly different from SHAM and METH groups. The difference between dynamic and static elastance was increased in DEP, METH, and NA treatments; HEX was not statistically different from SHAM. DEP and METH groups presented significantly increased upper airways resistance, while DEP, METH, and <b>NA</b> <b>showed</b> higher peripheral airways resistance values. All groups had a higher total resistance than SHAM. DEP, METH, and <b>NA</b> <b>showed</b> significant increased infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells.

We analyzed stars in the magnitude range from about 1 mag below the bump {{to the tip of}} the Red Giant Branch. The average metallicity we derive is [Fe/H]=- 1. 31 +/- 0. 004 +/- 0. 028 dex (random and systematic errors, respectively), with a very small star-to-star scatter (rms= 0. 033 dex), from moderately high-resolution Giraffe spectra. This is the first extensive spectroscopic abundance analysis in this cluster. Our results indicate that NGC 6218 is very homogeneous as far as heavy elements are concerned. On the other hand, light elements involved in the well known proton-capture reactions of H-burning at high temperature, such as O and <b>Na,</b> <b>show</b> large variations, anticorrelated with each other, at all luminosities along the red giant branch. The conclusion is that the Na-O anticorrelation must be established in early times at the cluster formation. We interpret the variation of Na found near the RGB-bump as the effect of two distinct populations having different bump luminosities, as predicted for different He content. To our knowledge, NGC 6218 is the first GC where such a signature has been spectroscopically detected, when combined with consistent and homogeneous data obtained for NGC 6752 to gain in statistical significance.

40|$|ABSTRACT HIV- 1 {{protease}} is {{most active}} un-der weakly acidic conditions (pH 3. 5 – 6. 5), when the catalytic Asp 25 and Asp 25 residues share 1 proton. At neutral pH, this proton is lost and {{the stability of}} the structure is reduced. Herewe present an investi-gation of the effect of pH on the dynamics of HIV- 1 protease usingMD simulation techniques. MD simu-lations of the solvated HIV- 1 protease with the Asp 25 / 25 residues monoprotonated and deproto-nated have been performed. In addition we investi-gated the effect of the inclusion of Na and Cl ions to mimic physiological salt conditions. The simula-tions of themonoprotonated form and deprotonated form including <b>Na</b> <b>show</b> very similar behavior. In both cases the protein remained stable in the com-pact, “self-blocked ” conformation in which the ac-tive site is blocked by the tips of the flaps. In the deprotonated system a Na ion binds tightly to the catalytic dyad shielding the repulsion between the COO groups. Ab initio calculations also suggest the geometry of the active site with the Na bound closely resembles that of the monoprotonated case. In the simulations of the deprotonated form (with-out Na ions), a water molecule bound between the Asp 25 Asp 25 side-chains.

40|$|ABSTRACT In human red cells, Li is {{extruded}} {{against its}} own concentration gradient if the external medium contains Na as a dominant cation. This uphill net Li extrusion {{occurs in the}} presence of external Na but not K, Rb, Cs, choline, Mg, or Ca, is ouabain-insensitive, inhibited by phloredn, and does not require the presence of cellular ATP. Li influx into human red cells has a ouabain-sensitive and a ouabain-insensitive but phloretin-sensitive component. Ouabain-sensitive Li influx is competitively inhibited by external K and Na and probably involves the site on which the Na-K pump normally transports K into red cells. Ouabain does not inhibit Li efflux from red cells containing Li concentrations below 10 mM {{in the presence of}} high internal Na or K, whereas a ouabain-sensitive Li efflux can be measured in cells loaded to contain 140 mM Li in the presence of little or no internal Na or K. Ouabain-insensitive Li efflux is stimulated by external Na and not by K, Rb, Cs, choline, Mg, or Ca ions. Na-dependent Li efflux does not require the presence of cellular ATP and is inhibited by phloretin, furosemide, quinine, and quinidine. Experiments carried out in cells loaded in the presence of nystatin to contain either only K or only <b>Na</b> <b>show</b> that the ouabain-insensitive, phloretininhibited Li movements into or out of human red cells are stimulated by Na on the trans side and inhibited by Na on the cis side of the red cell membrane.
