40|$|Abstract. A {{stochastic}} graph game {{is played}} by two players on a game graph with probabilistic transitions. We consider stochastic graph games with ω-regular winning conditions specified as Rabin or Streett objectives. These games are NP-complete and coNP-complete, respectively. The value of the game for a player at a state s given an objective Φ is the maximal probability with which the player can guarantee the satisfaction of Φ from s. We present a strategy-improvement algorithm to compute values in stochastic Rabin games, where an improvement step involves solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) and <b>nonstochastic</b> Rabin games. The algorithm also computes values for stochastic Streett games but does not directly yield an optimal strategy for Streett objectives. We then show how to obtain an optimal strategy for Streett objectives by solving certain <b>nonstochastic</b> Streett games. ...|$|E

40|$|Adjustment {{and testing}} of a {{combination}} of stochastic and <b>nonstochastic</b> observations is applied to the deformation analysis of a time series of 3 D coordinates. <b>Nonstochastic</b> observations are constant values that are treated as if they were observations. They are used to formulate constraints on the unknown parameters of the adjustment problem. Thus they describe deformation patterns. If deformation is absent, the epochs of the time series are supposed to be related via affine, similarity or congruence transformations. S-basis invariant testing of deformation patterns is treated. The model is experimentally validated by showing the procedure for a point set of 3 D coordinates, determined from total station measurements during five epochs. The modelling of two patterns, the movement of just one point in several epochs, and of several points, is shown. Full, rank deficient covariance matrices of the 3 D coordinates, resulting from free network adjustments of the total station measurements of each epoch, are used in the analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{background}} spectrum of Alfven waves on the rate of dissipation of a test shear Alfven wave is numerically calculated. The results demonstrate that as the classical resistivity eta and classical viscosity mu become small, the damping rate of the Alfven wave remains large and depends only on the amplitude for the scalar potential of the wave spectrum and the wavenumber of the Alfven wave. The damping rate is virtually independent of eta and mu. The wave spectrum need not be turbulent or stochastic to affect the damping rate. The dissipation rate is nonlinear enhanced by <b>nonstochastic</b> spectra {{as well as by}} stochastic spectra if two conditions are met. First, the perpendicular magnetic field associated with Alfven wave spectrum must exceed a certain collision-frequency threshold and second, for <b>nonstochastic</b> spectra only, the magnetic field must exceed a threshold proportional to the parallel wavenumber of the shear Alfven wave.

The behavior of certain input and output variables in the beef market explained the price variation in each reduced form equation. The results revealed dynamic stability, with a geometric rational lag structure describing fed cattle prices and a polynomial rational lag structure characterizing feeder cattle prices. These dynamics {{were found to be}} better than both static-serial correlation and purely autoregressive specifications. Key words: adjustment, fed price, feeder price, <b>nonstochastic,</b> rational lag. (1) This paper presents a rational distributed lag model of quarterly fed cattle and feeder cattle prices. <b>Nonstochastic</b> difference equations are introduced as a vehicle to estimate the sys-tematic components of the rational lag struc-ture with allowance for a generalized autore-gressive/moving average disturbance process.

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we address}} the {{spectrum}} utilization problem in cognitive radio (CR) networks, {{in which a}} CR can only utilize spectrum opportunities when the channel is idle. One challenge for a CR is to balance exploring new channels and exploiting existing channel, {{due to the fact}} that the channel availability and channel quality, potentially heterogeneous and time-dependent, are often unknown in advance due to the large number of channels, and the limited hardware capability of single CR. In this work, we propose joint channel sensing, probing, and accessing schemes for secondary users in cognitive radio networks. Our method has time and space complexity O(N u) for a network with N channels and u secondary users, while applying classic methods requires exponential time complexity. We prove that, even when channel states are selected by adversary (thus <b>nonstochastic),</b> it results in a total regret uniformly upper bounded by (p TN logN), w. h. p, for communication lasts for T timeslots. Our protocol can be implemented in a distributed manner due to the <b>nonstochastic</b> channel assumption.

40|$|The {{classical}} Fisher equation {{asserts that}} in a <b>nonstochastic</b> economy, the inflation rate must equal {{the difference between the}} nominal and real interest rates. We extend this equation to a representative agent economy with real uncertainty in which the central bank sets the nominal rate of interest. The Fisher equation still holds, but with the rate of inflation replaced by the harmonic mean of the growth rate of money. Except for logarithmic utility, we show that on almost every path the long-run rate of inflation is strictly higher than {{it would be in the}} <b>nonstochastic</b> world obtained by replacing output with expected output in every period. If the central bank sets the nominal interest rate equal to the discount rate of the representative agent, then the long-run rate of inflation is positive (and the same) on almost every path. By contrast, the classical Fisher equation asserts that inflation should then be zero. In fact, no constant interest rate will stabilize prices, even if the economy is stationary with bounded i. d. d. shocks. The central bank must actively manage interest rates if it wants to keep prices bounded forever. However, not even an active central bank can keep prices exactly constant.
