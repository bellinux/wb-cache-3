5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's <b>near</b> <b>field</b> <b>communication</b> (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs a {{necessary}} step, removing liquid in the wellbore {{plays an important}} role during the production of gas wells. Plunger lift is a widely-used intermittent deliquification process for gas wells. However, the manual control way and wire logging are still utilized as a downhole monitoring way for plunger lift, which is not efficient in terms of interrupting the production. This paper presents an improved solution that logging instruments canister are deployed and retrieved by means of a new assembly. With the reciprocating plunger, logging instruments canister can be carried and deployed to the bottom of a gas well to carry out logging and sampling tasks on the production demand of a field. After the deployment and logging tasks are performed, logging instruments canister is carried back to the surface by the plunger and then data is transferred to the wellhead device <b>near</b> <b>field</b> wireless <b>communication</b> technology. This newly developed plunger lift system comprises plunger body, deployment sub-assembly, retrieve sub-assembly and logging instruments canister. The surface device comprises RF antenna, reader and writer. Based upon the method of deployment-retrieve integration, the new deliquification process is introduced and on-line monitoring of production dynamics can be performed including P/T measurement, downhole fluid sampling, pressure build-up, etc. without interrupting production. The general solution and engineering design parameters have been confirmed by research teams, while system prototype manufacture and workbench tests are being performed. The cost-effective way combining deliquification with dynamic monitoring is developed and contributes to increasing production and the stable productivity of gas wells. It is very significant for low-pressure and low-production gas fields to achieve automation production and management...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{multihop}} relaying in RF-based {{communications and}} <b>near</b> <b>field</b> magnetic induction <b>communication</b> (NFMIC) is discussed. Three multihop relay strategies for NFMIC are proposed: Non Line of Sight Magnetic Induction Relay (NLoS-MI Relay), Non Line of Sight Master/Assistant Magnetic Induction Relay 1 (NLoS-MAMI Relay 1) and Non Line of Sight Master/Assistant Magnetic Induction Relay 2 (NLoSMAMI Relay 2). In the first approach only one node {{contributes to the}} communication, while {{in the other two}} techniques (which are based on a master-assistant strategy), two relaying nodes are employed. This paper shows that these three techniques can be used to overcome the problem of dead spots within a body area network and extend the communication range without increasing the transmission power and the antenna size or decreasing receiver sensitivity. The impact of the separation distance between the nodes on the achievable RSS and channel data rate is evaluated for the three techniques. It is demonstrated that the technique which is most effective depends on the specific network topology. Optimum selection of nodes as relay master and assistant based on the location of the nodes is discussed. The paper also studies the impact of the quality factor on achievable data rate. It is shown that to obtain the highest data rate, the optimum quality factor needs to be determined for each proposed cooperative communication method...|$|R
