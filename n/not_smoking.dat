5|$|Apart from <b>not</b> <b>smoking,</b> the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} {{keeping a}} healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} the {{regions of the world}} known as blue zones, where people {{commonly}} live active lives past 100 years of age, speculated that longevity is related to a healthy social and family life, <b>not</b> <b>smoking,</b> eating a plant-based diet, frequent consumption of legumes and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity. In a cohort study, the combination of a plant based diet, normal BMI, and <b>not</b> <b>smoking</b> accounted for differences up to 15 years in life expectancy. Korean court records going back to 1392 indicate that the average lifespan of eunuchs was 70.0 ± 1.76 years, which was 14.4–19.1 years longer than the lifespan of non-castrated men of similar socio-economic status.|$|E

25|$|Abiding by {{traditions and}} {{cultural}} norms {{is a more}} popular reason for <b>not</b> <b>smoking</b> than that of health related concerns, religion, personal conviction, or economic reasons. The increased prevalence of tobacco use amongst Syrian women can therefore {{be seen in a}} positive light as it signifies increasing freedom for women in a generally male-dominated society. However, this development also brings about a new target group for tobacco companies and furthers the potential for the spread of the tobacco epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is {{by blood}} {{pressure}} control and <b>not</b> <b>smoking.</b> The treatment of aortic dissection {{depends on the}} part of the aorta involved. Surgery is usually required for dissections that involve the first part of the aorta, while those that do not can typically be treated with blood pressure and heart-rate lowering unless complications result. Surgery may be done either by an opening in the chest or by endovascular aneurysm repair (carried out from inside the blood vessels).|$|E

25|$|Prevention is by <b>not</b> <b>smoking</b> and {{avoiding}} other lung irritants. Frequent hand washing {{may also be}} protective. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and NSAIDs {{to help with the}} fever. Cough medicine has little support for its use and is not recommended in children less than six years of age. There is tentative evidence that salbutamol may be useful in those with wheezing; however, it may result in nervousness and tremors. Antibiotics should generally not be used. An exception is when acute bronchitis is due to pertussis. Tentative evidence supports honey and pelargonium to help with symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} physicians have duties to serve as role models {{for the general public}} in matters of health, for example by <b>not</b> <b>smoking</b> cigarettes. Indeed, in most western nations relatively few physicians smoke, and their professional knowledge does appear to have a beneficial effect on their health and lifestyle. According to a study of male physicians, life expectancy is slightly higher for physicians (73.0 years for white and 68.7 for black) than lawyers or many other highly educated professionals. Causes of death less likely in physicians than the general population include respiratory disease (including pneumonia, pneumoconioses, COPD, but excluding emphysema and other chronic airway obstruction), alcohol-related deaths, rectosigmoidal and anal cancers, and bacterial diseases.|$|E

25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>smoking</b> is {{the single}} best way to prevent the disease. Other methods of {{prevention}} include treating high blood pressure, treating high blood cholesterol and not being overweight. Surgery is usually recommended when an AAA's diameter grows to >5.5cm in males and >5.0cm in females. Other reasons for repair include the presence of symptoms and a rapid increase in size (more than one centimeter per year). Repair may be either by open surgery or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). As compared to open surgery, EVAR has a lower risk {{of death in the}} short term and a shorter hospital stay, but may not always be an option. There {{does not appear to be}} a difference in longer term outcomes between the two. With EVAR there is a higher need for repeat procedures.|$|E
25|$|Robertson later {{recorded}} that {{it would}} have been impossible to live as a cavalry subaltern in Britain, where £300 a year was needed in addition to the £120 official salary (approximately £30,000 and £12,000 at 2010 prices) to keep up the required lifestyle; he was reluctant to leave the cavalry, but his Regiment was deployed to India, where pay was higher and expenses lower than in the UK. Robertson's father made his uniforms and he economised by drinking water with meals and <b>not</b> <b>smoking,</b> as pipes were not permitted in the mess and he could not afford the cigars which officers were expected to smoke. Robertson supplemented his income by studying with native tutors whilst others slept during the hot afternoons, qualifying as an interpreter—for which officers received cash grants—in Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Pashto and Punjabi.|$|E
25|$|Some {{effects may}} include a general {{alteration}} of conscious perception, euphoria, feelings of well-being, relaxation or stress reduction, increased {{appreciation of the}} arts, including humor and music (especially discerning its various components/instruments), joviality, metacognition and introspection, enhanced recollection (episodic memory), increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido, and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is the most commonly reported side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis, however, some report anxiety only after <b>not</b> <b>smoking</b> cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use in an unfamiliar environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety. Cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, {{has been shown to}} ameliorate the adverse effects of THC, including anxiety, that some consumers experience.|$|E

25|$|Smoking {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{development}} of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of CIN3 occurring which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or <b>not</b> <b>smoking</b> at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV which {{is the leading cause of}} this type of cancer. Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.|$|E
500|$|The {{test results}} {{determined}} that smokers showed consistently higher mean oral temperature and pulse rate, both at rest and following exercises, {{as well as}} significantly increased pulse rates over non-smokers, a marked decrease in alertness, {{and an increase in}} insomnia symptoms. [...] However, {{there was no significant difference}} in blood pressure between smokers and non-smokers. [...] Finally, smokers experienced [...] "debilitative performance decrements" [...] during the smoking prohibition, and as a consequence, this also affected the morale of non-smokers, both among the participants in the experiment as well as non-participants.

500|$|Brosnan's Bond was {{introduced}} in Goldeneye; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond {{into the history of}} the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the , previously seen in Goldfinger and Thunderball, [...] "thus immediately evoking the memory of [...] Connery". Brosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being [...] "closer to the Fleming novels than Moore... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton". Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond <b>not</b> <b>smoking.</b> Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying [...] "I don't give a damn about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke", although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in Die Another Day. Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals, and provided a [...] "mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour"; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were [...] "flippant, but not crass".|$|E
