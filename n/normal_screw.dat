40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel expandable-retractable pedicle screw and {{analyzes}} its functionality. A specially designed pedicle screw is described {{which has the}} ability to expand and retract using nitinol elements. The screw is designed to expand in body temperature and retract by cooling the screw. This expansion-retraction function is verified in an experiment designed in larger scale using a nitinol antagonistic assembly. The results of this experiment are compared to the results of a finite element model developed in Abaqus in combination with a user material subroutine (UMAT). This code has been developed to analyze the nonlinear thermomechanical behavior of shape memory alloy materials. The functionality of the proposed screw is evaluated with simulation and experimentation in a pullout test as well. The pullout force of a <b>normal</b> <b>screw</b> inserted in a normal bone was simulated, and the result is compared with the results of the expandable screw in osteoporotic bone. Lastly, strength of the designed pedicle screw in a foam block is also verified with experiment. The reported finite element simulations and experiments are the proof for the concept of nitinol expandable-retractable elements on a pedicle screw which validate the functionality in a pullout test...|$|E
40|$|Ruled surface {{design and}} its {{applications}} {{are widely used}} in CAGD (Computer Aided Geometric Design) and industrial areas. The hyperbolic paraboloid, the cylinder, the cone, and the hyperboloid are ruled surfaces with particular shapes. In this paper, dual space drawing methods for these particular ruled surfaces are proposed. The underlying principles of these methods are the applications, extensions and variations of the dual (space) de Casteljau algorithm [15]. The hyperbolic paraboloid is created by using the initial dual de Casteljau algorithm directly. The cylinder, the cone, and the hyperboloid, on the other hand, are created by using the extensions or variations of the dual de Casteljau algorithm. During the drawing processes, the screen representation of the rulings is presented. This treatment presents the rulings as clipped line segments {{on the computer screen}} in order to show the proportion of the ruled surface on the computer screen. In addition, the dual characteristics of Bezier surfaces are also discussed. The special construction method of the displacement matrix with two parallel control screws is demonstrated. The <b>normal</b> <b>screw</b> is normalized into the unit screw as well. These new methods show the universal possibility of the dual space approach for drawing ruled surfaces.

40|$|This paper deals with, the {{solution}} of problem occurred for reciprocating screw of Injection molding machine. It identifies and solves the problem by using the modeling and simulation techniques. The problem occurred in the reciprocating screw of machine which was wearing of threads due to affect of temperature of mold materials (flow materials) i. e. Nylon, low density polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC etc., The main work was to model the components of machine with dimensions, assemble those components and then simulate the whole assembly for rotation of the screw. The modeling software used is PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 for modeling the machine components like body, movable platen, fixed platen, barrel, screw, nozzle, etc. The analysis software ANSYS is {{used to analyze the}} reciprocating screws. The objectives involved are:-• To model all the components using modeling software Pro-E 4. 0 • To assemble all the components of the machine in the software. • To make the assembly run in Pro-E software. • Analysis of screw of machine using Ansys 11. 0 software. • To identify the wearing of threads and to provide the possible solutions. This problem is major for all industrial injection molding machines which the industries are facing and they need the permanent solution, so if the better solution is achieved then the industries will think for implementing it. The industries are having temporary solution but it will affect the life of the screw, because the stresses will be more in machined screw on lathe machine as compared to <b>normal</b> <b>screw.</b> Also if the screw will fail after some years of operation, the new screw available in the market will have the same problem. Also the cost associated with new screw and its mounting is much more as it is the main component of machine...|$|E

Essentially a tank version of the G class 0-8-0s. When introduced they had the then new style of 12″ letters for the company's initials on the tank sides. They were fitted with saturated [...] "Precursor" [...] class boilers with lagged ends, round-top fireboxes, and sloping coal bunkers. The main wheels were coupled by three overlapping rods and the third pair of wheels were flangeless. Lever actuated Joy reversing gear appeared in-lieu of the <b>normal</b> Ramsbottom <b>screw</b> system. The earlier engines initially had slender tapered Cooke buffers but these were replaced by those of standard Webb pattern: The latter type was fitted from new on later engines. Braking was by steam, but vacuum brakes were provided to operate fitted or passenger stock if required.|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{leakages}} are {{a considerable}} problem when measuring waveguide structures at high frequencies. In {{order to maintain}} good electrical contact, flanges need to be tightly and evenly screwed to the device under test. This can be a time-consuming operation, especially with repeated measurements. We present a metamaterial-based adapter, which prohibits leakage even {{in the presence of}} gaps at the interconnects. This so-called gap adapter has been fabricated from a metallized polymer (SU 8). The reflection coefficient is below - 20 dB throughout the band for a 50 -mu m gap {{on both sides of the}} gap adapter. In comparison, a conventional waveguide with a 50 -mu m gap on both sides has a reflection coefficient of - 10 dB. The gap adapter can be used to perform fast measurements, since the <b>normal</b> flange <b>screws</b> are redundant. We compare the SU 8 gap adapter with a Si version and to a smooth metal waveguide reference disc. The SU 8 gap adapter performed better than the Si version and much better than the waveguide disc in all test cases. SU 8 gap adapters were used to measure on a waveguide component. The SU 8 gap adapters with 50 -mu m gaps performed comparable with the waveguide component with the flange screws carefully tightened. The polymer also makes the gap adapter mechanically robust and easy to mass fabricate. [2015 - 0113...|$|R
5000|$|As {{there were}} {{initially}} only light locomotives (with two two-axle carriages hauled {{by one of}} five three-axle locomotives of Prussian class T 3), freight made powerful locomotives more necessary. Between 1925 and 1940, locomotives with four or five axle were procured. In 1933, the first three two-axle railcars were used, they {{had been made in}} Gothaer Waggonfabrik. As a result, the number of services that could be operated increased from seven pairs of trains in 1930 to 22 pairs of trains. Four-axle railcars were procured in 1951 and 1953 and a MAN railbus was acquired in 1958. Due to the scrapping of the pre-war railcars from 1961, new and used Uerdingen railbuses were purchased. They were single-engined, like the VT 95, but had <b>normal</b> buffers and <b>screw</b> couplings. In order to rationalise vehicle classes, the MAN railbuses were transferred to the Alster Northern Railway in 1968 [...] With the acquisition by the AKN, it was operated with AKN rollingstock. Two of the Uerdinger railbuses are still operated for special events.|$|R

All patients had posterior approach surgery. 14 of them were fixed with pedicle screw by augmentation with Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and the other 17 patients with autogenous bone. Age, sex and whether smoking were similar between the two groups. Surgical time, blood loss, blood transfusion, medical cost, post surgery ICU time, hospital day, length of oral pain medicines taken, Pre-and postoperative Oswestry disability index questionnaire and surgical revision were documented and compared. Preoperative, postoperative and final follow up Cobb angle, sagittal lumbar curve, correction rate, and Follow up Cobb loss were also compared. Results No {{significant differences were found}} between the autogenous bone group and Polymethylmethacrylate group with regards to all the targets above except for length of oral pain medicines taken and surgery cost. 2 patients were seen leakage during operation, but there is neither damage of nerve nor symptom after operation. No revision was needed. Conclusion Both augmentation pedicle screw with Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and autogenous bone treating degenerative lumbar scoliosis combined with osteoporosis can achieve a good surgical result. Less oral pain medicines taken are the potential benefits of Polymethylmethacrylate augmentation, but that is at the cost of more medical spending. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{efficacy of}} open reduction and internal fixation with the miniplate and hollow screw {{in the treatment}} of Lisfranc injury. Methods: Ten cases of Lisfranc injury treated by open reduction, miniplate and hollow screw in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. There were 6 males and 4 females with age ranging from 25 to 45 years (mean 32 years). Among them, one case was classified as Type A, six Type B and three Type C. Injury mechanism included road traffic accidents (3 cases), fall from height (5 cases) and hit by heavy object (2 cases). All injuries were closed without cerebral trauma or other complicated injuries. The time interval between injury and operation was 6 e 10 days (average 6. 6 days). Postoperatively, the foot function was assessed using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Scales. Healing time and complications were observed. Results: All patients were followed up for 18 e 24 months (average 20 months). Anatomic reduction was achieved in all patients on images. There was statistical significance between preoperative score (7. 89 ± 0. 34) and score at postoperative 8 weeks (0. 67 ± 0. 13). According to the AOFAS score, 5 cases were defined as excellent, 3 cases as good and 2 cases as fair. During follow-up, there was no wound infection or complications except for osteoarthritis in 2 cases. Healing time ranged from 3 to 6 months with an average of 3. 6 months. Conclusion: Anatomical reduction of Lisfranc injury can be achieved by open reduction and internal fixation with the miniplate and hollow <b>screw.</b> <b>Normal</b> structure of Lisfranc joint is regained to a great extent; injured ligaments were also repaired. Therefore, this method offers excellent curative effect and can avoid postoperative complications and improve the patients' quality of life...|$|R
