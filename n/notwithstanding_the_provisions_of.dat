40|$|Purpose This {{research}} project {{was an attempt}} to determine situational aspects of HIV and AIDS among the designated farming communities in the Vhembe and Mopani districts of Limpopo Province. Questions arising from the pilot project were premised on the capacity of farmers in these areas to adequately address the daunting reality and prevalence of HIV and AIDS in their communities. Research Design and Methodology The research was designed to facilitate the integration of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. A sample of 228 respondents was involved in a triangulated participatory action research method. To the extent that the data collection techniques were triangulated in both nature and focus, HIV/AIDS-related data and information within the designated farming communities was attained with a maximum degree of validity. The data collection techniques used in this regard were: questionnaires, which were distributed to 228 respondents; participant observation; exploratory investigation; unstructured interviews; naturalistic observation; focus group interviews and discussion; and review of documents. The reviewed documents include (primary) sources on HIV/AIDS by the Department of Health and (secondary) sources of literature by various authors presenting a range of perspectives on HIV/AIDS in farming areas. Findings The results of the study revealed the absence of a coordinated policy on HIV/AIDS in particular, and health in general; and a vacuous prevalence of basic HIV/AIDS-related information. For instance, knowledge on condom usage as a prevention strategy was ostensibly scant. Currently, primary healthcare services in the area are not available. The sampled farm workers themselves unanimously corroborated that there was no HIV/AIDS policy on the SAFM farms. Conclusion Based on the main findings established above, it has become indispensable that comprehensive and multidisciplinary HIV/AIDS policy interventions be initiated by all the relevant stakeholders. Local and provincial healthcare authorities need to provide policy guidelines for the development of such policy, taking the particular needs and circumstances of farm workers. The pervasive degree of insufficient HIV/AIDS knowledge among this group necessitates that such a policy should integrate both a labour perspective and healthcare orientation, rather than perpetuating a separation of the two paradigms. This form of integration ensures that the observance of a human rights dimension becomes a sacrosanct component of the prevention of HIV/AIDS among farm workers, as well as their education concerning their healthcare-related rights as farm employees. Furthermore, the prevalence of a national HIV and AIDS policy is mainly aimed at facilitating broad guidelines, not addressing the specific contexts of every public, corporate and rural employment sector (DoH, 2007 : 11 - 12; Muhlemann, et al., 1992 : 479). In order that the education, prevention and treatment initiatives in the Vhembe and Mopani farming communities are achieved, the most important parameters of the policy should indicate:,,X	The systematic institutionalisation of local, provincial, and national HIV and AIDS programmes, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> healthcare facilities such as clinics;,,X	The promotion of basic healthcare education in general, and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention among farm workers in particular;,,X	The development of HIV/AIDS work place policy by SAFM as employer;,,X	The systematic involvement and formation of partnerships between policy makers, local and international funders, HIV/AIDS healthcare workers and practitioners, NGOs and SAFM. As a critical factor and unit of analysis in the study, SAFM is expected to fulfil a developmental function among its employees, their families, and the local communities. This function could be enhanced further with the collaboration between SAFM and other farmers in the distribution of basic information regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases at the workplace, as well as extensive healthcare education and training for their farming personnel. Trained personnel, especially managers, are a salient factor in the implementation of organisational health and safety requirements (DoH, 2007 : 6, 8; Muhlemann, et al., 1992 : 478 - 479).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} macroeconomic {{and monetary}} policy-making at the European Commission, covering {{the period from}} the Rome Treaties to the Hague Summit. It {{is based on an}} analysis of public documents, archival research and interviews with former policy-makers. The paper starts with an overview of the economic philosophy of the Rome Treaties and senior macroeconomic policy-makers at the Commission, followed by an analysis of economic developments in the 1960 s. Thereafter, the focus is on three crucial macroeconomic policy documents of the period: the European Reserve Fund project in 1958, the Commission's Action Programme for the Second Stage of the EEC of October 1962 and the Barre [Barr] Memorandum of October 1969. [The Barr Plan I-III are on the Archive in the AEI-EU section - search for Barr]. The Commissionâ€™s objectives tended to be both defensive, preserving the "acquis communautaire", especially avoiding recourse to the safeguard clauses, and pro-active, stimulating the process of European integration. From an analytical point of view, the Commission focussed on the compatibility of policies between the Member States. Gradually, a typical Commission analysis developed, based on a blending of German convergence ideas with the French medium-term approach.
