5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth {{and the desire to}} protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E
25|$|A <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{and hear}} stories is {{essential}} to the species Homo sapiens second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day's events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

50|$|An {{electronic}} control module typically gets its input from sensors (speed, temperature, pressure, etc.) that it uses in its computation. Various actuators are used to enforce the actions determined by the module (turn the cooling fan on, change gear, etc.). The modules <b>need</b> <b>to</b> exchange data among themselves during the normal operation of the vehicle. For example, the engine <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the transmission what the engine speed is, and the transmission <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> other modules when a gear shift occurs. This <b>need</b> <b>to</b> exchange data quickly and reliably {{led to the development}} of the vehicle network, as the medium of data exchange.|$|R

On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance."

Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her.

However, he added {{that there would be}} some funny moments in the lead up to the big revelation. Not long after the camp-out incident, Scotty lets his attraction to Chris get the better of him and he tries to kiss Chris. Uhlich explained [...] "There's no mistaking this as Scotty hitting on Chris. He's really put it out there now, but Chris doesn't go for it.

[...] The same day, Vibe published a list in which Smith ranked all thirteen music videos from the worst to the best; he stated: [...] "B'Day Video Anthology Album must be heralded as an important pop culture artifact. As expressed before, it's the birther of Beyoncé's passion for providing fans visual sequences they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> an album’s story. Imagine a B'Day without its Anthology—although the go-go and funk infused tracks already made an impression upon audio listens only, the visuals made the record pop to life." ...|$|E
