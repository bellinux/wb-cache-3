5|$|In {{order to}} give its astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions. This would have first seen cooperative missions between <b>NASA</b> <b>and</b> the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from <b>NASA,</b> <b>and</b> one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would have flown a two-man Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions. Other proposed missions included tests of the Astronaut Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between <b>NASA</b> <b>and</b> the optics {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E
