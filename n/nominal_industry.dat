40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2001. The study aims to {{research}} the performance {{of past and present}} motor industry policy in South Africa - with special reference to Phase VI of the local content programme and the Motor Industry Development programme (MIDP) - {{in the light of the}} domestic macroeconomic environment and global developments in the world automotive industry. The overall objective of this dissertation is to contribute to the debate on motor industry policy which concerns what future policy would be appropriate for the development of a viable and competitive motor vehicle industry. Thus this study is primarily policy-oriented, and the empirical analysis produced deals with important developments in the local motor and component industries and attempts to examine key variables to establish the likely impact of industry-specific policy changes - both past and future. The method of investigation involves the study of relevant theoretical literature regarding domestic automotive policy, and considers policies of low-volume automobile producing economies, especially Australia, Philippines, India and Malaysia. Also, empirical data of various sub-sectors of manufacturing in South Africa were examined and compared to the motor vehicle sector in order to determine the extent to which the macroeconomic state of the domestic economy as distinct from automotive policy might explain the performance of the South African motor industry. The dissertation presents a review of the local content programme of motor industry policy in South Africa since the early 1960 s. It examines the claim that import-substituting policy in the motor industry actually had a negative impact on the country's balance of payments. The study finds questionable whether local content policy contributed significantly to the large net foreign exchange usage by the motor industry in real terms. There is evidence that increases in the <b>nominal</b> <b>industry</b> trade deficit can largely be explained by the weakening of the Rand, especially during the mid- 1980 s. Also, empirical data was used to make an examination of the performance of automotive exports under Phase VI and the MIDP in the context of economy-wide trade liberalization. It was found that exports of automotive products grew significantly under both Phase VI and the MIDP in real Rand terms. Thus, it seems probable that industry-specific policy played a major role in the strong export performance of the sector since the late 1980 s through to the 1990 s. The study then reviews the revised version of the impact of the MIDP and considers the future of the industry. The state of the domestic macroeconomic environment and globalization of the international automobile industry, including the influence of Transnational Corporations' (TNCs') strategies, will undoubtedly determine the future direction of South Africa's automotive sector. In the short to medium term, we might expect an increase in imported vehicles and some rationalization of the industry. Over the longer term, the possibility of fewer OEMs and component suppliers, and automotive exports are likely to rise as trade and the inflow of foreign investment accelerates due to foreign collaboration and global competition. A simple theoretical model applicable to the South African automotive industry attempts to show the welfare implications of a protective automotive regime (similar to Phase VI) and compares it with that of a more liberal (tariffs-only) automotive regime that may be considered as a likely policy-option for South Africa post-MIDP. The theoretical analysis indicates that the tariffs-only policy is superior to that of a more protective regime in that static efficiency losses are lower. However, the dynamic effects of such policy changes and of possible TNC responses to them, which are referred to in the previous paragraph, are not included in this simple model...|$|E

This estimate holds for several sectors within manufacturing. The response of nominal wage growth to unexpected inflation is around 0. 1, indicating a striking departure from the 'classical' assumption of full indexation.

We calculate, compare and analyze several measures of trade protection across agricultural, manufacturing and service <b>industries.</b> <b>Nominal</b> protection levels for both realized and nominal (published) tariff rates are calculated. Balassa and Corden measures of effective protection are constructed using both of these tariff rates. The focus is on highlighting the properties of each measure and on the difficulties of choosing a single measure of protection.

A number of sectors exhibit negative effective protection rates, however, when realized tariff rates are used. In addition, the latter measure shows a greater variability and a different ranking of sectors as compared to the nominal tariff based measure. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{issues involved}} in calculating a value added index {{in order to measure}} real value added at the industry level. Three methods of calculating real value added are considered; the Laspeyres double-deflation method recommended by the Utzired Nations System of Nation Accounts, the commonly used single-deflation method, and the double-deflation Divisia method. Actual data are employed to clarify and illustrate the issues involved, and the paper concludes with a recommenda-tion for an appropriate index to use when calculating industry real value added. Real value added is the key to understanding the contribution of the primary inputs, the economies of scale, and technical change in the production process. Historical and contemporary changes in "pure " productivity of an industry can be analyzed by observing real value added data. <b>Industry</b> <b>nominal</b> value added is easy enough to calculate, it is simply the difference between the value of the industry's output and the industry's cost of materials or intermediate inputs. Adjusting nominal value added for price changes in order to calculate real value added is much less straightforward. In defining real value added one encounters index number problems as well as some problems unique to value added itself...|$|R
40|$|Using {{annual data}} for 450 {{manufacturing}} industries {{over the period}} 1958 to 1989, we establish the following stylized facts on the response of <b>industry</b> <b>nominal</b> wage growth to aggregate and industry influences:; 1. We find support for the canonical wage contracts model outlined in Blanchard and Fischer (1989). The elasticity of response of nominal wage growth to expected inflation is 0. 7. The dasticity of nominal wage growth with respect to changes in unexpected inflation is 0. 1.; 2. These elasticity estimates are robust to splitting the sample along various dimensions: level of unionization, durability of the product, and industry contract length. The elasticity of nominal wage growth to expected inflation ranges from 0. 6 to 0. 8; the elasticity with respect to unexpected inflation is between 0. 1 and 0. 2.; 3. We find support for the multi-sector wage indexation models of Duca and VanHoose (199]) and others. The profit-sharing elasticity (the response of industry wage growth to industry profit growth) is positive, as hypothesized in these models.

40|$|In 2006, {{after years}} of stagnating and even {{significantly}} declining production, the construction industry finally experienced a year of strong growth (Table 1). In <b>nominal</b> terms, the <b>industry</b> expanded by 7 % in 2006. After allowing for price increases, there was real growth of almost 5 %, much higher than expected. Admittedly, one cause of this expansion was {{the effect of a}} VAT increase announced for 1 January 2007. A large number of both public and private investors brought projects forward to 2006 to avoid the increased VAT charges. Yet at the beginning of 2007, undiminished high construction production could be observed and {{there was no sign of}} the expected backwash effects. In the course of the year, however, the growth rate in construction slowed considerably. There was a steep rise in construction prices at the beginning of 2007. Here, the large increase in VAT as of 1 January 2007 must be taken into account. But even without the effect of higher VAT, the price increase over the previous year amounts to around four percent. This is partly due to higher construction costs. On the other hand, we can assume that companies also experienced an improvement in their earnings. Towards the end of 2007, prices began to stabilize. Nevertheless, the average real growth of construction volume for 2007 was only just under 2 %. In 2008, continued moderate growth is expected for real construction volume. The annual average growth rate should be 1 %. In the new Länder the growth rate should be lower than in the old Länder. Housing demand, Construction industry, Estimates 2008...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering Science) Economic {{modelling}} tools {{have gained}} popularity {{in recent years}} due to the increasing need for greater knowledge to assist policy makers and economists. A number of computational intelligence approaches have been proposed for economic modelling. Most of these approaches focus on the accuracy of prediction and not much research has been allocated to investigate the interpretability of the decisions derived from these systems. This work proposes the use of computational intelligence techniques (Rough set theory (RST) and the Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model) to model the South African economy. RST is a rule-based technique suitable for analysing vague, uncertain and imprecise data. RST extracts rules from the data to model the system. These rules are used for prediction and interpreting the decision process. The lesser the number of rules, {{the easier it is}} to interpret the model. The performance of the RST is dependent on the discretization technique employed. An equal frequency bin (EFB), Boolean reasoning (BR), entropy partition (EP) and the Naïve algorithm (NA) are used to develop an RST model. The model trained using EFB data performs better than the models trained using BR and EP. RST was used to model South Africa’s financial sector. Here, accuracy of 86. 8 %, 57. 7 %, 64. 5 % and 43 % were achieved for EFB, BR, EP and NA respectively. This work also proposes an ensemble of rough set theory and the multi-layer perceptron model to model the South African economy wherein, a prediction of the direction {{of the gross domestic product}} is presented. This work also proposes the use of an auto-associative Neural Network to impute missing economic data. The auto-associative neural network imputed the ten variables or attributes that were used in the prediction model. These variables were: Construction contractors rating lack of skilled labour as constraint, Tertiary economic sector contribution to GDP, Income velocity of circulation of money, Total manufacturing production volume, Manufacturing firms rating lack of skilled labour as constraint, Total asset value of banking <b>industry,</b> <b>Nominal</b> unit labour cost, Total mass of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) mined, Total revenue from sale of PGMs and the Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE).
