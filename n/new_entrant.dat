With more than ten players competing in this institutionalized industry, and with its market size and saturated market penetrations, it is considered highly competitive. In this study, the business strategy of <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> will be evaluated.

25|$|Firms may {{engage in}} Stackelberg {{competition}} {{if one has}} some sort of advantage enabling it to move first. More generally, the leader must have commitment power. Moving observably first is the most obvious means of commitment: once the leader has made its move, it cannot undo it - it is committed to that action. Moving first may be possible if the leader was the incumbent monopoly of the industry and the follower is a <b>new</b> <b>entrant.</b> Holding excess capacity is another means of commitment.|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{market for}} vehicle {{inspection}} is re-regulated since June 2010. More {{than four years}} after the re-regulation there are eight companies in the market. Two of these companies are a result of the former monopolist's owners divided the business among themselves. The remaining six companies have entered the market through acquisitions or by building up their business from scratch, these are known as <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> in the study. The competition has developed slowly and the former monopolist still has the highest market share. Industry conditions are to say the least special because the companies and technicians have to have individual licenses in the form of accreditation and certification, which causes high establishment barriers. The study has the aim of contributing to the knowledge of <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> on the re-regulated vehicle inspection market. In particular, the <b>new</b> <b>entrant’s</b> establishment and their strategic choices are studied to find out how they act to market conditions in order to create competitive advantages. The study is based on four questions: Main Question: How do <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> create competitive advantages in the vehicle inspection market? Sub query 1 : How’s the <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> view on the competitive situation? Sub query 2 : How do the <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> establish their station-/s? Sub query 3 : What strategies do the <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> use to strengthen its position against competitors? The essay is based on an empirical survey and is designed as a case study with four units of analysis that represent four new inspection companies in the market for vehicle inspection. Data were collected through interviews with people in key positions of the four companies, as well with a person of the authority whose task is to monitor market developments, namely the Transport Agency. Furthermore, also documents issued by the authorities and <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> were reviewed. The conclusions that the study has come up with is that the <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> create competitive advantages through a favorable placement of stations, a bit outside the city center. The strict regulation doesn’t allow the <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> to create competitive advantages through new or modified inspection services. Based on these regulations the <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> are trying to attract customers through enhanced service and additional services to the inspection. They try to create a total offering to the customer where the obligatory inspection service is included...|$|R

50|$|Interconnectedness. Since {{communications}} services exhibit network effects and positive externalities, <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> would face {{barriers to entry}} if they could not interconnect their networks {{with those of the}} incumbent carriers. Thus, another key provision of the 1996 Act sets obligations for incumbent carriers and <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> to interconnect their networks with one another, imposing additional requirements on the incumbents because they might desire to restrict competitive entry by denying such interconnection or by setting terms, conditions, and rates that could undermine the ability of the <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> to compete.|$|R

This new cable increases {{the total number}} of submarine cables connecting Jamaica {{to the rest of the}} world to four. Cable and Wireless Communications (parent company of LIME) acquired the company in late 2014 and replaced their brand LIME with FLOW.

Maxjet applied for rights between Seattle and Shanghai using an all business class configured Boeing 767-200ER. US Airways was granted rights by the DOT over Maxjet citing more seat availability and greater connecting possibilities with the US Airways bid. However, the airline relinquished the DOT authorization for Beijing {{at the end of}} 2009.|$|E

25|$|Eventually a chain {{will come}} to an end, usually with a <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> into the system or when the last unit in a chain is abandoned, merged, or destroyed. This can involve a new {{employee}} recruit or a housing unit on market for the first time, or when {{a house in the}} chain is torn down, left empty, or the duties of a vacant job are distributed among other employees. A vacancy chain is simply the sequence of moves that a vacancy makes from initial entry into a system to final termination. The distribution of material resources and social positions through vacancy chain processes requires that the things distributed possess a number of abstract qualities. These qualities include that the resource units in question are reusable, discrete, identifiable, and utilized by one individual or social group at a time.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} {{route to}} be terminated {{took place in}} October 1992, with {{the closing of the}} Visby route. The other main newcomer on the market, Malmö Aviation, gave up its routes from Malmö to London in early 1993, and Transwede took over the concession from April 1993. It followed up on 9 May with commencing a scheduled service from Halmstad Airport to Stockholm, with three daily round trips. Sundsvall to Stockholm commenced services on 19 September. As the airline regarded the MD-80s as too large for domestic services, they leased five 107-seat Fokker 100s, with an option for two more. The options were effectuated to allow Transwede to start services from Stockholm to Jönköping from 25 March 1994. The two MD-87s were subsequently leased out. In order to avoid another competitor on the Jönköping route, Transwede bought the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> Falcon Aviation who planned to start that route as well.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Air New Zealand's {{financial}} position was deteriorating, and Ansett was losing market share to both Qantas and a <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> on the Australian domestic market, Virgin Blue. The Air New Zealand board {{decided that the}} answer was to spend still more money, and buy Virgin Blue as well as Ansett. On condition that that deal went through, SIA was prepared to fund the purchase of 32 new aircraft for the Air New Zealand group. Virgin Blue, however, was growing fast, largely {{at the expense of}} Ansett; the initial A$120 million offer was deemed insufficient and in August Virgin Blue owner Sir Richard Branson, with his customary gift for publicity, put an end to negotiations when he tore up on television what he claimed was a A$250 million Air New Zealand cheque. Although the offer may have been genuine the cheque was not - it was actually a cheque from a book of one of the airport managers drawn on a Qantas' staff credit union account.|$|E
25|$|Royal Challengers Bangalore {{started their}} {{season with a}} blitz from AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli against SRH at Bengaluru, to comfortably win their first match. A bludgeoning century from Quinton de Kock meant RCB lost their second match of the season. Their form {{deteriorated}} in the coming matches, winning only one match of the next five. Although, Virat Kohli and AB de Villier's brilliant form, along {{with the emergence of}} KL Rahul as an important member of RCB's batting, were positive points. Royal Challengers needed to win at least 6 of their next seven matches to have a chance at qualifying for the playoffs. They won matches against KXIP and Rising Pune Supergiant, the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> in the tournament. But a loss against Mumbai Indians meant they needed 4 wins in 4 matches to qualify. Since then, Virat Kohli found himself in sublime form, with captaincy and the bat. RCB most notably defeated the Gujarat Lions by 144 runs, the highest margin in IPL history, during this 4 match winning streak. Through other match results, RCB ended at an unlikely second position {{at the end of the}} league stage. Virat Kohli dominated the run-scoring list, while Shane Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal collectively topped the wicket taking list at the end of the league stage. They faced the Gujarat Lions in the Qualifier 1 at their home ground, the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. They won by 4 wickets to make it to their third final in nine seasons. They played the final against SRH, again in Bengaluru. RCB lost a hard fought match by 8 runs, to end as runners up in this ninth season of the IPL. This is the third instance of RCB losing the finals in the IPL.|$|E
