25|$|Since valves {{lower the}} pitch, a valve {{that makes a}} pitch too low (flat) creates an {{interval}} wider than desired, while a valve that plays sharp creates an interval narrower than desired. Intonation deficiencies of brass instruments that are independent of the tuning or temperament system are inherent in the physics {{of the most popular}} valve design, which uses a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>valves</b> in combination to avoid redundant and heavy lengths of tubing (this is entirely separate from the slight deficiencies between Western music's dominant equal (even) temperament system and the just (not equal) temperament of the harmonic series itself). Since each lengthening of the tubing has an inversely proportional effect on pitch (Pitch of brass instruments), while pitch perception is logarithmic, there is no way for a simple, uncompensated addition of length to be correct in every combination when compared with the pitches of the open tubing and the other valves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Because of the converging–diverging conguration <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> passage, venturi valves {{have been}} widely used in large {{turbines}} to regulate inlet ow as turbine governing valves for about half a century. From the 1960 s, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> failure incidents have been reported. Improvement to current designs was strongly demanded but, owing to the complicated nature of the uid–structure interaction mechanisms, the basic mechanism causing valve failure is still far from being fully understood. Experimental investigations on a half-scale valve were performed here.

60|$|Description. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>valves</b> in the {{capitulum}} has in this genus acquired its maximum. The number varies {{considerably in}} the same species, and even {{on opposite sides of}} the same individual, and generally increases with age. It is more important, that the number of the whorls in P. cornucopia, and in the two following closely-allied forms, also increases with age. In P. sertus and P. spinosus, even the number of the whorls varies in different individuals, independently of age. The valves are arranged alternately with those above and below; they are generally thick and strong, making the capitulum somewhat massive; in some species they are subject to much disintegration; but in others, the apices of the several valves, especially of the carina and rostrum, are well preserved, and project freely: they are covered with membrane, which, differently from in most species of Scalpellum, either does not bear any spines, or only exceedingly minute points. In all the species there is a sub-rostrum and sub-carina, and often beneath these a second sub-rostrum and sub-carina. In medium-sized specimens there are at least 20 valves in the lowermost whorl. The carina is either straight or curved, but never rectangularly bent, and is always of considerable breadth. None of the valves are added to at their upper ends. The scuta have a deep pit for the adductor muscle. The valves lie either some little way apart, or more commonly close together. In P. mitella the scuta and terga are locked together by a fold, and the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other in a peculiar manner, resembling that in which the compartments in the shells of Sessile Cirripedes fold over each other.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{backward}} flow of piezoelectric pumps, this paper presents a single-active-chamber piezoelectric membrane pump with multiple passive check valves. Under the condition of a fixed total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passive check <b>valves,</b> by means <b>of</b> changing the inlet valves and outlet valves’ configuration, the pumping characteristics in terms of flow rate and backpressure are experimentally investigated. Like the maximum flow rate and backpressure, the testing {{results show that the}} optimal frequencies are significantly affected by changes in the number inlet valves and outlet valves. The variation ratios of the maximum flow rate and the maximum backpressure are up to 66 % and less than 20 %, respectively. Furthermore, the piezoelectric pump generally demonstrates very similar flow rate and backpressure characteristics when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> inlet <b>valves</b> in one kind of configuration is the same as that <b>of</b> outlet <b>valves</b> in another configuration. The comparison indicates that the backflow from the pumping chamber to inlet is basically the same as the backflow from the outlet to the pumping chamber. No matter whether the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> inlet <b>valves</b> or the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> outlet <b>valves</b> is increased, the backflow can be effectively reduced. In addition, the backpressure fluctuation can be significantly suppressed with an increase <b>of</b> either inlet <b>valves</b> or outlet valves. It also means that the pump can prevent the backflow more effectively at the cost of power consumption. The pump is very suitable for conditions where more accurate flow rates are needed and wear and fatigue <b>of</b> check <b>valves</b> often occur...|$|R

50|$|The dohc Genesis engine {{has five}} valves per {{cylinder}} and downdraft carburetors. Yamaha adopted the 5-valve concept, using three intake valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, because it allowed both excellent volumetric efficiency and high rpm. As designers began {{to appreciate the}} benefits of multi-valve layout, 4-valves-per-cylinder (and even 3-valves) became common.

The significance of the five-valve engine compared to other multivalve configurations engines is that (like a 3-valver) there were more intake valves than exhaust ones; yet all valves were small and of very similar sizes and weights.
