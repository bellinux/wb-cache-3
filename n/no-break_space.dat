50|$|In {{the table}} above, 0x20 is the regular SPACE character, and 0x9A is the <b>NO-BREAK</b> <b>SPACE.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Punctuation (4): one dot leader (U+2024), <b>no-break</b> <b>space</b> (U+00A0), {{non-breaking hyphen}} (U+2011), Tibetan mark {{delimiter}} tsheg bstar (U+0F0C) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the table}} above, 20 is the regular SPACE character, A0 is the <b>NO-BREAK</b> <b>SPACE,</b> and AD is SOFT HYPHEN.|$|E
50|$|Characters 00-3F and FF are controls, 40 is space, 41 is <b>no-break</b> <b>space,</b> and CA is soft hyphen. Characters {{are shown}} with their {{equivalent}} Unicode codes. Invariant alphanumeric, punctuation, and control characters {{are shown in}} color.|$|E
50|$|Spaces and {{no-break}} {{spaces of}} varying widths: These characters are simply rich text variants {{of the core}} space (U+0020) and <b>No-break</b> <b>Space</b> (U+00A0). Other rich text protocols should be used instead such as tracking, kerning or word-spacing attributes.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} {{varieties}} of ISO/IEC 8859, the lower 128 codes are equivalent to ASCII. The additional characters, apart from <b>no-break</b> <b>space,</b> {{are found in}} Unicode in the same order, only shifted from 0xA1 to U+0E01 and so forth.|$|E
50|$|TIS-620 is the IANA {{preferred}} charset {{name for}} TIS-620, and that charset name is used also for ISO/IEC 8859-11 (which adds a <b>no-break</b> <b>space</b> character at 0xA0, which is unassigned in TIS-620). When the IANA name is used the codes are supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429.|$|E
5000|$|In word {{processing}} and digital typesetting, a non-breaking space (" [...] ") (also called <b>no-break</b> <b>space,</b> non-breakable space (NBSP), hard space, or fixed space) is a space character that prevents an automatic line break at its position. In some formats, including HTML, it also prevents consecutive whitespace characters from collapsing {{into a single}} space.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{versions}} of Microsoft Word, the symbol dialog (often available via Insert > Symbol or Insert > Special Characters), has both the thin {{space and the}} narrow <b>no-break</b> <b>space</b> available for point-and-click insertion. In Word's Symbol dialog, under font = [...] "(normal text)", they are found in subset = [...] "General Punctuation", Unicode character 2009 and nearby. Other word processing programs have ways of producing a thin space.|$|E
5000|$|The word joiner {{replaces the}} zero-width <b>no-break</b> <b>space</b> (ZWNBSP), a {{deprecated}} {{use of the}} Unicode character at code point U+FEFF. Character U+FEFF is intended {{for use as a}} Byte Order Mark {{at the start of a}} file. However, if encountered elsewhere it should, according to Unicode, be treated as a [...] "zero-width non-breaking space." [...] The deliberate use of U+FEFF for this purpose is deprecated as of Unicode 3.2, with the word joiner strongly preferred.|$|E
50|$|ISO-8859-11 {{is not a}} {{registered}} IANA charset name despite following the normal pattern for IANA charsets based on the ISO 8859 series. However, the close equivalent TIS-620 (which lacks the non-breaking space) is registered with IANA, and can without problems be used for ISO/IEC 8859-11, since the <b>no-break</b> <b>space</b> has a code which was unallocated in TIS-620. Microsoft has assigned code page 28601 a.k.a. Windows-28601 to ISO-8859-11 in Windows. A draft had the Thai letters in different spots.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} word {{separator}} is a space (U+0020). However, {{there are other}} word joiners and separators that also indicate a break between words and participate in line-breaking algorithms. The <b>No-Break</b> <b>Space</b> (U+00A0) also produces a baseline advance without a glyph but inhibits rather than enabling a line-break. The Zero Width Space (U+200B) allows a line-break but provides no space: in a sense joining, rather than separating, two words. Finally, the Word Joiner (U+2060) inhibits line breaks and also involves none of the white space produced by a baseline advance.|$|E
50|$|Sentence spacing {{in digital}} media is the {{horizontal}} space between sentences in computer and web-based media. Digital media allow sentence spacing variations not {{possible with the}} typewriter. Most digital fonts {{permit the use of}} a variable space or a <b>no-break</b> <b>space.</b> Some modern font specifications, such as OpenType, have the ability to automatically add or reduce space after punctuation, and users may be able to choose sentence spacing variations. Modern fonts that allow spacing variations will allow the average user the ability to easily manipulate the following spaces: non-breaking short spaces (thin spaces), non-breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), and breaking long spaces (em spaces).|$|E
5000|$|The table {{below is}} based on CCSID 037, one of the code page {{variants}} of EBCDIC; it shows only the basic (English) EBCDIC characters. Characters 00-3F and FF are controls, 40 is space, 41 is <b>no-break</b> <b>space</b> (RSP: [...] "Required Space"), E1 is numeric space (NSP: [...] "Numeric Space"), and CA is soft hyphen. Characters are shown with their equivalent Unicode codes. Unassigned codes are typically filled with international or region-specific characters in the various EBCDIC code page variants, but the punctuation marks and other special characters, such as cent sign, are often moved around as well; only the letters and numbers and space have the same assignments in all EBCDIC code pages.|$|E
