5|$|In January 2007, the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in the NFL in its 1950 season as Adamle was named team captain, replacing Lou Saban following his retirement.

5|$|Adamle {{was again}} {{one of eight}} Browns chosen for the Pro Bowl after Cleveland's 1951 season, when the team reached the {{championship}} game but lost to the Los Angeles Rams. He was named a first-team All-Pro by United Press International and the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News after the season, when he had one interception and one fumble recovery. He was used mainly as an outside linebacker in Cleveland's 5-3 defense later in his career, only attempting three rushes in the 1950s. Adamle finished college at Kent State University in 1950, earning a bachelor's degree, and received a master's degree in education from Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1951.|$|E
5|$|By early 2011, Hughes's {{velocity}} on {{his fastball}} was down several mph; John Harper of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News speculated that Hughes's overuse of the cutter was to blame, not a dead arm.

In early May, Hughes dropped the cutter from his repertoire, using it only 1.2% of the time {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

In 1926, Hickok was diagnosed with diabetes, and Morse persuaded her take a year's leave from the newspaper so the pair could travel to San Francisco and Hickok could write a novel. At the beginning of the leave, however, Morse unexpectedly eloped with an ex-boyfriend, leaving Hickok devastated. Unable to face a return to Minneapolis, Hickok moved to New York, landing a job with the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> Mirror.|$|E

5|$|The BMT Astoria Line {{extension}} to LaGuardia Airport {{has been suggested}} as part of LaGuardia's long-range expansion/renovation plan.

The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News editorial board came out in support of this extension on February 21, 2017, detailing why this route is superior to Governor Andrew Cuomo's plan for an AirTrain from LaGuardia to Willets Point.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, Van Buren was {{considered}} one of {{the best players in the}} league. Before the season, he signed a three-year contract to remain with the Eagles, dispelling rumors that he planned to join the rival All-America Football Conference. He returned just five punts in the 1946 season, but ran one of them back fifty yards for a touchdown against the Boston Yanks in the final game of the year. It was the last punt Van Buren returned in his career. He finished the season with 529 rushing yards, third-most behind leader Bill Dudley of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rookie Pat Harder of the Chicago Cardinals. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News and a second-team All-Pro by the United Press.|$|E

5|$|Graham {{finished}} {{the season with}} the most passing yards in the AAFC and was named the league's Most Valuable Player, sharing the honor with Frankie Albert of the 49ers. Motley {{led the league in}} rushing, and Groza scored the most field goals in the league {{for the second year in}} a row. Speedie, meanwhile, had the most overall receptions and receptions per game of all receivers in the AAFC and NFL for the second year running. The Associated Press named Graham, Speedie and Motley to the first team of its combined AAFC-NFL All-Pro team, while Lou Rymkus and Bill Willis made the second team. The magazine Sporting News put Motley and Speedie on its first-team All-Pro list and put Graham and Willis on its second team. Cleveland's top players also made All-Pro teams assembled by the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News, United Press International and the AAFC itself.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E
5|$|Perry {{became the}} first player to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards in {{consecutive}} seasons, when he did so in 1953 and 1954. His 1,018 yards rushing in 1953 and 1,049 in 1954 were the third and second highest totals for a single season in the NFL, respectively, behind only Steve Van Buren's 1,146 yards in 1949. He led the league in carries, rushing yards, rushing yards per game, and yards from scrimmage in both seasons. His ten rushing touchdowns and 13 total touchdowns in 1953 were both the most in the NFL that year. Perry, McElhenny, and Tittle comprised the offensive backfield of that year's Pro Bowl. The Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), and <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> News each named Perry their first-team All-Pro fullback. Morabito awarded Perry an extra five dollars for every yard he gained in 1953, for a total bonus of $5,090.|$|E
