40|$|Abstract A school voucher would {{decrease}} property values in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> good {{public schools and}} increase property values in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> inferior public schools. These potential gains and losses may influence voting on voucher initiatives, particularly for homeowners without school children. This paper examines that possibility, using a survey of potential voters on California's 2000 voucher initiative. We find evidence that homeowners voted to protect their property values. For homeowners without school children, the probability of voting for the voucher was 39 percent if they lived in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> good public schools and 56 percent if they lived in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> inferior schools...|$|R

5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>with</b> potential buyers unwilling {{to take a chance}} on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E
5|$|MD7 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US40 (Pulaski Highway) in Rosedale {{just east of}} the Baltimore city line. The highway heads north then immediately turns east at a three-way intersection; the west leg of the intersection is Old Philadelphia Road, which is unsigned MD7BA. MD7 heads northeast as a two-lane street through a residential <b>neighborhood</b> <b>with</b> scattered businesses and industrial properties as well as a crossing of Redhouse Creek. The route intersects MD588 (Golden Ring Road) and expands to a five-lane road with center turn lane before meeting Interstate695 (I-695) (Baltimore Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. MD7 continues east past The Centre at Golden Ring shopping center, crossing Stemmers Run before its intersection with Rossville Boulevard in Rossville. The state highway reduces to two lanes and continues northeast through residential subdivisions on the westbound side and industrial facilities on the eastbound side of the highway.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 2014, {{the network}} was {{approved}} by New York City's Franchise and Concession Review Committee. Installation of two stations on Third Avenue—at 15th and 17th Streets—began on December 28, 2015, followed by other Links on Third Avenue below 58th Street, {{as well as on}} Eighth Avenue. After some delays, the first Links went online in January 2016. The public network was announced in February 2016. Locations like St. George, Jamaica, South Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue were prioritized for LinkNYC kiosk installations, with these places receiving Links by the end of 2016. By mid-July 2016, the planned roll-out of 500 hubs throughout New York City was to occur, though the actual installation proceeded at a slower rate. , there were 400 hubs in three boroughs (most of which were in Manhattan along lower Second Avenue, Third Avenue, Eighth Avenue, upper Amsterdam Avenue, Lafayette Street, parts of Broadway, and the Bowery; at least 25 along Grand Concourse and in Fordham in the Bronx; and some along Queens Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in Queens). In November 2016, the first two Links were installed in Brooklyn, along Fulton Street in the Bedford–Stuyvesant <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>with</b> plans to install nine more Links in various places around Brooklyn before year's end, especially around Prospect Park and LIU Brooklyn. Around this time, Staten Island also received its first Links, which were installed in New Dorp. The Links were being installed at an average pace of ten per day throughout the boroughs with a projected goal of 500 hubs by the end of 2016. , there were 920 Links installed across the city.|$|E

We examine the distribution of health outcomes and health transitions using descriptive analysis and explore the determinants of these distributions by estimating the contributions of family SES, unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence and also allowing for heterogeneity of state dependence parameters across categories of neighborhood status. Our analysis indicates that children living in poorer <b>neighborhoods,</b> in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> lower education levels and in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> more families headed by lone-parents tend to experience poor health status for longer after a transition to it, while children tend to experience multiple health drops living in poorer <b>neighborhoods,</b> in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> less educated people, in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> more families headed by lone-parents and in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> more families living in rental accommodation.

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} examine {{characteristics}} of <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> changing older adult populations. Method: We used 30 years (1980 - 2011) {{of data from}} four U. S. cities (n = 392 neighborhoods; Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California) and finite mixture modeling to identify trajectory classes: <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> “stable,” declining, or increasing older adult populations (≥ 65 years). We then compared mean baseline and change in their characteristics. Results: <b>Neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> an increasing (vs. “stable”) percentage of older adult populations had lower initial poverty and greater increases in education and income, with lower increases in road connectivity, population density, and housing prices/debt over time. The same was true for <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> declining older adult populations, {{with the exception of}} having higher increases in housing prices/debt. We observed few significant differences in neighborhood amenities or parks across classes. Conclusion: Our results emphasize the need to consider built and social environments when planning communities for older adults...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{dramatic}} changes in the earth’s landscape have prompted increased interest in the links between population, land use, and land cover. Previous research emphasized the notion of population pressure (population pressure increases demands on natural resources causing changes in land use), overlooking the potentially important effects of changes in land use on humans. Using multiple data sets from the Chitwan Valley Family Study in Nepal, we test competing hypotheses about the impact of land use on first birth timing. We argue that while agricultural land should encourage early childbearing, land area devoted to public infrastructure should discourage it. The results show that individuals from <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> larger proportions of land under agriculture experienced first birth at rates higher than those from <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> smaller proportions. On the other hand, indi-viduals from <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> larger proportions of land under public infrastructure experienced first birth at rates lower than those from <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>with</b> smaller proportions. However, the effects of public infrastructure are not as strong as the land area devoted to agriculture...|$|R
