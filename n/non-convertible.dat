The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for periods ranging from several years to indefinitely (the latter for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia in banknotes and coins, and for Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia in banknotes only). The earliest coins to become <b>non-convertible</b> were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.|$|E

25|$|In 1960 the {{government}} enacted the Real Estate Investment Trust Act {{to allow the}} creation of the real estate investment trust (REIT) to encourage real estate investment, and in 1977 Bank of America issued the first private label pass-through. In 1983 the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation T to allow broker-dealers to use pass-throughs as margin collateral, equivalent to over-the-counter <b>non-convertible</b> bonds. In 1984 {{the government}} passed the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act to improve the marketability of private label pass-throughs, which declared nationally recognized statistical rating organization AA-rated mortgage-backed securities to be legal investments equivalent to Treasury securities and other federal government bonds for federally charted banks (such as federal savings banks and federal savings associations), state-chartered financial institutions (such as depository banks and insurance companies) unless overridden by state law before October 1991 (which 21 states did), and Department of Labor–regulated pension funds.|$|E
25|$|The Mongol {{administration}} had issued paper currencies from 1227 on. In August 1260, Kublai {{created the first}} unified paper currency called Chao; bills were circulated throughout the Yuan domain with no expiration date. To guard against devaluation, the currency was convertible with silver and gold, and the government accepted tax payments in paper currency. In 1273, Kublai issued {{a new series of}} state sponsored bills to finance his conquest of the Song, although eventually a lack of fiscal discipline and inflation turned this move into an economic disaster. It was required to pay only in the form of paper money. To ensure its use, Kublai's government confiscated gold and silver from private citizens and foreign merchants, but traders received government-issued notes in exchange. Kublai Khan is considered to be the first fiat money maker. The paper bills made collecting taxes and administering the empire much easier and reduced the cost of transporting coins. In 1287, Kublai's minister Sangha created a new currency, Zhiyuan Chao, to deal with a budget shortfall. It was <b>non-convertible</b> and denominated in copper cash. Later Gaykhatu of the Ilkhanate attempted to adopt the system in Iran and the Middle East, which was a complete failure, and shortly afterwards he was assassinated.|$|E
2500|$|To {{compensate}} for having additional value through {{the option to}} convert the bond to stock, a convertible bond typically has a coupon rate {{lower than that of}} similar, <b>non-convertible</b> debt.

2500|$|Despite {{a history}} of Ponzi schemes, the {{continuing}} decline in interest rates, rapid financialisation of household savings, lack of financial literacy and investor awareness, political patronage, absence of adequate legal deterrence, and regulatory arbitrage encouraged the growth of similar companies. These companies either raised their funds through legitimate channels such as collective investment schemes, <b>non-convertible</b> debentures and preference shares, or illegitimately through hoax financial instruments such as teak bonds, potato bonds or fictitious ventures in agro-export, construction and manufacturing. , 80% of multi-level marketing and finance schemes against which complaints have been received are based in West Bengal, giving the state the title of [...] "Ponzi capital of India".

2500|$|Typical wages {{range from}} 400 <b>non-convertible</b> Cuban pesos a month, for a factory worker, to 700 {{per month for}} a doctor, or a range of around 17–30 US dollars per month. However, the Human Development Index of Cuba still ranks {{much higher than the}} vast {{majority}} of Latin American nations. After Cuba lost Soviet subsidies in 1991, malnutrition resulted in an outbreak of diseases. Despite this, the poverty level reported by the government is one of the lowest in the developing world, ranking 6th out of 108 countries, 4th in Latin America and 48th among all countries. Pensions are among the smallest in the Americas at $9.50/month. In 2009, Raúl Castro increased minimum pensions by 2 dollars, which he said was to recompense for those who have [...] "dedicated a great part of their lives to working... and who remain firm in defense of socialism".|$|E
2500|$|Though {{only three}} Parnall Pixies were built, they {{appeared}} with a remarkable variety of wings; a normal span monoplane (Pixie I); a short span monoplane (Pixie II); a biplane readily convertible to a monoplane (Pixie IIIA); and a <b>non-convertible</b> monoplane {{version of the}} latter, with a greater span than the Pixie I. [...] The first Pixie was designed {{to compete in the}} Lympne Light Aeroplane Trials of 1923, organised by the Royal Aero Club for what they described as single-seat motor-gliders. The intention was to develop economical private aviation, so the engine size was limited to 750 cc with immediate consequences for aircraft size and weight. Various sponsors provided attractive prizes, particularly the total of £1500 jointly from the Duke of Sutherland and the Daily Mail. The event took place from 8–13 October 1923. There were many entrants from the British aviation industry, including the de Havilland Humming Bird, Gloster Gannet and Vickers Viget. [...] The Pixie I first flew, at Filton on 13 September 1923, in good time for the competition.|$|E
60|$|Knox {{knew the}} {{difference}} between the ideal and the practical. It was the ideal that all <b>non-convertible</b> Catholics 'should die the death.' But the ideal was never made real; the State was not prepared to oblige the Kirk in this matter. It was the ideal that any of 'the brethren,' conscious of a vocation, and seeing a good opportunity, should treat an impenitent Catholic ruler as Jehu treated Jezebel. But if any brother had consulted Knox as to the propriety of assassinating Queen Mary, in 1561-67, he would have found out his mistake, and probably have descended the Reformer's stairs much more rapidly than he mounted them.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Non-convertible</b> debentures, {{which are}} simply regular debentures, cannot be {{converted}} into equity shares of the liable company.

5000|$|Rodríguez Saá's {{economic}} team {{came up with}} a scheme designed to preserve the convertibility regime, dubbed the [...] "Third Currency" [...] Plan.

50|$|For example, Germany {{had gone}} off the gold {{standard}} in 1914, and could not effectively return to it because War reparations had cost it much of its gold reserves. During the Occupation of the Ruhr the German central bank (Reichsbank) issued enormous sums of <b>non-convertible</b> marks to support workers who were on strike against the French occupation and to buy foreign currency for reparations; {{this led to the}} German hyperinflation of the early 1920s and the decimation of the German middle class.|$|E

50|$|As {{the early}} 20th century gold {{standard}} was undermined by inflation {{and the late}} 20th century fiat dollar hegemony evolved, and as banks proliferated and engaged in more complex transactions {{and were able to}} profit from dealings globally on a moment's notice, these practices became mandatory, if only to ensure that there was some limit on the ballooning of money supply. Such limits have become harder to enforce. The People's Bank of China retains (and uses) more powers over reserves because the yuan that it manages is a <b>non-convertible</b> currency.|$|E
50|$|A capital {{structure}} arbitrageur seeks {{to profit from}} differential pricing of various instruments issued by one corporation. Consider, for example, traditional bonds, and convertible bonds. The latter are bonds that are, under contracted-for conditions, convertible into shares of equity. The stock-option component of a convertible bond has a calculable value in itself. The value of the whole instrument should be {{the value of the}} traditional bonds plus the extra value of the option feature. If the spread (the difference between the convertible and the <b>non-convertible</b> bonds) grows excessively, then the capital-structure arbitrageur will bet that it will converge.|$|E
50|$|The 900 sedan was {{introduced}} in Geneva 1980, {{as a result of}} dealer pressure. This introduction corresponded with the phase-out of the old Saab B engine in favor of the lighter Saab H engine. In the early 1980s, most 900s were produced in Trollhättan. However, coinciding with the production of the 9000, more 900's were produced elsewhere. The Valmet plant in Finland, referenced below under the 900C, also produced the <b>non-convertible</b> as evidenced by one previously owned by this author and imported by the SAAB US distributor. The plant in Arlöv (now closed), near Malmö, also produced some 900s.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{a number}} of causes of high inflation. However, most hyperinflations have been caused by {{government}} budget deficits financed by money creation. Peter Bernholz analysed 29 hyperinflations (following Cagan's definition) and concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way. A necessary condition for hyperinflation is the use of paper money, instead of gold or silver coins. Most hyperinflations in history, with some exceptions, such as the French hyperinflation of 1789-1796, occurred after the use of fiat currency became widespread in the late 19th century. The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a <b>non-convertible</b> paper currency, the assignats.|$|E
50|$|To {{influence}} the money supply, some central banks may require that {{some or all}} foreign exchange receipts (generally from exports) be exchanged for the local currency. The rate {{that is used to}} purchase local currency may be market-based or arbitrarily set by the bank. This tool is generally used in countries with <b>non-convertible</b> currencies or partially convertible currencies. The recipient of the local currency may be allowed to freely dispose of the funds, required to hold the funds with the central bank for some period of time, or allowed to use the funds subject to certain restrictions. In other cases, the ability to hold or use the foreign exchange may be otherwise limited.|$|E
5000|$|The Soviet {{currency}} (ruble) was <b>non-convertible</b> after 1932 (when {{trade in}} gold-convertible [...] "chervonets", introduced by Lenin in NEP years, was suspended) {{until the late}} eighties. It was impossible (both for citizens and state-owned businesses) to freely buy or sell foreign currency even though the [...] "exchange rate" [...] was set and published regularly.Buying or selling foreign currency on a black market was a serious crime until the late eighties. Individuals who were paid from abroad (for example writers whose books were published abroad) normally had to spend their currency in a foreign-currency-only chain of state-owned [...] "Beryozka" [...] ("Birch-tree") stores. Once a free conversion of currency was allowed, the exchange rate plummeted from its official values by almost a factor of 10.|$|E
