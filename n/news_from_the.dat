5|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some {{of the success of the}} evacuation measures. Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome as a symbol of the flooding occurring in New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's main {{newspapers}} {{are owned by}} the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the two halves of the country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula. The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.|$|E

5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an Oblivion release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during a conference call with analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion. News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing Hot Coffee minigame controversy, worse than average sales for the company's flagship , sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> people around him and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of}} the road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
5|$|Barring a few {{exceptions}} where Trijata is cast as Ravana's agent, she is generally portrayed as a friend and loyal companion of Sita in her adversity. On numerous occasions, she offers solace to Sita and brings <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside world; she also dissuades Sita from committing suicide. After Rama's victory and Ravana's death, Trijata is richly rewarded by Sita and Rama. While some Ramayana adaptations mention her being a devotee of Rama, Southeast Asian versions often depict her as the wife of Rama's monkey general Hanuman, whom she bears a son. She is worshipped as a local goddess in Varanasi and Ujjain; both in India.|$|E

5|$|During {{the chaos}} of the battle, Major General Yu Jai Hung of the ROK II Corps did not receive <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front line until midnight of November 25 — five hours after the Chinese had entered the Korean rear. Responding to the crisis, Hung {{committed}} the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment of the 6th Infantry Division to block the Chinese divisions. As the 2nd Infantry Regiment marched towards the front on the morning of November 26, the PVA 113th Division intercepted the regiment and destroyed its command post, scattering the ROK II Corps' entire reserve in the process. With most the ROK II Corps' units destroyed by November 27, the UN right flank had fallen to the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{tries to}} {{introduce}} another murder and other twists {{to the story}} to pull his staff back into the party. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns the phone calls to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin {{is expected to be}} insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> staff and nudges them back into the party. Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home, and the others pretend to shoot each other to death.|$|E
5|$|Moreau {{accompanied}} Desaix's Left Wing {{with the}} divisions of Delmas and Sainte-Suzanne (vice Beaupuy), Bourcier's Reserve and Saint-Cyr's cavalry and horse artillery which were ineffective in the mountains. Malsch was captured twice by the French and recaptured each {{time by the}} Austrians. Latour tried to force {{his way around the}} French left with cavalry but was checked by the mounted troops of the Reserve. Finding his horsemen outnumbered near Ötigheim, Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay. In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM. In the evening the Austrians were pushing Desaix back when bad <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left flank caused Charles to call a halt.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1903, the {{expedition}} reached Port Stanley, where they received their first <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside world {{since leaving the}} Cape Verde Islands. After a week's rest, Scotia departed for Buenos Aires, where {{she was to be}} repaired and provisioned for another season's work. Bruce had further business in the city; he intended to persuade the Argentine government to assume responsibility for the Laurie Island meteorological station after {{the expedition}}'s departure. During the voyage to Buenos Aires, Scotia ran aground in the Río de la Plata estuary, and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by a tug, on 24 December.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick's {{family was}} {{informed}} {{of his death}} by a neighbor who had heard his name on a radio broadcast, and the <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> military came via telegraph several days later. The family was immediately inundated by reporters and local well-wishers. Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951, a funeral attended by hundreds of local residents was held in Beckley, West Virginia. The service was set {{to coincide with the}} anniversary of the start of the war. His flag-draped casket was escorted down the streets of the town on a horse-drawn carriage, and he was buried at the American Legion cemetery in the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just {{two to three hours}} putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E

5|$|Within {{some of the}} {{destroyed}} suburbs, {{a limited}} postal system between various Robinson groups was established. Dawid Landau {{had served as a}} bodyguard to the courier of the Polish government in exile, Jan Karski, while Karski secretly entered the ghetto to gather information for a report on the extermination of Polish Jews by Nazi Germany for the Western allies, in 1943. Later, Landau fought in both of the Warsaw uprising as part of Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union, ŻZW) and afterward decided to stay in the ruins. In his memoirs he reports that the post functioned through the use of empty electrical socket boxes. Various groups would leave notes for others informing them of who was alive and in hiding, <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front that had been obtained, as well as requests for special forms of assistance. According to Landau, the most common pleas were for doctors or other forms of medical help.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E
5|$|Many {{adaptations of}} the Ramayana narrate the {{friendship}} and companionship developed between Trijata and Sita. Trijata fulfils two important objectives: she comforts Sita and constantly updates Sita about the happenings {{of the war}} and the welfare of Rama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana describes Trijata assuaging Sita's grief when they hear that Indrajit has wounded Rama and Lakshmana a second time. In the Balaramayana of Rajasekhara, Trijata employs two rakshasas to bring her <b>news</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. The Ananda Ramayana narrates that, upon hearing Lakshmana's conch sound, Sita urges Trijata to find out what has happened. Trijata learns of the death of Indrajit by Lakshmana and passes the news to Sita. The Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas also depicts Trijata breaking the news of Indrajit's death to Sita, upon her inquiry. In another episode in the text, the two discuss the impending duel between Rama and Ravana {{on the final day of}} war. Sita is concerned that the ten-headed Ravana is invincible and will magically regrow his severed heads. Trijata reassures Sita that Rama will slay Ravana by shooting an arrow through the demon-king's heart. The text emphasizes that Trijata is a devotee of Rama, a feature also found in the Bhavartha Ramayana.|$|E
