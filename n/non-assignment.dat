5000|$|A {{contract}} {{may contain}} a <b>non-assignment</b> clause, which prohibits {{the assignment of}} specific rights and some various rights, or of the entire contract, to another. However, such a clause does not necessarily destroy the power of either party to make an assignment. Instead, it merely gives the other party the ability to sue for breach of contract if such an assignment is made. However, an assignment of a contract containing such a clause will be ineffective if the assignee knows of the <b>non-assignment</b> clause, or if the <b>non-assignment</b> clause specifies that [...] "all assignments are void".|$|E

5000|$|Trained {{officers}} were also left idle, as {{the plan to}} shift African-American officers into command slots stalled, and white officers not only continued to hold command, but were joined by additional white officers assigned to the post. One rationale behind the <b>non-assignment</b> of trained African-American officers was stated by the commanding officer of the Army Air Forces, General Henry [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold: [...] "Negro pilots cannot be used in our present Air Corps units since this would result in Negro officers serving over white enlisted men creating an impossible social situation." ...|$|E
50|$|Mikrut was testifying {{in favor}} of {{imposing}} a punitive tax on factoring companies that engaged in pursuit of structured settlement payments. Despite the use of <b>non-assignment</b> clauses in annuity contracts to secure the tax advantages for tort victims, companies cropped up that tried {{to take advantage of}} these individuals in ”factoring” transactions, purchasing their periodic payments in return for a deeply discounted lump sump payment. Congress felt that factoring company purchases of structured settlement payments “so directly subvert the Congressional policy underlying structured settlements and raise such serious concerns for the injured victims,” that bills were proposed in both the Senate and the House to penalize companies which engage in such transactions.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the nature of {{assignment}} as it relates to contractual debts and contractual rights in general, before addressing problems presented by <b>non-assignment</b> clauses. 1 The assignment of things in action sits precariously between contract law and property law and <b>non-assignment</b> clauses cannot properly be understood without an appreciation of this hybrid character of assignment. 2 <b>Non-assignment</b> clauses pose the question whether and in what circumstances contractual rights are items of property. They also demand an examination of the doctrine of privity of contract and a response to the question whether one contracting party has the right unilaterally to vary the contract. Finally, <b>non-assignment</b> clauses set two primary values at odds with each other, namely freedom of contract and the free alienation of items of property. To a significant extent, the practical problems presented by <b>non-assignment</b> clauses will diminish when expected secondary legislation nullifying <b>non-assignment</b> clauses in the field of receivables (or book debts) comes into force, 3 but some of the leading cases do not involve receivables and the subject therefore continues to merit attention for practical as well as for theoretical reasons...|$|E
40|$|The {{confused}} {{state of}} most state corporate merger statutes allows many intellectual property licenses {{to find their}} way into unintended hands by way of corporate merger, in spite of <b>non-assignment</b> clauses. Clearly a detriment to licensors, corporate licensees too should be wary of depending upon the merger statute; a court ruling may not go their way. The states must clean up their collective act and bring some much needed certainty to a highly unpredictable intersection of corporate and intellectual property law...|$|E
40|$|The {{rules on}} {{assignment}} and transfer {{of rights and}} obligations are currently {{outside the scope of}} the proposed CESL. In contrast, the original DCFR from 2009 includes a chapter on these issues. Questions outside the scope of CESL are left to be solved by the ‘domestic’ provisions of the national law that is applicable under the relevant conflict-of-laws provisions. This paper is part of the larger CFR Context research project and explores interactions of the system of assignment of receivables under a future European contract instrument with both English and German national laws. This concerns above all other areas of law, for example the rules that apply upon the insolvency of one of the parties (in particular that of the assignor) and the rules on public policy. Key differences between the jurisdictions include, inter alia, the proprietary aspects of the assignor’s insolvency where the assignor is paid by the debtor, the priority rule for competing assignments, and the effects of a <b>non-assignment</b> clause. Here, the choice of the optional instrument rather than either English or German law will lead to diverging results and may therefore prejudice any of the parties involved...|$|E
30|$|However, {{with the}} {{adoption}} of an assignment matrix, as shown by [197, 198, 199], the simultaneous approach assumes a prohibitive computational complexity, even {{in the case of}} medium-size networks. Therefore, {{in order to deal with}} more feasible computational times and, at the same time, adopt a simultaneous approach which is the most suitable from a conceptual point of view, several <b>non-assignment</b> based methods for dynamic O–D matrix estimation have been developed. Within this framework, after pioneering works by [200, 201, 202, 203, 204], more recent contributions proposed {{the adoption of}} evolutionary methods [205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210], simulating annealing techniques [211], bee colony optimisation [212], probe vehicle data [213] and artificial intelligence approaches [214, 215, 216]. Other major contributions are provided by [217, 218] which addressed the simultaneous adjustment of a dynamic traffic demand matrix by means of a gradient approximation approach representing a variant of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) path search optimisation method proposed by [219, 220]. Further variants of the SPSA approach are W-SPSA proposed by [221, 222] and c-SPSA presented by [223]. Similarly, [224] proposed a method based on the use of linear approximations of the assignment matrix in optimisation iterations and tested several specific solution algorithms which differ in the search direction.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransition to {{psychosis}} in at-risk individuals has markedly {{declined in}} recent years. So {{far it has}} never been discussed in detail that with the growing awareness and increasing availability of early psychosis services, a much broader diagnostic spectrum is now being seen in these services. Subsequently, subjects present with symptoms that meet psychosis risk on a purely psychometric basis but may be the phenotypical expression of another underlying mental disorder. Here we critically review four groups of symptoms and clinical features that are frequently reported by individuals with suspected psychosis risk states, yet share strong commonalities with other mental disorders and conditions: isolated hallucinations; unusual bodily perceptions, hypochondriatic fears and cenesthetic psychotic symptoms; depersonalization; obsessive–compulsive, overvalued and delusional ideas. Of the 616 individuals so far assessed in the Bruderholz Early Psychosis Outpatient Service for Adolescents and Young Adults, 218 (30. 5 %) met ultra-high risk (UHR) criteria, 188 (86. 2 %) of whom suffered from one of the four above-mentioned symptom groups. The appraisal of the diagnostic spectra and their overlapping symptoms constitute a tremendous challenge in the clinical assessment of each referred individual. The final conclusion of a clinical assessment should not end with the mere assignment – or <b>non-assignment</b> – to a presumed psychosis risk group, but needs {{to take into account the}} ‘Gestalt’ of these particular symptoms and clinical features and thus be based on many more facets than solely a psychometric or nosological approach. Such an approach may break down the heterogeneous psychosis risk group and enable appropriate treatment regimes...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} is agreement and case assignment, with particular reference to conjoined noun phrases. The initial chapters {{look at the}} different possibilities available in such contexts, including agreement with the features of each individual conjunct, agreement with the features of only one conjunct, or agreement with features computed {{on the basis of}} those of the individual conjuncts but not necessarily possessed by them. We propose a way of handling all of these patterns with a single formal mechanism, later applying the same intuitions to the assignment (or <b>non-assignment)</b> of case values by a head to its dependents. Attempts are also made to explore in greater depth some of the factors that might influence the choice of alternative agreement configurations, as well as to extend the scope of the model which we elaborate as we go along to non-conjoined environments where variable agreement occurs. Special emphasis is laid throughout on fluctuations in agreement, either because the controller has mismatched attributes or because the syntactic structure and/or the semantic interpretation allow variation. The final conclusion is that a modular approach to grammar is best placed to deal with the empirical facts. The complexities of the data call for bringing together purely morpho-syntactic, declensional information, syntactic hierarchy, order and constituency, coupled with semantics and pragmatics. The successful, appropriately regulated, interaction of these modules is shown to offer a satisfactory explanation which is difficult to obtain by exclusively relying on syntax or semantics alone.

40|$|Como o envelhecimento provoca dificuldade na capacidade de dividir a atenção, este estudo visou verificar, em jovens e idosos: (1) a {{eventual}} interferência entre uma tarefa visual e uma motora; (2) se essa interferência (caso exista) ocorre de forma diferente no desempenho de jovens e idosos; (3) se as tarefas propostas têm correlação com testes validados, de seqüência alfanumérica (TMT) e de levantar e caminhar cronometrado (TLCC). A tarefa visual consistiu na verbalização do reconhecimento de duas figuras iguais ou diferentes apresentadas rapidamente. A tarefa motora consistiu na alternância de passos do chão a uma plataforma fixa de 10 cm de altura. As tarefas foram avaliadas isoladas (tarefa-simples) e associadas (tarefa-dupla) em dois grupos: 10 jovens (23 ± 2, 8 anos) e 10 idosos (68, 8 ± 8, 6 anos).

The visual task measured the ability to state whether two quickly presented figures were same or different. The motor task consisted on alternating steps from the ground to a 10 cm-high platform. Tasks were assessed both as single-task (isolated) and dual-task (simultaneous) in two groups: 10 young people (aged 23 ± 2. 8) and 10 elderly (aged 68. 8 ± 8. 6). In the visual task, young volunteers presented less errors than the elderly (p< 0. 001); in both groups no {{increase in the number}} of errors was detected at dual-task when compared to the single-task. At the motor task the elderly presented lower speed in dual-task as compared to the single-task (p= 0. 009). TMT correlated positively to the number of alternations of step (p< 0. 05) and TUGT correlated negatively to the number of alternations of step (p< 0. 05). For both young and elderly, the motor task did not interfere on the visual task; however, the elderly showed lesser speed in the motor task when associated to the visual task. The <b>non-assignment</b> of primality to either task proved useful to detect these interferences...|$|E
40|$|This release {{contains}} the scripts and programs {{used for the}} analysis contained in the Flanagan & Jones Evolution paper. See README_SCA for a full description of each program and script: SCA Analysis README This file contains information about each program used in the selection components analysis paper. GENOME-WIDE SELECTION COMPONENTS ANALYSIS PROGRAMS infer_mat_vcf PURPOSE This program takes a list of fathers and their paired offspring to infer the maternal allele at compatible loci. NOTES Variant Call Format usually has more entries per individual than just genotype (GT), but this program ignores those. Any pruning for allele depth etc. must occur before running this program. INPUT The path for output files A tab-delimited file with the fathers and their paired offspring. One line per pair, with the father in the first column and the offspring in the second column. A vcf file {{with all of the}} fathers and their offspring in it, with the same name as the names found in the father-offspring pair file. Output name OUTPUT A vcf file with only the GT format. The INFO field is no longer relevant but is retained from the original vcf. HOW TO RUN The program currently (5 May 2016) cannot be run interactively or on the command line. I plan to change this in the near future to make it more user-friendly. You must go into the source file and edit the path (where things are), dad_kid_name (name of the father-offspring pairs list file), vcf_name (vcf file name), and summary_name (output vcf) settings. gwsca_biallelic_vcf PURPOSE This program calculates all pairwise FST estimates between groups within a population. NOTES You must provide the program with the assignment of each individual to the groups. This program does not do any filtering, although it does output summary files that will help with filterings steps. INPUT A vcf file A file with each individual's assignment to groups. The file must be tab-delimited and contain six columns: individual ID in the sumstats file, an individual ID (can be the same as the first column), the sex of the individual, the age or other grouping factor, and two columns with phenotype/status of that individual. Assignments should be string factors (e. g. "MALE" or "FEMALE") and <b>non-assignment</b> is a 0. Here are some examples: FileIndID IndID Sex Age Status Phenotype sample_MOM 001 _align MOM 001 0 0 0 MOM sample_FEM 087 _align FEM 087 FEM ADULT 0 0 sample_NPM 005 _align NPM 005 MAL ADULT NONPREG 0 sample_OFF 015 _align OFF 015 0 JUVIE 0 0 sample_PRM 085 _align PRM 085 MAL ADULT PREGNANT 0 OUTPUT File with the Fsts, with a column describing the locus and then columns for each pairwise Fst comparison Summary file containing columns PopID, Chromosome (Chrom), Locus position on chromosome (Pos), Locus Name, Number of individuals genotyped at the locus (N), expected heterozygosity (Hs), observed heterozygosity (Ho), Allele frequency in group 1 (Allele 1 Freq), Allele frequency in group 2 (Allele 2 Freq), the frequency of homozygotes for major allele (AA), frequency of heterozygotes (Aa), and frequency of homozygotes for minor allele (aa). A file containing the index (IndCount), individual ID (IndID), population ID (PopIndex) and Pop ID (PopName) for each individual. Individuals belonging to multiple groups will be listed multiple times, once for each group. HOW TO RUN The program currently (12 December 2016) cannot be run interactively or on the command line. I plan to change this in the near future to make it more user-friendly. You must go into the source file and edit the filename settings. maternal_alleles_sim PURPOSE To simulate the inference of maternal alleles and identify bias. NOTES This is based on actual allele frequencies from a vcf file. The results of the simulation are analyzed in gwsca_biallelic_analysis. R and reported in the supporting information file of the Flanagan & Jones Evolution paper. INPUT A vcf file You must specify the number of offspring to simulate and an error rate. OUTPUT A tab-delimited file containing the locus ID (Locus), reference allele (Ref), alternative allele (Alt), female allele frequency (FemaleAF), male allele frequency (MaleAF), actual maternal allele frequency (ActualMomAF), and the inferred maternal allele frequency (InferredMomAF) HOW TO RUN The program currently (12 December 2016) cannot be run interactively or on the command line. You must go into the source file and edit the filename settings. vcf_to_sca_monnahan PURPOSE The purpose of vcf_to_sca_monnahan is to convert a vcf file into input files for the Monnahan/Kelly python script. NOTES You must provide the file with parent-offspring matches. You can provide a whitelist if there is a subset of loci you would like to convert (rather than the entire vcf file). INPUT A vcf file A text file containing two tab-separated columns, the first containing the parent ID and the second containing the offspring ID. [Optional] A text file containing a list of Locus IDs to convert. All other loci will not be included in the output.
