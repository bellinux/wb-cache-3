25|$|General Jan Christiaan Smuts, {{a member}} of the Imperial War Cabinet, was sent to confer with Allenby {{regarding}} the implementation of a French qualification to the War Office's Joint <b>Note</b> <b>No.</b> 12—that no troops from France could be redeployed to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Smuts was {{on his way back to}} London in February when the first step was taken to accomplish his suggestion of crossing the Jordan River and capturing the Hedjaz Railway, and the front line was extended eastwards with the successful capture of Jericho.|$|E
25|$|On 5 March 1940, {{after the}} Gestapo–NKVD Third Conference {{was held in}} Zakopane, Beria sent a <b>note</b> (<b>no.</b> 794/B) to Stalin in which he stated that the Polish prisoners of war kept at camps and prisons in western Belarus and Ukraine were enemies of the Soviet Union, and {{recommended}} their execution. Most of them were military officers, {{but there were also}} intelligentsia, doctors, priests and others in a total of more than 22,000 people. With Stalin's approval, Beria's NKVD executed them in {{what became known as the}} Katyn massacre.|$|E
25|$|Qualified {{approval}} from the Supreme War Council for a decisive offensive to annihilate Ottoman armies and crush resistance was contained in Joint <b>Note</b> <b>No.</b> 12. It was claimed that {{the destruction of the}} Ottoman Empire 'would have far-reaching results upon the general military situation.' Early in February 1918 General Jan Christiaan Smuts (a member of the Imperial War Cabinet) was sent to confer with Allenby regarding the implementation of the Joint Note. The French imposed an important qualification on the Joint Note; that no British troops in France could be deployed to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Smuts informed Allenby the intention was to reinforce the Egyptian Expeditionary Force with one and possibly a second Indian cavalry division from France, three divisions from Mesopotamia and more artillery and aeroplanes. Smuts also suggested crossing the Jordan, capturing the Hejaz Railway and using it to outflank Damascus.|$|E

25|$|Some non-eusocial insects also {{sanitize}} their nests: {{the wood}} cockroach (Cryptocercus punctulatus) commonly defecates within the nest (this species nests in decaying wood, which often {{has a high}} microbe density), and faeces {{have been found to}} have antifungal activity against M. anisopliae, possibly mediated by microbes. The galleries constructed within spruce trees by spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) are under threat from multiple species of fungus which reduce spruce beetle fitness. Upon fungal invasion, adults begin secreting orally and analysis of these secretions has revealed bacteria with antifungal activity; faecal pellets are used to quarantine off fungally-infested sections of the gallery. A waste management strategy exists in some group living and subsocial species, such as the subsocial De Geer's short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus muticus). 5–10 minutes after defecating and returning to her eggs, A. muticus females return to the fecal pellets and removes them out of the chamber — <b>note</b> <b>no</b> other items are removed from the chamber. Upon discovering a carcass, subsocial N. vespilloides parents upregulate the anitmicrobial activity of their anal exudates and smear them over the carcass - thus sanitizing the resource their brood will soon feast on.|$|E

2500|$|The 1982 Grand Prix was {{a virtual}} re-run of the 1981 model with no {{appearance}} changes to <b>note.</b> <b>No</b> gasoline-powered V8 engines were offered this year (in the U.S. only — Canadian GPs were available with the Chevy 305 V8 {{as an option}} in '82), leaving only the standard [...] Buick V6, a larger Buick [...] V6 and the Olds [...] Diesel V8. The A-body line became front-wheel-drive, leaving the rear-wheel-drive midsize platform as the G-body. The downsized four-door Bonneville was now related to the Grand Prix. The automatic climate control option was also dropped in 1981, leaving just a manual climate controls on all models. Also most 1982 models had a two tone interior. Front suspension was independent with wishbones, coil springs, antiroll bars and telescopic shocks while the rear still had a live axle.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{began their}} attack on British Malaya {{the same day}} as Pearl Harbor. The Japanese entered Malaya {{overland}} from the north and the fortified base of Singapore fell on 15 February 1942 and was held with the rest of Malaya by the Japanese until August 1945. Malaysian scrip is in dollars (Straits or Malayan dollars) and therefore is often, mistakenly, thought to be for the invasion of the United States. In 1942 the Japanese issued paper scrip currency of 1, 5, 10 and 50 cents and 1, 5 and 10 dollars. [...] The 1, 5 and 10 dollar notes initially had serial numbers; these were later omitted. In 1944, inflation lead to the issuing of a 100 dollar note. In 1945, a replacement note 100 dollar bill was issued as well as a hyper-inflation 1,000 note. [...] The 1942 series of notes, including the 50c and 1, 5, 10, and the 1944/45 100 dollar all contained the text [...] “Promise To Pay The Bearer On Demand”. The 1944 100 dollar replacement <b>note</b> <b>no</b> longer contained this message.|$|E
2500|$|General Jan Christiaan Smuts, {{a member}} of the Imperial War Cabinet, had been sent to Palestine in early February to confer with Allenby {{regarding}} the implementation of Joint <b>Note</b> <b>No.</b> 12. At that time he encouraged Allenby in the view that if [...] of the Hejaz Railway near Amman could be destroyed, the Ottoman Army garrisons along the railway south from Amman to Medina would be isolated and weakened, which could result in [...] further Arab uprisings. Allenby had written to General William Robertson, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in late January regarding his wish to cut the Hejaz Railway at Amman– an important Ottoman line of communication to the garrisons to the south of Amman, which would considerably weaken their positions. Without reliable supplies and reinforcements Bedouin and Arab forces in the region could be encouraged to attack and rebel against these weakened Ottoman Empire forces and lengthen Allenby's right. Allenby continues: [...] "If I could destroy 10 or 15 miles of rail and some bridges and get touch with the Arabs under Feisal– even temporarily– the effect would be great." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty {{signed in}} 1952, Article 4 {{stipulates}} that “all treaties, conventions and agreements concluded before December 9, 1941 between Japan and China have become {{null and void}} {{as a consequence of}} the war.” While Peace Treaty of Shimonoseki is certainly a treaty nullified by this provision, however, in terms of international law, a territory once ceded by a legal and effective treaty remains a ceded territory even if the treaty is nullified afterwords. Article 3 stipulates that the disposition of property and claims of Japan and its nationals in Taiwan and Penghu shall be the subject of special arrangements between the governments of the ROC and Japan. And Article 10 stipulates that “nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).” From legal point of view, this provision confirmed that all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) are not nationals of ROC, but merely [...] "deemed as" [...] and to be treated as nationals of ROC for the purpose of the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty. Moreover, <b>Note</b> <b>No.</b> 1 in the Exchange of Notes accompanying the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty stipulates that “the terms of the present Treaty shall, in respect of the Republic of China, be applicable to all the territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government.” Consequently, at that time Japan agreed that Taiwan is a territory under the control of the ROC. However, although Japan recognized ROC's administration over Taiwan, she refrained from recognizing Taiwan as sovereign territory of ROC due to the legal fact that Japan had renounced all right, title and claim to Taiwan in San Francisco Peach Treaty and could not make further disposition of Taiwan sovereignty.|$|E
