50|$|The rose fish (Sebastes norvegicus), {{also known}} as the ocean perch, Atlantic redfish, <b>Norway</b> <b>haddock,</b> red perch, red bream, golden redfish, or hemdurgan, is a deep sea species of {{rockfish}} from the North Atlantic. It is a large, slow-growing, late-maturing fish and the subject of a fishery.|$|E
50|$|The {{deepwater}} redfish (Sebastes mentella), {{also known as}} the beaked redfish, ocean perch, Atlantic redfish, <b>Norway</b> <b>haddock,</b> red perch, golden redfish, or hemdurgan, may reach a size of 55 - 70 cm, but is usually less than 45 cm. It lives in comparatively high concentrations in the North Atlantic, for example in the Irminger Sea where considerable numbers are fished. It occupies depths between 300 and 1000 m and is often pelagic, i.e. far off the bottom. The deep-sea redfish feeds on a variety of food organisms, for example small fishes. In contrast to most fishes that spawn unfertilised eggs, the {{deepwater redfish}} has internal fertilisation and spawns free-living larvae.|$|E
40|$|The 2 m {{beam trawl}} and 1. 5 m push net {{were used to}} sample the small epibenthic fish {{assemblage}} during September on the east and south coasts of England. Fishing stations were distributed along the entire coast within four depth bands to 20 m. A total of 104 species were caught between 1973 and 1995, and these included infrequent Lusitanean species such as the big-scale sand-smelt (Atherina boyeri), and the undulate ray (Raja undulata), and infrequent boreal species such as the <b>Norway</b> <b>haddock</b> (Sebastes viviparus). Fifty-four taxa were selected as representative of the small, demersal inshore fish community that would be most vulnerable to capture by the two sampling gears, and were used in subsequent analyses of community structure. The north-east coast assemblage was the least diverse (H*= 1. 58) and least even (J*= 0. 47). It also supported the least number of species (55), and the variation in catch of the only dominant genus, Pomatoschistus spp., was partly responsible for large year-to-year variations in diversity and in the total population abundance of selected demersal species. On the east and south-east coasts, both diversity (H*= 1. 78 and 1. 93) and evenness (J*= 0. 50 and 0. 51) were greater than in the north, {{as a result of}} large...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a joint survey with two research vessels in July 1985. Total estimates of abundance (N x 10 - 9), were: <b>Norway</b> pout 56, <b>haddock</b> 52, whiting 66 and cod 4. Comparisons are made with a similar survey in July 1984 and with some recruitment estimates from other surveys...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{research}} {{vessels of}} ICES member countries participated, {{in order to}} investigate the strength of incoming yearclasses of commereially most important species. Germany {{took part in the}} investigations by R. V. "Walther Herwig III" from January 23 to February 24. Indices of a total of 330 stations indicate a positive development of the stocks of <b>haddock,</b> <b>Norway</b> pout and sprat whereas indices for cod, whiting, and herring remain in the mean of the last years. Water temperatures were up to 1 K above the longterm mean. Salinities were measured regionally both above and below mean values up to 1 0 / 00...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the 0 -group {{abundance}} of <b>Norway</b> pout and <b>haddock</b> in the North Sea a combined acoustic/trawl survey {{was carried out in}} July - August 1978. The 0 -group of both species were concentrated in a scattering layer between surface and 40 m depth during the night. During the day all the 0 -group Norway pout and most of the 0 -group haddock were found {{in the vicinity of the}} bottom but a minor portion of the 0 -group haddock occurred in scattered schools throughout the entire water column. Acoustic estimates of the 0 -group stocks of the two species amounted to 165 * 10 ^ 9 specimens of Norway pout and 23 * 10 ^ 9 specimens of haddock. The figure for Norway pout compares resonably well with estimates based on independent data, but regarding the haddock the acoustic estimate seems high compared with estimates based on other data sources...|$|R
