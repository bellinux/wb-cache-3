40|$|<b>Neurotisation</b> {{involves}} {{transfer of}} nerves {{for the restoration}} of function following injury. A number of nerves have been used in different part of the peripheral nervous system. This study was undertaken to develop a practical and relatively safe surgical approach to the treatment of L 4 root lesion's. We examined the effectiveness and safety of <b>neurotisation</b> of the deep peroneal nerve and its branches by the superficial peroneal nerve. Twelve legs of dissected cadavers provided for teaching purposes in the anatomy laboratory were used to display the common peroneal nerve and its branches. Each branch was measured using calipers and analysed to investigate the possibility of <b>neurotisation</b> of the deep peroneal nerve by the superficial peroneal nerve and its branches. It was found that of the measured branches, transposition was possible between those to peroneus longus and tibialis anterior {{on the basis of their}} diameter and length. In recent decades, advances in microsurgical reconstruction and understanding of the microanatomy have played major roles in improving the results of surgical treatment of nerve injuries. There is a need for further experimental studies on the feasibility of this surgical approach...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{experimental study}} {{has been carried out}} in rats with denervated gastrocnemius muscles. Three groups of five rats were treated by three different types of implantation of nerve directly into muscle (<b>neurotisation).</b> In the fourth group, the common peroneal nerve was sutured to the transected tibia 1 nerve. The fifth group was left denervated as a control. The muscles were studied by serial electrodiagnostic studies and later histologically. The results showed little difference between nerve suture and implantation of nerve directly into muscle. Extension of the common peroneal nerve with a pair of sural nerve grafts did not produce a detrimental effect. Journal of Hand Surgery (British Volume, 1991) 16 B: 505 - 510 The possibility of <b>neurotisation</b> of denervated skeletal muscles was suggested by Gersuny (1906). Erlacher (1915) and Steindler (1915) independently described the technique of direct implantation of the proximal stump of a severed nerve into denervated mammalian muscle. Since then there have been numerous reports on the nerve regeneration and innervation of muscles (Mc...|$|E

40|$|Opposition, one of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of the hand, is lost or impaired after median nerve injury. Complete recovery does not always occur after treatment, and various techniques of opponensplasty are used for restoring opposition. This study was performed in order to develop an alternative method for selective restoration of thenar muscle function. Ten arms from 5 cadavers were used. The median nerve with its thenar motor branch (Tb) and the anterior interosseous nerve with its motor branch to pronator quadratus (PQb) were prepared in the distal forearm. The mean widths and the number of myelinated fibres of these nerves were: PQb 1. 3 ± 0. 10 mm, Tb 1. 4 ± 0. 12 mm and PQb 912 ± 88 mm, Tb 1020 ± 93 mm. The minimum necessary distance from the distal flexor crease of the wrist for <b>neurotisation</b> of the Tb by the PQb was 60 ± 5. 41 mm. It was concluded that PQb-Tb <b>neurotisation</b> would be possible anatomically. The advantages are that motor function is reestablished with a motor nerve, the diameters and the number of myelinated fibres of both nerves are similar, the loss of function after denervation of the pronator quadratus is slight and opponensplasty still remains as a final option...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic {{brachial plexus}} {{injuries}} rarely recover spontaneously {{and if the}} window period for <b>neurotisation</b> has elapsed, the only option for restoration of function lies in a salvage procedure. Many such salvage procedures have been described in the literature with variable functional results. We report {{the case of a}} 16 -year-old boy who presented after unsuccessful treatment for a complete brachial plexus injury; we performed a pectoralis major tendon transfer to attain elbow flexion. Postoperatively, the elbow was splinted with flexion at 100 °. After 4 weeks of immobilization the splint was removed and the patient could actively flex his elbow from 30 ° to 100 °.

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{retrospective}} review of 32 consecutive patients (30 adults and two children) with total or partial lesions of the brachial plexus who had surgical repair using nerve grafting, <b>neurotisation,</b> and neurolysis between January 1991 and December 2003. The outcome measures of muscular strength were correlated {{with the type of}} lesion, age, preoperative time, length and number of grafts, and time to reinnervation of the biceps. The function of the upper limb was also evaluated. There was a significant correlation between muscular strength after surgical repair and both the preoperative time and the length of the nerve graft. There was also a significant correlation between muscular strength and the number of grafts. Muscular strength was better when the neurolysis was done before six months. When neurosurgical repair and reconstructive procedures were performed, the function of the upper limb was improved...|$|E
40|$|Context: In {{cases of}} chronic facial palsy, where direct <b>neurotisation</b> is possible, {{ipsilateral}} masseteric nerve {{is a very}} suitable motor donor. We have tried to specifically locate the masseteric nerve for this purpose. Aims: Describing an approach of localisation and exposure of both the zygomatic branch of Facial nerve and the nerve to masseter, {{with respect to a}} soft tissue reference point over face. Settings and Design: Observational cross sectional study, conducted on 12 fresh cadavers. Subjects and Methods: A curved incision was given, passing about 0. 5 cms in front of the tragal cartilage. A reference point “R” was pointed out. The zygomatic branch of facial nerve and masseteric nerve were dissected out and their specific locations were recorded from fixed reference points with help of copper wire and slide callipers. Statistical Analysis Used: Central Tendency measurements and Unpaired “t” test. Results: Zygomatic branch of the Facial nerve was located within a small circular area of radius 1 cm, the centre of which lies at a distance of 1. 1 cms (± 0. 4 cm) in males and 0. 2 cm (± 0. 1 cm) in females from the point, 'R', in a vertical (coronal) plane. The nerve to masseter was noted to lie within a circular area of 1 cm radius, the centre of which was at a distance of 2. 5 cms (± 0. 4 cm) and 1. 7 cms (± 0. 2 cm) from R, in male and female cadavers, respectively. Finally, Masseteric nerve's depth, from the masseteric surface was found to be 1 cm (± 0. 1 cm; male) and 0. 8 cm (± 0. 1 cm; female). Conclusions: This novel approach can reduce the post operative cosmetic morbidity and per-operative complications of facial reanimation surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} is a comparison of early and late operated children with traumatic brachial plexus lesions suffered during birth. For this dissertation 25 children with traumatic in-birth injuries of the brachial plexus were examined after intraplectic <b>neurotisation.</b> At {{the time of the}} operation the children were more than nine month old. The results of the examination were expressed in angular degrees, starting from a neutral (zero) position; the patient’s best possible movement was transferred into a tabel, moreover the results were transformed into the Active Movement Scale to make them compartable to other studies. Eleven children had suffered total lesions (C 5, C 6, C 7, C 8, Th 1), the other fourteen had lesions of the upper plexus, eleven of them having extended upper lesions (C 5, C 6, C 7), and three having plain upper lesions (C 5, C 6). This sample of children was compared to a group of children who had been operated on before the age of nine months. This group had suffered comparable injuries and showed a similar nerve morphology and similar transplantation scheme. If possible, children with collateral injuries and of the same sex were compared. Because this second group contained only 22 children, the comparison was made between ten pairs with total lesion, ten pairs with extended upper lesions and two pairs with plain upper lesions. The children were compared on a one-to-one basis. One point was given to the group of early- or late-operated children. The distribution of points was as follows: Among the total lesions each group received five points, which allows the conclusion that for this kind of injury it does not make a difference if the child is treated before or after the age of nine months. Among the extended upper lesions the early-operated group received six points, the late-operated group only four points. This could indicate that with extended upper lesions it is important to aim at an early operation to get better results. Among the plain upper lesions the late-operated group got two points, the early-operated group none. None of the groups shows a statistically significant difference in points (level of significance 0, 05). As it is difficult to rule out an injury of nerve root C 7 before the operation, the extended upper lesions and the plain upper lesions were combined, so that the result was six points for the early operations and six for the late operations. Similar to the total lesions, this result allows the conclusion that an operation at a later date may be as successful as an early operation. The statistics was analysed by a paired t-test and showed significant differences only for the adduction of the shoulder and the extension of the elbow. For the adduction of the shoulder the early-operated children showed significantly lower figures (m= 16. 4) than the late-operated ones (m= 24. 1). For the extension of the elbow the early-operated children showed significantly higher figures (m= 0. 00) than the late-operated ones (m=- 8. 2). In conclusion {{it can be said that}} there is no clear difference in the success of early and late operations of total as well as upper birth-trauma lesions of the brachial plexus...|$|E
