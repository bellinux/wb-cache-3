50|$|The first basic {{categorisation}} {{of long-term}} insurance is {{between life and}} <b>non-life</b> <b>business.</b> Life insurance business is insurance that is contingent on human life. Examples would include a policy that pays out £100,000 if the policy holder dies within a specified time; a policy that pays out £100,000 in 10 years time, but will pay out £101,000 if the policy holder dies before the policy matures; a pension in payment, which will end once the pensioner dies.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{analytical}} framework for conducting forward-looking assessments of profitability and solvency {{of the main}} euro area insurance sectors. We model the balance sheet of an insurance company encompassing both life and <b>non-life</b> <b>business</b> and we calibrate it using country level data to make it representative of the major euro area insurance markets. Then, we project this representative balance sheet forward under stochastic capital markets, stochastic mortality developments and stochastic claims. The model highlights the potential threats to insurers solvency and profitability stemming from a sustained period of low interest rates particularly in those markets which are largely exposed to reinvestment risks due to the relatively high guarantees and generous profit participation schemes. The model also proves how the resilience of insurers to adverse financial developments heavily depends on the diversification of their business mix. Finally, the model identifies potential negative spillovers between life and <b>non-life</b> <b>business</b> thorugh the redistribution of capital within groups...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{measurement}} of dependency between different lines of <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>business</b> {{remains an open}} problem. International regulatory requirements and accounting standards are moving towards increased disclosure of the variability of insurance liabilities. In estimating the variability, it is required to take diversification benefits into account, as it is generally believed that different lines of business are not perfectly dependent on one another. Due to data limitations and the complicated nature of <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>business,</b> however, direct quantification of dependency and so diversification benefits between individual lines is a difficult task. In this article, we set forth some practical considerations in modeling dependency and diversification benefits under Australian regulatory environment. We start with providing {{a summary of the}} underlying factors causing dependency and examining the reasonableness of some industry correlation figures based on these factors. We also study the correlations between the historical loss ratios of several lines of Australian business. Afterward we carry out extensive simulation studies to investigate the effects of applying some recently suggested methodologies for tackling the problem of evaluating diversification benefits. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate risk capital allocation methods in detail for both non-life and life insurance <b>business.</b> In <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>business</b> loss models are generally linear with respect to losses of business-lines. However, in life insurance loss models are not generally a linear function of factor risks, i. e. the interest-rate factor, mortality rate factor, etc. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we present the existing allocation methods and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In a comprehensive simulation study we examine the allocations sensitivity to different allocation methods, different risk measures and different risk models in a <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>business.</b> We also show the possible usage of the Euclidean distance measure and rank correlation coefficients for the comparison of allocation methods. In the second part, we investigate the factor risk contribution theory and examine its application under a life annuity business. We provide two approximations that enable us to apply risk capital allocation methods directly to annuity values in order to measure factor risk contributions. We examine factor risk contributions for annuities with different terms to maturity and the annuities payable at different times in future.

40|$|In a <b>non–life</b> {{insurance}} <b>business</b> an insurer often {{needs to}} build up a reserve to able to meet his or her future obligations arising from incurred but not reported completely claims. To forecast these claims reserves, a simple but generally accepted algorithm is the classical chain-ladder method. Recent research essentially focused on the underlying model for the claims reserves to come to appropriate bounds for the estimates of future claims reserves. Our research concentrates on scenarios with outlying data. On closer examination it is demonstrated that the forecasts for future claims reserves are very dependent on outlying observations. The paper focuses on two approaches to robustify the chain-ladder method: the first method detects and adjusts the outlying values, whereas the second method is based on a robust generalized linear model technique. In this way insurers will {{be able to find a}} reserve that is similar to the reserve they would have found if the data contained no outliers. Because the robust method flags the outliers, it is possible to examine these observations for further examination. For obtaining the corresponding standard errors the bootstrapping technique is applied.

40|$|The {{authors have}} studied the {{combined}} ata on claims in fire insurance of dwelling houses reported 1958 - 1969 by Swedish fire insurance companies. The claims were cleared of deductibles and adjusted according to a suitable index. Only losses above the largest deductible (in real value) applied during the observation period were included. The material contains four different classes according to the fire resistibil-ity of the building construction. For international comparisons, the pure classes Bi ("stone " dwellings) and B 4 (wooden houses) are of interest. The distribution of the claims could be well approximated by the log-normal distribution i Bi and by the Pareto distribution in B 4. An equally good or better fit was obtained by assuming the original oss, reported or not, being distributed according to these distributions and applying the distributions, conditioned by the loss being larger than the deductible. In both cases the distribution parameters are functions of the insurance amount in such a way, that the mean value of the loss {{is described as a}} power of this amount. The authors refrain from any theoretical arguments for the general applicability of the distributions used. They observe, however, the good approximation by wellknown parametric distributions which facilitates many actuarial taks, such as the determination of first loss premiums, deductible premium factors, excess-of-loss premiums etc. The agreement between model and reality make these functions fit for use in the models underlying the general risk theory and in the more comprehensive models of the <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>business.</b> I.

Its nature as compulsory insurance, its inﬂuence on the inﬂation rate, together with the growing role played by biological damage reimbursements and by fraud, have opened a deep and sometimes harsh debate, both in the political and technical arenas, on the measures to be adopted in order to get tariff levels under control, to increase efﬁciency and to promote competition. The main question addressed by our paper is if and how, over the period 1982 – 2000, deregulation measures inﬂuenced the structure of the supply side of the market and the efﬁciency and productivity of the companies operating in the Italian motor business. In particular, we focus our attention on three main aspects: 1) the effects of deregulation on the dynamics of insurers (at an aggregate level, i. e. the total number of insurers in the motor insurance market from 1982 to 2000 and the entry-exit process); 2) the effects of deregulation on the rate of growth of insurance activity (as measured by premiums by line of business, in particular the motor insurance <b>business</b> compared with <b>non-life</b> and life business); 3) the effects of deregulation on the efﬁciency and productivity of a sample of Italian motor insurers.

The risk theory is the analysis of the stochastic features of <b>non-life</b> insu- rance <b>business.</b> The field of insurance risk theory has grown rapidly. There are now many papers and textbooks, which study the foundations of risk processes along strictly theoretical lines. On the other hand there is a need to develop the theories into forms suitable for practical purposes and to demonstrate their application. Modern computer simulation techniques open up a wide field of practical applications for risk theory concepts, without requiring the restrictive assumptions and sophisticated mathematics, of many traditional aspect of insurance risk theory [...] Modelling the size or loss is of crucial importance for an insurer. Particular attention is paid to studying the right tail of the distribution, since it is important to not underestimate the size (and fre- quency) of large losses. The method of maximum likelihood is often used to estimate parameters of possible distributions, and various tests may be used to assess the fit of a proposed model (for example Kolmogorov-Smirnoff, and χ 2 goodness-of-fit. Often one may find that a mixture of various distributions may be appropriate to model losses due to varying characteristics of both the policies and policyholders. The objective of this article is to call attention to a new approach to statistical modelling using quantile functions. This approach can deal with many issues associated with the steps of the sta- tistical modelling process based on quantile methods. The definition and modelling of loss distributions in non-life insurance is one of the problem are- as, where obtaining a good fit to the extreme tails of a distributional model is of major importance.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 66). The report on “The Insurance Act 2010 (for <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>business)</b> and the problems & prospects of Peoples Insurance Company Limited” has been prepared based on qualitative research as required for completion of BBA degree from BRAC University. In a developing country like Bangladesh, different insurance companies are playing a very {{crucial role in the}} economic growth. Though insurance industry has significant prospects in the economy but for some reasons it has failed to achieve its goal to some extent. There are 62 insurance companies in Bangladesh. Among them, Peoples Insurance Company Limited is the second private insurance company and it has been doing insurance business in the country over 27 years since 1985. The company was established and had been operated under the Insurance Act 1938 since its inception until 2010. However, as the need of time, the parliament of Bangladesh passed a new Insurance Act 2010 in March, 2010 in order to reform & modernize the insurance sector in Bangladesh. Since just after passing a new act to replace the old one, the previous Insurance Act 1938 became inactive due to pass Insurance Act 2010. The insurance industry faced a shock suddenly. In this report, the Insurance Act 2010 has been summarized focusing on the additions and changes brought by the new act which are different from the former Insurance Act 1938. A qualitative research has been conducted to gather required information where I have taken interviews of four top level employees of Peoples Insurance Company Limited. The entire report has been categorized into six chapters. In chapter one, the introduction, scope, objective, methodology, and limitations of the report have been described. Then chapter two of the report focuses on the Peoples Insurance Company Limited—the company overview, its services, vision, mission, and future plans. Here, I also have conducted a financial analysis on the company‘s performance since 2002 until 2010 where short descriptions of the performance have been given along with necessary graphical presentations. In chapter three, I have described the internship program under the Department of Finance & Accounts at the corporate office of PICL specifying the departmental responsibilities along with my own responsibilities that I performed as an intern. Here, I have tried to discuss about my work procedures while performing different responsibilities and also my learning from the work experiences. In the report, chapter four and chapter five bear more weight. Chapter four basically works on the topic of this report where a brief description on insurance, Insurance laws and regulatory system, and regulatory conflicts in the insurance industry in Bangladesh along with the emergence of establishing and passing the new insurance act. Hence, the Insurance Act 2010 has been taken into focused in this chapter specially for the non-life insurance sector—why the new act has been passed, how the new regulatory authority is working for the reformation and modernization of the insurance sector in Bangladesh, what are the problems that the non-life insurance companies (specially the Peoples Insurance Company Limited) are facing while trying to follow the new rules and regulations to implement the new act in doing their business. Besides, the huge prospects of the insurance companies while the new act will be fully functional also has been identified and described. Continuously, in chapter five, the findings have been presented along with developing necessary recommendations addressing both the regulatory authorities and the Peoples Insurance Company Limited in order to overcome the conflicting situations as well as to make the prospects come true. Then conclusion has been drawn by expressing hope and expectation on the modernization of the insurance sector in Bangladesh competing with its neighbors. Lastly, in chapter six, appendix of the report has been given which encloses the supporting information & documents of the report & references that might be helpful to understand the whole report more clearly.
