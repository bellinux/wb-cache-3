40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{determination}} of receipts from EU budget by considering a richer institutional structure than in earlier studies. We assume that the member states have self-interested objectives in CM trying to minimize their contributions within the given framework of the EU budget whereas EP is supposed to support benevolent objectives using its competence in <b>non-compulsory</b> <b>expenditure,</b> i. e. structural spending, internal and external policies and administration. CM exerts power in the allocation of both compulsory expenditure, mainly consisting of agricultural spending, and in <b>non-compulsory</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is not, however, to evaluate EP's influence but rather how the assumed benevolent objectives of EP and income differences turn into member states' budget receipts in a power politics based model.

40|$|The {{member states}} have self-interested {{objectives}} {{and they use}} their voting power in the Council of Ministers (CM) to maximize their shares from the EU budget, whereas European Parliament (EP) uses its power to support benevolent objectives and equality between member states. Given the current decision procedures of the EU, EP has effective power on <b>non-compulsory</b> <b>expenditure</b> covering structural spending, but not on compulsory expenditure consisting mainly of agricultural spending. We use this fact to assess how the assumed benevolent objectives of EP turn into member states' budget receipts in a power politics based model. European integration, EU budget, voting power...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course of the budgetary year. In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the principle of budgetary annuality as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the budgetary systems of the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the budgetary year (”structural flexibility”), the system of compulsory vs <b>non-compulsory</b> <b>expenditure</b> (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of commitment appropriations, the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{arrangements}} concluded between European institutions contribute to the separation of powers underlying the European Union’s political system. The point of departure is an analysis of different separation of powers models. The author posits that the European Union’s political system is best interpreted against the background of a ‘separation of institutions’, implying that no European institution should exercise its legal powers in an unchecked manner. This approach builds on the Court of Justice’ institutional balance doctrine. It differs from the more traditional constitutional law theory known as ‘trias politica’ according to which no government authority ought to combine two ‘governmental functions’. Seen from this perspective, separation of powers is a matter of autonomous institutions subject to ‘checks and balances’. Some checks and balances find their basis in EU law. However, many others are based on arrangements between the European institutions. Many of such arrangements are not based on law. An enquiry into the possible general legal bases for such interinstitutional agreements finds all of them unsound. Driessen argues that interinstitutional arrangements without a legal basis (‘interinstitutional conventions’) cannot be legally enforceable. Although there are differences, to a certain extent they can be equated to the ‘constitutional conventions’ known in British constitutional law. An analysis of such interinstitutional conventions suggests their omnipresence in European constitutional practice. The study analyses the effects of interinstitutional arrangements on different fields of EU law. This includes, inter alia, an analysis of the political responsibility of the Commission and of its members towards the European Parliament, of the interinstitutional conventions that govern the Parliament’s rights of oversight, and those governing legislative procedures, the budgetary procedure and external relations. The analysis shows that many interinstitutional conventions are important instruments for the daily management of the Union. Other interinstitutional conventions concern the details of the relations between the institutions. They can tangibly affect the balance of influence between the European institutions. For example, in the budgetary field, the European Parliament successfully used interinstitutional agreements to ensure that about one half of expenditure is subject to its approval as <b>non-compulsory</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Additionally, it acquired some control over the remainder through the financial perspectives, which are equally based on interinstitutional conventions. Driessen researches the limitations on the use of such interinstitutional arrangements. Although they certainly cannot replace the procedures foreseen in European law, they can affect such them. Jurists often fail to notice {{the extent to}} which this happens. The study is based on current law but also takes on board the changes proposed in the Constitutional Treaty.
