5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.|$|E
5|$|His {{political}} {{projects were}} put on hold, and Caragiale instead concentrated his energy on obtaining the French Légion d'honneur order, eventually becoming one of its Chevaliers in December 1929. The Romanian author himself <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> had been {{made possible by the}} intercession of François Lebrun, the Bucharest correspondent of Le Matin newspaper, whom he considered a personal friend.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. It was <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> resulted in less use of the car parks, more local street parking and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|The pH of Messers Run {{upstream}} of the Lofty Reservoir is 6.3. The total {{concentration of}} alkalinity {{in this part}} of the stream is 3 milligrams per liter. These values are similar to those measured in a similar area during a 1990 survey of the stream. The concentration of water hardness {{in this part of}} the stream is 47 milligrams per liter. A 1997 report <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> value was very high considering the concentration of alkalinity.|$|E

5|$|This book's target {{audience}} {{is not the}} common consumer of pig meat, but the grocer who would sell the products to the masses. The goal of the book was {{to aid in the}} proper handling, selling and profiting from the business of selling pork.

5|$|After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably {{dismissed}} on 1 April 1959. {{the dismissal}} {{has been reported}} in several sources {{to be related to the}} acquittal of/dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of undermining the government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime.|$|E
5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must be <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E

5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. It should also be <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the very first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E

5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} pressure readings, {{since there}} were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured {{when it was a}} Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, it should be <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses {{which were}} the sagas' main sources) chiefly {{describe}} war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus' peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf's reign lasting almost three times longer than Magnus'). Modern historians have <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> probably has made the image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus' case, skewed towards his deeds as a warrior).|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} led to antiquities of Roman origin such as {{beads and}} gems, amphorae (wine making vats) with remnants of wine, a Roman stamp, big bricks recovered {{from an old}} wall, Arretine ware and so forth. From these antiquities Wheeler concluded that the site was related to a period of trading with Rome, {{and that it was}} first established by emperor Augustus. He also <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> Indo-Roman trade lasted for a period of about 200 years, till 200 CE. Wheeler also found the Chinese celadon, identified to belong to the Song-Yuan dynasty, and Chola coins from about the eleventh century, but these were rejected as despoiling items or remnants left by brick-robbers. Items Chinese blue-and-white ware were also recovered from the site.|$|E

5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people {{used to be able to}} see in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E
5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E
