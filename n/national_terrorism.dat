2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Defence Forces {{established}} Special Assault Groups (SAG) in the Army to meet security challenges {{on the border}} with Northern Ireland. A number of Army officers attended the United States Army Ranger School in Fort Benning, Georgia who returned to conduct Army Ranger courses in Ireland with the first held in 1969. Among its founding officers was later-to-be Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Dermot Earley. Special Assault Groups were formed comprising 40 Rangers trained in all arms, engineering and ordnance techniques. By the mid 1970s, the Defence Forces had over 300 Rangers who conducted support operations on the request of the Garda Síochána. Students on these courses were selected from among all ranks and units of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. The courses improved standards of physical endurance, marksmanship, individual military skills and small unit tactics. In December 1977, the Garda Síochána formed a counter terrorist unit named the Special Task Force (STF) to operate in border regions that was later to become the [...] Emergency Response Unit. In 1978, following an assessment of the SAG, it was decided to consolidate the Rangers into a new special forces unit with a counter terrorist capability following an increase in international and <b>national</b> <b>terrorism,</b> such as the 1972 Munich massacre in Germany (then West Germany) and a spate of hostage-takings by the Provisional IRA at home.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the Homeland Security Advisory System was a {{color-coded}} terrorism threat advisory scale.

50|$|In 2011 the Department of Homeland Security {{phased out}} the old Homeland Security Advisory System with a {{two-level}} <b>National</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Advisory System. The system has two types of advisories: Alerts and Bulletins. NTAS Bulletins permit the Secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts themselves have two levels: Elevated and Imminent. An Elevated Alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending {{in the very near}} term.|$|E
