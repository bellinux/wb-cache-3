500|$|On July 22, 2013, MLB {{suspended}} Braun for {{the remaining}} 65 games of the regular season, plus the entire postseason, for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Braun, who lost $3.25 million as a result, did not appeal the suspension. In a statement, he said, [...] "I realize <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made some mistakes. I am {{willing to accept the}} consequences of those actions." [...] ESPN reported that Braun decided to [...] "strike a deal" [...] with MLB after being presented with the evidence against him. Called a [...] "liar", he was heavily criticized by the media and other players, particularly for tarnishing Laurenzi's reputation. In particular, it was later exposed that Braun engaged in a campaign for support from players around the league, accusing Laurenzi Jr. of being an anti-Semite.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain's {{fall from}} power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, [...] "Few men can have known such a {{reversal}} of fortune in so short a time." [...] He especially regretted the loss of Chequers as [...] "a place where I have been so happy", though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote [...] "I am content <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind." [...] As Lord President he assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as [...] "free {{from any of the}} rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike". As chairman of the Lord President's Committee, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. When Axis feelers for peace reached the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the Low Countries conquered and France tottering, Halifax urged following up and seeing if the actual offer was worthwhile. The battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet lasted three days, and Chamberlain's statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the feelers should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.|$|E

2500|$|In 196, the warlord Cao Cao {{received}} and fetched Emperor Xian to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and established the new capital there.

[...] Xun You was then appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day Gushi County, Henan) and later summoned to the capital to serve as a Master of Writing (尚書). Cao Cao had long heard of Xun You and was overjoyed when they finally met.

2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E

2500|$|On May 9, 1887, Buffalo Bill's Wild West {{opened in}} London. Among the {{audience}} members was Queen Victoria, {{who visited the}} Earl's Court encampment three days later. [...] Black Elk recalled that Natives were told [...] "that Majesty was coming. I {{did not know what}} that was at first, but I learned afterward. It was Grandmother England who owned Grandmother's Land where we lived awhile after the Wasichus murdered Crazy Horse." [...] Red Shirt expressed his pleasure in meeting the Queen and remarked to her that [...] "I have come many thousands of miles to see you. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen you, my heart is glad." [...] The encounter and his words were widely circulated among the press and noted in her diary. Since the death of Prince Albert, her husband, which event had occurred thirty years previous to this [...] "command," [...] the queen had been more than ordinarily seclusive. She seldom appeared before great assemblages of her subjects and her visits to even her parliament were rare. To theatrical performances she never went during that long period of her mourning. Her latest knowledge of the greatest actors and actresses of the time was gained by private performances given, by command, in her court, and these were infrequent. [...] "The Wild West was altogether too big a thing to take to Windsor Castle, and {{as in the case of}} Mahomet and the mountain, as the Wild West could not go to the Queen it became absolutely necessary for the Queen to go to the Wild West, if she desired to see it, and it was evident that she did." [...] "Then I presented Red Shirt, the Native Chieftain, who was gorgeous in war paint and feather trappings. His proud bearing was fetching among the royal party, and when he spoke through an interpreter, saying he had come a long way to see her Majesty and [...] "felt glad," [...] the Queen smiled appreciatively, and as the red man, unconventionally, but proudly, strolled away with the dignity of a Supreme Court Judge, she seemed to say, [...] "I know a real prince when I see him." [...] "Every act went with a rush and a cheer, and was received by cries of 'bravo,' 'well done,' etc. At the close of the exhibition calls were made for Red Shirt and myself, in response to which I thanked my patrons and assured them that the recollection of that evening's display of kindness would ever be fresh in my memory. Cries of 'Bravo, Bill,' and the singing of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' by the entire audience brought the demonstration to a close." ...|$|E
2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says it in the middle of the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, I was of no worth, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned wipe away in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E
2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt.

However, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour.
