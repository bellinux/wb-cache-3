5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resource,</b> because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{importance}} of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> for economic development between optimists and pessimists shows that the extensive depletion of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources,</b> particularly oil, along with a higher level of consumption could {{have a significant impact on}} the economic development of future generations. Based on this debate, this paper proposes criteria under which the depletion of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> would create excess costs for future generations. Therefore, this paper aims to answer the question "What will be the impact of the depletion of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> on sustainable economic development?" Accordingly, a sustainable development policy appears feasible by minimizing non-sustainable externalities which derive from future externalities that weigh the benefits from a previous employment of natural resources. The research based on qualitative analysis clarifies the reasons for and the extents of taking sustainability into account as well as points to difficulties of implementing policies to time the transition towards a sustainable economic development. Finally, the research shows the implications of this approach for environmental degradation, the depletion of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> and energy production.

40|$|We {{contrast}} {{effects of}} taxing <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> {{with the effects}} of traditional capital taxes and investment subsidies in an endogenous growth model. In a simple framework we demonstrate that when <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> are a necessary input in the sector where growth is ultimately generated, interest income taxes and investment subsidies can no longer affect the long-run growth rate, whereas resource tax instruments are decisive for growth. The results stand out both against observations in the literature from the 1970 ’s on <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> and taxation -observations which were not based on general equilibrium considerations- and against the general view in the newer literature on taxes and endogenous growth which ignores the role of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resources</b> in the “growth engine”...|$|R

25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resource.</b> It may turn out to be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds when no one else is willing to do so. And thusly, Angola has become China's leading energy supplier.|$|E
25|$|Water, however, is not {{a finite}} {{resource}} (meaning the availability of water is limited), but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking water supply, which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years), that is a <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resource,</b> and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.|$|E

After that peak, according to Hubbert peak theory, the rate of production enters a terminal decline. While uranium is used in nuclear weapons, its primary use is for energy generation via nuclear fission of the uranium-235 isotope in a nuclear power reactor. [...] Each kilogram of uranium-235 fissioned releases the energy equivalent of millions of times its mass in chemical reactants, {{as much energy as}} 2700 tons of coal, but uranium-235 is only 0.7% of the mass of natural uranium. Uranium-235 is a finite <b>non-renewable</b> <b>resource.</b> Future advances in breeder reactor technology could allow the current reserves of uranium to provide power for humanity for billions of years, until the death of our sun, so nuclear power can be considered sustainable energy.
