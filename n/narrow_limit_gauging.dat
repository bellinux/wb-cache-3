40|$|Methodology is {{presented}} {{for the design}} of single and double compressed limit Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT) and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control charts to detect one-sided mean shifts in a symmetric probability distribution. We also show how to evaluate the average run length properties with the Fast Initial Response (FIR) feature. The resulting CUSUM plans have a simple scoring procedure, and are extremely simple to derive and implement. The use of two compressed <b>limit</b> <b>gauges</b> is more efficient than a single compressed <b>limit</b> <b>gauge.</b> In the case of SPRTs, the use of two compressed <b>limit</b> <b>gauges</b> minimizes the average sampling number required for specified operating characteristics.
