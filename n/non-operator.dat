40|$|Joint Operating Agreements (JOA) {{are well}} {{accepted}} standard agreements {{in the oil}} and gas industry. The basic aim of any JOA is to regulate the relationship of the parties in the Joint Venture: Operator and <b>Non-Operators.</b> The former is responsible to perform the operations on the behalf of the consortium and the latter is responsible to contribute with regards to the financial commitments and expenses of the Joint Venture. However, Joint Operation Agreements typically do not reflect the <b>Non-Operator's</b> perspective, as they traditionally focus on the strong position retained by the Operator. This reality is very clear as the most critical clauses (namely management of operations, limitation of liabilities and removal of the Operator) strengthen the Operator's position, often {{to the detriment of the}} <b>Non-Operators.</b> In consequence, such an unbalanced agreement can cause uncertainly, raises the potential for litigation and might even jeopardize the very existence of the consortium. It is important to note that some parties might still sign such an imbalanced agreement in order to secure investment into a project but they will be subject to these risks, and even ultimately termination of the agreement. However, the decline of production and the lack of new reserves (which together reflect the maturity of an oil and gas area) will lead major companies to leave such region in search for a province with greater rewards. As a matter of consequence, the strongest party of the JOA shall be replaced by smaller companies so as there will be a shift on the JOA context from a dominant position for another in equitable terms. Consequently, there is a need for a new and more balanced approach to the negotiation of Joint Operating Agreements, to apply to new, current operations and mature operations, where the <b>Non-Operator's</b> perspectives are fully considered and properly addressed.

This report examines both macroeconomic (interest rates, prices of alternative investments) and parcel-specifi c (soil quality, government payments, proximity to urban areas) factors that affect farmland values. In the last few years, U. S. farmland values have been supported by strong farm earnings, which have helped the farm sector in many regions to withstand the residential housing downturn.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of minimalist program proposed by Chomsky (1992), this thesis explores scrambling in Korean with respect to crossover, reconstruction effects and binding phenomena and characterizes properties of movement types, their target positions and traces (or copies). ^ Chapter 2 examines syntactic properties of scrambling with respect to crossover phenomena, which cannot be well {{accounted for by the}} traditional A/A' distinction. We show that scrambling is distinguished from other operator movements, such as Wh-movement and QR, and provide evidence for the existence of a <b>non-operator</b> A'-position (a broadly L-related position in Chomsky 2 ̆ 7 s term) as the landing site of scrambling. We suggest that scrambling in Korean, as <b>non-operator</b> A'-movement, leaves behind not a variable, but a null epithet. We therefore demonstrate that the lack of WCO effects in scrambling constructions is due to a null epithet, which is not subject to WCO effects. ^ In Chapter 3, we argue that scrambling involves three different types of syntactic operations, i. e., a TopP-adjunction operation, an IP-adjunction operation and a substitution operation to SPEC (AGRo). We show that scrambling across a subject, as <b>non-operator</b> A'-movement, creates a null epithet immune to WCO effects, and an anaphor can take as its antecedent the element in <b>non-operator</b> position. Observing that scrambling across a topic yields WCO effects and does not create a new anaphor binding possibility, we claim that scrambling across a topic, as movement to an operator position, leaves behind a variable subject to WCO effects, and the element in operator position cannot serve as an antecedent for an anaphor. We then deal with short scrambling and attribute the lack of reconstruction effects to the A-movement property of short scrambling. ^ In Chapter 4, we maintain that the copy of A'-movement remains whereas that of A-movement deletes at LF and that Binding conditions, as conditions involving interpretation, apply at the LF interface level. We show that scrambled direct objects in Korean are preposed to SPEC (AGRo) and then to the sentence-initial position. Finally, we demonstrate that in Korean, what raises to SPEC (AGRo) for Case-checking at LF is not a direct object in-situ but its accusative Case feature. ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} by melting profile {{analysis}} of lac repressor-DNA complexes that repressor binds tightly and preferentially (relative to single-stranded DNA) to double-stranded <b>non-operator</b> DNA. This binding stabilizes the DNA against melting and the repressor against thermal denaturation. Analysis {{of the extent of}} stabilization and the rate of dissociation of repressor from <b>non-operator</b> DNA as a function of sodium ion concentration shows, in confirmation of other studies, 3, 4 that the binding constant (KRD) is very ionic strength dependent; KRD increases from ∼ 106 M− 1 at ∼ 0. 1 M Na+ to values in excess of 1010 M− 1 at 0. 002 M Na+. Repressor bound to <b>non-operator</b> DNA is not further stabilized against thermal denaturation by inducer binding, indicating that the inducer and DNA binding sites probably represent separately stabilized local conformations. Transfer melting experiments are used to measure the rate of dissociation of repressor from operator DNA. These experiments show that most of the ionic strength dependence of the binding constant is in the dissociation process; the estimated dissociation rate constant decreases from greater than 10 − 1 sec− 1 at [Na+] ≥ 0. 02 M to less than 10 − 4 sec− 1 at [Na+] ≤ 0. 002 M. Competition melting experiments are used to show that at 0. 02 to 0. 002 M Na+ the affinity of lac repressor for various natural DNAs and synthetic double-stranded polynucleotides (including poly[d(m 6 A-T) ], which carries a methyl group in the large groove) are approximately independent of base composition, except that the affinity of repressor for poly[d(A-T) ] is ∼ 2 - to 3 -fold greater than for the other DNAs tested.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} spontaneous abortion and work within dry cleaning units in the United Kingdom where the solvent perchloroethylene is used. METHODS: A retrospective occupational study of reproductive outcome in 7305 women aged 16 and 45 years, who were currently or previously employed in dry cleaning or laundry units in the United Kingdom. Data on workplace exposures and reproductive outcome were obtained by postal survey. A sample of reported spontaneous abortions was validated from medical records. Machine operator versus <b>non-operator</b> {{was used as a}} surrogate for exposure to perchloroethylene in dry cleaning units as no data on individual doses were available for women in this study. RESULTS: The response rate was higher for current workers of dry cleaning units (78 %), than for past workers of dry cleaning units (46 %). Similarly, the response for current laundry workers (65 %) was higher than that for past laundry workers (40 %). Overall, the reproductive characteristics of the respondents were similar to expectation. Examination of exposure at the time of pregnancy, however, showed that the rate of spontaneous abortion varied according to the type of work the women did during the pregnancy or in the three months before conception: being lowest for pregnancies not exposed to either dry cleaning or laundry work (10. 9 %), higher for those exposed to laundry work (13. 4 %), and higher still for those exposed to dry cleaning work (14. 8 %). Within the group of pregnancies exposed to dry cleaning, the proportion was higher if the woman reported that she worked as an operator {{at the time of the}} pregnancy (17. 1 %) rather than as a <b>non-operator</b> (11. 6 %). Adjusted odds ratios for the period 1980 - 95 showed that the risk was over 50 % higher in operators than non-operators (p = 0. 04). The physical demands of the two jobs are likely to be similar. A higher risk was found when work as a dry cleaning operator was compared with no work in either dry cleaning or laundry units during pregnancy. Exposure to dry cleaning as a <b>non-operator</b> was not associated with any excess risk. CONCLUSIONS: Women who worked in dry cleaning shops at the time of their pregnancy or in the three months before who described themselves as operators were about half as likely again to report that their pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion than women who described themselves as non-operators...|$|E

Given the standard assumption that the licensing of empty pronominal elements is related to properties of the verbal agreement morphology, I propose that the loss of V 2 in the history of English can ultimately be reduced to a change in the inflectional morphology during the Middle English period. This conclusion supports recent work which suggests that the morphological properties of a language can {{play an important role in}} determining its syntactic properties...|$|E

In order to better understand whether conservation participation decisions, and potential responses to factors such as commodity prices, may vary by tenure status, we exploit a unique dataset that identifies where participants associated with Conservation Reserve Program contracts live relative to the land enrolled. These data provide improved spatial information on tenure status relative to previous sources. This study seeks to improve our understanding of the extent and characteristics of absentee landowners in CRP.

40|$|Most {{phosphorus}} loading to Lake Erie is now {{attributable to}} agricultural non-point sources; hence {{a better understanding}} of the factors that affect the ecosystem health is crucial. Decisions farmers make regarding the adoption of conservation practices are inherently dynamic, affected by changes in social, economic and environmental conditions, whereas the water quality models used to assess policy interventions lack this dynamic social component. To bridge this gap, this dissertation presents three necessary steps to evaluate the impacts of farmers’ adoption of conservation practices on water quality using a coupled natural human systems modeling approach. The necessary steps are: 1) water quality modeling of the Sandusky watershed, Ohio using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), 2) development of a farmer typology of conservation practice adoption among Corn Belt farmers and building an agent-based model (ABM) for adoption of conservation practices using the farmer typology, and 3) coupling the ABM with the water quality model to understand impacts of conservation practice adoption on water quality. In Chapter 2, SWAT is used for the Sandusky basin for 1970 - 2010 to simulate nutrient loading, particularly focusing on dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). The results indicate that recent increased storm events, interacting with changes in fertilizer application timing and rate, as well as management practices that increase soil stratification at the soil surface, appear to increase DRP runoff. In Chapter 3, the broad literature review on conservation practices adoption by Corn Belt farmers consistently identify four policy-relevant farmer characteristics, namely farm size, land tenure arrangements, source of income, and information networks. In an examination of these characteristics, four broad farmer types emerged: traditional, supplementary, business-oriented, and <b>non-operator</b> farmers. To study the dynamic social component of farmers on water quality, an ABM of conservation practice adoption by farmers using the farmer typology is built. In Chapter 4, the results of ABM are used as input for water quality models to explore the linkages between social and biophysical processes within this coupled system. This linked modeling framework highlights the importance of <b>non-operator</b> owners and the influence of crop revenue insurance in lieu of commodity payments on farmers’ adoption decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the lac repressor headpiece and a small operator DNA fragment has been examined by fluorescence and circular dichroism (c. d.) measurements. Binding of the headpiece to the DNA fragment induces a strong quenching of the fluorescence of its tyrosine residues. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence data demonstrates that, in a first step, two headpieces bind very strongly to the DNA fragment then weaker binding occurs. C. d. demonstrates that the binding induces conformational changes of the DNA. The c. d. change produced upon binding {{of the first two}} headpieces differs from that induced upon binding of two further headpieces. Binding of the second pair of headpieces is similar to non-specific binding to <b>non-operator</b> DNA. The conformation of the operator DNA in the presence of two headpieces differs drastically from that in presence of lac repressor. Addition of the core to the lac operator does not induce any conformational change of the nucleic acids.

Yet, the model must be sufficiently general {{so that it}} will encompass the system that is to be represented. An approach is presented for representing metabolic reaction systems. It uses simple object bipartite graphs, with event operators (mediators of events) representing one species and non-operators (the non-mediators in events) the other. Edge colours describe relations between the two species and shared objects connect events together. The operators (e. g., enzymes) are integral components of the system interacting with the non-operators (e. g., substrates). This facilitates inclusion of receptors and transporters (operators), and effectors (non-operators) in the same model. A membrane operator separates two compartments and mediates the transport of compounds between them. Furthermore, enclosing a sequence of events between two membrane operators represents compartmentalisation of that sequence. Extended operators can include additional information such as the species and chromosome. Non-enzymatic reactions are included in the model by treating the activation energy as the operator. An operator in one event may be a <b>non-operator</b> in another, and vice versa. This is useful for addressing conceptual issues such as representing an enzyme as substrate (e. g., phosphorylation) or a metabolite (e. g., cyclic AMP) as mediator in a signal transduction pathway...|$|E
