40|$|Synthetic dyes {{are very}} {{practical}} {{to use and}} can lead to striking color on a colored product. This makes the synthetic dyes are often used in the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and textile. But the waste or residues of synthetic dyes can contaminate the environment than the use of synthetic dyes is often abused, {{such as the use of}} non synthetic food dyes in food products, thereby causing harm to consumers. Thus the natural dyes began to be reconsidered for use. Drawbacks of natural dyes extracted the natural dye is a liquid so it is not practical for long term use. Dye is form in a liquid extract is dried into a powder by using a spray dryer. Extract natural dyes from kesumba seeds and mahogany bark in this final assignment dried using a spray dryer that has been modified. In a spray dryer using a nozzle extracts scattered granules form small particles, granules – granules of small particles are contacted directly by the hot air that will be formed powder. Spray dryer consists of three main tools <b>nozzle,</b> <b>dryer</b> tank and cyclone. Nozzle is used to extract the dye waste so as to form granules of small particles. Tank made of stainless steel dryer that has a diameter of 14 cm, height 94 cm, the maximum volume of 50 liter and 40 liter effective volume. Cyclone acts as a filter / separator between the dye powders with gaseous reaction products has a diameter of 10 cm and 40 cm high. Other support tools in the form of a compressor, blow dryer, and heater. Extract of mahogany dye is obtained by solvent extraction to extract the water while the dye solvent kesumba extracted with (0. 1 M, 0. 2 M, 0. 3 M, 0. 4 M, 0. 5 M) NaOH solution and Ca(OH) 3. Operation of the spray dryer by using continuous system, with a continuous drying process in the tank while the bait into a maximum of 2000 ml for each process with the average feed rate 0. 13 ml / sec, can work well and can result in dye powder. Feed into the drying temperature to extract mahogany between 90 - 100 ° C, whereas for the extract of secang and kesumba between 100 - 110 ° C. This dye powder can then be used for dyeing textiles for dyeing cloth is batik. ...|$|E
40|$|Dried powders {{containing}} Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris {{were produced}} using laboratory and pilot scale spray dryers with lactose:whey protein isolate (3 : 1) as a protective medium. The effects of storage temperature (25, 4 and - 18 °C) and time (30, 60 and 90 days) were studied. The survival and fermentation {{activity of the}} dried bacterial cells were significantly lower when the powders were stored at 25 °C compared to those stored at 4 and - 18 °C; powders stored at 4 and - 18 °C were statistically similar. The survival and fermentation activity of bacterial cells obtained from a laboratory scale two-fluid <b>nozzle</b> spray <b>dryer</b> {{were found to be}} higher than those of cells obtained from a pilot scale two-fluid spray dryer. A rotary wheel atomizer gave significantly higher survival and activity in the same dryer. These observations are consistent with cell damage due to high characteristic shear rates in the atomization process in nozzle type atomizers. The presence of ascorbic acid (oxygen scavenger) in the powder composition was found to improve both the survival and the maintenance of fermentation activity of the dried bacterial cells significantly during storage. The survival and fermentation activity of dried bacterial cells in stored powders indicated that these parameters are system-specific and can be strongly affected by the storage temperature and presence or absence of antioxidant, and also by upstream processing conditions such as the mode of atomization and presence or absence of antioxidants in the dryer feed...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{coloring}} essence {{has been replaced by}} sintetic coloring. Since the result of the natural coloring is in the liqud form that makes it difficult to be applied and it is less practice. This liquid coloring is dryed into powder with a spray dryer. The aim of this final asigment is to design and to make a coloring spray dryer and to know how this tool works. Spray dryer uses continous system, in which the materials are mixed with nozzle to make them into small particles. These small particles are directly contacted to the hot air to make powder. Spray dryer contains of two main equipments, they are <b>nozzle</b> and <b>dryer</b> tank. <b>Nozzle</b> is made of brass with 0, 5 mm in diameter used to mix the coloring essence to make them into small particles. The dryer tank is made of galvanic plat with 40 cm in diameter, 220 cm in height, maximal volume 600 liter, and effective 500 liter. The other equipment supports are compressor, blower and belt conveyor.

40|$|Abstract-Spray drying is a {{commonly}} used {{method of drying}} a liquid feed through a hot gas. This study aims to obtain the empirical model of the spray drying process of full cream milk using a <b>nozzle</b> atomizer spray <b>dryer,</b> Lab-Plant SD 05 Laboratory Scale Spray Dryer. Inlet air temperature {{was chosen as the}} manipulated variable and outlet air temperature was the controlled variable. No disturbance was considered in this process. The model was obtained from empirical model development and it can be represented using first order plus time delay (FOPTD). The empirical dynamic model of the spray drying of full cream milk was simulated using SIMULINK to evaluate the performance and robustness. The PI and PID controllers were applied to implement the control strategies of the process. The effects of parameter uncertainties were investigated. From the observation, the direct synthesis tuning method has been found as a good controller tuning for both controllers in spray drying control system.

40|$|Of {{the total}} energy {{required}} for U. S. manufacturing processes, a signi®cant portion {{is used for}} industrial drying processes, estimated at 12 %. Often these industrial dryers operate without any provisions for heat recovery. This means that almost all the energy consumed by the dryer is essentially thrown away. Without the ability to recover the latent heat of the water vapor in the air, signi®cant reductions in dryer energy usage cannot be made. In an attempt to recover the latent heat of the water vapor, a closed drying cycle is proposed, which uses a nozzle as the means to recover this energy from moist-saturated air. This nozzle condensation drying cycle (NCDC) is composed of the following components: <b>dryer,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> di€user, air-water separator, heat exchanger and compressor. Analysis of this drying cycle shows that ideally this cycle requires {{a third of the}} energy compared with an ideal open cycle heated dryer or a heat pump dehumidi®cation cycle. However, when equipment isentropic e�ciencies are included, the energy costs are of the same order as that for the other two non-ideal cycles, but with as much as six times less heat exchange requirements. The cycle can be operated at varying conditions, allowing for a single design to be utilized for various applications. Other than the advantage of lower heat exchanger equipment costs, other advantages are in applications that requir...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpray drying is {{a common}} drying {{technique}} in food industries to convert liquid to powder form. A good understanding on the dynamic behavior of the process is important to ensure proper control. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop empirical models for spray drying of whole milk powder and orange juice powder using a <b>nozzle</b> atomizer spray <b>dryer.</b> Maltodextrin was used as the drying agent material in spray drying of orange juice powder as it is considered as sticky powder. A preliminary study on the effect of several inputs such as inlet air temperature, feed flow rate and maltodextrin concentration on the product quality was studied. The selection of suitable inputs is important to ensure the desired quality of final products (moisture content). It was found that inlet air temperature gave more significant effect on outlet air temperature and powder moisture compared to other two inputs. Inlet air temperature and outlet temperature were selected as the manipulated variable and controlled variables respectively. Empirical models were developed by applying step change in the inlet air temperature. For spray drying of orange juice powder, its response was faster to achieve steady state because maltodextrin inhibited sticky behaviour. Both empirical models can be represented by first order plus time delay (FOPTD) and valid because R 2 ≥ 0. 6...|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} method is developed here to investigate agglomeration in spray drying towers operating with multiple nozzles. It allows studying independently {{the contribution of}} each spray to the product and obtaining a valuable insight into the agglomeration processes. The paper studies a two level swirl counter-current dryer of detergent in a full-scale production system. It shows that operation with two nozzle levels increases the energy efficiency {{compared to the use}} of single sprays, but in turn promotes both agglomeration and elutriation of powder {{from the top of the}} dryer. The product size distribution becomes bi-modal and the composition and porosity of the product more heterogeneous due to the different thermal histories experienced by droplets from each spray. The method described here controls the air temperature and humidity nearby the nozzles to quantify the agglomerates resulting from particle contacts within each individual spray or from their interaction. Particle agglomeration is shown to be suppressed at the bottom of the dryer where the heat transfer rates are highest and promoted at the top spray, which originates a second coarse mode in the size distribution. Both levels do not operate independently; the powder elutriated upwards from the bottom nozzle is captured entirely by the top spray when it is centrally located. By isolating the independent impact of each <b>nozzle</b> in a <b>dryer,</b> the method provides powerful data to correlate the agglomeration behaviour with local process conditions, and so facilitate the development and validation of spray dryer models...|$|R
