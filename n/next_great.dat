Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in {{time to take a}} decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any way that he thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the <b>next</b> <b>great</b> war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le Mérite.|$|E

30|$|We proceed this way, {{since it}} is unfair to rank users by maximal belief masses they have on the degrees. This is because {{during the process of}} the masses fusion, a user’s {{influence}} increases and passes from an influence degree to the <b>next</b> <b>greater</b> degree and so on. Thus, for users who have many combinations, they pass from the weaker influence degree (V.Weak) until they reach high influence degrees. Therefore, the masses on each degree starts weak, and as we combine, this mass becomes more important, and then it decreases and the mass on the <b>next</b> <b>greater</b> influence degree increases instead. For this reason, to rank users who have maximal belief mass on the same degree (for example, two users who have the degree V.Strong as a maximal degree), we should not consider the mass they have on this degree, because we may have a user more influential than another, although he has a weaker belief mass than him on the same degree. This {{is due to the fact}} that, the belief mass on the next-greater degree has increased and became quite important. Hence, to compare users who have maximal belief mass on the same degree, we should rather consider the belief mass on the <b>next</b> <b>greater</b> degree.|$|R

25|$|Percy Jackson {{learns that}} Kronos' forces are {{preparing}} to attack Olympus. Poseidon, Percy's father, decides {{that it is time}} for Percy to now fulfill the Great Prophecy. Seeking to defeat Kronos, like Achilles did, Percy bathes in the River Styx, making his body invulnerable except one small chosen part of his body (the small of his back). Kronos leads a siege of New York City and puts its citizens to sleep. Percy leads the campers, Hunters, nature spirits, and centaurs to protect Mount Olympus from Kronos and his forces. While they protect Olympus, the gods hold down the monster Typhon as he makes his way to New York. Kronos, possessing Luke's body, forces his way into Olympus and battles Percy in Olympus' throne room. Typhon reaches New York but is defeated after the arrival of Poseidon's forces, led by Tyson. Annabeth is able to make Luke come back to his senses, and Percy gives him Annabeth's knife. Luke stabs himself in his mortal spot (as he also was invulnerable from bathing in the River Styx) to destroy Kronos and save Mount Olympus, but Luke dies. The gods reward Percy and his friends, and offer him immortality. He rejects the offer, but instead requests the gods to claim all their children and to have cabins for all the gods, including the minor ones. Rachel Elizabeth Dare becomes the Oracle and recites the <b>next</b> <b>Great</b> Prophecy. The book finishes with Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple, and ominous clouds looming over Rachel's <b>next</b> <b>Great</b> Prophecy.|$|E
25|$|The Natchez {{are noted}} {{for being the}} only Mississippian culture with complex chiefdom {{characteristics}} to have survived long into the period after the European colonization of America began. Others had generally declined a century or two before European encounter. The Natchez are also noted for having had an unusual social system of nobility classes and exogamous marriage practices. It was a strongly matrilineal kinship society, with descent reckoned along female lines. The paramount chief named the Great Sun was always {{the son of the}} Female Sun, whose daughter would be the mother of the <b>next</b> <b>Great</b> Sun. This ensured that the chiefdom stayed {{under the control of the}} single Sun lineage. Ethnologists have not reached consensus on how the Natchez social system originally functioned, and the topic is somewhat controversial.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} Pyrrhus {{triggered}} a widespread revolt {{by the southern}} socii, the Samnites, Lucani and Bruttii. But the revolt was far from universal. The Campanians and Apulians largely remained loyal to Rome. This was probably due to their long-standing antagonism to the Samnites and Tarentines respectively. Neapolis, the key Greek city on the Tyrrhenian, also refused to join Pyrrhus, due to its rivalry with Tarentum. This demonstrates a critical element {{in the success of}} Rome's military confederation: the socii were so divided by mutual antagonisms, often regarding their neighbours as far greater threats than the Romans, that they were never able to stage a universal revolt. The pattern {{is similar to that of}} the <b>next</b> <b>great</b> foreign challenge, Hannibal's invasion of Italy (see below). The central Italians (Etruscans and Umbrians) remained loyal, while the southern Italians, with significant exceptions, rebelled. The exceptions were also the similar, save for the Campanians, who joined Hannibal in the later episode.|$|E

25|$|The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Hammir {{defeated}} {{and captured}} Muhammad Tughlaq with the Bargujars as his main allies. Tughlaq {{had to pay}} a huge ransom and relinquish all of Mewar's lands. After this event, the Delhi Sultanate did not attack Chittorgarh for a few hundred years. The Rajputs re-established their independence, and Rajput states were established as far east as Bengal and north into the Punjab. The Tomaras established themselves at Gwalior, and Man Singh Tomar built the fortress which still stands there. During this period, Mewar emerged as the leading Rajput state; and Rana Kumbha expanded his kingdom {{at the expense of}} the Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat. The <b>next</b> <b>great</b> Rajput ruler, Rana Sanga of Mewar, became the principal player in Northern India. His objectives grew in scope – he planned to conquer the much sought after prize of the Muslim rulers of the time, Delhi. But, his defeat in the Battle of Khanwa consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India. However, Maharana Pratap of Mewar, a 16th-century Rajput ruler, firmly resisted the Mughals. Akbar sent many missions against him. He survived to ultimately gain control of all of Mewar, excluding the Chittor Fort.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} cricketers of his era, Morrisby's {{first-class}} career {{was interrupted by}} the outbreak of World War II. He only ever managed to score one additional century after the 1935-36 tour of India, which had {{proved to be the}} highlight of his first-class career, and that came in a match against the touring Indians in the 1947-48 season. They stopped in Tasmania to play two tour matches, and in the second at the NTCA Ground on 16 January 1948, Morrisby made 130 in a remarkable Tasmanian total of 458 all out, chasing the Indians first innings score of 7 for 457 declared. The match was rain-affected, and ended in a draw, but is notable in that it was the first-class debut of Emerson Rodwell, who was to become the <b>next</b> <b>great</b> Tasmanian batsman of the following generation. Morrisby continued playing first-class cricket until the 1951-52 season, when he retired at the age of 37. In 51 matches, Morrisby had accumulated 2596 runs at an average of 32.45 including 3 centuries, and 14 half-centuries, with a high score of 145. Ronald Morrisby also umpired in a match between Southern Tasmania Cricket Association and the North-West Tasmania Cricket Association in 1955-56.|$|E
25|$|The {{praise for}} the Franklin statue caught the {{attention}} of Chicago industrialist George Pullman, who commissioned Rohl-Smith's <b>next</b> <b>great</b> work. Pullman's Chicago mansion was built on or near the site of the 1812 Fort Dearborn Massacre, in which 28 men, 12 children, and two women were killed by rogue warriors of the Potawatomi Native American tribe. In 1893, Pullman commissioned Rohl-Smith to create a memorial to the Fort Dearborn Massacre (whose 85th anniversary was approaching). After researching the event with his wife, Rohl-Smith decided that the most important and dramatic part of the narrative was the incident in which a rogue warrior is prevented from killing Margaret Helm and her child by the Potawatomi chief Black Partridge. Dr. Isaac Van Voorhees lies dying beneath Helm's feet. Two members of the Lakota nation, Kicking Bear and Short Bull, were imprisoned at nearby Fort Sheridan for having fired at United States Army troops during the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. Short Bull posed as the less muscular, younger warrior attempting to kill Helm, while Kicking Bear posed as Black Partridge. Pullman donated the sculpture to the city of Chicago. Pullman was so pleased with the memorial that in 1895 he commissioned Rohl-Smith to sculpt bas-relief portraits of his parents for Pullman Memorial Universalist Church in Albion, New York.|$|E
