2500|$|In {{a typical}} hard wired motor {{start and stop}} circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that {{activates}} a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> <b>contact</b> and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The [...] "lock in" [...] contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "off" [...] button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.|$|E

50|$|The use of relays for {{the logical}} control of complex {{switching}} systems like telephone exchanges was studied by Claude Shannon, who formalized {{the application of}} Boolean algebra to relay circuit design in A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. Relays can perform the basic operations of Boolean combinatorial logic. For example, the boolean AND function is realised by connecting <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> relay <b>contacts</b> in series, the OR function by connecting <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> <b>contacts</b> in parallel. Inversion of a logical input {{can be done with}} a normally closed contact. Relays were used for control of automated systems for machine tools and production lines. The Ladder programming language is often used for designing relay logic networks.|$|R
5000|$|Form C {{contacts}} ("change over" [...] or [...] "transfer" [...] contacts) {{are composed}} of a normally closed contact pair and a <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> <b>contact</b> pair that are operated by the same device; {{there is a common}} electrical connection between a contact of each pair that results in only three connection terminals. These terminals are usually labelled as normally open, common, and normally closed (NO-C-NC). An alternate notation for Form C is SPDT.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{contacts}} in PLC's and they are normally open and normally closed switches. A <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> <b>contact</b> means the contact is on when pressed/closed, and a normally closed contact is on when open/not pressed. Contacts represent the states of real world inputs like sensors, switches, if the part is present, empty, full, etc. PLC's also consist of coils, which are outputs like motors, pumps, lights, timers, etc. The PLC examines inputs and turns coils on or off whenever it is needed. They can also be used as inputs to other rungs in the ladder diagram.|$|E
5000|$|The {{total number}} of relays, cam timers and drum sequencers can number into the {{hundreds}} or even thousands in some factories. Early programming techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, {{one of the first}} being ladder logic, where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called programmable logic controllers were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit.

50|$|The isolated, or independent, switch {{configuration}} consists of individual relays, often with multiple poles, with no connections between relays. Isolated relays {{are commonly used}} in power and control applications to open and close different parts of a circuit that are at substantially different voltage levels. Applications for isolated relays include controlling power supplies, turning on motors and annunciator lamps, and actuating pneumatic or hydraulic valves. Figure 4 illustrates a single isolated relay or actuator, in which a single-pole <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> relay is controlling the connection of the voltage source to the lamp. This relay connects one input to one output. An isolated relay can {{have more than one}} pole and can have normally closed contacts as well as <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|R

50|$|Since relays are switches, the {{terminology}} applied to switches is also applied to relays; a relay switches {{one or more}} poles, each of whose contacts can be thrown by energizing the coil. <b>Normally</b> <b>open</b> (NO) <b>contacts</b> connect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is disconnected when the relay is inactive. Normally closed (NC) contacts disconnect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is connected when the relay is inactive. All of the contact forms involve combinations of NO and NC connections.|$|R
50|$|This circuit shows a {{push button}} that closes a door, and an {{obstruction}} detector that senses {{if something is}} {{in the way of}} the closing door. When the <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> push button <b>contact</b> closes and the normally closed obstruction detector is closed (no obstruction detected), electricity is able to flow to the motor which closes the door.|$|R
5000|$|First we {{have the}} <b>normally</b> <b>open,</b> timed-closed (NOTC) <b>contact.</b> This type of <b>contact</b> is <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> when the coil is {{unpowered}} (de-energized). The contact is closed by the application of power to the relay coil, but only after the coil has been continuously powered for the specified amount of time. In other words, {{the direction of the}} contact's motion (either to close or to open) is identical to a regular NO contact, but there is a delay in closing direction. Because the delay occurs in the direction of coil energization, this type of contact is alternatively known as a <b>normally</b> <b>open,</b> on-delay: ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{general-purpose}} relays, contactors {{are designed}} to be directly connected to high-current load devices. Relays tend to be of lower capacity and are usually designed for both normally closed and <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> applications. Devices switching more than 15 amperes or in circuits rated more than a few kilowatts are usually called contactors. Apart from optional auxiliary low-current contacts, contactors are almost exclusively fitted with <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> ("form A") <b>contacts.</b> Unlike relays, contactors are designed with features to control and suppress the arc produced when interrupting heavy motor currents.|$|R
5000|$|In the example, the {{physical}} {{state of the}} float switch contacts must be considered when choosing [...] "normally open" [...] or [...] "normally closed" [...] symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from float switches (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (<b>normally</b> closed) <b>open</b> their <b>contacts</b> when the water level in the tank is above {{the physical}} location of the switch.|$|R
50|$|A wire spring relay {{typically}} {{has many}} individual contacts. Each contact {{is either a}} fixed contact, which does not move, or is a moving contact, and is made from a short piece of wire. The contact points are made from small blocks of precious metals, such as palladium, which are spot-welded to the wire springs. The majority of the wire spring relays manufactured in the 1960s had twelve fixed <b>contacts.</b> A <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> (make) <b>contact,</b> a <b>normally</b> closed (break) contact, or both can be provided for each fixed contact. A moving contact consists of two wires projecting out of {{the base of the}} relay, bent slightly inwards in order to exert pressure against the armature.|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and operation}} of membrane switches are discussed. The membrane switch functions as a <b>normally</b> <b>open,</b> momentary <b>contact,</b> low-voltage pressure-sensitive device. Its design is a three-layer sandwich usually constructed of polyester film. Conductive patterns are deposited onto the inner side of top and bottom sheets by silk screening. The center spacer is then placed between the two circuit layers to form a sandwich, generally held together by an adhesive. When pressure {{is applied to the}} top layer, it flexes through the punched openings of the spacer to establish electrical contact between conductive pads of the upper and lower sheets, momentarily closing the circuit. Upon release of force the top sheet springs back to its normal open position. The membrane touch switch is being used in a rapidly expanding range of applications, including instrumentation, appliances, electronic games and keyboards. Its board acceptance results from its low cost, durability, ease of manufacture, cosmetic appeal and design flexibility. The principal electronic components in the membrane switch are the conductor and dielectric...|$|R
50|$|Force-guided {{contacts}} {{by themselves}} {{can not guarantee}} that all contacts {{are in the same}} state, however they do guarantee, subject to no gross mechanical fault, that no contacts are in opposite states. Otherwise, a relay with several <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> (NO) <b>contacts</b> may stick when energised, with some contacts closed and others still slightly open, due to mechanical tolerances. Similarly, a relay with several normally closed (NC) contacts may stick to the unenergised position, so that when energised, the circuit through one set of contacts is broken, with a marginal gap, while the other remains closed. By introducing both NO and NC contacts, or more commonly, changeover contacts, on the same relay, it then becomes possible to guarantee that if any NC contact is closed, all NO <b>contacts</b> are <b>open,</b> and conversely, if any NO contact is closed, all NC <b>contacts</b> are <b>open.</b> It is not possible to reliably ensure that any particular contact is closed, except by potentially intrusive and safety-degrading sensing of its circuit conditions, however in safety systems it is usually the NO state that is most important, and as explained above, this is reliably verifiable by detecting the closure of a contact of opposite sense.|$|R
