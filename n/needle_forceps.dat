40|$|At present {{there is}} no {{satisfactory}} technique for repeated lung biopsy in recipients of heart-lung transplants. A new technique for lung biopsy, which might be adopted for this purpose, has been developed. A Teflon sheath is inserted through the jugular vein into the pulmonary artery {{with the aid of}} a balloon catheter. A flexible biopsy forceps is then introduced through the sheath into the pulmonary arterial tree and advanced into the periphery of the lung, where biopsy samples are taken. The procedure was attempted in 14 pigs. Initially crocodile jaw (two pigs) and fenestrated cups forceps (five pigs), which are currently in use for transbronchial lung biopsy, were used. Subsequently the biopsy forceps was modified and the jaws were replaced by a cutting needle mechanism (six pigs). Out of the 13 animals in which the procedure was technically possible, lung parenchyma was obtained from nine and pulmonary arterial wall from 11. One animal died shortly after the procedure. The cause of death could not be determined with certainty at postmortem examination. There was, however, a small tear on the surface of the lung, which could have produced a tension pneumothorax. The other 12 animals recovered from the procedure. They were killed 24 hours later and postmortem examination was carried out. One animal in which the crocodile jaw forceps had been used had a haematoma in the lower lobe (3 X 3 X 4 cm) and 100 ml of blood in the pleural cavity. In the other 11 animals, in which the fenestrated cups or the cutting <b>needle</b> <b>forceps</b> had been used, the intrapulmonary haematomas were 1 - 2 cm in diameter and the pleural surface was intact. It is concluded therefore that transvenous lung biopsy is feasible and that this procedure might find an application in monitoring rejection in recipients of heart-lung transplants...|$|E

40|$|Concentric tube robot (CTR) {{comprises}} several precurved concentric tubes {{which can}} rotate and translate independently {{with respect to}} each other. Each pre-curved tube of a CTR can be controlled to rotate axially and translate along its axis, which enables the tip to bypass obstacles and finally reach the target position. The concentric tube robots enable surgeons to perform delicate procedures by combining the flexibility of elastic catheters {{with the use of}} operation tools, such as <b>needles,</b> <b>forceps</b> and grippers. Hence, many clinical applications of concentric tube robots are promising, such as transnasal robotic neurosurgery. Concentric tube robots are suitable for such minimally invasive surgeries because they are able to present various flexible shapes with great dexterity, which strengthens the ability of collision avoidance and enlarges the reachability of operation tools. This paper describes an image based visual servoing method to control the concentric tube robot so that it can reach a desired position. A model-less control algorithm is developed by first estimating and adjusting the Jacobian matrix based on measurement of each incremental movement traced by a single camera, and then generating the next motion using the estimated Jacobian matrix. Therefore, no kinematic model is required to control the CTR during experiments and the experimental results reveal the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes model-less feedback control of concentric tube robots based on visual servoing...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{has dealt}} {{with the role of}} {{endosonography}} in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The main conclusion is that endosonography with aspiration of mediastinal lymph nodes has superior diagnostic yield in comparison to conventional bronchoscopy with taking of peripheral (TBLB) and endobronchial (EBB) tissue (80 % vs 53 %). Guidelines advising to perform bronchoscopy (including TBLB and EBB) as a first choice procedure to detect granulomas should be revised. In case EUS or EBUS are not available, bronchoscopy may reach comparable sensitivity but only if cTBNA, TBLB and EBB are all performed. This will increase procedure time and likely also complications {{because of the number of}} <b>needle</b> and <b>forceps</b> samples. Secondly, we assessed morbidity and mortality rates of EBUS and EUS for pulmonary indications and found that both techniques are very safe. Fatalities have been described but are very rare with a mortality rate of 0. 04 % and mostly occurred in patients of fragile health. Serious adverse events happen occasionally (0. 15 %) and are mostly of infectious origin in patients undergoing needle aspiration of cysts, sarcoid of necrotic lymph nodes...|$|R

40|$|Telemetry is {{frequently}} {{used to examine}} the behavior of fish, and the transmitters used are normally surgically implanted into the coelom of fish. Implantation requires the use of surgical tools such as scalpels, <b>forceps,</b> <b>needle</b> holders, and sutures. When several fish are implanted consecutively for large telemetry studies, it is common for surgical tools to be sterilized or, at minimum, disinfected between each use so that pathogens that may be present are not spread among fish. However, autoclaving tools can take a long period of time, and chemical sterilants or disinfectants can be harmful to both humans and fish and have varied effectiveness. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is commonly used to disinfect water in aquaculture facilities. However, this technology has not been widely used to sterilize tools for surgical implantation of transmitters in fish. To determine its efficacy for this application, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory researchers used UV radiation to disinfect surgical tools (i. e., <b>forceps,</b> <b>needle</b> holder, stab scalpel, and suture) that were exposed to one of four aquatic organisms that typically lead to negative health issues for salmonids. These organisms included Aeromonas salmonicida, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, Renibacterium salmoninarum, and Saprolegnia parasitica. Surgical tools were exposed to the bacteria by dipping them into a confluent suspension of three varying concentrations (i. e., low, medium, high). After exposure to the bacterial culture, tools were placed into a mobile Millipore UV sterilization apparatus. The tools were then exposed for three different time periods— 2, 5, or 15 min. S. parasitica, a water mold, was tested using an agar plate method and forceps-pinch method. UV light exposures of 5 and 15 min were effective at killing all four organisms. UV light was also effective at killing Geobacillus stearothermophilus, the organism used as a biological indicator to verify effectiveness of steam sterilizers. These techniques appear to provide a quick alternative disinfection technique for some surgical tools that is less harmful to both humans and fish while not producing chemical waste. However, we do not recommend using these methods with tools that have overlapping parts or other structures that cannot be directly exposed to UV light such as needle holders...|$|R
40|$|Pediatric ophthalmologists {{increasingly}} {{recognize that}} the ideal site for intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is in the bag for aphakic eyes, but it is always very difficult via conventional technique. We conducted a prospective case series study to investigate the success rate and clinical outcomes of capsular bag reestablishment and in-the-bag IOL implantation via secondary capsulorhexis with radiofrequency diathermy (RFD) in pediatric aphakic eyes, in which twenty-two consecutive aphakic pediatric patients (43 aphakic eyes) enrolled in the Childhood Cataract Program of the Chinese Ministry of Health were included. The included children underwent either our novel technique for secondary IOL implantation (with RFD) or the conventional technique (with a bent <b>needle</b> or <b>forceps),</b> {{depending on the type}} of preoperative proliferative capsular bag present. In total, secondary capsulorhexis with RFD was successfully applied in 32 eyes (32 / 43, 74. 4 %, age 5. 6 ± 2. 3 years), of which capsular bag reestablishment and in-the-bag IOL implantation were both achieved in 30 eyes (30 / 43, 70. 0 %), but in the remaining 2 eyes (2 / 32, 6. 2 %) the IOLs were implanted in the sulcus with a capsular bag that was too small. Secondary capsulorhexis with conventional technique was applied in the other 11 eyes (11 / 43, 25. 6 %, age 6. 9 ± 2. 3 years), of which capsular bag reestablishment and in-the-bag IOL implantation were both achieved only in 3 eyes(3 / 43, 7. 0 %), and the IOLs were implanted in the sulcus in the remaining 8 eyes. A doughnut-like proliferative capsular bag with an extensive Soemmering ring (32 / 43, 74. 4 %) was the main success factor for secondary capsulorhexis with RFD, and a sufficient capsular bag size (33 / 43, 76. 7 %) was an additional factor in successful in-the-bag IOL implantation. In conclusion, RFD secondary capsulorhexis technique has 70 % success rate in the capsular bag reestablishment and in-the-bag IOL implantation in pediatric aphakic eyes, particularly effective in cases with a doughnut-like, extensively proliferative Soemmering ring...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Evaluating {{surgical}} {{practice in}} the operating room is difficult, and its assessment is largely subjective. OBJECTIVE: Recording of standardized spine surgery processes was conducted to ascertain whether any significant differences in surgical practice could be observed between senior and junior neurosurgeons. METHODS: Twenty-four procedures of lumbar discectomies were consecutively recorded by a senior neurosurgeon. In 12 cases, surgery was entirely performed by a senior neurosurgeon {{with the aid of a}} resident, and in the 12 remaining cases, surgery was performed by a resident with the aid of a senior neurosurgeon. The data recorded were general parameters (operating time for the whole procedure and for each step), and general and specific parameters of the surgeon's activities (number of manual gestures, number and duration of actions performed, use of the instruments, and use of interventions on anatomic structures). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison between the 2 groups of neurosurgeons. RESULTS: The operating time was statistically lower for the group of senior surgeons. The seniors statistically demonstrated greater economy in time and in gestures during the closure step, for sewing and for the use of scissors, <b>needle</b> holders, and <b>forceps.</b> The senior surgeons statistically worked for a shorter time on the skin and used fewer manual gestures on the thoracolumbalis fascia. The number of changes in microscope position was also statistically lower for this group.

40|$|Histological {{techniques}} {{are often used}} to study environmental effects on mussels, but since these techniques include killing of the individuals, rare or endangered populations cannot be studied using conventional tissue sampling. This study {{is an attempt to}} find a method that can be used repeatedly with the same mussel individual and which does not affect growth and survival. From 200 mussels, Mytilus edulis, tissue was sampled in different ways, such as drilling a hole in the shell or prising apart the shell valves. Two kind of instruments were used, an injection <b>needle</b> and surgery <b>forceps.</b> Some of the drilled mussels had their holes sealed again with cement. Drilling a hole in the shell, removing tissue sample with surgical forceps and then leaving the holes open did not seriously harm the mussels during the two months the experiment lasted. But if the holes were sealed with cement, both length and weight growth were negatively affected (35 % lower length growth and 36 % lower weight growth compared to the control mussels). Mortality was highest among the drilled and sealed mussels (80 % higher than among the other treatments). The vulnerability of the population, the aim of the study and the duration of the experiment should decide what method to use for tissue sampling. For long-term experiments and repeated sampling, opening the mussels by prizing apart the valves is a better alternative than drilling holes in the shells, but depending on the morphology of the species it could be difficult to sample the anterior part of the mussel body. For a short experiment and to sample anterior parts, drilling the shells, leaving the holes open and using surgical forceps, seems to be an acceptable compromise between the different treatments used...|$|R
40|$|Part I: Surgical Tool Design. The primary {{objective}} of this thesis was {{the development of a}} surgical tool to implant a specialized micro-scale sensor into the anterior chamber of a mouse eye. The sensor measures intra-ocular pressure continuously under normal living conditions, creating a measurement system that is needed in the field of Glaucoma research. The sensor has a complex geometry comprised of both compliant and non-compliant materials, and requires careful handling. ^ Previously, the surgical procedure required three separate tools; a knife, a syringe and <b>needle,</b> and <b>forceps.</b> That procedure suffered from issues of ease of use, efficiency, safety and reliability. The objective was to design, fabricate, and test a single unified tool that could perform all necessary surgical functions. The motivation for unifying the toolset into a single device was primarily to improve surgical efficiency and ease of use. ^ The development of the surgical tool faced a number of different challenges. These issues pertained to creating a sharp cutting instrument within unusual geometrical constraints, loading the sensor into a narrow tube, delivering both fluid and an object through the same tube, optimizing dimensions against competing constraints, and satisfying the ergonomic needs of the surgeon. ^ Two generations of prototypes were fabricated and tested. The second generation prototype was comprised of three telescoping tubes, each with a specific function. All three surgical steps were successfully carried out on a cadaver pig eye, with minor complications in the handling of the tool. Due to inherent design constraints in the implant and available materials, the size of the tool is likely more appropriate for the anatomy of a larger animal. ^ Part II: The Effects of Leg Morphology on Running Performance. The secondary {{objective of this}} thesis was to explore how differences in joint morphology impact the dynamics and energetics of running. An analysis was completed on the effects of kinematic knee orientation on legged locomotion, specifically simple running patterns. ^ The analysis compared the dynamics of a forward facing knee found in humans, a rear facing ankle found in birds, and a linear knee found in pogo sticks and simple robots. ^ The equations of motion for the models reveal that joint orientation has a direct effect on the dynamics of the system. The early simulation results show that leg morphology directly effects deflection and force patterns, which in turn effects the trajectory of the system. In forward facing joints, hip torque increases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of higher compliance in the leg. In rear facing joints, hip torque decreases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of lower compliance in the leg. The results suggest that a forward facing knee joint found in humans is more energy efficient than a rear facing ankle joint found in birds. ...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Yoh Wada, Minako Aoyama, Ge-Hong Sun-Wada, Nobuyuki Kawamura & Hiroyuki Tabata ### Abstract In this {{protocol}} {{we describe}} methods for observation endocytic {{activity in the}} mouse embryos. The methods are optimised for mouse embryos at E 5. 5 ~E 7. 2 pregastrulation/gastrulation stages. We optimise three different experimental schemes for tracing the embryonic endocytosis. In utero labelling scheme, an endocytic tracer is introduced into circulation of a pregnant mother to follow bulk uptake of fluid phase endocytosis. Rodent embryos are known to internalise maternal immunoglobulins, thus steady-state levels of endocytosis can be visualised by subcellular localization of mouse IgG. We also describe an in vitro labelling method for the isolated embryos. The last method allows pulse-labelling and chase experiments thus one can follow the temporal orders of events. Further, cellular processes involved in the endocytosis can be dissected pharmacologically by applying small- or large molecules with biological activities. ### Introduction Endocytosis is an important cellular process by which cells internalise macromolecules impermeable to cell membranes. During the endocytosis, a portion of cell surface membranes invaginates inwardly with extracellular and membrane-embedded substances including signalling molecules, growth factors, and nutrients to form small membrane vesicles which are destined to be transported toward the intracellular compartments like endosomes and lysosomes. The endocytosis is not only important for taking up nutritional macromolecules including a transferrin-iron complex, lipoproteins, immunoglobulins, but plays {{a central role in}} downregulation of cell-surface receptors for various signalling molecules as well. Moreover, in the various systems, signal transductions from the activated receptors to cytosolic mediators occur after ligand-receptor complexes are endocytosed. Therefore, the endocytosis plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in the signal transduction. The visceral endoderm, a polarised absorbing epithelium overlying embryo proper, actively internalises various molecules including transferrin, immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, and albumins [1 - 3]. This tissue controls multiple signalling cascades that ultimately governs antero-posterior axis formation and epiblast differentiation[4, 5]. This process, in principle, is highly dependent upon the endocytic pathways in the embryonic tissues [6 - 8]. The endocytic activity of rodent embryo has been documented by electron-microscopy in the earlier literatures. The endocytic pathway in the visceral endoderm cells is composed of the apical canaliculi, spherical bodies, and giant organelles referred as to apical vacuoles [9, 10]. We optimise protocols for observing the endocytosis under fluorescence microscopes, and with appropriate equipment setting, one can follow the endocytic process in live embryos. Here, we describe step-by-step protocols for different labelling schemes for the endocytic compartments. ### Reagents 1. 10 X Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen 70011044) - PBST 1 x PBS plus 0. 05 % Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich P 9416) - PBST+TSA+DS: dissolve TSA blocking reagent (Perkin Elmer FP 1020) at 1 %(w/v) in PBST, at 50 ºC in water bath.
