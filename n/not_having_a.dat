S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil.

When mounted in a special chuck which allows for the bit <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E

5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman {{taught his}} {{students}} lessons on morality using {{examples from the}} lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.|$|E

5|$|Corals are sessile {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of the animal is a polyp. Most corals are colonial, the initial polyp budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and water movement being significant.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> sting, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is capable}} of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
