2500|$|In 1981 she {{converted}} to the Bahá'í Faith after several encounters with adherents. Important Bahá'í teachings {{for her in}} her investigation of the religion in respecting her Indian heritage, her beliefs as a Catholic, and beyond were the positions and teachings of the Bahá'í Faith on gender equality and progressive revelation. On {{the basis of the}} principles of the religion, she converted. So important is gender equality in her understanding years later that she said: [...] "…there will not be world peace until the equality of women and men are established, not just theoretical, but established." [...] However, there was some estrangement [...] between her and her first formal contact with the community of Bahá'ís through a delegated individual. This person felt her activities in the women's movement and seeking Indigenous rights and facing Stereotypes of Native Americans were divisive. Her other initial encounters left her ambivalent about the religion. She gained a more personal faith in the religion after coming in contact with a heartfelt friend and went on Bahá'í pilgrimage in 1983. Soon after she divorced though she maintains this had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> change in faith but her immediate and extended family did not accept her change of faith. Shortly she worked at the Bahá'í national center and was appointed to the committee on American Indian teaching, where she was a liaison to the many American Indians who had become Bahá'ís. In 1984 she participated in the Trail of Light event of North American indigenous Bahá'ís traveling with Latin American indigenous peoples among the lands of Latin America. In 1987 she participated in the 75th anniversary commemoration of `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West at the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. She was appointed a Continental Counselor, the highest office of individual standing in the religion, in 1988. She attended the 1988 Bahá'í Indigenous Council, and the next tour of the Trail of Light team this time keeping a diary of events over the three weeks journey as they went through Latin America. She co-chaired the 1989 Association of Bahá'í Studies conference in Canada and traveled to Finland to attend an indigenous event there for the Sami people.|$|E
