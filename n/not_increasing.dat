However, homoploid hybrid speciation (<b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> the number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed {{by the fact that}} early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E

In early October, Newfoundland was again struck by a {{tropical}} cyclone– Hurricane Ophelia. Though a weaker storm, Ophelia caused more damage than expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of Igor. The mayor of Marystown criticized government officials for <b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> the size of repairs, especially to culverts, to account for flooding.|$|E

Editing was found to take significantly longer with VisualEditor, and new editors were less likely to save their work.

The Zachman Framework provides the thirty-six necessary categories for completely describing anything; especially complex things like manufactured goods (e.g., appliances), constructed structures (e.g., buildings), and enterprises (e.g., the organization and all of its goals, people, and technologies). The framework provides six different transformations of an abstract idea (<b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> in detail, but transforming) from six different perspectives.|$|E

A 2009 report based on the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey by the National Health Service determined that the prevalence of ASD in adults was approximately 1% of the population, with a higher prevalence in males and no significant variation between age groups; {{these results suggest that}} prevalence of ASD among adults is similar to that in children and rates of autism are <b>not</b> <b>increasing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{six years}} {{preceding}} the 1952 National Revolution {{are known as}} the sexenio. During this period, members of the Conservative Party tried to stem {{the growth of the}} left, but they ultimately failed, because they could not halt the economic decline and control the growing social unrest. Enrique Hertzog Garaizabal (1947–49), who was elected president in 1947 after the interim rule of a provisional junta, formed a coalition cabinet that included not only the concordancia but also the PIR. He hoped to retain the backing of the Conservative Party forces by <b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> taxes, but he tried also to gain labor support, relying on the PIR to mobilize the workers.|$|E
25|$|Monetarists {{follow the}} {{explanation}} given by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz. They {{argue that the}} Great Depression {{was caused by the}} banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction by 35%. This caused a price drop by 33% (deflation). By not lowering interest rates, by <b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling the Federal Reserve passively watched the transforming of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action.|$|E

25|$|Gender inequality, however, is <b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> or {{decreasing}} in a collinear fashion {{among these}} predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, {{as measured by}} the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005. Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can be said about the level of gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.|$|E
25|$|If an {{individual}} possesses {{a good or}} service whose marginal utility to him is {{less than that of}} some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is <b>not</b> <b>increasing,</b> all else being equal, {{an individual}} will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.|$|E
25|$|Indiana's income {{had been}} {{problematic}} {{in the two}} decades preceding Whitcomb's term and had necessitated major tax increases to fund the growing budget. Whitcomb had committed to <b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> the tax burden on the state in his campaign, but the state was not permitted to take on debt and was in need to growing its reserve funds. To increase the budget surplus, Whitcomb embarked {{on a number of}} cost reduction measures that required no legislative support. He created by executive order a commission of sixty business leaders to examine the entire operation of the state government and recommend changes to improve its operational efficiency. He used their findings to alter work flows that resulted in an annual savings of $12 million. They also made recommendations that would improve the efficiency of state taxes through better auditing techniques that once implemented raised state revenue by 8%. Additional savings were realized when because of the vastly improved government efficiency, less staff was needed to complete the work allowing the state to cut its workforce by 10%. Whitcomb also saved money by withholding non-mandatory pay raises for most state employees.|$|E

25|$|In 1987 the United Nation's World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission), in {{its report}} Our Common Future {{suggested}} that development was acceptable, {{but it must be}} sustainable development that would {{meet the needs of the}} poor while <b>not</b> <b>increasing</b> environmental problems. Humanity’s demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations. A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling, and renewable energies emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s. Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.|$|E
