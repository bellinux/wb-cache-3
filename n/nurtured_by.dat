5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June, and {{fighting}} among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses {{a significant amount of}} weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are <b>nurtured</b> <b>by</b> their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coins. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology.|$|E
5|$|Partners in Time {{features}} both original {{characters and}} those that were introduced before the game. Professor E.

Although the older Peach is kidnapped, Baby Peach is retrieved from the past into the present by Toadsworth, where she is <b>nurtured</b> <b>by</b> both the old and young renditions of him. Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the past to kidnap Baby Peach, although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with his older self. Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E

40|$|Focus groups {{comprised}} of seventy-five self-identifying Buddhist teenagers in Britain {{were asked to}} discuss value domains that previous research has identified to be of special interest to Buddhists. These included personal well-being, the nature of faith, the law of karma, monasticism, meditation, home shrines, filial piety, generosity, not killing animals, and alcohol use. The findings suggest that some attitudes held by teenagers were conscious and intrinsically nurtured ("worldview") while others involved social constructs ("ideologies"). The study finds that parents and the Sangha are mainly responsible for shaping "ideological" patterns in young Buddhists whereas informal <b>nurture</b> <b>by</b> "immersion" (possibly facilitated by caregivers) {{may be responsible for}} "worldview" patterns...|$|R

25|$|Viticulture {{suffered}} {{with the}} invasions of Bavarians, Slavs and Avars {{after the fall}} of the Roman Empire, but from 788 the rule of Charlemagne saw considerable reconstruction of vineyards and introduction of new grape presses. Once Otto the Great had seen off the threat from Magyar incursions in 955, Austrian viticulture was <b>nurtured</b> <b>by</b> the Church and encouraged among the populace at large. The first vineyard names recorded are Kremser Sandgrube in 1208, and Steiner Pfaffenberg in 1230. Rudolf IV introduced the first wine tax, Ungeld, in 1359, as Vienna established itself as a centre for wine trading on the Danube.|$|E

25|$|This {{partition}} of Lebanon was <b>nurtured</b> <b>by</b> outside powers, and animosities between the religious sects increased. The French, for example, traditionally supported the Christians, while the British supported the Druzes, and the Ottomans fomented strife {{to increase their}} control over the administratively divided region. These tensions led to conflict between Christians and Druzes as early as May 1845. Consequently, the European powers requested that the Ottoman sultan establish order in Lebanon, and he attempted {{to do so by}} establishing a new council in each of the districts. Composed of members of the various religious communities, these councils were intended to assist the deputy governor.|$|E

The cycles could last from a few hours or days to weeks or months, depending on the importance of events, or could even last longer, when they were linked to the events that significantly marked his life, as such was his relation with Veronica, his political activity during his years as a student, or the fact that he attended the gatherings at the Junimea society or the articles he published in the newspaper Timpul.

Consequently, the organisation is <b>nurtured</b> <b>by</b> and for the people, {{as opposed to being}} driven by corporate interests looking to maximise profit. This effectively enabled the events organisers to set minimal entry fees, based upon projected profits, so that festivals were affordable to lower income people. For example, the 1979 festival entrance was $18 (pre-paid) for a three-day adult pass. The trustees have several times declined offers of corporate sponsorship because the products offered have not met the Trust's philosophical aims and objects. In the 1970s the Nambassa Trust donated $29,698 to other organisations which meet its criteria. All Nambassa events made a profit with the exception of Celebration 1981.|$|E
