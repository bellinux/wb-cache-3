25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over his shoulder to Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
500|$|Earlier, Håkan {{stops and}} kills a passerby {{on a busy}} {{footpath}} near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making {{his way home from}} a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> he has seen and decides not to report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated hydrochloric acid onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck to her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to [...] "go steady". While Eli states, [...] "I'm not a girl", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear child," [...] said Ermine, [...] "she is {{our great}} blessing, and some day I trust {{will be the}} same to her dear father. Oh, Colin! it is too much to hope that you have <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> you must have heard! And yet you wrote to him." ...|$|R

6000|$|Pluffles' {{weakness}} was <b>not</b> <b>believing</b> <b>what</b> people said. He preferred what {{he called}} [...] "trusting to his own judgment." [...] He had as much judgment as he had seat or hands; and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or twice. But the biggest trouble Pluffles ever manufactured came about at Simla--some years ago, when he was four-and-twenty.|$|R
2500|$|According to Cimino, {{he would}} call Washburn while on the road {{scouting}} for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn's draft, Cimino said, [...] "I came back, and read it and I just could <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I read. It was like {{it was written by}} somebody who was... mentally deranged." [...] Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn's response to Cimino's comments were, [...] "It's all nonsense. It's lies. I didn't have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{word of the}} executions by {{this time}} was {{spreading}} everywhere. [...] Obrenović was briefed {{that there was a}} group at Orahovac from the Drina Corps Military Police assisting with the executions. An elderly man attached to the Rear Services of 4th Battalion related to him that he had heard that Drago Nikolić had personally taken part in the execution and that he could <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> had happened. That evening and all that night, the ARBiH 28th Division cut off the 4th Battalion's communications lines and transport routes and mounted another attack. Obrenović and his troops extracted from Baljkovice the next day, having lost 40 soldiers to the enemy. On July 16, at 14:00, VRS troops opened an escape corridor and began sweeping operations to drive the 28th Division forces through it. [...] The corridor was closed four hours later at 18:00 that same day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} {{regarding the}} Jewish real {{chances of survival}} once the Holocaust began continues to draw attention of historians. For one, the Germans made it extremely difficult to escape the ghettos just before deportations to death camps, deceptively disguised as [...] "resettlement in the East". All passes were cancelled, walls rebuilt containing fewer gates, with policemen replaced by SS-men. Some victims already deported to Treblinka were forced to write form letters back home, stating that they were safe. Around 3,000 others fell into the German Hotel Polski trap. Many ghettoized Jews did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> was going on until the very end, because the actual outcome seemed unthinkable at the time. David J. Landau suggested also that the weak Jewish leadership might have played a role. Likewise, Israel Gutman proposed that the Polish Underground might have attacked the camps and blown up the railway tracks leading to them, but as noted by Paulsson, such ideas are a product of hindsight.|$|E

6000|$|The {{young man}} could <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> he saw {{with his own}} eyes. [...] "Oh, marvel of marvels!" [...] he cried; [...] "little wonder you could give me {{boundless}} wealth from such a storehouse as this." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{he paused}} before {{concluding}} the last phrase. Even {{as he began}} the sentence, he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>what</b> {{he was going to}} say. He knew it never could have been a success.|$|R

60|$|Phineas did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> he had heard, {{but though}} he did not believe it, still the tidings set his heart beating. He would have {{believed}} it less perhaps had he known that Laurence had just received the news from Mrs. Bonteen.|$|E

5000|$|But TSO really {{cemented}} its {{following in}} concert.

[...] "We have, two stages—with pyro, light and lasers—on {{both sides of the}} arena, {{as well as in the}} crowd and the best sound we can find...

60|$|She saw {{the color}} fade {{out of his}} face. A shock seemed to go over his body. He {{took a couple of}} {{dragging}} strides toward her. His eyes had the gaze of a man who did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> he saw. The hand he reached out shook.|$|E
60|$|Though Abdallah had {{affirmed that}} he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> the wise man had said, {{nevertheless}} {{the words of the}} other were a comfort, for it makes one feel easier in trouble to be told that others have been in a like case with one's self.|$|E
