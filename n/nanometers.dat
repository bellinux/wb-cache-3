The {{results show that}} the complex permittivity of <b>nanometer</b> SiC/CNTs composite is much higher than that of <b>nanometer</b> SiC. Reflection curves of <b>nanometer</b> SiC and <b>nanometer</b> SiC/CNTs composite calculated with electromagnetic wave transmission-line theory show that the addition of CNTs at 6 wt%, 12 wt % and 18 wt % in <b>nanometer</b> SiC absorber can improve its microwave absorption properties strongly. There is a relationship between the mass fraction of CNTs and microwave absorption ability. With increase of the mass fraction of CNTs, its microwave absorption ability firstly increased then decreased. From the simulation, it was found that <b>nanometer</b> SiC with 12 wt % CNTs gave the optimum microwave absorption. The corresponding frequency of maximum reflection loss value of <b>nanometer</b> SiC/CNTs composite gradually moves to the low frequency range with increase of thickness.

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few <b>nanometers</b> in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
