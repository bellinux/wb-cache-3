5|$|The game {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the most successful era in Seattle franchise history, as they would go on to win AL West division championships again in 1997 and 2001, and an AL Wild Card berth in 2000. However, they failed to reach the World Series each time and remain one of two MLB franchises to <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> the Fall Classic, along with the Washington Nationals.|$|E
5|$|Born in Beaufort, North Carolina, Taylor {{attended}} East Carteret High School, {{where his}} pitching ability {{caused him to}} be chosen by the New York Yankees with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. After two full seasons in the minor leagues, he injured his shoulder in a fight, and was ineffective after returning to baseball. He retired in 2000, having never played a game above Class AA. Taylor was the second of two players to be picked first overall in the MLB draft to <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> the major leagues, the other one being Steve Chilcott.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} Universe is {{somewhat}} difficult to define. According to a restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but <b>never</b> <b>reach,</b> the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{relatively}} peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun {{is too small to}} undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.|$|E

25|$|Analysis {{is always}} an {{analysis}} ad infinitum and one can <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> the absolute. It consists in dividing the object based on the chosen viewpoint and translating the divided fragments into symbols, wherein a spectre of the original can be reconstructed. These symbols always distort {{the part of the}} object they represent, as they’re generalized to include it and every other part they represent. Thus they ignore the object’s uniqueness.|$|E
25|$|Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot {{say there}} is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> a point where space stops {{and that is the}} end of space. Space is {{infinite}} in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.|$|E
25|$|Buck {{continued}} to seek {{relief for the}} distressed state and in October 1933 called the General Assembly back into session to consider borrowing money from the Federal government. Once it was clear the General Assembly would <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> agreement on this measure, Buck took the unprecedented step of adjourning their session. Shortly thereafter teachers and state employees began taking reductions in their pay. In 1935 Buck had the State Highway Department assigned responsibility for the roads in the state that had formerly been maintained by the counties.|$|E

25|$|A {{release of}} methane from clathrates, however, is {{believed}} to be slow and chronic rather than catastrophic and that 21st-century effects of such a release are therefore likely to be 'significant but not catastrophic'. It is further noted that 'much methane from dissociated gas hydrate may <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> the atmosphere', as it can be dissolved into the ocean and be broken down biologically. Other research demonstrates that a release to the atmosphere can occur during large releases. These sources suggest that the clathrate gun effect alone will not be sufficient to cause 'catastrophic' climate change within a human lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{transformation}} (transduction): Package {{the desired}} genetic material into a suitable plant virus and allow this modified virus to infect the plant. If the genetic material is DNA, it can recombine with the chromosomes to produce transformant cells. However, genomes of most plant viruses consist of single stranded RNA which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cell. For such genomes {{this method is}} a form of transfection and not a real transformation, since the inserted genes <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> the nucleus of the cell and do not integrate into the host genome. The progeny of the infected plants is virus-free and also free of the inserted gene.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance was {{a problem}} for F-15 {{operations}} from the beginning. In January 1948, the entire fleet was grounded for ten days because of weather {{and a lack of}} spare parts, mostly heat exchangers that were found to be cracking prematurely. Because of the lack of spare heat exchangers, replacements had to be obtained from F-15s in storage at JAMA. By February 1948 the parts problem had become so critical that the 8th PRS had an average in service rate of only two aircraft. Cannibalization of both damaged and flyable aircraft eventually brought this rate up, but the unit would <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> a strength of sixteen operational aircraft again, reaching a high of fifteen only once, in December 1948.|$|E

25|$|Cold fusion {{researchers}} (McKubre since 1994, ENEA in 2011) {{have speculated}} that a cell that is loaded with a deuterium/palladium ratio lower than 100% (or 1:1) will not produce excess heat. Since most of the negative replications from 1989–1990 did not report their ratios, this has been proposed as an explanation for failed replications. This loading ratio is hard to obtain, and some batches of palladium <b>never</b> <b>reach</b> it because the pressure causes cracks in the palladium, allowing the deuterium to escape. Fleischmann and Pons never disclosed the deuterium/palladium ratio achieved in their cells, there are no longer any batches of the palladium used by Fleischmann and Pons (because the supplier uses now a different manufacturing process), and researchers still have problems finding batches of palladium that achieve heat production reliably.|$|E
25|$|On 8 September 1965, {{a company}} of 5 Maratha Light Infantry was sent to {{reinforce}} a Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) post at Munabao– a strategic hamlet about 250 kilometres from Jodhpur. Their brief was simple. To hold the post and to keep Pakistan's infantry battalions from overrunning the post at bay. But at Maratha Hill (in Munabao) – as the post has now been christened– the Indian company could barely manage to thwart the intense attack for 24 hours. A company of 3 Guards with 954 heavy mortar battery ordered to reinforce the RAC post at Munabao could <b>never</b> <b>reach.</b> The Pakistani Air Force had strafed the entire area, and also hit a railway train coming from Barmer with reinforcements near Gadra road railway station. On 10 September, Munabao fell into Pakistani hands, and efforts to capture the strategic point did not succeed.|$|E
25|$|At 0800 on February 28, Company B of the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry, {{departed}} {{the overnight}} defensive position located along Route 4 and moved east on a search and destroy mission. Two {{and a half}} kilometers ahead was the Prek Klok stream, a destination they would <b>never</b> <b>reach.</b> Commanded by Captain Donald S. Ulm, Company B made very slow progress through the thick and tangled jungle in two columns with the 3d Platoon in the lead, followed by the 2d and 1st Platoons. Ulm’s command element was located between the 2d and 1st Platoons. As the company progressed, the jungle thinned somewhat and the primary obstacle to the Americans became the fallen trees and brush-deadfall-which was encountered at 50- to 75-meter intervals. The company employed patrols in a cloverleaf pattern as they. Two of these patterns had been completed by the time Company B progressed a little over one kilometer from its starting point.|$|E
