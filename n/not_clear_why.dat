5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> Wilson's disease causes hemolysis, but various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that a}} high level of free (non-ceruloplasmin bound) copper has a direct effect on either oxidation of hemoglobin, inhibition of energy-supplying enzymes in the red blood cell, or direct damage to the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), but it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
25|$|In many West Central German dialects, {{the words}} dat, wat, et ("that, what, it") did not shift to das, was, es, even though t was shifted in other words. It is <b>not</b> quite <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> these {{exceptions}} occurred.|$|R

It is <b>not</b> <b>clear,</b> however, <b>why</b> the phonics taught in these approaches cannot be systematic.|$|R
5|$|Pantulf {{regained his}} lands after he cleared {{himself of the}} charge, through the {{mechanism}} of a trial by ordeal. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> the ordeal was required, with the historian David Bates speculating that either the evidence of Pantulf's involvement was not conclusive or that murder victim's family demanded the ordeal because they suspected any evidence pointing to Pantulf's innocence. Pantulf gave Saint-Evroul four altar frontals for the abbey's help after he was cleared of the charges.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why,</b> in 1873, Alkan {{decided to}} emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been {{associated}} with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who {{was at the end of}} 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.|$|E
5|$|Louisville's Courier-Journal {{carried an}} {{announcement}} of Blackburn's candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Kentucky on February 11, 1878. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why,</b> with only meager prior political experience, {{he decided to}} seek the office. He may {{have been influenced by}} the members of his family who were involved in politics. His brother Joseph was, at the time, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and another brother, James, had served in the Kentucky Senate. Two of his wife's brothers also held political office; Samuel Churchill was Secretary of State under Governors John L. Helm, John W. Stevenson, and Preston Leslie, and Thomas Churchill served as treasurer and later {{governor of the state of}} Arkansas. Whatever the reason, even his friends did not believe his announcement was wise due to his political inexperience. He opened his campaign with a speech in Owen County on March 29, 1878.|$|E
25|$|While it is <b>not</b> always <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> an intimal tear may occur, {{quite often}} it {{involves}} degeneration of the collagen and elastin {{that make up}} the media. This is known as cystic medial necrosis and is most commonly associated with Marfan syndrome and is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.|$|R
40|$|There {{is a small}} {{vibration}} {{which goes}} undetected by the naked eyes. It is called a microvibration (MV) or a minor tremor (MT). The MV on the body surface is expected to apply to a clinical examination of the autonomic nervous system. It is <b>not</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>why</b> and how the MV occurs, {{but there are many}} papers about its occurrence and clinical application. In this study, MV measuring system, its estimation and basic characteristics are examined. The difference between head MV and thenar MV, individual MV and diurnal and seasonal change are discussed. The power spectrum of MV is obtained using an autoregressive model...|$|R

It is <b>not</b> entirely <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> they shut the operation down but industry experts familiar with the consortium say it did not seem very experienced and may have rushed into production.|$|R
5|$|The {{detailed}} design {{work for the}} new mixed-traffic locomotives was undertaken at Brighton railway works where they were scheduled to be constructed. The earliest drawings were for a moderately sized 2-6-0 with similarities to the London and North Eastern Railway K4class, which Bulleid had helped design for the West Highland Line when he was Nigel Gresley's assistant. However, such a design would have been inadequate for the Kent Coast lines, which required a powerful 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 class. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> the design was subsequently enlarged to become a smaller version of the Merchant Navy class 4-6-2 as the likely traffic requirement did not warrant such lavish provision, but the incorporation of components from that class enabled standardisation during wartime production difficulties.|$|E
25|$|DNA helix co-discoverer and Nobel laureate James D. Watson has {{homozygous}} USH1B mutations, {{according to}} his published genome. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> he did not develop the syndrome. This lack of genetic penetrance argues that expression of the phenotype of Usher syndrome may be more complex than originally assumed.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the show}} noted that breath tests are often {{verified}} with blood tests (BAC, {{which are more}} accurate) and that even if a person somehow managed to fool a breath test, a blood test would certainly confirm a person's guilt. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> a negative breath test would be verified by a subsequent blood test.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the defence}} of obeying {{superior}} orders, {{at least in}} the Belzec trial, was a factor that inhibited the award of sanctions.

30|$|According to Uzoigwe et al. (2015), it is {{important}} to emphasize that the ability to reduce surface and interfacial tensions is considered as a way to differentiate so-called biosurfactants from bioemulsifiers. However, it is <b>not</b> yet <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> bioemulsifiers do <b>not</b> show significant variations in surface and interfacial tension between the different phases (solid–liquid, liquid–liquid and liquid–air).|$|R
25|$|By 1912, the {{decision}} was made to scrap the Holland class vessels. The submarine foundered in the English Channel off Beachy Head, Sussex, on 8 August 1912, when she was under tow on the way to being scrapped at Sheerness. It was <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> she sank, but a theory is that the torpedo tube hatch was left open, causing the boat to take on water.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondriate {{eukaryotic}} cells live poised {{between life}} and death, because mitochondria still retain their repertoire of molecules that can trigger cell suicide. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> apoptotic machinery is maintained in the extant unicellular organisms. This process has now been evolved to happen only when programmed. to cells (such as feedback from neighbors, stress or DNA damage), mitochondria release caspase activators that trigger the cell-death-inducing biochemical cascade. As such, the cell suicide mechanism is now crucial {{to all of our}} lives.|$|E
25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause. However, since the head-end crew of the freight train did not survive, it was <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> they had erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though {{it was revealed that}} the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk for a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
50|$|In 1153 Maurice participated as a vassal of Baldwin III of Jerusalem in the Siege of Ascalon.

50|$|A {{specific}} {{version of}} the fietsvierdaagse is the avondfietsvierdaagse ("evening cycling four-day"). That is a four-day cycle tour in the evenings.The Dutch tend to organise {{all different kinds of}} four-day events: another example is the wandelvierdaagse ("walking four-day"). It is <b>not</b> exactly <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> these events must be held in four days, but four days fit nicely in a week.|$|R
50|$|Additional I/O links were added, {{with two}} {{dedicated}} to I/O and sixteen for interconnects, allowing {{for up to}} 65,536 CPUs in the hypercube. The channels operated at 100 Mbit/s, due to use of 2-bit parallel lines, instead of the serial lines used previously. The nCUBE-3 also added fault-tolerant adaptive routing support, in addition to fixed routing, although in retrospect it's <b>not</b> entirely <b>clear</b> <b>why.</b>|$|R
25|$|At the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut's {{numerous}} statues {{were torn}} down {{and in many}} cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, there even {{was an attempt to}} wall up her obelisks. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut's history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III's reign, it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> it happened, other than the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps saving money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III and instead, using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.|$|E
25|$|Some studies seem {{to suggest}} that the longer a patient is on {{dialysis}} before the transplant, the less time the kidney will last. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> this occurs, but it underscores the need for rapid referral to a transplant program. Ideally, a kidney transplant should be pre-emptive, i.e., take place before the patient begins dialysis. The reason why kidneys fail over time after transplantation has been elucidated in recent years. Apart from recurrence of the original kidney disease, also rejection (mainly antibody-mediated rejection) and progressive scarring (multifactorial) play a decisive role. Avoiding rejection by strict medication adherence is of utmost importance to avoid failure of the kidney transplant.|$|E
25|$|Although the denarius {{remained}} {{the backbone of}} the Roman economy from its introduction in 211 BC until it ceased to be normally minted {{in the middle of the}} third century, the purity and weight of the coin slowly, but inexorably, decreased. The problem of debasement in the Roman economy appears to be pervasive, although the severity of the debasement often paralleled the strength or weakness of the Empire. While it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> debasement was such a common occurrence for the Romans, it's believed that it was caused by several factors, including a lack of precious metals and inadequacies in state finances. When introduced, the denarius contained nearly pure silver at a theoretical weight of approximately 4.5 grams.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} several lysine and {{arginine}} residues in the serum albumin structure, {{very few of them}} can take part in the glycation reaction. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> exactly <b>why</b> only these residues are glycated in serum albumin, but it is suggested that non-covalent binding of glucose to serum albumin prior to the covalent bond formation might be the reason.|$|R

25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> Cody became {{fascinated by}} kite flying. Cody liked to recount a tale that he first became {{inspired}} by a Chinese cook; who, apparently, taught him to fly kites, whilst travelling along the old cattle trail. However, {{it is more likely}} that Cody's interest in kites was kindled by his friendship with Auguste Gaudron, a balloonist Cody met while performing at Alexandra Palace. Cody showed an early interest in the creation of kites capable of flying to high altitudes and of carrying a man. Leon also became interested, and the two of them competed to make the largest kites capable of flying at ever-increasing heights. Vivian too became involved after a great deal of experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Chatterjee {{asserts that}} the pelvic girdle is apomorphic {{comparative}} to archaic birds and displays a retroverted pubis, fusion of the ischium and ilium, an antitrochanter, {{and the presence of}} a renal fossa. The pubis does appear to display opisthopuby, although this has yet to be verified. The alleged fusion of the ischium and ilium into an ilioischiadic plate is currently not substantiated by the fossils at hand, despite Chatterjee's auspicious illustration to the contrary in The Rise of Birds. At this time the pelvic girdle is not sufficiently well preserved to ascertain whether or not a renal fossa was present, although as no known avian from the Mesozoic displays a renal fossa, it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> Protoavis should, even if it is more derived than Archaeopteryx. Similarly, it is unclear if the alleged antitrochanter has been correctly identified as such.|$|E
25|$|It {{was enacted}} at the {{parliament}} assembled in Forfar in 1057 by King Malcolm Canmore that every baron should erect a gibbet for {{the execution of}} male criminals, and sink a well or pit, for the drowning of females. The term pit and gallows described the jurisdiction of a Baron in criminal cases; in full 'pit and gallows, sake and soke, toll, team, and infangthief'. A pit, according to Mackenzie {{was a form of}} dungeon or prison cell, not a pit for drowning the condemned. Others take the view that the pit was the drowning pool for women and the gallows for the men. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>why</b> men {{were more likely to be}} hanged and women drowned in a fen, river, pit or 'murder hole', however it may relate to ideas of decency. The place name 'Muttonhole' is not infrequently found and one suggestion is that it is derived from 'Mort-toun-hole', another of the names for a hollow where women were drowned.|$|E

50|$|Such disdain {{may not be}} {{restricted}} to points of grammar; speakers often criticize regional accents and vocabulary as well. Arguments related to regional dialects must center on questions of what constitutes Standard English.
