5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least {{as far back as the}} Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a <b>neophyte,</b> a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E

40|$|The river {{banks are}} very often colonized by {{invasive}} alien plants. The {{aim of this}} paper was to monitor the presence of invasive <b>neophytes</b> in riparian vegetation of the Berounka river and to compare the results with those of Boháčková (2007) from the year 2006. The research was completed during August in the year 2015. In every segment of the riparian vegetation were observed the presence and approximate population of seventeen invasive <b>neophytes.</b> In the riparian vegetation of the Berounka river were observed thirteen invasive <b>neophytes</b> on the whole. Impatiens glandulifera occured in the largest number of the segments, very closely followed by Robinia pseudacacia.

The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the <b>neophyte</b> Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the <b>neophyte</b> into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E

25|$|There {{were five}} initial charges lodged against the Templars. The first was {{renunciation}} of and spitting {{on the cross}} during initiation into the Order. The second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel, posterior and mouth. The third was telling the <b>neophyte</b> (novice) that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly. The fourth was that the cord worn by the <b>neophyte</b> day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol {{in the form of}} a human head with a great beard, and that this idol was adored in all chapters. The fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating Mass.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1800 the <b>neophyte</b> {{population}} had risen to 277, including both Ohlone and Bay Miwok speakers. By the end of 1805 all Indians of the East Bay south of Carquinez Strait were at the missions. After a devastating measles epidemic that reduced the mission population by one quarter in 1806, people from more distant areas and new language groups began to join the Mission San Jose community. The first such language group was the Yokuts or Yokutsan, whose speakers began to move to Mission San José from the San Joaquin Valley in 1810. Members of two more language groups, the Coast Miwok from present Sonoma County and Patwin from present Napa and Solano counties, moved down to Mission San Jose in the 1812–1818 period, but in smaller numbers than the Yokuts. By 1825 Delta Yokuts was the dominant language in the multi-lingual community of 1,796 people. Over {{the next few years}} speakers of yet another language group, Plains Miwok, moved to the mission from {{the north side of the}} Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. By the time Mission San Jose was closed as an agricultural commune in the mid-1830s, Plains Miwok was the predominant native language among its <b>neophyte</b> Indian people (Milliken 2008).|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} focused on {{evaluating}} changes {{in the presence of}} alien species in ruderal vegetation. Two datasets comprising phytosociological relevés of ruderal communities during two time periods within the Bratislava City (in southwestern Slovakia) were analyzed. The old dataset consisted of 387 relevés recorded in the years 1975 – 1982, and the more recent dataset consisted of 308 relevés from the years 2011 – 2014. The relevés from both time periods were assigned to phytosociological classes via the same procedure – numerical classification (hierarchical clustering) using HIERCLUS software. The average values of the percentage number and percentage cover of the archaeophytes and <b>neophytes</b> as groups in the earlier and more recent relevés of each class were compared by the main effects ANOVA analysis in the STATISTICA 7. 0 software. The proportion of each taxon of archaeophytes and <b>neophytes</b> in both datasets was also calculated. The invasive status, origin, and life forms of alien species in both datasets were compared. In total, both datasets comprised 120 archaeophytes and 71 <b>neophytes.</b> The old dataset contained more archeaophytes than the more recent dataset. On the contrary, the more recent dataset contained more <b>neophytes</b> than the old dataset. In the years 2011 – 2014, more invasive <b>neophytes</b> were recorded than in the past. The results revealed a statistically significant decrease in the average percentage number of archaeophytes in the classes Stellarietea mediae, Artemisietea vulgaris, and Galio-Urticetea, and a decrease in the average percentage cover of archaeophytes in the class Artemisietea vulgaris, compared to the past. On the contrary, a statistically significant increase in the average percentage number and cover of <b>neophytes</b> in the classes Artemisietea vulgaris and Galio-Urticetea was recorded. Some rare species of archaeophytes were only recorded 30 years ago (e. g., Kickxia elatine, Silene gallica).

40|$|The {{extent of}} plant invasions was studied in 302 nature {{reserves}} {{located in the}} Czech Republic, central Europe. Lists of vascular plant species were obtained for each reserve, alien species were divided into archaeophytes and <b>neophytes</b> (introduced before and after 1500, respectively). The statistical analysis using general linear models {{made it possible to}} identify the effects of particular variables. Flora representation by <b>neophytes</b> decreased with altitude (explained 23. 8 % of variance) while, with archaeophytes, the effect of altitude depended on their interaction with native species in particular vegetation types. The proportion of <b>neophytes</b> increased with increasing density of human population. Both the number and proportion of aliens plants significantly increased with increasing number of native species in a reserve. This relationship was affected by altitude, and after filtering out this variable, the effect remained positive for <b>neophytes</b> but became negative for archaeophytes in humid grasslands. The positive relationship between <b>neophytes</b> and native species is not a mere side effect of species–area relationship of native flora, but indicates that the two groups do not directly compete. Vegetation type alone explained 14. 2 and 55. 5 % of variation in proportion of aliens in regions of mesophilous and mountain flora, respectively. Humid grasslands were the least invaded vegetation type. Positioning the reserve within large protected sections of landscape significantly decreases probability of it being invaded by potentially invasive alie...|$|R

25|$|As the Waterpump mission continued, it was {{attached}} to the 606th Air Commando Squadron in 1966. General Vang Pao agitated for his own Hmong pilots to support his Clandestine Army. He pointed out that the other four military regions of Laos had an RLAF squadron; that they did not share their air assets with him, and that he had need of the same. CIA case agent James William Lair began a pilot training program for him in Thailand, using scrounged light aircraft and instructor pilots scrounged from the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit, Continental Air Services, Inc, and the Royal Thai Air Force. By Summer 1967, the improvised program had graduated dozens of <b>neophyte</b> pilots in its three classes. Two of them were the first of 19 Hmong pilots accepted for Waterpump training.
