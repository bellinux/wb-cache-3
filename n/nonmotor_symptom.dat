40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the frequency and clinical features of gastroesophageal reflex disease (GERD) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Consecutively recruited PD patients and controls were questioned about heartburn and GERD with a questionnaire. In PD patients, disease duration and severity, quality of life, and nonmotor symptoms were also examined and then the clinical features of GERD were analyzed. A total of 102 patients and 49 controls were enrolled and 21 patients and 4 controls had heartburn, significantly frequent in PD. The prevalence rate of GERD was 26. 5 % in PD and the odds ratio was 4. 05. Heartburn, bent forward flexion, and wearing-off phenomenon were frequent, and scores of UPDRS, total and part II, PD questionnaire- 39, and <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> scale were significantly higher in PD patients with GERD than without GERD. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed statistical significance in UPDRS part II and <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> scale. This study suggests that GERD is prevalent in PD. Deterioration of daily living activities and other nonmotor symptoms can imply the presence of GERD. Because clinical symptoms of GERD are usually treatable, the management can improve the patient’s quality of life. Increased attention should be given to detect GERD in PD...|$|E

40|$|Background. The nonmotor {{symptoms}} are important determinants {{of health and}} quality of life in Parkinson’s disease but are not well recognized and addressed in clinical practice. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of nonmotor symptoms and their impact on quality of life in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study among patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. Exclusion criteria were a Mini Mental State Examination score of < 21 / 30. Prevalence of nonmotor symptoms was determined using the NMSQuest. The severity of nonmotor symptoms and the quality of life were assessed using validated disease-specific questionnaires (PDQ- 39 and NMSS). Results. A total of 113 patients consisting of 60 males and 53 females were recruited. The median duration of illness was 5. 0 (2. 0 – 8. 0) years. The prevalence rate of nonmotor symptoms in our cohort was 97. 3 %. The most common reported <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> in our cohort was gastrointestinal (76. 1 %). We found that the severity of the nonmotor symptoms was associated with poorer quality of life scores (rs: 0. 727, P< 0. 001). Conclusions. Nonmotor symptoms were highly prevalent in our patients with Parkinson’s disease and adversely affected {{the quality of life of}} our patients. In contrast to western studies, the most common <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> is gastrointestinal. The possibility of an Asian diet playing a role in this observation requires further study...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} the frequency and severity of <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> and their correlations with a wide range of demographic and clinical factors in a large cohort of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods. 268 PD patients were assessed using the validated Movement Disorders Society’s Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ- 39), the Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY), the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SE-ADL) Scale, and the Minimental State Examination (MMSE). Results. <b>Nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> had a strong positive relationship with depression and lower quality of life. Also, age, duration and severity of PD, cognitive impairment, daily dose, and duration of levodopa treatment correlated with the burden of <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Patients with postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) dominance or with the presence of motor complications had higher MDS-UPDRS Part I scores expressing the load of nonmotor features, compared to participants with other disease subtypes or without motor complications.

40|$|<b>Nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> are an {{integral}} part of Parkinson’s disease and cause significant morbidity. Pharmacological therapy helps alleviate the disease but produces nonmotor manifestations.

Compared with pharmacological therapy, bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) -DBS or globus pallidum interna (GPi) -DBS has significant beneficial effects on pain, sleep, gastrointestinal and urological symptoms. STN-DBS is associated with a mild worsening in verbal fluency while GPi-DBS has no effect on cognition.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that both motor and <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> contribute to health status in Parkinson's disease. Less clear {{is how much}} change in health status can be expected if these clinical variables change. In addition, anxiety, separate from depression, has rarely been examined {{as a predictor of}} health status. We used hierarchical multiple regression analysis and standardized beta coefficients in a prevalent cohort of 462 patients with Parkinson's disease to explore the relative impact on health status (measured using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire) of 5 well-recognized symptom domains in Parkinson's disease: motor signs, depression, anxiety, cognition, and other <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms.</b> In the health status scores, 19. 6 % of variance was explained by age, number of comorbidities, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent dose. Younger age predicted worse health status. A full regression model containing baseline variables and all 5 symptom domains explained 56 % of the variance in health status. The standardized beta coefficient for depression was 2. 1, 1. 6, and 1. 3 times that of motor signs, anxiety, and other <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms,</b> respectively. Our findings provide a ranking order of clinical variables for their relative impact on health status in Parkinson's disease and show that depression has more than twice the impact of motor signs on health status. Anxiety and other <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> are also important separate determinants of poor health status in Parkinson's disease.

40|$|Introduction. Pain is an {{important}} <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Brain {{areas such as the}} hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex play {{an important}} role in the processing of pain. Since these brain areas are also involved in cognitive functioning, for example, episodic memory and executive functions, respectively, we examined whether a relationship exists between cognitive functioning and spontaneous pain in PD. Methods. Forty-eight patients with PD and 57 controls participated. Cognitive functioning was measured by a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Both the sensory-discriminative aspect and the motivational-affective aspect of pain were assessed. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess a relation between cognition and pain. Results. Cognition was related to neither the sensory nor the affective aspect of pain in our sample of PD patients. Variance in pain measures was primarily explained by symptoms of depression and anxiety. Discussion. The difference between the affective and the sensory aspect of pain might be due to the neuropathology of PD, which is mainly present in areas processing the affective aspect of pain. Pain treatment might improve when mood is taken into account. We provide several explanations for the lack of an association between pain and cognition...|$|E

As facial expression influences emotional perception, summarized as the facial feedback hypothesis, we investigated if patients report fewer depressive symptoms if injections of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) include the “grief muscles” of the glabellar region, compared to treatment of orbicularis oculi muscles alone. Ninety BL patients were included, half of whom had BoNT treatment including the frown lines. While treatment pattern did not predict depressive symptoms overall, subgroup analysis revealed that in male BL patients, BoNT injections into the frown lines were associated with remarkably less depressive symptoms. We hypothesize that in BL patients presenting with dystonia of the eyebrow region, BoNT therapy should include frown line application whenever justified, to optimize nonmotor effects of BoNT denervation.

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease. The cardinal clinical features of PD are motor and include bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor with an asymmetric pattern. Apart from these, various <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> (NMS) also occur in PD and constitute a major clinical symptoms. NMS can present at any stage of the disease including early and pre-motor phase of PD. Management of PD requires recognition of both motor and <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> as well as an understanding of the relationship between these symptoms and how they can be affected by treatments for PD. Therapy should be individualized for each patient, as treatments for the motor symptoms of PD can improve some <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> while they can worsen others. Some non-motor symptoms, including depression, constipation, pain, genitourinary problems, and sleep disorders, can be improved with antiparkinsonian drugs. Other non-motor symptoms can be more refractory and need the introduction of novel non-dopaminergic drugs in association with rehabilitation programs.

40|$|Olfactory {{dysfunction}} is {{a frequent}} <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and may be considered as an early clinical feature of the disease preceding motor symptoms by years. According to recent neuropathological staging concepts, impaired olfaction is assumed to indicate an early pathological process and might be associated with structural changes in the brain. A morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance images [voxel-based morphometry (VBM) ] was used to investigate gray matter atrophy related to psychophysically measured scores of olfactory function in early PD patients (n = 15, median Hoehn and Yahr stage 1. 5), moderately advanced PD patients (n = 12, median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2. 5), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 17). In PD patients, but not in controls, cortical atrophy in olfactory-related brain regions correlated specifically with olfactory dysfunction. Positive correlations between olfactory performance and gray matter volume were observed in the right piriform cortex in early PD patients and in the right amygdala in moderately advanced patients. The results provided first evidence that olfactory dysfunction in PD is related to atrophy in olfactory-eloquent regions of the limbic and paralimbic cortex.

40|$|Background. The early {{detection}} of wearing-off in Parkinson disease (DEEP) observational study demonstrated that women with Parkinson’s disease (PD) carry an increased risk (80. 1 %) for wearing-off (WO). This post hoc analysis of DEEP study evaluates gender differences on WO and associated phenomena. Methods. Patients on dopaminergic treatment for ≥ 1 year were included in this multicenter observational cross-sectional study. In a single visit, WO was diagnosed based on neurologist assessment {{as well as the}} use of the 19 -item wearing-off questionnaire (WOQ- 19); WO was defined for scores ≥ 2. Post hoc analyses were conducted to investigate gender difference for demographic and clinical features with respect to WO. Results. Of 617 patients enrolled, 236 were women and 381 were men. Prevalence of WO was higher among women, according to both neurologists’ judgment (61. 9 % versus 53. 8 %, P= 0. 045) and the WOQ- 19 analysis (72. 5 % versus 64. 0 %, P= 0. 034).

Assessments were baseline and follow-up (6 months) with Hoehn and Yahr staging, unified PD rating scale (UPDRS-III and UPDRS-IV), Parkinson disease questionnaire (PDQ- 8, quality of life [QoL]) and <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> scale (NMSS). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. The IJL-treated group showed highly significant improvements in UPDRS-III (P = 0. 005), UPDRS-IV (P = 0. 0004), total NMSS score (P = 0. 004), and QoL (P = 0. 01), whereas the C group showed no change in these parameters. A large effect size of IJL was seen in treated patients for UPDRS-III (1. 13), UPDRS-IV (1. 52), NMSS score (0. 82), and QoL (1. 12), whereas continuing conventional treatment registered no effect in C.

40|$|Sleep {{dysfunction}} is {{a common}} <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> experienced by patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder and others, can significantly affect {{quality of life and}} daytime functioning in these patients. Recent studies have evaluated the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) at various targets on sleep in patients with advanced PD. Several of these studies have provided evidence that subthalamic nucleus DBS improves subjective and objective measures of sleep, including sleep efficiency, nocturnal mobility, and wake after sleep onset (minutes spent awake after initial sleep onset). Although fewer studies have investigated the effects of bilateral internal globus pallidus and thalamic ventral intermedius DBS on sleep, pallidal stimulation does appear to improve subjective sleep quality. Stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus has recently been proposed for selected patients with advanced PD to treat severe gait and postural dysfunction. Owing {{to the role of the}} pedunculopontine nucleus in modulating behavioral state, the impact of stimulation at this target on sleep has also been evaluated in a small number of patients, showing that pedunculopontine nucleus DBS increases REM sleep. In this review, we discuss the effects of stimulation at these various targets on sleep in patients with PD. Studying the effects of DBS on sleep can enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep disorders, provide strategies for optimizing clinical benefit from DBS, and may eventually guide novel therapies for sleep dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|Fatigability is {{a common}} <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> in Parkinson's disease (PD), which worsens {{quality of life in}} patients. Objective: to analyze the {{association}} of fatigability with the duration of PD and the degree of movement and neuropsychic (depression, nocturnal sleep disorders, daytime sleepiness) disorders; to evaluate changes in the manifestations of fatigability during therapy with the dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole (Mirapex). Patients and methods. Sixty patients with PD (disease duration 6. 02 ± 3. 47 years; stage 2. 68 ± 0. 62) without dementia were examined using the PD fatigue scale (PFS- 16), unified PD rating scale (Part 2), the Beck depression inventory, the PD sleep scale, and the Epworth sleeping scale. Results. 66 % of the patients were found to consider fatigability {{to be one of the}} three most daily life-limiting manifestations of the disease. The integrated rating of fatigability significantly correlated with total depression scores and sleep scores. During pramipexole therapy, there were statistically significant positive changes in fatigability, which did not correlate with those in motor functions, depression, and sleep problems. It is concluded that fatigability substantially impairs the daily activities of patients with PD and is associated with neuropsychic symptoms to a greater extent than with the degree of movement disorders in PD. This may be due to both the common pathophysiological mechanisms of these abnormalities and their comorbidity in PD. The fact that there is no significant association of the time course of changes in fatigability with alterations in the parameters of other neuropsychic functions during therapy conceivably indicated the independent genesis of this symptom...|$|E

Patients underwent routine evaluation with the four-minute “Sniffin Sticks” test, RBD, depression, and constipation. Results. 291 patients were included in the analysis. Conclusion. We found that lower olfaction scores based on “Sniffin Sticks” testing combined with reports of depression and constipation are independent predictors for the diagnosis of the spectrum of Lewy body Parkinsonian disorders (LBPD). Parkinson’s disease (PD) cannot be reliably clinically differentiated from other causes of Parkinsonism that share symptomatology and structural abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether alexithymia {{is linked to}} the disease process or to psychopathology, particularly depression, in Parkinson disease (PD) patients. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Neuropsychiatry outpatient clinic. Participants: One hundred PD patients and 100 comparison subjects (CS). Measurements: PD patients and CS underwent a clinical and neuropsychiatric evaluation. Alexithymia was assessed with the 20 -item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS- 20). Severity of depressive symptoms was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. A structured psychiatric interview was used to diagnose major and minor depression. Logistic regression analyses with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association between alexithymia and PD. Results: Alexithymia occurred twice as often in PD patients (22 %) as in CS (11 %) and major depressive disorder occurred twice as often in CS (30 %) than in PD (16 %). The frequency of minor depression was almost identical (about 40 %) in the 2 groups. Alexithymia was also associated with PD independently from depression. Indeed, after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, antidepressant use and depression severity, PD patients had an almost fourfold higher risk of having alexithymia (OR: 3. 9, 95 % I. 5 - 10. 0) and 24 times increased odds of having high scores on the TAS- 20 items assessing difficulty in identifying emotions than CS (OR: 23. 7, 95 % CI: 10. 1 - 55. 6). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that alexithymia is a depression-independent phenomenon in PD patients and may be associated with the disease process. Alexithymia is an important <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptom</b> of PD and should be considered in patient assessment and management. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2012; 20 : 133 - 141...|$|E

We compared the profile of depressive symptoms in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) patients with that of control subjects (CS) suffering from non-neurological medical illnesses. Methods: One-hundred PD patients and 100 CS were submitted to a structured clinical interview for identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) and minor depressive disorder (MIND), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), criteria. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were also administered to measure depression severity. Results: When considering the whole groups, there were no differences in depressive symptom frequency between PD and CS apart from worthlessness/guilt, and changes in appetite reduced rates in PD. Further, total scores and psychic and somatic subscores of HDRS and BDI did not differ between PD and CS. After we separated PD and CS in those with MDD, MIND, and no depression (NODEP), comparing total scores and psychic/somatic subscores of HDRS and BDI, we found increased total depression severity in NODEP PD and reduced severity of the psychic symptoms of depression in MDD PD, with no differences in MIND. However, the severity of individual symptom frequency of depression was not different between PD and CS in MDD, MIND, and NODEP groups. Conclusion: Although MDD and MIND phenomenology in PD may be very similar to that of CS with non-neurological medical illnesses, neurological symptoms of PD may worsen (or confound) depression severity in patients with no formal/structured DSM-IV-TR, diagnosis of depressive mood disorders. Thus, a thorough assessment of depression in PD should take into consideration the different impacts of neurological manifestations on MDD, MIND, and NODEP.

40|$|Cell therapy {{studies in}} {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been confined to intrastriatal transplantation of dopamine-rich fetal mesencephalic tissue in efforts to improve motor performance. Although some PD patients receiving the dopamine-rich grafts showed improvements in motor symptoms due to replacement of dopaminergic neurons, they still suffered from <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> including depression, fatigue, visual hallucinations, and sleep problems. Using functional imaging and clinical evaluation of motor and <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> in three PD patients transplanted with intrastriatal fetal grafts 13 to 16 years previously, we assessed whether reestablishment of dopaminergic neuronal networks is sufficient to improve {{a broad range of}} symptoms. At 13 to 16 years after transplantation, dopaminergic innervation was restored to normal levels in basal ganglia and preserved in a number of extrabasal ganglia areas. These changes were associated with long-lasting relief of motor symptoms. Then, we assessed the integrity of their serotonergic and norepinephrine neuronal systems using [C- 11]DASB {[C- 11] 3 -amino- 4 -(2 -dimethylaminomethylphenylthio) benzonitrile} positron emission tomography (PET) and F- 18 -dopa PET, respectively. F- 18 -Dopa uptake in the locus coeruleus was within the normal range. In contrast, [C- 11] DASB uptake in the raphe nuclei and regions receiving serotonergic projections was markedly reduced. These results indicate ongoing degeneration of serotonergic raphe nuclei and their projections to regions involved in the regulation of sleep, arousal, feeding, satiety, mood, and emotion. Our findings indicate that future cell-based therapies using fetal tissue or stem cells in PD patients may require additional grafts of serotonergic neurons to relieve <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> by restoring serotonergic neurotransmission in specific cerebral targets...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} effects of group-based and individual-based Tai Chi {{training}} on <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease. Design. Randomized controlled pilot study. Methods. 36 community-dwelling patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{were randomly assigned to}} either group-based training group (n= 19) or individual-based group (n= 17). Both groups received same content of Tai Chi training 3 times a week for 13 weeks. Participants were also asked to perform home exercises daily. The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale was used to assess global <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> change. Sleep quality, depression, and cognition were evaluated by Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, and Beijing version-Montreal Cognitive Assessment, respectively. Home exercise compliance was recorded. Results. There {{was no significant difference between}} two groups at baseline. After 13 weeks, there were no statistical significance between two groups. However, the within-group effect was different. Participants in group-based and individual-based groups showed a significant improvement on global <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> (P< 0. 001, P= 0. 004) and sleep (P< 0. 001, P< 0. 001). But only group-based training patients presented a significant improvement in cognitive impairment compared with baseline (P= 0. 002, P- 0. 116). For depression, no group gained a significant improvement(P= 0. 123, P= 0. 170). Group-based participants had a higher home-exercise compliance rate (HeCR) than individual-based participants did (P= 0. 019), and HeCR showed a moderate correlation with MoCA-BJ and NMSS scores changes in this study. Conclusion. Group-based Tai Chi training is considered to be a more effective and a more labor-saving method in the clinical settings, and patients tend to have a higher compliance rate in their home exercise program.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the concor- dance between disease severity, {{prevalence}} of <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms,</b> age, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability and medication use in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Severity was classified with the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale and Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) calculated. HRQoL was evaluated with the SF- 36, disability with the WHO-DAS II and <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> with the NMSQuest. Patients were clustered using SF- 36 and WHO-DAS II into three groups covering the contin- uum from low disability and HRQoL, to severe disability and HRQoL decrement. Contingency Coefficient were used to verify the relationships between clusters and HY stage; ANOVA to evaluate differences in NMS, age and LEDD between clusters; odds ratio to test the likelihood of taking levodopa or dopamine agonist and being member of the three clusters; t test to evaluate differences in LEDD between patients with HY C 3 or B 2. Eighty-six patients were clustered: 48 had low disability and HRQoL decre- ment, 18 intermediate disability and HRQoL decrement and 20 high disability and HRQoL decrement. A significant relationship was found between PD severity groups, HRQoL and disability profiles. No differences for age and LEDD were observed in the three groups, and those with more disability and lower HRQoL reported a higher number of nonmotor symptoms; patients in HY C 3 were prescribed higher doses of drugs. In conclusion, we found a substantial concordance between PD staging, prevalence of <b>nonmotor</b> <b>symptoms</b> and patient-reported HRQoL and disability measures. In our opinion, the SF- 36 and the WHO-DAS II can be used for profiling patients...|$|R
