5|$|WWV {{had been}} {{broadcasting}} second pulses since 1937, but these pulses were <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> to actual time. In June 1944, the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV {{to use the}} USNO's clock {{as a source for}} its time signals. Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Frequencies of 600Hz and 440Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35MHz. The 30 and 35MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2011, {{the final}} Bowl Championship Series standings were {{unveiled}} with LSU ranked first, followed by Alabama, {{to set up}} a rematch between the two teams in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the weeks that led up to the game, the notion of a split national championship became a major storyline. This was the case as the AP Poll is <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> to the Bowl Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS National Championship Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus national championship and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with {{no evidence of any}} decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E

5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{sequence}} databases like GenBank contain many sequences {{that are}} <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> to vouchered specimens (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images).
