5000|$|In its verdict against <b>Ante</b> <b>Gotovina,</b> the ICTY for {{the first}} time also {{concluded}} that the war in Croatia constituted an international armed conflict as the military of Serbian Krajina acted as an extension to Serbia's military. In particular, the Trial Chamber considered the evidence pertaining to Serbian President Milošević's control and influence over SVK forces and Serbia/FRY's funding, arming and supplying of the Krajina Serbs. Based on the above evidence, the Trial Chamber finds that Serbia/FRY had overall control of the SVK. Recalling the agreement of all the parties that Croatia and Serbia were engaged more broadly in hostilities around the beginning of the Indictment period, the Trial Chamber further finds that the armed conflict that existed {{at the outset of the}} Indictment period was international. If it was not already an international armed conflict in 1991, then it became one based on the SVK acting on behalf of Serbia/FRY ICTY in its verdict against <b>Ante</b> <b>Gotovina</b> ...|$|R
