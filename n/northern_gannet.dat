2500|$|The island plays host to {{more than}} 150,000 gannets and is the world's largest colony of Northern gannets. Described famously by naturalists as [...] "one of the {{wildlife}} wonders of the world" [...] (often credited to Sir David Attenborough). [...] It was also awarded BBC Countryfile Magazine's Nature Reserve of the Year, following a nomination by Chris Packham, in 2014/15. When viewed from the mainland, large regions of the surface appear white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152,000kg of ammonia per year, equivalent to the achievements of 10 million broilers). In fact the scientific name for the <b>Northern</b> <b>gannet,</b> Sula bassana or Morus bassanus, [...] derives its name from the rock. It was known traditionally in Scots as a [...] "solan goose". In common with other gannetries, such as St Kilda, the birds were harvested for their eggs and the flesh of their young chicks, which were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2,000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species that frequent the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E

2500|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{reproductive}} strategies employed by different species. Some animals, such as the human and <b>northern</b> <b>gannet,</b> do not reach sexual maturity for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to adulthood. For example, a rabbit (mature after 8 months) can produce 10–30 offspring per year, and a fruit fly (mature after 10–14 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as K-selection (few offspring) and r-selection (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by evolution depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population. [...] Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called sperm storage thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.|$|E

50|$|The IUCN lists <b>northern</b> <b>gannets</b> as {{a species}} of least concern, as they are widely distributed, do not fulfil many of the {{criteria}} set for vulnerable species, and {{as there is a}} large population that appears to be growing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>gannets</b> only lay one egg that {{on average}} weighs 104.5 grams. This is lighter than for other seabirds. Where two eggs {{are found in}} a nest {{this is the result}} of two females laying an egg in the same nest or one of the eggs has been stolen from another nest. <b>Northern</b> <b>gannets</b> will lay another egg if the first one is lost. Incubation takes 42 to 46 days. During {{incubation}} the egg is surrounded by the brooding bird’s webbed feet that are flooded with warming blood. The process of breaking the eggshell can take up to 36 hours. When this is about to take place the brooding bird will release the egg from its webbed feet to prevent the egg from breaking under the adult's weight as the chick breaks it open. This is a frequent cause of death for chicks of birds that are breeding for the first time. The webbed feet are also used to cover the chicks, which are only rarely left alone by their parents. Chicks that are left unattended are often attacked and killed by other <b>northern</b> <b>gannets.</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has hinted at {{changes in the}} migratory patterns of seabirds nesting in Scotland, including a decreasing number of <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets</b> Morus bassanus wintering in the North Sea, {{and an increase in}} numbers of <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets</b> and Great Skuas Stercorarius skua spending the winter off north-western Africa (NWA). Both species show increasing numbers of colonies in northern areas, including Norway and Russia. These seabird species move through the North Sea during autumn migration, and from there search for favourable wintering grounds mainly around Iberia, including the Atlantic coast of Portugal, the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Cadiz. By means of historic ring recovery data, provided by the British Trust for Ornithology, it was possible to establish that the number of records of adults of both species are increasing in recent years from NWA coasts, despite having to attend their nests in the colonies and, as a result, having limited time to migrate south. Differences were observed in ring recovery locations between years and months. The number of ring recoveries by month coincides with records from observation points along the coast of Western Europe. However, ring recovery data are limited and potentially biased. Using data loggers, it was possible to establish that both species are diurnal in habits during the entire winter period, showing noticeable differences in the times spent flying during the migration months (September-October) and during the wintering and breeding months (January and March respectively), and to confirm the increasing tendency to winter off NWA in recent years. Analyses of fishing landings, discard rates, and sea surface temperature data, show that food available to <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets</b> and Great Skuas is increasing in NWA coasts where oceanographic conditions are stable; in contrast in the North Sea fisheries are decreasing and the sea surface is warming. Both species are apparently changing their migratory behaviour in order to face the constant changes in the abundance of food. Given the long life-span of <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets</b> and Great Skuas, genetic changes can be ruled out of an explanation for the changes in migration behaviour, {{and the fact that the}} changes in winter distribution appear to be occurring within one generation of the birds. The winter distribution of <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets</b> and Great Skuas may be due to an ideal free distribution over a wide range, in response to changes in the distribution of fish and the availability of discards.

40|$|Land-based {{counts of}} {{migrating}} seabirds remain essential to increase knowledge about their numbers and movements. To assess {{the value of}} Cabo Carvoeiro (Peniche, Portugal) as a monitoring site in the East Atlantic, we studied seabird species composition, passage patterns and flock size during mid-October 2014. During standardized counts, we observed nearly 8 000 seabirds of 17 species. The ratio of individuals passing in a southerly to southwesterly direction was > 96 % in all species, showing that genuine migrants were counted. The passage rate (birds/hour) was higher for <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets</b> Morus bassanus than for any other species, {{by a factor of}} approximately 50 (morning mean 906 /h, afternoon mean 1 153 /h). The globally endangered Balearic Shearwaters Puffinus mauretanicus, Great Skuas Stercorarius skua and Pomarine Skuas S. pomarinus had passage rates of 10 – 25 /h. Flock size distribution in the 11 most numerous species showed that most migrated singly or in groups of two. Flock size was larger in Balearic Shearwaters than in both Cory’s Calonectris borealis and Manx Shearwaters P. puffinus. Among skuas, flock size was larger in Pomarine than in Great Skuas. The passage rate of Manx Shearwaters was positively correlated with that of <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets,</b> Great Skuas and Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis. <b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets</b> showed a positive co-variation with Pomarine Skuas. Balearic and Sooty Shearwaters Ardenna griseus were the only species that did not show any significant co-variation with another species. Morning and afternoon passage rates did not differ significantly in any of the six most numerous species (<b>Northern</b> <b>Gannets,</b> Cory’s and Balearic Shearwaters, Great and Pomarine Skuas, and Sandwich Terns), or in Sooty Shearwaters (less numerous). Thus, the passage rates at Cabo Carvoeiro in October of Balearic Shearwaters and five other species were as high or higher than those reported from any other seawatch in Portugal, indicating the international value of seabird monitoring at Cabo Carvoeiro during the autumn migration...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} caused {{the death of}} a large number of seabirds in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the long term {{consequences}} of oil exposure on migratory birds overwintering in this area have received limited attention. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of oil contamination (e. g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) on the circulating status of prolactin and corticosterone, two hormones that influence reproductive success in birds, in <b>Northern</b> <b>gannets</b> (Morus bassanus) breeding on Bonaventure Island, Eastern Canada. Using light-based geolocators, it was found that 23. 5 % of <b>Northern</b> <b>gannets</b> from Bonaventure Island overwintered in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 - 2011; the remainder of this population overwintered along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. PAH concentrations (eight compounds) in gannet blood cells were all found to be under the method limits of quantification, which could be the result of the ability of seabirds to metabolize these compounds and the time elapsed between oil exposure and blood sampling. Corticosterone and prolactin levels as well as body mass did not differ between the two major birds' wintering sites. Moreover, levels of both these hormones did not vary from early to late incubation period. Present results suggest that if Bonaventure Island-breeding <b>Northern</b> <b>gannets</b> had been exposed to oil in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of this historical spill, this exposure could not be associated with changes in hormonal status and body mass in breeding individuals...|$|R
