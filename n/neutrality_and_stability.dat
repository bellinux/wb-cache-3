40|$|Abstract—The Internet {{consists}} of economically selfish players {{in terms of}} access/transit connection, content distribution, and users. Such selfish behaviors often lead to techno-economic ineffi-ciencies such as unstable peering and revenue imbalance. Recent research results suggest that cooperation in revenue sharing (thus multi-level ISP settlements) can be a candidate solution for the problem of unfair revenue share. However, {{it is unclear whether}} providers are willing to behave cooperatively. In this paper, we study the interaction between how content-oriented traffic scheduling at the edge is and how stable the intended cooperation is. We consider three traffic scheduling policies having various degrees of content-value preference, compare them in terms of implementation complexity, network <b>neutrality,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> of cooperation, and present interesting trade-offs among them...|$|E

This return current maintains plasma <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> the <b>stability</b> of the beam of streaming electrons. The electric field that drives this return current also decelerates the energetic electrons in the beam. The corresponding energy loss experienced by the accelerated electrons can affect the observed properties of the X-ray and radio emissions from flares {{and the evolution of}} the thermal flare plasma. I will discuss the properties of the flare emissions expected in a classical, steady-state model. As part of this discussion, I will examine Gordon Emslie's 1980 conjecture that return-current losses result in a maximum brightness for the hard X-ray emission from flares...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tetradentate Schiff base {{compounds}} were synthesized by condensing 1 equiv. of 1, 2 -phenyl diamine along with four groups of 2 equiv. of salicylaldehyde derivatives. Chemical characteristics of compounds {{were analyzed by}} using instruments including proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR), elemental analysis (EA), electron-impact mass spectroscopy (EI-Mass) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Moreover, these Schiff base compounds were labeled with trace level 99 m-TcO, freshly eluted from a 4 99 99 m 99 m Mo / Tc generator, to form Tc complexes. Methods such as solvent extraction into chloroform, paper electrophoresis, and chromatographic techniques were employed to evaluate the labeling yields, lipophilicity, <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> time <b>stability</b> of 99 m Tc complexes. In simple terms, high labeling yield (> 93 %), great lipophilicity (log P> 2. 37) <b>and</b> excellent <b>stability</b> of 99 mTc complexes were formulated upon the condition using pH 9 bicarbonate buffers. Biodistribution study demonstrates that the metabolic pathway of 99 m Tc complexes on Wistar rats is via hepatobiliary duct. Furthermore, the accumulated 99 m Tc activities in rats after bearing with N 1 -S 1 tumor cells show cold hepatoma area...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of a beam balance are little appreciated and seldom understood. We here consider {{the conditions that}} result in a stable balance, with center of gravity below the fulcrum (pivot point), while an unstable balance results when {{the center of gravity}} is above the fulcrum. The highly sensitive drinking-straw microbalance, which uses a plastic drinking straw as a rigid beam, is briefly described with some slight convenient modifications. Different placements of the center of gravity are considered analytically to explain the equilibrium <b>neutrality,</b> <b>stability,</b> <b>and</b> instability of such beam balances as the microbalance, the playground “seesaw” or “teeter-totter,” the “dipping bird,” and other toys and magic tricks...|$|R

The government attaches a high priority to the security <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> {{formality}} of accounting {{as a form}} of intervention in situations of conflict faced by Nongovernmental Organisations (NGOs). In this thesis, <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> formality of accounting are limited to evaluation devices and formats used by donors to assess NGOs, specifically the Logical Framework (LF). Technical attributes and views were desirable for making sense of evaluator experiences in development projects in the 1960 s. Responding to this, contractors under the United States International Development Agency (USAID) combined scientific and management approaches and created the LF (Chapter 2). Many development agencies since then have required NGOs to use an LF within project proposals and as a basis to monitor and evaluate project performance. At the same time, the <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> formality of the LF have been widely criticised in development circles. This thesis found, however, that in situations where conflict is prevalent, <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> formality play a role in shaping, informing and structuring conflict. To understand ways in which conflict and technicality intersect, this thesis is based on a case study of a grassroots NGO in Sri Lanka, Sarvodaya. This thesis identifies and discusses conflict between donors and the NGO, conflict as part of society and conflict between actors within an NGO project. Contrary to previous literature in accounting, <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> formality in Sarvodaya were found to be a malleable resource for mobilisation in conflict situations. <b>Neutrality</b> <b>and</b> formality of evaluation devices, mainly the LF, were used in Sarvodaya as a way to strategize around sources of conflict between external donors and internal NGO accounts in the late 1980 s (Chapter 4). Later, after the end of Sri Lanka’s civil war, the LF was used to work on projects focused on reconciliation <b>and</b> reconstruction. <b>Neutrality</b> <b>and</b> formality of the LF helped to transform social conflicts into manageable projects in Sarvodaya (Chapter 5). Lastly, this thesis proposes a framing of ‘sights’ – plain sight, oversight and foresight - to explore the ways in which <b>neutrality</b> <b>and</b> formality provide a visual methodology for staff to make sense of their daily work, accountability and visions of the future (Chapter 6) ...|$|R
