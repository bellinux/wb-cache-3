5|$|More recent models {{attempt to}} model bubble dynamics, also usually by {{simplified}} models, {{to facilitate the}} computation of tables, and later to allow real time predictions during a dive. Models that approximate bubble dynamics are varied. They range from those that are <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> complex than the dissolved phase models, to those that require considerably greater computational power.|$|E
5|$|The Zytglogge's {{internal}} layout {{has changed}} over time to reflect the tower's change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower. The thirteenth-century guard tower was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than a hollow shell of walls that was open towards {{the city in the}} east. Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted.|$|E
5|$|The {{finished}} road, {{while an}} improvement over the previous route, still was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than a track, and remained such throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Efforts to seal the highway began in Norseman in 1960, with the Western Australian section completed in 1969 and the South Australian section finished in 1976. Further improvement works have been undertaken since the 1980s, including widening and reconstructing portions of the road.|$|E

5|$|Robie Mortin {{came forward}} as a {{survivor}} during this time; {{she was the}} only one added to the list who could prove she lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine survivors who were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press of friends and relatives who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> expensive than the last pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter. Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power {{in spite of their}} price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|The next {{trip was}} up to Anchorage, for the Northern Lights Invitational, a three-day, eight-team tournament. The first game was an easy win against Akron, in which Summitt played her bench frequently. The semi-final game, against Texas A, was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult. The Ladies won handily, 105–81, leading {{by as much as}} 25. Texas A's 81 points would end up being the most a team would score on Tennessee that season. The {{championship}} game was against Wisconsin, a team ranked in the top 10, but this ranking did not mean much, as the team ended 1997 with an 87–66 victory. The Meeks were named to the All-Tournament team.|$|E

5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than {{a hole in}} the ground. He {{was probably}} buried {{in such a way as}} to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{most troubling}} aspect of colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the {{required}} number of colonists, {{so that the}} failure {{of many of the}} other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in the <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> fruitful Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.|$|E

By the 7th century, Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.|$|E

25|$|Depending on culture, {{there may}} be varying degrees of {{separation}} {{between men and women}} and different levels of privacy. Typically, the entire room, or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet, is lockable. Urinals, if present in a men's toilet, are typically mounted on a wall with or without a divider between them. In the most basic form, a public toilet may be <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than an open latrine. Another form is a street urinal known as a pissoir, after the French term.|$|E

25|$|Most of the palaces and {{temples of}} Palenque were {{constructed}} during his government; the city flourished as never before, eclipsing Tikal. The central complex, known as The Palace, was enlarged and remodeled on various occasions, {{notably in the}} years 654, 661, and 668. In this structure, is a text describing how in that epoch Palenque was newly allied with Tikal, and also with Yaxchilan, {{and that they were}} able to capture the six enemy kings of the alliance. <b>Not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> had been translated from the text.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the very}} {{enlarged}} wing, an empty RB-57D weighed <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than an empty B-57 {{due to the}} lightening measures taken. The most extreme measures were taken with the wings, which were thin metal honeycomb sections that formed a full wet wing (even in the leading edges). To avoid the weight of rivets, the wings were assembled with a special glue. The wing skin was waxed for aerodynamic smoothness. With a surface skin of only 0.010inch thick, dropping a small tool on the wing could damage the skin. Even deicing fluid used on the aircraft could potentially cause the glue used to lose strength.|$|E
25|$|Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{were limited}} to 139 for 5 by {{economical}} Derbyshire Phantoms bowling – which allowed them to take singles and <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> at Derby. Only ten boundaries were hit during Nottinghamshire's innings, all in fours, and Chris Read – who had a Twenty20 strike rate of 129.12 during the season – was limited to 29 off 31 balls. The Derbyshire reply was spearheaded by Michael di Venuto who made an unbeaten 77 and added 92 with Jonathan Moss for the second wicket. Derbyshire passed their target with nine wickets and 20 balls in hand, and the victory gave them a quarter-final berth.|$|E

25|$|Mansa Mahmud III's reign ended around 1559. There {{seems to}} have been either a vacancy or unknown ruler between 1559 and the start of the last mansas reign. A vacancy or rule by a court {{official}} seems the most likely, since the next ruler takes the name of Mahmud IV. By 1560, the once powerful empire was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than the core of the Manden Kurufaba. The next notable mansa, Mahmud IV, doesn’t appear in any records {{until the end of the}} 16th century. However, he {{seems to have}} the distinction of being the last ruler of a unified Manden. His descendants are blamed for the breakup of the Manden Kurufaba into north, central and southern realms.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{light rail}} {{vehicles}} can travel in multi-car trains carrying a theoretical ridership up to 20,000 passengers per hour in much narrower rights-of-way, <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than two car lanes wide {{for a double}} track system. They can often be run through existing city streets and parks, or placed in the medians of roads. If run in streets, trains are usually limited by city block lengths to about four 180-passenger vehicles (720 passengers). Operating on two-minute headways using traffic signal progression, a well-designed two-track system can handle up to 30 trains per hour per track, achieving peak rates of over 20,000 passengers per hour in each direction. More advanced systems with separate rights-of-way using moving block signalling can exceed 25,000 passengers per hour per track.|$|E
25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{is known}} {{historically}} of Sulmo, which, however, {{appears to have}} {{continued to be a}} considerable provincial town. Ovid speaks of it as one of the three municipal towns whose districts composed the territory of the Paeligni: and this is confirmed both by Pliny and the Liber Coloniarum; yet {{it does not seem to}} have ever been large, and Ovid himself designates it as a small provincial town. From the Liber Coloniarum we learn also that it had received the status of a colony, probably in the time of Augustus; though Pliny does not give it the title of a Colonia. Inscriptions, as well as the geographers and Itineraries, attest its continued existence as a municipal town throughout the Roman Empire.|$|E
