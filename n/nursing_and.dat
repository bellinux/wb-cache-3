40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT Title: The {{perceptions}} of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants on care-related prevention concerning people with dementia: a mixed methods approach. Background: Because {{of the growing}} number of people with dementia, care-related prevention activities done by <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants will become increasingly important to prevent complications and maintain an acceptable quality of life. Currently it’s unknown what the {{perceptions of}} <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention in dementia care are. Aim: To gain insight into the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention so care-related prevention for people with dementia can be further improved in the future. Research question: How do <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants working in home care, residential or nursing homes perceive care-related prevention concerning people with dementia? Method: A mixed methods approach with survey research and individual semi-structured interviews. First, secondary analyses were done on existing survey data collected in 2011 on a sample of 206 <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants. Second, in March-May 2014 12 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to embellish the quantitative results. Results: From this study three concepts related to the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> CNAs towards care-related prevention activities emerged: attitude, knowledge and skills <b>and</b> the future. <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants think care-related prevention is a task of their profession. They experience insufficient knowledge and skills and they like to devote more time to care-related prevention in the future. Conclusion: <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants perceive care-related prevention to be part of their profession. They however express the need for more education on care-related prevention, preferably in a classroom setting. In the future, <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants like to devote more time to care-related prevention and e-health can support this. Recommendations: Additional training of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants focused on their different needs and use of e-health...|$|R
