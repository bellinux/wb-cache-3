5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (<b>Numida</b> <b>meleagris).</b> It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey on}} the {{production}} characteristics of guinea fowl (<b>Meleagris</b> <b>numida)</b> {{was carried out in}} the Borgou department located in the soudano-guinean zone North-Est of Benin. Chicks and reproductive groups were kept either on station under improved management conditions or in rural environment. In rural environment, the birds were divided in two groups. The birds pertaining to the first group were treated against parasitic diseases, whereas those in the second one (control group) received no treatment. Under station conditions, the feed conversion ratio and the daily weight gain were 8. 8 and 5. 7 g/day respectively. Mean body weight at six months of age were 1151 g and 1085 g for males and females, respectively. Sexual maturity was reached at 36 weeks of age. For mature hens kept on station, laying rate and the mean egg weight were 37. 2 % (65 % at the peak) and 41. 1 g respectively. Smothering, stress and pricking were the major constraints to the cloistering of guinea fowl. In rural environment, the mean hatchability rate was 70 %. Mortality rate and adult body weight were not significantly different between groups. Mortality rate observed in the rural environment was 50 % for both treated or untreated birds. Apart from the parasitic affections, the main causes of mortality were the rain, the predators, the cold and the fragility of chicks. The mean body weight at six months of age is higher for the birds raised under village conditions in comparison to the birds kept on station. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl takes {{a diverse}} range of birds as prey. More than 50 avian prey species have been {{identified}} and they may locally exceed mammals in importance in the diet, somewhat unusually for eagle-owls. No one type of bird {{can be said to}} be predictably favored as prey and any avian species unfortunate enough to have a nighttime roost or nest that happens to be in an eagle-owl's foraging path may fall victim to this species. Many cases of predation involve nest robbery, with nestlings or fledglings being taken, although adult birds may be taken just as often, especially for species with less conspicuous nests. In South Africa's De Hoop Nature Reserve, it was found that birds were somewhat better represented by both number, 43.3% of remains, and biomass, 57.84% of remains, than mammals or any other prey group. The species best represented in biomass in the prior study was the black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) with several adults estimated to average 1260 g being found among the prey remains. Other fairly common, largish herons are also known to fall prey at night to Verreaux's eagle-owl including the 873 g great egret (Ardea alba), the 1443 g grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the 975 g purple heron (Ardea purpurea). Other medium-sized water birds known to have been represented in this species diet include the 1008 g yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 983 g African black duck (Anas sparsa), the 596 g African swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and the 825 g red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata). Besides herons, another well-represented group of birds in the diet are galliforms. Perhaps the most widely prey species reported from this group is the 1229 g helmeted guineafowl (<b>Numida</b> <b>meleagris),</b> which may seasonally dominate the eagle-owl's food in Kenya. More modestly sized wild galliform species reported in the diet including the 96 g common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the 390 g grey-winged francolin (Francolinus africanus). Domestic fowl, especially those allowed back to a semi-feral state and thus sleeping in the open as is prevalent in Africa, are taken when encountered, including chickens and peafowls.|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{the range}} and sizes of mammals {{included}} in their prey spectrum, birds taken by martial eagles may seem less impressive as a whole but the morphology of the martial eagle, including large wing surface areas, pronounced sexual dimorphism and relatively long toes, shows the species’ partial adaptation to capture of avian prey. Birds are universally considered by biologists more difficult to capture than mammals of the same size. In all, more than 50 bird species {{have been identified as}} the prey of martial eagles. The most significant portion of the avian diet is comprised by medium-sized terrestrial upland birds such as guineafowl, spurfowl and bustards. In total more than a dozen species of the galliform order and the bustard family each have been identified as their prey. When attacking these ground-loving birds, which are understandably quite easily spooked and usually react to potential danger by flying off, martial eagles almost always try to take them on the ground much like they do mammalian prey. If the birds take flight, the hunting attempt will fail, although a hunting eagle may try to surprise the same birds again. In Niger, the most numerous prey species is apparently the 1.29 kg helmeted guineafowl (<b>Numida</b> <b>meleagris).</b> Other guineafowl such as the vulturine (Acryllium vulturinum) and crested guineafowl (Guttera edouardi) are also readily taken elsewhere. Guineafowl and spurfowl were stated as the most numerous prey for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. In Tsavo East National Park, the 0.67 kg red-crested korhaan (Lophotis ruficrista), perhaps the smallest bustard the eagle hunts, is the most numerous prey taken, comprising about 39% of the prey remains. Medium sized bustards such as the 1.2 kg Hartlaub's bustard (Lissotis hartlaubii) and the 1.7 kg Karoo korhaan (Eupodotis vigorsii) were oft-taken supplemental prey in Tsavo East and the Cape Province, respectively. Although these are not usually taken in large numbers, martial eagles are one of the main predators of larger bustards. These may include (averaged between the extremely size dimorphic sexes) the 3.44 kg Ludwig's bustard (Neotis ludwigii), the 5.07 kg Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and even the Kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), seemingly the heaviest bustard in the world on average at 8.43 kg. Attacks on adult male Kori bustards, which are certain to be the largest avian prey attacked by martial eagles and are twice as heavy as females, averaging some 11.1 kg, can be extremely prolonged. One protracted battle resulted in an injured leg for the eagle and massive, fatal blood loss for the male bustard, which was ultimately scavenged by a jackal by the following morning.|$|E

The {{relationships}} between the local guinea fowl's (<b>Numida</b> <b>meleagris)</b> egg weight and keets' production parameters in the central region of Burkina Faso are studied. The local guinea fowl's eggs (n= 2500) are distributed, per interval of 5 g, in five categories of weight going from 25 g to 50 g. The fertility average rate is 84. 4 % and varies with the egg weight. The embryonic death rate average is 17. 3 % and 11. 2 % with 6. 1 % are noticed respectively the 1 st and the 24 th day and between the 25 th and the 31 st day of incubation. The real hatchery rate is significantly (p< 0. 05) correlated (r= 0. 85) to the egg weight. The one-day keets weight average is about 25. 2 ± 1. 9 g and is significantly (p< 0. 05) correlated (r= 0. 96) to egg weight. This positive relation is always observed between the egg weight and the kinetics of the keets growth (r= 0. 97).

The present data suggest that pellet particle size is advantageous in terms of feed intake and efficiency in poultry...|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal tracts from 48 helmeted {{guineafowl}} (<b>Numida</b> <b>meleagris),</b> five Swainson’s spurfowl (Pternistis swainsonii) {{and a single}} Orange River francolin (Scleroptila levaillantoides) were examined for helminth parasites. Twelve species of helminths were found in {{helmeted guineafowl}}, comprising six nematodes, five cestodes and a single acanthocephalan. Six species of nematodes were recovered fromSwainson’s spurfowl and a single nematode was recovered from the Orange River francolin. First-year guineafowl had {{more than twice the}} intensity of infection than did adult guineafowl, particularly regarding the acanthocephalan Mediorhynchus gallinarum, the caecal nematodes Subulura dentigera and S. suctoria, and the cestodes Octopetalum numida, Hymenolepis cantaniana and Numidella numida. Female guineafowl had significantly higher intensities of infection than males, especially concerning M. gallinarum, S. dentigera and N. numida and the nematode Gongylonema congolense. The recovery of the cestode Retinometra sp. from helmeted guineafowl constitutes a new host-parasite record...|$|E
