40|$|Most common complex traits, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cancers, {{are known}} to be {{associated}} with multiple genes, environmental factors, and their epistasis. Recently, the development of advanced genotyping technologies has allowed us to perform genome-wide association studies (GWASs). For detecting the effects of multiple genes on complex traits, many approaches have been proposed for GWASs. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is one of the powerful and efficient methods for detecting high-order gene-gene (GxG) interactions. However, the biological interpretation of GxG interactions identified by MDR analysis is not easy. In order to aid the interpretation of MDR results, we propose a <b>network</b> <b>graph</b> analysis to elucidate the meaning of identified GxG interactions. The proposed <b>network</b> <b>graph</b> analysis consists of three steps. The first step is for performing GxG interaction analysis using MDR analysis. The second step is to draw the <b>network</b> <b>graph</b> using the MDR result. The third step is to provide biological evidence of the identified GxG interaction using external biological databases.

40|$|Abstract—The {{behavior}} {{of an organization}} may be inferred based on the {{behavior of}} its members, their contacts, and their connectivity. One approach to organizational analysis is the construction and interpretation of a social <b>network</b> <b>graph,</b> where entities of an organization (persons, vehicles, locations, events, etc.) are nodes, and edges represent varying kinds of connectivity between entities. This paper describes a transformation based approach to the extraction of a social <b>network</b> <b>graph,</b> where the original data comprising (partial) observation of the organization are embedded on a graph with a different ontology, and with many entities and edges that are unrelated to the organization of interest. Social network extraction allows the inference of implied relationships, and the selection of relationships relevant for intended analysis techniques. The analysis of the resulting social <b>network</b> <b>graph</b> is based on organizational and individual analysis, in order to permit an advanced user to draw conclusions regarding the behavior of the organization, based on established social <b>network</b> <b>graph</b> metrics.

Signed social <b>network</b> <b>graphs</b> {{can be used to}} predict the future evolution of the graph.

According to balance theory, balanced graphs represent {{a group of people who}} are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, but C and A have a negative relationship is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to morph into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concept of balanced and unbalanced cycles, the evolution of signed social <b>network</b> <b>graphs</b> can be predicted.|$|E
