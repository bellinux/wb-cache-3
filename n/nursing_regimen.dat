40|$|The present paper {{describes}} LH and FSH secretion, follicle {{development and}} ovulation in sows that {{were subjected to}} a limited <b>nursing</b> <b>regimen.</b> From Day 14 of lactation, 32 sows were separated from their piglets for 12 h every day (intermittent suckling; IS). Half the sows had boar contact during separation. Nine of 32 sows ovulated spontaneously within 14 days from initiation of IS. The frequency of LH pulses {{on the first day}} of IS tended to be higher in anovulatory sows (6. 3 v. 4. 2 pulses per 12 h; P < 0. 10); other characteristics of LH secretion were similar to sows that ovulated. The characteristics of FSH secretion did not differ over the 8 -h sampling period. Boar contact did not influence either LH and FSH secretion or the number of sows that ovulated. Up to 58 % of anovulatory sows showed an increase in follicle size after initiation of IS and, 4 days after the initiation of IS, one-third still had follicles similar in size to those in ovulatory sows. However, the oestradiol concentration in anovulatory sows did not increase. We conclude that FSH and LH stimulation in anovulatory sows is not limiting for normal follicle development, but that ovarian follicles are not responsive to increased LH secretio...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} luteal phase luteinising hormone (LH) in sows that ovulated due to {{a limited}} <b>nursing</b> <b>regimen</b> (LN). The LN regimen was imposed either at Day 14 or at Day 21 of lactation. At ovulation, lactation was terminated (n = 8) or sows remained lactating throughout early pregnancy (n = 8). Blood samples were collected every 15 min for 8 h during the day, around Day 11 after ovulation. In addition, lactating sows were bled during the night, when piglets were allowed to suckle. The LH pattern was typical for the luteal phase, with one to five pulses per 8 h. The LH characteristics (frequency, base, average, pulse area) did not differ between lactating and weaned sows, except for the amplitude of LH pulses, which was higher in weaned sows compared with lactating sows (1. 22 ± 0. 15 v. 0. 76 ± 0. 11 ng mL¿ 1, respectively; P < 0. 05). In lactating sows, average LH, basal LH {{and the frequency of}} LH pulses were significantly lower during the night, when piglets were allowed to suckle. The sage of lactation at which LN was imposed did not influence LH. In conclusion, {{it is unlikely that the}} small difference in LH explains the considerable difference between lactating and weaned sows in progesterone at Day 12 of pregnancy (24. 1 ± 1. 3 v. 43. 3 ± 4. 0 ng mL¿ 1, respectively; P < 0. 01). Moreover, the difference in progesterone already exists during the early luteal phase (Day 0 ¿ 10), when secretion of the corpora lutea is still independent of LH...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sense of {{coherence}} (SOC) is {{a strong}} determinant of positive health and successful coping. For older {{people living in the}} community or staying in a hospital, SOC {{has been shown to be}} associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Studies focusing on this aspect among nursing home (NH) residents have been limited. This study investigated the relationship between SOC and HRQOL among older people living in NHs in Bergen, Norway. Methods Based on the salutogenic theoretical framework, we used a descriptive correlation design using personal interviews. We collected data from 227 mentally intact NH residents for 14 months in 2004 – 2005. The residents' HRQOL and coping ability were measured using the SF- 36 Health Survey and the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC- 13), respectively. We analyzed possible relationships between the SOC- 13 variables and SF- 36 subdimensions, controlling for age, sex, marital status, education and comorbidity, and investigated interactions between the SOC and demographic variables by using multiple regression. Results SOC scores were significantly correlated with all SF- 36 subscales: the strongest with mental health (r = 0. 61) and the weakest with bodily pain (r = 0. 28). These did not change substantially after adjusting for the associations with demographic variables and comorbidity. SOC- 13 did not interact significantly with the other covariates. Conclusion These findings suggest that more coping resources improve HRQOL. This may indicate the importance of strengthening the residents' SOC to improve the perceived HRQOL. Such knowledge may help the international community in developing <b>nursing</b> <b>regimens</b> to improve HRQOL for older people living in NHs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To examine patient- and provider-reported psychosocial {{problems}} and barriers to effective self-care {{and resources for}} dealing with those barriers. Methods: Cross-sectional study using face-to-face or telephone interviews with diabetic patients and health-care providers in 13 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. Participants were randomly selected adults (n = 5104) with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, and providers (n = 3827), including primary care physicians, diabetes specialist physicians and <b>nurses.</b> Results: <b>Regimen</b> adherence was poor, especially for diet and exercise; provider estimates of patient self-care were lower than patient reports for all behaviours. Diabetes-related worries were common among patients, and providers generally recognized these worries. Many patients (41 %) had poor psychological well-being. Providers reported that most patients had psychological problems that affected diabetes self-care, yet providers often reported {{they did not have}} the resources to manage these problems, and few patients (10 %) reported receiving psychological treatment. Conclusions: Psychosocial problems appear to be common among diabetic patients worldwide. Addressing these problems may improve diabetes outcomes, but providers often lack critical resources for doing so, particularly skill, time and adequate referral sources. © 2005 Diabetes UK...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of stress reduction psycho-educational intervention on the affective state and adaptation to hospitalization among hospitalized high risk pregnant women. By using quasi experimental research design, thirty hospitalized high risk pregnant women, aged from 16 - 40 years old were assigned to the intervention. The study was conducted at the in-patient gynecological word at El-kaser El-Aini Hospital Tools consisted of demographic data sheet, Mills depression and anxiety symptom feeling checklist (2004), and patient perception of stressful events associated with hospitalization by Volicer (1973). The intervention included “the antepartum doula support for high risk pregnancies which consisted of psychological, emotional, and informational support” [...] Results revealed that, the high risk pregnant women who attended the psycho-educational intervention showed significant adjustment to the hospitalization and improvement in their psychological state. The study concluded that the psycho-educational intervention was effective in improving psychological state and increasing adaptation to hospitalization of high risk hospitalized pregnant women. It is recommended that the psycho-educational intervention must be included in the <b>nursing</b> care <b>regimen</b> for the high risk pregnant women to improve the quality of care provided to such group, for the optimum level of health and safety for pregnant women and their new born...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis Development of {{care for}} gerontopsychiatric patients deals mainly {{with the development of}} nursing care at the gerontopsychiatric admission department of the Psychiatric Hospital Kosmonosy. The thesis describes the history of the psychiatric hospital and the establishment of gerontopsychiatric department. Other chapters describe the development of department equipment, the number of <b>nursing</b> staff, therapy <b>regimen</b> over twenty years and specifics of nursing care. Patient diagnoses leading to admission to Gerontopsychiatric departments are also described. The next section describes the development of nursing care at the department. It mainly deals with the process of patient admission, nursing care and documentation, staff approach to patients and relatives. My personal experience will certainly be reflected in the thesis because I have worked at the Gerontopsychiatric department for twenty years. The aim of this thesis is to find out what changes have occurred over twenty years. Therefore, considerable changes which I found out will be described and possible future development of gerontopsychiatry will be outlined in the conclusion. Key words: gerontopsychiatry, history, dementia, nursing care, therapeutic regime...|$|R
40|$|International audienceErythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) {{are largely}} {{prescribed}} before dialysis stage to {{chronic kidney disease}} patients. In accordance to current international guidelines, lots {{have been made by}} pharmacological companies in order to improve self management of ESAs: subcutaneaous administration, pencil devices, mutidose cartridges, low injection volume, very fine needles, once a month injections but none is currently known on the percentage of patients who actually do self administration of ESAs. We conducted a simple prospective questionnaire study in different nephrology departments in France, on pre-dialysis patients. Questionnaires have been fulfilled by randomly selected French nephrologists during visits with outpatients treated by ESA. Costs have been evaluated by ESA and nurse visit direct costs in euros and compared by a Wilcoxon test. Within 6 months, 143 questionnaires of outpatients have been completed. The characteristics of the population are as followed: 53 % men, mean age 66. 4 ± 16. 9 y/o, 38. 6 % of diabetics, mean estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR by MDRD formula) 22. 8 ± 11. 6 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2). ESAs are prescribed as follow: Aranesp(®) (50. 3 %), Mircera(®) (36. 3 %), NeoRecormon(®) (10. 5 %), Eprex(®) (2. 1 %) and Retacrit(®) (0. 7 %). ESA self administration concerns only 24. 8 % of the patients their while most of the patients (70. 2 %) ask a nurse for injection without any differences between ESAs (P= 0. 24), sex (P= 0. 81) or presence of diabetes (P= 0. 78). ESA self administration is more frequent for working patients (56. 8 % versus 34. 7 %; P= 0. 0002). Moreover, for 86. 7 % of the patients, nurse comes at home and in 60 % of the cases only for this injection. Finally, 42 % of the patients feel improvement as soon as a couple of hours after injection whatever ESA used (0 - 45 days). In addition, mean haemoglobin level is 11. 4 ± 1. 3 g/dL, mean ferritinemia is 229 ± 211 UI/mL. Non surprisingly, <b>nurse</b> injection <b>regimen</b> is more expensive than self injection (P= 0. 0016). This simple questionnaire shows that despite efforts made to improve ESA self administration, a minority of patients are in fact proceeding to ESA self administration. Asking for a nurse, does not help patient to be independent, and increases health cost. Efforts have to be made in order to help patients for ESA self administration...|$|R
40|$|The right regimen {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{influencing}} the ability to handle the requirements of medical profession. It is important for the nurses to realize how important the right diet and keeping to it not only at home but also at work is, especially in the three-shift operation. The survey was quantitative. Anonymous questionnaires for randomly chosen nurses were applied for data collection. The research survey was carried out at asylum and at the Hospital in Havlíčkův Brod. 120 questionnaires were distributed in total, of which 114 (100 %) were used for the research survey. Three goals were set for this paper. To find out whether nurses working in three-shift operation eat regularly, whether nurses keep a drinking regime and whether they suffer due to their regimen from indigestion. The set goals were fulfilled in the paper. Three hypotheses were set, each of which related to one goal. The first hypothesis presumed nurses ate regularly. This hypothesis was not confirmed. The second hypothesis presumed nurses maintain drinking regime at work, which was confirmed. The third hypothesis presumed nurses do not suffer from indigestion due to their regimen. The survey has shown nurses believe the medical profession has an impact on their regimen, especially in irregular eating habits, lack of sleep, and besides they consider their work as the cause of stress. On the other hand the nurses maintaining of drinking regime and lack of indigestion problems was a surprising realization. Regular eating habits certainly are an indicator of <b>regimen.</b> However many <b>nurses</b> do not have regular eating habits. The results of the paper shall help to better understand the importance of the right <b>regimen.</b> <b>Nurses</b> should be acquainted with this issue...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{the growth}} of {{premature}} children is of great importance in neonatology and pediatrics. Evaluation {{of the growth}} is carried out taking into account the corrected age of preterm infants. Correction is performed during {{the first two years of}} life. This is especially important for children born before 32 – 33 weeks of gestation and weighing less than 1500 g. Evaluation of the growth is carried out with the use of growth charts for premature babies. Growth curves contain three measurements: weight, height and head circumference. Today, there are several growth curves. Lubchenco curves (1963), the curves of Babson and Benda (1976) have been used for more than forty decades. Currently, they do not accurately reflect the growth of a premature baby. In recent years, modern growth curves have been developed. Modern curves are developed on the basis of larger groups, taking into account gender differences. Fenton (2003) proposed growth charts for premature babies. They consist of graphs of percentiles of weight, height and head circumference. Graph compares the growth of preterm infants with fetal growth from 22 weeks to 10 weeks of postnatal age. Gender differences have a significant impact on the growth of children. Fenton (2013) established growth curves for girls and boys. Boys have higher weight, height and head circumference than girls. In assessing the growth of the fetus and the baby after birth national and racial differences should be taken into account. The growth curves of the fetus and preterm infant are important for population health assessment and evaluation of individual growth. The growth curves are used to evaluate the child's performance at birth and for the assessment {{of the growth of}} the baby after birth. The growth curves are used in intensive care and pediatric units. In order to achieve adequate growth it is necessary to carry out the correction of <b>regimen,</b> <b>nursing</b> and nutrition of a child. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{epilepsy}} {{occurs in}} the whole world without exception of age, race, geographical location and socio-economic structure. The incidence of epilepsy depends on age and influences each time {{the quality of life of}} the child and its next relatives. Our children and young people perceive, experience and evaluate their life usually from different points of view than adults including the parents. For this reason the main target of the nurse effort should be the education and involving the family into the process of healing. Also the preventive and educational care is connected with this. The target of thesis was to map if the education by the <b>nurse</b> concerning the <b>regimen</b> measures has influence on knowledge extent of the family of an epileptic child. The work focused, as for quantitative examination, on nurses in the surgeries of physicians for the children and young people (pediatrists) in South Bohemia. By the technology of the questionnaire the possibilities of provided primary and secondary care for children with epilepsy by the nurse and the scope of the co-operation of the nurse with the clubs of epileptics were mapped. Within the qualitative examination, based on the talks with parents of the children with epilepsy, the contribution of the knowledge of regimen measures handed on through the education by nurses in the primary pediatric care was examined. It follows from the results of the quantitative examination that the nurses in the outpatient departments of pediatrists do not devote attention to primary or secondary prevention of epilepsy and simultaneously they do not co-operate with the clubs of epileptics. It was impossible to verify all three hypotheses. It followed from the results of the quantitative examination that nurses in outpatient departments of physicians for children and young people do not sufficiently educate the parents of children with epilepsy. If the education by the nurse in the pediatric primary care has been performed, it was a contribution for parents each time. The results of the thesis lead us to reflection concerning the role of the nurse as educator and simultaneously as defender of the client- child in the outpatient departments of pediatrists. The results of the thesis: I would like to address the nurses in primary care, that they should assert themselves more, educate themselves and get involved into the care for children with epilepsy and hereby help to children to improve their childhood in the way necessary for their healthy growth and development...|$|R
