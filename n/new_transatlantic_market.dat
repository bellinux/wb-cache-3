40|$|This study {{presents}} four economic {{scenarios for}} Europe until 2040. The scenarios are developed around two key uncertainties: international cooperation and institutional reforms. �In the scenarios Strong Europe (SE) and Global Economy (GE), international cooperation is prominent, {{while the other}} scenarios, Regional Communities (RC) and <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market</b> (TM), feature limited international cooperation. Public institutions are important in Strong Europe and Regional Communities. In Global Economy and <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market</b> {{the role of the}} public sector is limited. There is more room for private initiatives in these scenarios. To illustrate the scenarios, this document presents quantitative developments described with an applied general equilibrium model developed at CPB: WorldScan. By using this model we are able to derive consistency between developments in the scenarios and to apply common economic mechanisms. The variation in the outcomes for the scenarios is derived by introducing differences in exogenous trends. This document explains and motivates these differences. More regulation and income redistribution in Regional Communities and Strong Europe is accompanied by higher unemployment rates and lower participation, as compared to the scenarios in which private initiatives are given more leeway (i. e. Global Economy and <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market).</b> Combined with the ageing of the population, this result implies that employment contracts in Regional Communities, while it grows only moderately in Strong Europe, due to immigration. More incentives for labour supply imply a higher participation rate in <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market</b> than in Strong Europe. However, lower population growth in the former scenario has the effect that overall employment growth is equivalent in Strong Europe and <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market.</b> The emphasis on an efficient functioning of markets in Global Economy and <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market</b> is accompanied by a higher labour productivity growth�than in Strong Europe and Regional Communities. Labour productivity growth is weakest in Regional Communities. This weak growth, together with a fall in employment, causes GDP per capita in Regional Communities to grow by only 0. 6 % per year. Trade liberalisation and economic integration boost trade and growth in Global Economy and Strong Europe. High growth in Asia redirects European trade flows towards that continent, so that the share of intra-EU trade decreases. In <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market,</b> the EU cooperates more closely with the United States and Latin America, which boosts EU-US trade. In Regional Communities, growth in world exports is negligible, and the share of intra-EU trade remains relatively high. In Strong Europe and Global Economy, governments stimulate national savings by curbing budgets deficits and stimulating private savings. Although this does not prevent a decline in saving rates because of ageing, it is less dramatic than in <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market</b> and Regional Communities, where saving rates decrease by 6 %-points between 2000 and 2040. As the demand for capital also falls substantially, real interest rates still decrease in Regional Communities and, to a lesser extent, in Strong Europe. In Global Economy and <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Market,</b> increasing investment demand causes a higher real interest rate. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} impact of the European {{regulatory}} response to the global financial crisis in the governance of <b>transatlantic</b> financial <b>markets.</b> The main argument is that European regulatory initiatives have sought to expand European regulatory clout over market actors domiciled in third countries but operating in European markets, thus departing from the authority-sharing arrangements that had informed the construction of an integrated <b>transatlantic</b> <b>market</b> for financial services in the period preceding the crisis. The article will explain this shift in the European approach towards the regulation of <b>transatlantic</b> <b>markets</b> by exploring the reconfiguration of EU financial regulatory politics triggered by the financial crisis.

40|$|Since the {{domestic}} {{deregulation of the}} U. S. airline industry in 1978, impacts to domestic stakeholders, including airlines, airports, labor and consumers, have been well-studied. International air transportation, however, has remained principally regulated by bilateral agreements between governments. Recent global movement towards international deregulation, including the U. S. -EU Open Skies agreement which took effect March 30 th 2008, has revived {{the debate over the}} effects of regulatory liberalization in aviation. Our research contributes to the debate over regulatory liberalization with an analysis of its impacts in the broader <b>transatlantic</b> <b>market.</b> In this thesis we evaluate how competition in <b>transatlantic</b> aviation <b>markets</b> has evolved over the last decade and how regulatory liberalization has impacted service levels and competition in specific U. S. and European markets. In addition, we explore the extent to which various <b>market</b> characteristics impact <b>transatlantic</b> service levels. This research is conducted in four parts: (1) a stakeholder analysis, (2) a competition and <b>market</b> analysis of <b>transatlantic</b> aviation, (3) a review of the policy impacts since 1990, and (4) an econometric market analysis. In our stakeholder analysis, we find that increased competition is brought about by loosened restrictions on airline networks and by strengthening carriers financially through the availability of foreign capital and opportunities for cross-border mergers. Our market analysis reveals that, in aggregate since 2000, <b>transatlantic</b> <b>markets</b> have seen an increase in number of competitors. (cont.) In addition, U. S. carriers have gained a disproportionate share of <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> service, leveraging the network effects of flying from their hubs. Further, we discover that although European gateways are highly concentrated to the largest four hubs, overall U. S. gateways are more concentrated than those of Europe, where a greater proportion of traffic is fed through smaller gateways. In our analysis of Open Skies between European countries and the U. S., we find that the agreements have resulted in both increases and decreases in service levels in recent decades. Of the 22 European countries with U. S. Open Skies agreements in place by 2007, only seven demonstrated overall increases in service levels while six demonstrated overall reductions. Five countries saw no significant change and the remaining four have yet to receive direct transatlantic service, supporting our hypothesis that liberalization alone does not oblige service level increases. We discuss the extent to which antitrust immunized alliances in deregulated markets have led to the benefits often credited to liberalization. Our econometric analysis confirms the hypothesis that Open Skies demonstrates no statistically significant correlation to transatlantic service levels. Instead, total economic activity of a city or country and its status as a major carrier hub is the dominant explanatory factor of service levels. by Alexander Cosmas. Thesis (S. M.)

The thesis is primarily devoted to analysis of the impact of both trends and their implications for stock exchanges world and the second objective is to attempt a empirical analysis of the effects of ongoing integration and consolidation of the <b>transatlantic</b> stock <b>markets.</b> The first chapter deals with past and current changes in the <b>transatlantic</b> stock <b>markets</b> and continues to look theoretically at detailed integration and consolidation trends, their definition, assumptions, reasons, importance, benefits, obstacles and risks, approaches and scenarios.
