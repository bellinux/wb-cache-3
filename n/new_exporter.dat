40|$|We {{construct}} a two-country dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} in which trade responds more to a cut in tariffs {{in the long run}} than in the short run. The model introduces a dynamic element to the fixed-variable cost trade-off in a heterogeneous producer trade model, and nests standard models. The dynamics of aggregate trade adjustment arise from producer-level decisions to invest in lowering their future variable export costs. The model is calibrated to match salient features of <b>new</b> <b>exporter</b> growth and provides a new estimate of the exporting technology. At the producer level, we find that the marginal <b>new</b> <b>exporter</b> incurs substantial losses in its first three years in the export market; export profits are back-loaded. In the aggregate, a cut in tariffs generates a long-run trade elasticity that is three times the short-run trade elasticity. We estimate the welfare gain from global and unilateral tariffs cuts, taking into account the transition period, and allowing for international capital flows. While the intensity of trade expands slowly, consumption overshoots its new steady-state level, so the welfare gain is larger than the long-run change in consumption. Models without this dynamic export decision underestimate the gain from tariff reform and even predict a loss where we find a gain...|$|E

We use a large-scale dataset on French manufacturing firms to evaluate how sunk costs affect the productivity of new exporters. We find that the typical productivity dynamics of a <b>new</b> <b>exporter</b> is U-shaped. Prior to entry into export markets, firm productivity temporarily decreases.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of {{experimentation}} by firms {{in the presence of}} demand uncertainty in a new market. The firm can postpone paying the sunk cost of full-scale entry into the market, and learn more about the demand for its product by accessing a few consumers at some cost. This is the first formal model of test marketing where the firm chooses optimally the experimentation intensity (number of consumers accessed), as well as exit/entry policy. When applied to the trade literature, the model can help explain the observed patterns of the <b>new</b> <b>exporter</b> dynamics: increasing average export volumes over time, and falling exit rates. We structurally estimate the model using French firm-level export data, by extending it to a setting where a given geographical region is viewed as a target market for the firm, and individual destinations within the region as consumers.

40|$|Models {{in which}} {{heterogeneous}} plants face sunk export entry costs are standard {{tools in the}} in-ternational trade literature. How well do these models account for the observed dynamics of new exporters? We document that new exporters initially export small amounts and — conditional on continuing in the export market — grow gradually over several years. New exporters {{are most likely to}} exit the export market in their first few years. We construct a dynamic discrete choice model of exporting and find that the standard model cannot replicate the behavior of new ex-porters: New exporters grow too large too quickly and live too long. We assess the quantitative importance of accounting for <b>new</b> <b>exporter</b> dynamics by extending the model to account for these facts. In this model, the present value of exporting falls relative to the baseline model. As a result, the entry costs needed to account for the data are three times smaller than in the baseline model.

We find that, in a typical year, nearly half of all Colombian exporters were not exporters in the previous year. These <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> tend to be extremely small in terms of their overall contribution to export revenues, and most do not continue exporting in the following year. Hence export sales are dominated by a small number of very large and stable exporters. Nonetheless, out of each cohort of <b>new</b> <b>exporters,</b> a fraction of firms go on to expand their foreign sales very rapidly, and over the period of less than a decade, these successful <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> account for almost half of total export expansion.

We estimate the welfare gains from trade from a cut in tari¤s, taking into account the transition period. While the intensity of trade expands slowly, consumption overshoots its new steady-state level, so the welfare gains are almost 15 times larger than the long-run change in consumption.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 This dissertation’s three essays {{investigate}} {{trade and}} productivity effects on firm behavior based on new heterogeneous-firms trade {{models in the}} case of Korea. In the first essay, firms’ decision to export {{in the case of}} Korean manufacturing industries is examined, where the change in firms’ productivity before and after exports are analyzed. In particular, two common hypotheses of export decision - self-selection and learning-by-exporting- are tested using a dynamic model of firm export behavior and a Korean firm-level panel database. Evidence of self-selection is found in only three out of eight industries, but that of learning-by-exporting is limited. Sunk-cost or previous-export-experience effect on the predicted export probability is relatively larger than that of firms’ productivity and size. The second essay investigates the effect of trade cost changes on firms’ entry and exit in Korean manufacturing. Empirical support is found for new trade theories’ predictions on firm entry and exit, and the number of exporting firms, and changes in market share following trade-cost changes. However, Korean manufacturing appears to differ from some of the outcomes of the heterogeneous-firms theory, especially in the result that large firms {{are less likely to be}} a <b>new</b> <b>exporter.</b> Rather, smaller and less capital-intensive firms tended to enter the export market. In general, the results of this essay show that changing trade costs had important consequences for the structure of manufacturing activity in Korea. In the final essay, the differences in the scale economies of exporters and non-exporters in Korean manufacturing are investigated. Results from estimating a production function show that exporters face diseconomies of scale in four of five industries. A matching technique confirms the difference in returns to scale between exporters and non-exporters. The evidence that size and hence, scale economies may be less important for trade participation and gains from overseas market, bodes well for small or medium exporters. In summary, this dissertation has improved the understanding of the relationships among trade, productivity and firm behavior. The key determinant of firms’ export behavior in the Korean context appears to be previous experience in overseas markets. Not surprisingly, the Korean government has invested heavily in lowering their firms’ cost of accessing foreign markets. In industries where Korea has a comparative advantage, high productivity of firms appears to promote trade participation. However, productivity growth in other industries is low and falling, in some cases. A balanced approach to investments in productivity and export promotion would sustain and improve Korean manufacturing’s competitiveness in global markets...|$|E

40|$|Models of {{heterogenous}} firms {{making decisions}} about entering foreign markets {{in the face of}} sunk entry costs have become standard tools for understanding the firm exporting decision. These models induce a discrete choice between exporting and only serving the domestic market. In this paper we study how well these discrete choice models account for the data on new export entrants. Using Colombian data on manufacturing plants, we document the time paths of new entrants to the export market and find that, though there is a discrete nature to the growth in exports, there is also a substantial amount of adjustment that continues after entry, which is contrary to the standard model. We construct a dynamic discrete choice model of exporting and calibrate it to the Colombian manufacturing sector. We find that the standard heterogeneous firm model cannot replicate the behavior of new exporters; in the model, <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> grow too large, too quickly. The model also cannot generate the downward sloping exit hazard that is evident in the data. We assess the quantitative importance of the slow adjustment of <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> by fitting an export demand function to the data.

Second, the export behaviors of domestic and foreign firms are systematically different. The Chinese domestic firms self-select into the export market with higher productivity ex ante and show a significant learning-by-exporting effect ex post. Foreign exporters do not show significant higher productivity either ex ante or ex post. Third, both domestic and foreign <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> exploit the comparative advantage of China’s low labor cost before exporting, and then strengthen this advantage when exporting. In other words, exporting significantly lowers the capital-labor ratio for the <b>new</b> <b>exporters.</b> Fourth, we find that the learning-by-exporting effect for domestic firms is positively related to their absorptive capacity, in addition to the more usual learning channel through exporting to developed markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of a real current account {{adjustment}} on terms of trade, aggregate productivity and welfare-based exchange rate in a two-country general equilibrium model. As in Melitz (2003), firms are heterogeneous in productivity and endogenously enter and exit their domestic and export markets. The real adjustment of the current account leads to the increase of Home exports through the intensive and the extensive margins of trade : incumbent firms export more and <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> endogenously enter the market. In the benchmark case, the extensive margin of trade accounts for about 19 % of the overall adjustment and the depreciation of the national currency is lower with respect to models where this margin is not considered. In the literature, the change in the terms of trade is lower when goods are more substituable. This common finding is overturned by the endogenous entry of <b>new</b> <b>exporters.</b> For a given dispersion of productivity across firms, a higher elasticity of substitution reduces the role played by the extensive margin on the adjustment and yields a higher depreciation of the exchange rate.

In the last decade many countries have introduced EPAs to support their firrms {{in order to deal}} with asymmetric information problems and make feasible additional gains from trade. Some recent studies have found that the support of EPAs has been effective with respect to the intensive and extensive margins of trade. Nevertheless, due to the lack of information on non-exporting firms, few of them analyze their impact on {{the probability of}} promoting <b>new</b> <b>exporters.</b> This paper evaluates the impact of the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (Apex-Brasil) on firms' export status using a unique firm-level dataset which covers the full manufacturing sector in Brazil.

The empirical results show evidence of the program's positive impact on the probability of promoting <b>new</b> <b>exporters.</b> Also, the effect is heterogeneous according to firms' size categories and sectors.

This procedure is used to deal with the endogeneity problems, stemming from the fact that <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> have most likely initial better financial health.
