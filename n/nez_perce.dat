5|$|When the U.S. 7th Cavalry {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} Chief Joseph and the remaining <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce,</b> they immediately took more than 1,000 of the tribe's horses, sold what they could and shot many of the rest. But a significant population of horses {{had been left behind}} in the Wallowa valley when the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> began their retreat, and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central Idaho, were allowed few horses, and were required by the Army to crossbreed to draft horses in an attempt to create farm horses. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas. In the late 20th century, they began a program to develop a new horse breed, the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> horse, with the intent to resurrect their horse culture, tradition of selective breeding, and horsemanship.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of the Snake River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce,</b> who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E
50|$|In September 1818 Donald MacKenzie {{left his}} new base at Fort <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés</b> {{to lead a}} large fur {{trapping}} party into the Snake River country. The operation was a major departure from the usual practice of the North West Company. MacKenzie spent the winter of 1818-19 shifting camps and trapping in a large region. His return to Fort <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés</b> in July 1819 with an unusually large and valuable catch won him praise and vindicated the establishment of Fort <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés,</b> about which some company partners had been skeptical. The Snake country expeditions from Fort <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés</b> became an annual affair and regularly produced {{a large portion of}} company's entire fur export west of the Rocky Mountains.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> {{lost most}} of their horses after the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> War in 1877, and the breed fell into decline for several decades. A small number of {{dedicated}} breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) was formed as the breed registry in 1938. The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to the foundation bloodstock of the registry; its partially open stud book allows the addition of some Thoroughbred, American Quarter Horse and Arabian blood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> band {{associated}} with Chief Joseph, numbering about 750 people, passed through Yellowstone National Park in thirteen days during late August 1877. They were {{being pursued by}} the U.S.Army and entered the national park about {{two weeks after the}} Battle of the Big Hole. Some of the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> were friendly to the tourists and other people they encountered in the park; some were not. Nine park visitors were briefly taken captive. Despite Joseph and other chiefs ordering that no one should be harmed, at least two people were killed and several wounded. One of the areas where encounters occurred was in Lower Geyser Basin and east along a branch of the Firehole River to Mary Mountain and beyond. That stream is still known as <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> Creek. A group of Bannocks entered the park in 1878, alarming park Superintendent Philetus Norris. In the aftermath of the Sheepeater Indian War of 1879, Norris built a fort to prevent Native Americans from entering the national park.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{dealt with}} several {{conflicts}} with Indian tribes. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce,</b> led by Chief Joseph, began an uprising in June 1877 when Major General Oliver O. Howard {{ordered them to}} move on to a reservation. Howard's men defeated the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> in battle, and the tribe began a 1,700-mile retreat into Canada. In October, after a decisive battle at Bear Paw, Montana, Chief Joseph surrendered and General William T. Sherman ordered the tribe transported to Kansas, where they were forced to remain until 1885. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> war was not the last conflict in the West, as the Bannock rose up in Spring 1878 and raided nearby settlements before being defeated by Howard's army in July of that year. War with the Ute tribe broke out in 1879 when the Utes killed Indian agent Nathan Meeker, who had been attempting to convert them to Christianity. The subsequent White River War ended when Schurz negotiated peace with the Ute and prevented the white Coloradans from taking revenge for Meeker's death.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> {{people lived}} in what today is eastern Washington, Oregon, and western Idaho, where they engaged in {{agriculture}} as well as horse breeding. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> first obtained horses from the Shoshone around 1730. They {{took advantage of the}} fact that they lived in excellent horse-breeding country, relatively safe from the raids of other tribes, and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals, establishing breeding herds by 1750. They were one of the few tribes that actively used the practice of gelding inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from the gene pool, and thus were notable as horse breeders by the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} American horse breeds with leopard {{coloring}} and Appaloosa ancestry. These include the Pony of the Americas and the Colorado Ranger. Appaloosas are crossbred with gaited horse breeds {{in an attempt}} to create a leopard-spotted ambling horse. Because such crossbred offspring are not eligible for ApHC registration, their owners have formed breed registries for horses with leopard complex patterns and gaited ability. In 1995 the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed, the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> Horse, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa with the Akhal-Teke breed from Central Asia. Appaloosa stallions have been exported to Denmark, to add new blood to the Knabstrup breed.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{two large}} Native American groups {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Snake River: the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce,</b> whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the mainstay of the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> {{and most of the}} other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact. As a result, the Shoshone centered on a trading economy.|$|E

Hastening back with his band to the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perces</b> village, he told all {{that he had seen}} and heard, and urged the most prompt and strenuous measures for defence. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perces,</b> however, heard him with their accustomed phlegm; the threat of the Blackfeet had been often made, and as often had proved a mere bravado; such they pronounced it to be at present, and, of course, took no precautions.|$|R
5|$|In January 2014 the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> Tribal Executive Committee sent {{a letter}} to two {{northern}} Idaho school districts with American Indian mascots asking that they be changed. The mascots are the Sacajawea Junior High Braves in Lewiston and the Nezperce High School Indians. The school officials state that they will have meetings and gather public opinions before making a decision.|$|E
5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce,</b> Cayuse, and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came {{aspects of the}} emerging plains culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. The <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E

5|$|Today, the Appaloosa {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular breeds in the United States; it was named the {{official}} state horse of Idaho in 1975. It is best known as a stock horse used in a number of western riding disciplines, but is also a versatile breed with representatives seen in many other types of equestrian activity. Appaloosas have been used in many movies; an Appaloosa is the mascot for the Florida State Seminoles. Appaloosa bloodlines have influenced other horse breeds, including the Pony of the Americas, the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> Horse, and several gaited horse breeds.|$|E
5|$|As river {{development}} {{continued in}} the 20thcentury, each of these major fishing sites was flooded by a dam, beginning with Cascades Rapids in 1938. The development was accompanied by extensive negotiations between natives and US government agencies. The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, a coalition of various tribes, adopted a constitution and incorporated after the 1938 completion of the Bonneville Dam flooded Cascades Rapids; Still, in the 1930s, there were natives who lived along the river and fished year round, moving along with the fish's migration patterns throughout the seasons. The Yakama were slower to do so, organizing a formal government in 1944. In the 21stcentury, the Yakama, <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce,</b> Umatilla, and Warm Springs tribes all have treaty fishing rights along the Columbia and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} Native Americans and First Nations peoples have {{a historical}} and continuing {{presence on the}} Columbia. South of the Canada–USborder, the Colville, Spokane, Coeur d'Alene, Yakama, <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce,</b> Cayuse, Palus, Umatilla, Cowlitz, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs live along the US stretch. Along the upper Snake River and Salmon River, the Shoshone Bannock tribes are present. The Sinixt or Lakes people lived on the lower stretch of the Canadian portion, while above that the Shuswap people (Secwepemc in their own language) reckon {{the whole of the}} upper Columbia east to the Rockies as part of their territory. The Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin outlines the traditional homelands of the Canadian Kootenay–Ktunaxa.|$|E

5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} Snake. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the {{millions}} in the river. These fish were central {{to the lives of}} the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a Snake tributary, the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving the Snake River its name.|$|E
5|$|In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a nose ring. Nose {{piercing}} {{has been}} {{practiced by the}} Bedouin tribes of the Middle East and the Berber and Beja peoples of Africa, as well as Australian Aboriginals. Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility. The name of the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe. The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama. Nose piercing also remains popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh and is practiced in a number of Middle Eastern and Arab countries.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest {{forms the}} eastern {{boundary}} of Yellowstone National Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances {{to the park}} are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated National Scenic Byways All-American Road, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to Yellowstone National Park. Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (Wyoming Highway 296) connects Cody, Wyoming with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which Chief Joseph and the <b>Nez</b> <b>Perce</b> tribe attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, Wyoming, passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, Wyoming, over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway {{is the only one}} of these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, all four of them have been designated Wyoming State Scenic Byways by the state of Wyoming.|$|E
5000|$|Constructed on {{the east}} bank of the Columbia River, Fort <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés</b> was half a mile north of {{the mouth of the}} Walla Walla River and a few miles below the mouth of the Snake River The {{location}} was chosen for its strategic geographic value. The nearby Walla Walla Valley had long been an important rendezvous point for parties working several peripheral fur districts. The 1815 decision by the NWC to refocus the entire New Caledonia region southward to the Columbia River meant greatly increased traffic on the river. Donald MacKenzie intended to open up the Snake River country, adding another operation converging on the area where Fort <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés</b> was built.|$|R

5000|$|In 1855 {{they sold}} by treaty {{a large part}} of their territory. In the general {{outbreak}} of 1855-56, sometimes designated as the Yakima war, the <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés,</b> almost alone, remained friendly. In 1863, in consequence of the discovery of gold, another treaty was negotiated between another <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés</b> chief known as Lawyer (whose band had converted to Christianity and was now assimilating to white culture) and General Oliver O. Howard of the U.S. Army in which Lawyer surrendered all but the Lapwai reservation. Chief Joseph of the Wallowa band refused to sign the new treaty, stating that the Treaty of 1855 was promised to be the rule of law for [...] "as long as the sun shines," [...] protecting their home land from white intrusion. Since <b>Nez</b> <b>Percés</b> custom dictated that no single chief spoke for all others, when Joseph and others (including Toohoolhoolzote and Looking Glass) refused to sign the treaty, it was done so with the understanding that the U.S. Government was still bound by their original agreement, and that only Lawyer's band would be bound by the new treaty that only they signed.|$|R
