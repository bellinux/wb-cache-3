40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 61 - 62) The Safety <b>Notification</b> <b>Broadcast</b> System is {{a network}} design that enables broadcast of safety/emergency notifications to wireless mobile {{devices such as}} cellular phones. The widespread penetration of wireless coverage, even reaching into subways, underscores the significance of such a system. An alert-aggregator or emergency operations center authenticates alerts and passes them on to participating wireless providers, who in turn distribute the alerts to their customers via broadcast messages. The alerts are focused on geographic areas under threat, and are processed in real time. The ultimate goal {{of the system is}} to ensure that real-time safety notification messages reach people in the geographic area under threat, and the best solution to achieve this would be through their cellular phones. This thesis concentrates on the design and development of a network protocol design and a supporting Android application that supports such a Safety <b>Notification</b> <b>Broadcast</b> System. Not all cellular phones support an emergency broadcast message built over a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) - a classification of the broader Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), or the Geo-Targeted Alerting System (GTAS). Mobile communication messages have several parameters that help the device to identify it's purpose and origins. Depending on various parameters such as priority, service category, etc., messages may be recognized as a broadcast message. Such a safety notification or alert message is embedded inside the broadcast message according to any standard alert protocol mentioned above. Our application inside the mobile device shall accept this high priority message, decode it following the protocol and immediately notify the user about the received emergency message with a special audio-sensitory patter...|$|E

Extracting five fundamental strategies from those usually employed in mobile communication protocols, we shall discuss their features and then compare their performance. These five strategies are: single <b>broadcast</b> <b>notification</b> (SBN), double <b>broadcast</b> <b>notification</b> (WBN), <b>broadcast</b> query forwarding (BQF), single default notification (SDN), and double default notification (WDN). We show that the optimal strategy varies according to network conditions suchasnetwork topology, network scale, migration rate, and query occurrence rate. In Mobile Computing, T. Imielinski and H. F.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} performance comparison among five {{strategies for}} mobile support. The major facilities {{that are required}} for a network protocol to support mobile hosts are location management and packet forwarding. Based on this observation, we consider five basic strategies which use distinct methods to achieve these facilities and compare their performance. These five strategies are <b>Broadcast</b> <b>Notification</b> (BN), <b>Broadcast</b> Forwarding (BF), Broadcast Query (BQ), Default Forwarding (DF), and Default Query (DQ). As a result of analytical evaluation and comparison, it is shown that under different network conditions, such as number of routers, network topology, migration/communication ratio, data/control packet size ratio, different strategies produce minimum network traffic. In short, DF and DQ show the best performance in network size scaling, while BF and BQ are efficient for frequent migration. On the other hand, BN is suitable for a small network which has hosts with infrequent migration. 1 Introductio...|$|R

SMPP is able to carry short messages including EMS, voicemail <b>notifications,</b> Cell <b>Broadcasts,</b> WAP messages including WAP Push messages (used to deliver MMS notifications), USSD messages and others. Because of its versatility and support for non-GSM SMS protocols, like UMTS, IS-95 (CDMA), CDMA2000, ANSI-136 (TDMA) and iDEN, SMPP is the most commonly used protocol for short message exchange outside SS7 networks.|$|R

However, the on-chip area overhead required to encode sharer sets may compromise their success as core count increases. In this work, we propose the Express COherence NOtification (ECONO) protocol, a simple and efficient Dir 0 B cache coherence protocol that does not require sharer sets encoding while approaching performance of a conventional directory-based protocol. To accomplish that, ECONO relies on express coherence <b>notifications</b> which are <b>broadcast</b> atomically over a dedicated lightweight on-chip network leveraging state-of-the-art technology.
