5|$|The sparse {{population}} {{was accompanied by}} a difficult <b>numeracy</b> development in the 17th century. Nevertheless, Argentina overtook Peru, which enjoyed an early rapid development in <b>numeracy</b> through the contact with Indios, {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. This <b>numeracy</b> development as a measure of early modern development demonstrates the rapid and remarkable development of Argentina in the period of colonial time.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 the Skills Matter survey {{conducted}} by OECD found the levels of <b>numeracy</b> and literacy in the adult population of Turkey at rank 30 of the 33 OECD countries surveyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground is}} home to the Hatters Study Support Centre, which {{provides}} local school pupils with ICT equipment, football training and lessons in <b>numeracy</b> and literacy. Kenilworth Road also hosts a number of local tournaments and events, including an annual youth competition organised by London Luton Airport.|$|E
5|$|Courses vary {{in length}} {{from a few}} weeks to two years. There are no formal {{academic}} requirements for entry into RNC, but potential students are invited to attend an assessment at the college before being offered a place to determine the level of support they will need during their studies. The assessment typically includes an evaluation of a person's level of vision, their mobility and independence skills, any residential support they may require, basic literacy and <b>numeracy</b> skills tests, and an interview with the leader of the course they wish to take.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 19th century, all {{education}} in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills {{as well as}} social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders. The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810–28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and <b>numeracy</b> to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nobility}} {{there were many}} educated and cultured women, of which Queen Mary is the most obvious example. By the early eighteenth century their {{education}} was expected to include basic literacy and <b>numeracy,</b> musical instruments (including lute, viol and keyboard), needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers. The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603. Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746). There are 50 autobiographies extant from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, of which 16 were written by women, {{all of which are}} largely religious in content.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic literacy and <b>numeracy,</b> needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 percent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 percent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Overall literacy rates were slightly higher than in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for their English counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{visit by}} Radama I to Madagascar's first formal school, {{established}} in Toamasina in 1818 {{by members of the}} London Missionary Society (LMS), the king invited the first Christian artisan missionaries to the capital city to share their knowledge. Beginning in December 1820, LMS missionaries established workshops in Antananarivo to teach brick-making, European carpentry and other practical skills, and developed a network of public schools where <b>numeracy</b> and English were taught alongside literacy using portions of the Malagasy language Bible. Despite high attendance at the schools, the LMS were initially unsuccessful in converting pupils to Christianity. Near the end of Radama's reign, the king came to regard the few Malagasy who had been converted as irreverent toward royal authority. He forbade Malagasy people from being baptized or attending Christian services.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 50 primary and eight {{secondary}} schools in Bintulu. All the schools under the National Education System are {{managed by the}} Bintulu District Education Office. The oldest primary schools in Miri are StAnthony's Primary School (Roman Catholic Mission School), Chung Hua Primary School, and the Orang Kaya Mohammad Primary School, which were established in the early 1960s. The Bintulu Government Secondary School was built in 1964. It {{is now known as}} SMK Bintulu, the oldest secondary school in the town. Bintulu also has one Chinese independent school, Kai Dee Middle School (开智中学). The Shell Oil Company established the Kidurong International School in 1982 to meet the primary education needs of Shell employees' children. The school provides English National Curriculum (ENC) for literacy and <b>numeracy</b> and International Primary Curriculum (IPC) for other subjects.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based <b>numeracy</b> supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E
5|$|Urban elites {{throughout}} the Empire shared a literary culture embued with Greek educational ideals (paideia). Hellenistic cities sponsored schools {{of higher learning}} {{as an expression of}} cultural achievement. Young men from Rome who wished to pursue the highest levels of education often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to one of several Greek schools in Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training along with literacy and <b>numeracy.</b> On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties, though primary schoolmasters did not receive these benefits. Quintilian held the first chair of grammar. In the eastern empire, Berytus (present-day Beirut) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law. The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic (1st–3rd century AD) promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social, educational, and aesthetic values, and the Greek proclivities for which Nero had been criticized were regarded from the time of Hadrian onward as integral to Imperial culture.|$|E
5|$|While {{education}} in Malta {{dates back to}} the period of Arab occupation between 870 and 1090 through the introduction of Arabic numerals, the arrival of the Franciscans in 1350, the Carmelites in 1418, the Dominican Order in 1450, the Augustinians in 1460 and the Friars Minor in 1492 brought religious-based education to the island. Members of these groups were asked to serve as private tutors for the children of wealthy parents, and later moved to set up classes for instruction in Italian, Latin and <b>numeracy.</b> In 1592, the Collegium Melitense (what was to become the University of Malta) was established by the Society of Jesus {{as a result of a}} direct order from Pope Clements VIII, and around this institution a number of others flourished, including a grammar school, a preparatory school and institutions for the study of cartography, naval architecture and navigation. In addition to public options, it was possible to hire private tutors in a number of different areas, including accounting, philosophy, navigation and languages. During this period, however, education for those without wealth was non-existent. During the 16th century, philosophy, theology, grammar and the humanities were taught at the Collegium, and following Europe's temporary recovery from the Black Death in 1675, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller appointed a new lecturer in anatomy and surgery at Sacra Infermeria, essentially establishing the University of Malta's medical school. The Roman Catholic Church, however, was against educating the lower classes and focused on those who afforded to pay. This resulted in mass illiteracy by the end of the Order of St John and took until the second half of the 19th century, under Brtish rule, to have a sprint towards further inclusion.|$|E

25|$|Under the Ottoman rule, <b>numeracy,</b> school {{enrollment}} and literacy rates were all low. In some countries, these {{low levels of}} human capital level persisted sometime after Ottoman rule ended. Greece and Cyprus were no exception, they faced the same issue of paths taken under Ottoman educational policies. In these two countries (Greece and Cyprus), <b>numeracy</b> increased rapidly during the twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|The {{curriculum}} of primary schools in Guyana {{is designed to}} impart basic literacy and <b>numeracy</b> skills, and also aims {{to prepare students for}} secondary education. This literacy and <b>numeracy</b> training is complemented with lessons in Social Studies and Integrated Science. Though Guyana is considered to have met its Millennium Development Goal for universal primary education, the challenge for primary education remains equity of access in terms of curriculum delivery, quality and relevance. Equity of access is a problem {{largely as a result of}} how the primary education system is structured, as well as uneven resource availability based on geography - that is, schools on Guyana's coasts and in urban areas tend to be better resourced than schools in the hinterland or in rural areas.|$|E

25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{literacy}} and <b>numeracy</b> {{were found in}} 2003 {{to be associated with}} socio-economic deprivation. Adults in more deprived areas, such as the North East of England, performed at a lower level than those in less deprived areas such as the South East. Local authority tenants and those in poor health were particularly likely to lack basic skills.|$|E
25|$|Education for {{children}} in institutions was often of a poor standard and {{by the age of}} 15 most children had left school. Many children left institutions with low levels of literacy and <b>numeracy</b> that may have affected their ability to find work or meant they could only get low paying jobs. It also affected their ability to further their education.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, the {{industrial}} revolution led to an enormous increase in urban populations.

Within the new public education systems, mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age.|$|E
25|$|In 1816, Robert Owen, {{a philosopher}} and pedagogue, opened the first British and {{probably}} globally the first infants school in New Lanark, Scotland.

25|$|Both the Gaskells {{taught at}} the two Mosley Street Sunday Schools, which {{instructed}} young mill workers. Lessons covered basic <b>numeracy</b> and literacy in addition to traditional Biblical teaching, and Gaskell defended the practice of giving non-religious instruction on a Sunday, {{saying that they were}} doing 'their Father's business' by teaching reading. He and others lobbied successfully in 1832 for the two schools to be moved to improved premises, and some 400 pupils had been enrolled by 1847.|$|E
25|$|Being {{concerned}} that, {{because of}} this cultural gap, they were being cheated in trade, the Pirahã people asked Daniel Everett, a linguist who was working with them, to teach them basic <b>numeracy</b> skills. After eight months of enthusiastic but fruitless daily study with Everett, the Pirahã concluded that they were incapable of learning the material and discontinued the lessons. Not a single Pirahã had learned to count up to ten or even to add 1 + 1.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{was named}} the 'bogan capital of Australia' with Taswegians earning four spots in the final. This {{prompted}} a response from Luke Martin, CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, who affirmed that Tasmanians are friendly, down to earth and want people to share their stories and if that makes them bogans, so be it. On the island of Tasmania, half the population has literacy and/or <b>numeracy</b> difficulties, and {{the unemployment rate is}} higher than it is in mainland Australia.|$|E
25|$|Early Childhood Development (ECD), as {{with primary}} {{education}} and non-formal education programs, {{falls within the}} category of basic education and entails the essential skills of literacy and <b>numeracy</b> upon which further learning is built. Qur'anic education also forms a component of ECD. ECD is offered to children in the 0-5 age bracket, with the focus on stimulating and developing the cognitive, affective and psycho-motor skills of the toddler and his/her holistic development. It also prepares children for school and facilitates the transition from home to primary school.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{linguistic}} relativity postulates {{a relationship between}} the language a person speaks and how that person understands the world. The conclusions about the significance of Pirahã <b>numeracy</b> and linguistic relativity in Frank et al. (2008) are quoted below. In short, in this study the Pirahã were - by and large - able to match exact quantities of objects set before them (even larger quantities), but had difficulty matching exact quantities when larger quantities were set before them and then hidden from view before they were asked to match them.|$|E
25|$|Spencer has {{advocated}} for better science literacy through educational reforms and improved resourcing for science teachers and laboratories in Australian primary schools. He has also urged {{high school students}} to do mathematics subjects to improve university outcomes and Australia's development. Spencer has highlighted the perceived failings of the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR), in terms of how subjects are weighted, and impact the final rankings for students. He has supported National Literacy and <b>Numeracy</b> Week by being a surprise visiting mathematics teacher. Lurnea High School was the winning school for his guest teaching spot in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Women for Women International (WfWI) is {{a nonprofit}} {{humanitarian}} organization that provides practical and moral support to women survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war's devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, <b>numeracy)</b> training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development. The organization was co-founded in 1993 by Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi American who is herself a survivor of the Iran–Iraq War and Salbi's then-husband Amjad Atallah. Since June 2012, WfWI has been led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI's first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to {{devote more time to}} her writing and lecturing.|$|E
25|$|Even {{at the age}} {{of seven}} when the family moved to Lichfield, she {{recognised}} she had a gift for writing. At Lichfield the family lived in the Bishop's Palace which became the centre of a literary circle including Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, to which Anna was exposed and encouraged to participate as she later relates. Though Canon Seward's (but not his wife's) attitudes towards the education of girls was progressive relative to the times, they were not excessively liberal. Amongst the subjects he taught them was theology and <b>numeracy,</b> and how to read and appreciate poetry, and also how to write and recite poetry. Although this deviated from what were considered ' conventional drawing room accomplishments', the omissions were also notable, including languages and science, although they were left free to pursue their own inclinations. However Anna was not unskilled in the domestic sphere.|$|E
500|$|Gillard also ensured the {{implementation}} of the National Assessment Program – Literacy and <b>Numeracy</b> (NAPLAN) in 2008, whereby a series of standardised tests focused on basic skills are administered annually to Australian students.
