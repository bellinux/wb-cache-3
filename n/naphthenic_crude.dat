Different products require different compositions and properties in the oil. One {{of the most important}} factors is the liquid’s viscosity at various temperatures. Whether or not a crude oil is suitable to be made into a base oil is determined by the concentration of base oil molecules as well as how easily these can be extracted. [...] Base oil is produced by means of refining crude oil. This means that the crude oil is heated in order that various distillates can be separated from one another. During the heating process, light and heavy hydrocarbons are separated - the light ones can be refined to make petrol and other fuels, while the heavier ones are suitable for bitumen and base oils. There are large numbers of crude oils all around the world that {{are used to}} produce base oils. The most common one is a type of paraffinic crude oil, although there are also <b>naphthenic</b> <b>crude</b> oils that create products with better solubility and very good properties at low temperatures. By using hydrogenation technology, in which sulfur and aromatics are removed using hydrogen under high pressure, you can obtain extremely pure base oils, which are suitable when quality requirements are particularly stringent. Chemical substances - additives - are added to the base oil {{in order to meet the}} quality requirements for the end products in terms of, for example, friction and cleaning properties. Certain types of motor oils contain more than twenty percent additives.|$|E
40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of cycloaliphatic and alkyl-substituted acyclic carboxylic acids whose overall characteristics {{are determined by}} the composition of the mixture. A complex mixture of NAs from a commercial fraction of atmospheric oil of the Vojvodina <b>naphthenic</b> <b>crude</b> "Velebit" (Serbia) was separated into narrower fractions {{on the basis of their}} acidity. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the fractions showed the occurrence of structural differentiation of acids. By extraction at pH 3 - 5, about 50 % of the total mass of acids was separated, consisting predominantly of tricyclic and bicyclic structures. Acids of lower acidity, (about 22 %), separated at pH 9 and 10, and their dominant constituents were acids with three, four and five rings. A correlation was found between the dominant structure and the biological activity of NAs of the fractions. The fraction extracted at pH 8, also with dominant bicyclic and tricyclic structures, showed the highest auxin and gibberellin activities...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{insulating}} {{mineral oils}} are mainly manufactured from <b>naphthenic</b> <b>crude</b> sources, {{with a small}} number being produced from paraffinic crudes and gas-to-liquids technology. The resulting products are most frequently free of additives, except for certain types of phenol-based oxidation inhibitors, and of a very low percentage by weight, only up to 0. 4 %. The main specifications for electrical insulating oils, Doble TOPS, ASTM D 3487 and IEC 60296, only allow oxidation inhibitors and any other additives must be agreed upon by the entities involved in the selling and purchasing of the product. Over the years, other additives have been used, sometimes unbeknownst to the purchaser, some of which include pour point depressants, gassing tendency additives, other types of oxidation inhibitors, passivators and metal deactivators. This paper discusses the uses of passivators and how they work in transformer systems. Presently, passivators {{are being used to}} control issues with corrosive sulfur but they have also been used to control oxidation stability of the oil and streaming (static) electrification. This paper will focus mainly on the use of passivators to control corrosive sulfur...|$|E

The objective was an improved understanding of the flowability and pumpability of the fuels under conditions encoutered during cold weather flight of a long range commercial aircraft. The test tank simulated a section of an outer wing tank and was chilled on {{the upper and lower}} surfaces. Fuels included commercial Jet A and Diesel D- 2; JP- 5 from oil shale; and Jet A, intermediate freeze point, and D- 2 fuels derived from selected paraffinic and <b>naphthenic</b> <b>crudes.</b> A pour point depressant was tested...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for the routine, rapid, and quantitative analysis of aliphatic and <b>naphthenic</b> acids in <b>crude</b> oils, {{based on their}} isolation using nonaqueous ion exchange solid-phase extraction cartridges. The isolated acid fractions are methylated and analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The method is effective on both light and heavy oils and is capable of providing mechanistic information of geochemical significance {{on the origin of}} the acids in the oils. Analysis of oils that were solvent extracted from laboratory and field mesocosm marine sediment oil degradation studies indicate that this new method of analyzing the products of hydrocarbon biodegradation may be a useful tool for monitoring the progress of bioremediation of oil spills in the environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} year of this project, we {{continued}} our effort to develop low temperature decarboxylation catalysts and investigate the behavior of these catalysts at different reaction conditions. We conducted a large number of dynamic measurements with crude oil and model compounds to obtain the information at different reaction stages, which was scheduled as the Task 2 in our work plan. We developed a novel adsorption method to remove <b>naphthenic</b> acid from <b>crude</b> oil using naturally occurring materials such as clays. Our results show promise as an industrial application. The theoretical modeling proposed several possible reaction pathways and predicted the reactivity depending on the catalysts employed. From all of these studies, we obtained more comprehensive understanding about catalytic decarboxylation and oil upgrading based on the naphthenic acid removal concept...|$|R
40|$|Examination by high {{temperature}} GC (HTGC) of the methyl esters {{of the so-called}} 'ARN' <b>naphthenic</b> acids from <b>crude</b> oils of North Sea UK, Norwegian Sea and West African oilfields revealed the distributions of resolved 4 - 8 ring C- 80 tetra acids and trace amounts of other acids. Whilst all three oils contained apparently the same the proportions of each differed, possibly reflecting the growth tempe acids, ratures of the archaebacteria from which the acids are assumed to have originated. The structures of the 4, 5, 7 and 8 ring acids are tentatively assigned by comparison with the known 6 ring acid and related natural products and an HPLC method for {{the isolation of the}} individual acids is described. ESI-MS of individual acids isolated by preparative HPLC established the elution order of the 4 - 8 ring acids on the HPLC and HTGC systems and revealed the presence of previously unreported acids tentatively identified as C- 81 and C- 82 7 and 8 ring analogues...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>naphthenic</b> acids in <b>crude</b> oils {{has caused a}} major corrosion problem to the production equipment, storage and transport facilities in the petroleum industry. The level of acidity of crude oil {{was determined by the}} value of Total Acid Number (TAN) in the oil samples. Two types of crude: Petronas Penapisan Melaka Heavy Crude and Petronas Penapisan Melaka Light Crude were studied. Various parameters studied were the amount of chemical dosing, type of catalyst, different catalyst calcination temperatures, and catalyst ratio of basic metal and dopant. The basic chemical used was ammonia solution in ethylene glycol (NH 3 -EG) with a concentration range of 100 - 1000 mg/L. The best experimental condition for the possible TAN for the two samples is 1000 mg/L of NH 3 -EG, and the catalyst reaction must be in the range of 35 - 40 °C. Cu/Mg (10 : 90) /Al 2 O 3 catalyst successfully reduced TAN in Heavy Crude for about 84. 8 % while for Light Crude, TAN was reduced 66. 7 % with the aids of Ni/Mg (10 : 90) /Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Increase concentration of basic chemical, reduced the total acid number value of both crude oil...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that the corrosivity of naphthenic acids is related to their molecular mass and that the "total acid number" (TAN), traditionally used as an indicator of the naphthenic acid content of an oil, is not as reliable as first believed. The presence of <b>naphthenic</b> acids in <b>crude</b> oils leads to the corrosion of oil refinery equipment, with the oil industry incurring costs that will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. With regard to these concerns, mass spectrometry has been increasingly applied to the investigation of the naphthenic acid content of crude oils. To ascertain the nature of the species present, however, it is necessary to utilize an ionization technique that does not result in fragmentation, ensuring the detection only of molecular species which provide useful information about the sample constitution. In the following investigation, negative ion mode nanospray Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry has been applied to the analysis of crude oil samples, providing insight into the different acidic species that were present. Use of the negative ion mode to allow the selective observation of the naphthenic acids and the inherent high mass accuracy and ultrahigh resolution of FTICR mass spectrometry ensure that this technique is very well suited to the characterization of naphthenic acids within a crude oil sample. Determination {{of the nature of the}} naphthenic acids present provides vital information, such as the acids' sizes and composition, which may be used in the battle against corrosion and also used to fingerprint samples from different oil fields...|$|R
30|$|To {{overcome}} {{the limitations of}} WAG, a new technique {{in the form of}} chemically induced water-alternated-gas had been developed {{to take advantage of the}} synergic combination of chemical and gas EOR methods. The types of chemicals commonly used are surfactants, co-surfactants, co-solvents, polymers, alkalis, salts, nanoparticles, etc. depending upon the specific application (Talebian et al. 2013; Kumar and Mandal 2017). The technique is called surfactant-alternated-gas (SAG) flooding when surfactant solutions are alternately injected with gas to form foam in the porous media (Kibodeaux and Rossen 1997). The higher oil recovery obtained by SAG injection compared to WAG can be attributed to a number of factors like reduction of oil–water interfacial tension (IFT), better mobility control due to foam formation, mutual mass transfer between crude oil and injected gas, etc. Although foam can be formed by surfactant alternated with gas injection, clay minerals in rock matrix adsorb the surfactants and reduce the efficiency of the process. So alkali is added with the surfactant in the chemical slug, where alkali works as a clay stabilizer to reduce surfactant adsorption by rock grains. The addition of alkali also helps to convert naturally occurring <b>naphthenic</b> acids in <b>crude</b> oils to produce in-situ surfactant (soaps). It is assumed that a highly oil-soluble single pseudo-acid component (HA) is present in oil (Sheng 2015). This pseudo-acid component partitions into the aqueous phases upon contact with water, and due to subsequent hydrolysis of the alkali, OH− ions are produced which react with acid species in the aqueous phase to form natural soaps NaA (soluble anionic surfactant). The presence of synthetic surfactants and natural soaps assists in further lowering of IFT to ultra-low value (<[*] 0.01 mN/m) resulting in the formation of more stable foam which in turn increases the oil recovery efficiency. The process of co-injection or alternate injection of gas and alkali-surfactant slug which results in the formation of foam in the porous media is termed in the literature as alkali surfactant gas (ASG) or alkaline-surfactant-alternated-gas (ASAG) or low-tension gas process (Srivastava et al. 2009, 2011; Cottin et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2012; Lashgari et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{the term}} “naphthenic acids” was {{originally}} {{used to describe}} acids that contain naphthenic rings, today this term is used in {{a more general sense}} and refers to all components in the acid extractable fraction. In <b>crude</b> oil, <b>naphthenic</b> acids exist as a complex mixture of compounds with broad polydispersity with respect to both molecular weight and structure. There has been increasing interest in the <b>naphthenic</b> acids in <b>crude</b> oil because of the corrosion problems that cause during oil refining. Herein, two powerful analytical tools, negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, ESI(-) FT-ICR MS and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were combined to monitor the thermal degradation of naphthenic acids and their corrosion effects on AISI 1020 steel, respectively. Two different acidic crude oils (TAN= 2. 38 and 4. 79 mgKOHg− 1, and total sulfur= 0. 7993 and 1. 0220 wt%) have been submitted to thermal treatment at 280, 300 and 350 °C during 2, 4 and 6 h, and characterized by ESI(-) -FT-ICR MS, total acid number (TAN), and total sulfur. The AISI 1020 steel was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM. Generally, heating the crude oil at 350 °C in a period of 6 h, it was observed that a high efficiency (≅ 80 %) and selectivity of thermal decarboxylation process was monitored by decay of TAN (4. 79 → 0. 44 mgKOHg− 1). ESI(-) -FT-ICR MS results showed that naphthenic acid species remained after the heating have DBE ranging 1 – 12 and carbon number from C 15 to C 45. AFM topographic profile evidenced that the naphthenic acid corrosion of the crude oil with TAN of 4. 73 mgKOHg− 1 on AISI 1020 steel was profoundly altered and a marked reduction in peak to peak height values (obtained by subtracting the value of the lowest peak by the highest peak in the topographic area examined). Optical images and microphotographs confirmed the presence of irregularities, characterizing the corrosion mechanism as pitting type. The naphthenic corrosion was also evidenced in samples with low TAN value (0. 44 mgKOHg− 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The novel {{application}} of combination, or two stage, photochemical and microbial degradation systems for removal of resin acids from natural river water and single stage photolysis for degradation of naphthenic acids in natural river water was investigated. The organic compounds {{included in this}} project comprise naphthenic acid model compounds and mixtures as well as four resin acids. <b>Naphthenic</b> acids are <b>crude</b> oil-derived and accumulate to significant concentrations (> 100 mg/L) in tailings pond water at oil sands extraction facilities. Resin acids are pulp and paper mill-derived compounds that tend to persist at low levels in receiving waters. For each compound group, analytical methods utilizing liquid chromatography negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS) were developed. The main hurdle to developing analytical methods for the naphthenic acids and resin acids are related to their polarity, complexity, and lack of available standards for the various individual components. As well, co-extractives, such as humic and fulvic acids, tend {{to interfere with the}} detection of naphthenic acids in aquatic samples (Headley et al., 2002 a). Resin acid mixtures are not as complex as the naphthenic acids, although each group of hydrocarbon acids may include several isomeric compounds. The {{application of}} photochemical degradation prior to biodegradation was proven to be effective here for rapid degradation of the resin acids. In general, the resin acid precursors were more susceptible to the photolysis than were the naphthenic acids. Through thermal maturation and increased complexity, the naphthenic acids seemingly become more resistant to degradation, as evidenced by their commercial use as anti-microbial agents and the observed resistance to photolysis noted in this research. The results of this research may be significant for the design of staged treatment for reduced microbial shock loading and increased bioavailability (defined here as the ability of microbial organisms to degrade the target contaminants) in both bioremediation systems and receiving waters. Specifically, four selected pulp and paper mill-associated resin acids were exposed to several ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) spectrum radiation sources in water collected from the River Saale in Germany. Background resin acid concentrations were observed in water collected in 2001 and 2002 from various locations along the well-forested River Saale and a manuscript detailing these results published. Analyses of water samples collected in the pulp and paper milling region of the river (in the state of Thuringia) indicated that resin acids persist through biodegradation treatment systems and for several hundred kilometres downstream. All four resin acids were degraded by facile photochemical and microbial degradation with pseudo-first-order kinetics. Half-life values were in the ranges of 18 to 200 minutes for photolysis applications, 8 to 40 hours for biodegradation applications and 3 to 25 hours for two-stage photochemical-microbial degradation processes, in which photolysis was limited to three hours. From these results, it was shown conclusively that photolysis pre-treatment is a viable and efficient method for reducing both resin acid concentrations and the associated acute toxicity. The naphthenic acids investigated in this study were not effectively degraded via UV/vis radiation, including UV-A/UV-B radiation between 300 - 400 nm, near-monochromatic UV 254 -radiation, full spectrum artificial solar radiation and natural sunlight. The photochemical degradation potential of three model naphthenic acid compounds and three naphthenic acid mixtures (one extract from the Athabasca Oil Sands and two commercial mixtures) were examined in Athabasca River water. Photolysis at UV 254 was the most successful degradation source in all instances, although most naphthenic acids were not significantly degraded by any of the radiation sources. Therefore, it was determined that photolysis is not likely to contribute significantly to environmental degradation and attenuation in the aquatic ecosystem. The results observed from the various naphthenic acids photodegradation processes, coupled with their low affinity for adsorption to soils, reveal that naphthenic acids are likely to persist in the water column. However, UV/vis radiation is capable of significantly changing the composition of mixtures in the aquatic ecosystem, but not reducing overall naphthenic acid concentrations. This may not be a beneficial as there is the potential for increased toxicity toward the lower molecular weight naphthenic acids...|$|R
