40|$|Traditional {{museums are}} {{sometimes}} static, passive and lifeless. Based on previous work on interaction techniques in Virtual Reality museums, {{the aim of}} this Master Thesis is to bring this work to the next level. The project will focus on improving the experience of exploring a virtual museum through more realistic modeling and improved navigation and interaction with the objects allocated inside. As a novelty in this kind of virtual museum the interaction is based on the <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> <b>controllers</b> -Wiimote and Nunchuck. The Next Engine Desktop 3 D Scanner is used to get base meshes for the ob- jects, and Autodesk 3 DStudio MAX and Blender are used as modeling tools. The high quality textures for the pictures exhibited in the virtual museum are created with Adobe Photoshop. We implement the navigation and interaction framework with EON Studio. Finally, the Bluetooth stack BlueSoleil and the emulator GlovePIE are the tools selected to connect the Wii controllers to the application. The visual appearance is improved with shadows, and the time of rendering is accelerated using render-to-texture techniques. The final application is a realistic and interactive virtual museum which can successfully be operated with the <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> <b>controllers.</b> The result of a subsequent usability test shows that it is highly usable as well. The innovative input devices are very welcome by users in this kind of appli- cations. The use of shadow techniques notably improves the visual appearance and sense of presence when exploring virtual environments. Even if there are still a few aspects which can be improved regarding the interaction, the overall result is very satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the developmental prototype of a gesturally controlled digital musical interface. It is called Wii-bändi, as it uses <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> <b>controllers</b> {{to translate the}} gestures into music, and is constructed specifically for clients {{with a variety of}} physical and mental disabilities so that they can use it in a therapeutic group context. It is argued that gestural and emotional expressivity might be based on a theory of vitality affects, and that optimal learnability could be achieved through making use of learning schemas. It then sets out how the interface was created using a methodological approach based on action research, describing the specific contexts that led to the changes that were made to the set-up, over a period of approximately one year (between November, 2008 and December, 2009). The research is split into three cycles. The first explores the specific wishes of the group in question, establishing the core members and core values for the group who are to use the interface; the second progressively develops the interface along those lines as far as is possible, given the limits of the technological tools available; and the third consolidates what has been achieved by finding the optimal way to use the interface constructed. This was found to be a form of musical role play which is covered in greater detail in the last chapter of results. Finally, there is discussion of how best to avoid some of the technical issues that befell Wii-bändi, and the conclusion describes how the interface presents a viable model for using modern music technology to work with disabled people in the future...|$|E

The advantage of this system can be a self-managed, at-home therapy system; reducing fatigue for physical therapists, and the time required for therapist-patient sessions. The system incorporates a virtual reality (VR) environment displaying both the games and a human model as feedback of the patients’ actions whilst playing the games.

30|$|As the {{proliferation}} of dual-hand controllers for both virtual and mixed reality systems continues to grow, further research will still be needed as they are still open questions. The dual-hand controllers for VR systems are symmetrical and have the same functionalities. We have {{the example of the}} <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> <b>controller,</b> which in a way is a combination of two separate input devices (the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk). Although it is a dual-hand controller, each side has a different form factor (for example their shapes and tactile feelings are different) and yet have both similar and different functions. It would be a useful line of research to explore if similar asymmetric designs will enhance the usability of the controllers for manipulating 3 D objects in VR environments. All current dual-hand VR controllers appear to have symmetrical design and functionalities for both hands. With an asymmetrical design, {{it will be possible to}} explore how one can leverage Guiard’s theory of Kinematic Chain [50] in VR environments. For example, we can answer questions like how to use one hand to serve as the reference frame to support and complement the other simultaneous, more precise tasks that need to be performed with the other hand; or whether asymmetrical controllers can lead to better synchronization of simultaneous activities using both hands at the same time in VR environments.|$|R

40|$|Intelligence, surveillance, and {{reconnaissance}} {{unmanned aircraft}} systems (UAS) {{are the most}} common variety of UAS in use today and provide invaluable capabilities to both the military and civil services. Keeping the sensors centered on a point of interest {{for an extended period of}} time is a demanding task requiring the full attention and cooperation of the UAS pilot and sensor operator. There is great interest in developing technologies which allow an operator to designate a target and allow the aircraft to automatically maneuver and track the designated target without operator intervention. Presently, the barriers to entry for developing these technologies are high: expertise in aircraft dynamics and control as well as in real- time motion video analysis is required and the cost of the systems required to flight test these technologies is prohibitive. However, if the research intent is purely to develop a vehicle maneuvering controller then it is possible to obviate the video analysis problem entirely.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{automatic}} learning method for gesture recognition. We combine two different pattern recognition techniques: the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). First, we apply the SOM {{to divide the}} sample data into phases and construct a state machine. Next, we apply the SVM to learn the transition conditions between nodes. An independent SVM is constructed for each node. Of the various pattern recognition techniques for multi-dimensional data, the SOM is suitable for categorizing data into groups, and thus it {{is used in the}} first process. On the other hand, the SVM is suitable for partitioning the feature space into regions belonging to each class, and thus it is used in the second process. Our approach is unique and effective for multi-dimensional and time-varying gesture recognition. The proposed method is a general gesture recognition method that can handle any kinds of input data from any input device. In the experiment presented in this paper, we used two <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> Remote <b>controllers,</b> with three-dimensional acceleration sensors, as input devices.

40|$|As {{unmanned}} systems {{continue to}} evolve and their presence becomes more prolific, new methods are needed for training people to interact with these systems. Likewise, new interfaces must be developed {{to take advantage of}} the increasing capabilities of these platforms. However, the complexity of such interfaces must not grow in parallel with advancements in unmanned systems technology. A common form of human communication is through the use of arm and hand gestures. Applying gesture-based communication methods to human-to-robot communication may increase the interface capabilities, resulting in less complex, natural and intuitive interfaces. In the context of military operations, hand and arm gestures (such as those listed in the Army Field Manual on Visual Signals, FM 21 - 60) may be used to communicate tactical information and instructions to robotic team members. We believe that a gesture-based interface provides a natural method for controlling unmanned systems and reduces training time and training costs for military personnel by reusing standard gestures. The research presented explores these hypotheses through interactions with unmanned systems using computer-mediated gesture recognition. The methodology employs the <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> Remote <b>Controller</b> (Wiimote) to retrieve and classify one- and two-handed gestures that are mapped to an unmanned system command set.

40|$|Objectives: Commercial {{timing light}} systems (CTLS) provide precise {{measurement}} of athletes running velocity, however {{they are often}} expensive and difficult to transport. In this study an inexpensive, wireless and portable timing light system was created using the infrared camera in <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> hand <b>controllers</b> (NWHC). Design: System creation with gold-standard validation. Method: A Windows-based software program using NWHC to replicate a dual-beam timing gate was created. Firstly, data collected during 2. m walking and running trials were validated against a 3 D kinematic system. Secondly, data recorded during 5. m running trials at various intensities from standing or flying starts were compared to a single beam CTLS and the independent and average scores of three handheld stopwatch (HS) operators. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots {{were used to assess}} validity. Absolute error quartiles and percentage of trials in absolute error threshold ranges were used to determine accuracy. Results: The NWHC system was valid when compared against the 3 D kinematic system (ICC. = 0. 99, median absolute error (MAR). = 2. 95 %). For the flying 5. m trials the NWHC system possessed excellent validity and precision (ICC. = 0. 97, MAR 8 %). Conclusions: A NWHC timing light system is inexpensive, portable and valid for assessing running velocity. Errors in the 5. m standing start trials may have been due to erroneous event detection by either the commercial or NWHC-based timing light systems. © 2010 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R

40|$|Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a {{field of}} {{research}} that studies ways in which humans and computers can interact. Gesture interfaces is a particular area of interested situated inside this field. It is about HCI techniques based on the interpretation the users' movement of the head or limbs, and it also relates to haptics. This thesis examines the field's advances made until the present day and analyses how the people have benefited from it. The {{aim of the research}} is to find if gestural interaction has been propagating, its use increased, and identify ways of disseminating gesture interaction and HCI to the general population. A further concern is to improve the distribution of the benefits from HCI and gesture interfaces, reaching out also to a population that is often left disregarded - the developing nations. This is done by reviewing previous work on gesture interfaces under HCI and Computer Vision. This provides the grounds for defining the ideal technology or technique which can facilitate the development of gesture interfaces that are accessible to ordinary users, and can be used in their routine. This definition helps identifying the technology which can best provide for massification of gesture interfaces: the <b>Nintendo</b> <b>Wii</b> Remote <b>controller</b> (Wiimote). After selecting the Wiimote as the best device, it is examined in order to analyze what deficiencies and qualities it has. The technologies it carries are also looked into in detail in order to comprehend the possibilities of connectivity with other devices. This technology is put to test and evaluated both from technical point of view (implementation learning curve, tools, flexibility), and user experience (usability, stress, efficiency). A series of recommendations follow on how to proceed with further implementation of tools and applications that assist users and current interaction models, and can help to change the way they interact with computers. After the initial steps of constructing a test application, it is concluded that the Wiimote is not an appropriate device for this application to build on top of. The proposed approach and design cannot accomplish the goals of a gesture interface due to problems related to the dependency on a fundamental external component. Although the Wiimote is clearly fit for many gesture interfaces, its use and applications are limited, it can only serve a definite number of scenarios.
