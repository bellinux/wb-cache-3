In 1982, she revealed that she had accepted {{thousands of dollars in}} clothing, jewelry, and other gifts, but defended her actions by stating that she had borrowed the clothes, and that they would either be returned or donated to museums, and that she was promoting the American fashion industry. Facing criticism, she soon said she would no longer accept such loans. While often buying her clothes, she continued to borrow and sometimes keep designer clothes throughout her time as first lady, which came to light in 1988. None of this had been included on financial disclosure forms; the <b>non-reporting</b> of loans under $10,000 in liability was in violation of a voluntary agreement the White House had made in 1982, while not reporting more valuable loans or clothes not returned was a possible violation of the Ethics in Government Act. Reagan expressed through her press secretary [...] "regrets that she failed to heed counsel's advice" [...] on disclosing them.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFollowing the {{emergence}} of the Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV- 8) in France in 2006, a surveillance system (both passive and active) was implemented to detect and follow precociously the progression of the epizootic wave. This system did not allow a precise estimation of the extent of the epizootic. Infection by BTV- 8 is associated with a decrease of fertility. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether a decrease in fertility can be used to evidence the under-reporting of cases during an epizootic and to quantify to what extent <b>non-reported</b> cases contribute to the total burden of the epizootic. The cow fertility in herds in the outbreak area (reported or not) was monitored around the date of clinical signs. A geostatistical interpolation method was used to estimate a date of clinical signs for <b>non-reported</b> herds. This interpolation was based on the spatiotemporal dynamic of confirmed case herds reported in 2007. Decreases in fertility were evidenced for both types of herds around the date of clinical signs. In <b>non-reported</b> herds, the decrease fertility was large (60 % of the effect in reported herds), suggesting that some of these herds have been infected by the virus during 2007. Production losses in <b>non-reported</b> infected herds could thus contribute to an important part of the total burden of the epizootic. Overall, results indicate that performance data can be used to evidence the under-reporting during an epizootic. This approach could be generalized to pathogens that affect cattle's performance, including zoonotic agents such as Coxiella burnetii or Rift Valley fever virus...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of return variability between accounting report and <b>non-report</b> periods. A model of information dissemination in financial markets is developed which shows that if corporate sales activity {{is a source of}} predisclosure information, the ratio of return variability between accounting report and <b>non-report</b> periods decreases in contribution margin per dollar sales. Greater contribution margin increases that portion of cash flow variability which is predictable by investors' observation of sales activity and, therefore, contribution margin indexes the informativeness of sales-related predisclosure information. Greater informativeness increases return variability in the predisclosure period relative to the accounting report period. Supporting evidence for this prediction is presented.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reporting of}} bank loans in the financial press during the 2004 - 2007 period. More specifically, it uses a unique hand-collected data set to examine the frequency and determinants of loan reporting. The motivation is double folded. First, virtually all publicly traded firms borrow from banks. However, despite their widespread use, the reporting of bank loan agreements in the financial press is historically associated with a positive share price reaction. Furthermore, this investor reaction has been interpreted as evidence of bank certification or “specialness”. However, historical work on the specialness of bank loans considers only loans that are reported in the press, although the subset of press reported loans and borrowers could arguably differ from the subset of <b>non-reported</b> loans and borrowers. Second, changes in the frequency and determinants of bank reporting during bubbles could arguable be evidence of the financial press being caught in the frenzy and the announcements being less informative. Overall, {{results show that the}} frequency of loan reporting in the press significantly increased, practically doubled the historical 22 % reporting frequency, during the 2004 - 2007 bubble period. However, reported loans and borrowers are still significantly different from <b>non-reported</b> ones. Reported loans have longer maturities, and reported borrowers present lower operating cash flows during the year preceding loan activation. Followin...|$|R

50|$|Male-directed sexual {{violence}} is {{more significant than}} is often thought. The scope of such crimes continues, however, to be unknown largely because of poor {{or a lack of}} documentation. The under- or <b>non-reporting</b> of {{sexual violence}} against males may often be due to fear, confusion, guilt, shame and stigma, or a combination thereof. Moreover, men may be reluctant to talk about being victim of crimes of sexual violence. In this regard, the way in which societies construct the notion of masculinity plays a role. Masculinity and victimization may be considered incompatible, in particular in societies where masculinity is equated with the ability to exert power, leading to <b>non-reporting.</b> The incompatibility between the conventional understanding of masculinity and victimization can arise both with regard to the attack itself and when coping with the consequences of such crimes. Because of under- and <b>non-reporting</b> on sexual violence against men, the little evidence that exists tends to be anecdotal.|$|E
50|$|Reasons for <b>non-reporting</b> include {{shame and}} embarrassment, fear {{of not being}} believed, fear of the {{perpetrator}} of the crime, fear of the legal process, or disbelief that the police {{would be able to}} do anything to help them. Men are even more reluctant to report sexual violence due to extreme embarrassment and concerns about opinions of other people, their masculinity and the fact that they were unable to prevent the assault. Thus information about the extent of sexual violence against males is especially limited. Child sexual abuse is also largely underreported. Most of the data comes from asking adults about their past experiences.One of the reasons for <b>non-reporting</b> is that children lack independent access to resources. They normally require the cooperation of one of their parents who may refuse to believe their child, or may, in fact, be the perpetrator.|$|E
