5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E

The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the essence of the self.|$|E

500|$|Originally [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from pop music critics. [...] In {{a review of}} the group's album Into The Gap, Parke Puterbaugh, from Rolling Stone magazine, said that the band took a [...] "new and drastic tangent" [...] and that they [...] "have slowed it all down to bring the human factor into clearer focus", adding that [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] maintains a [...] "hypnotic, swaying groove that suggests reserves of pastoral contentment even {{in the wake of the}} storm". Robert Christgau, in a review for The Village Voice, said that the song [...] "is a classic on chord changes alone, even though Tom Bailey sings it", adding that <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the album Into The Gap [...] "approaches its heart-tugging mastery". J.D. Considine, in a review for The Washington Post, commented that the song's melody adds [...] "accessibility but could easily turn to dreary monotony".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E
500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in.</b> The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E

2500|$|Baudrillard's writing up to {{the mid-1980s}} is open to several criticisms. He fails to define key terms, such as the code; his writing style is {{hyperbolic}} and declarative, often lacking sustained, systematic analysis when it is appropriate; he totalizes his insights, refusing to qualify or delimit his claims. He writes about particular experiences, television images, as if <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> society mattered, extrapolating a bleak {{view of the world}} from that limited base.

2500|$|Vail’s presidential {{essays in}} AT annual reports are like <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> American {{business}} literature, before or since.

2500|$|Melville's {{major source}} for the story was an {{advertisement}} for a new book, The Lawyer's Story, printed in both the Tribune and the Times for 18 February 1853. The book was published anonymously later that year but in fact was written by popular novelist James A. Maitland. This advertisement included the complete first chapter, which had the following opening sentence: [...] "In the summer of 1843, having an extraordinary quantity of deeds to copy, I engaged, temporarily, an extra copying clerk, who interested me considerably, in consequence of his modest, quiet, gentlemanly demeanor, and his intense application to his duties." [...] Biographer Parker points out that <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the chapter besides this [...] "remarkably evocative sentence" [...] was [...] "notable". Critic Andrew Knighton notes the debt of the story to an obscure work from 1846, Robert Grant White's Law and Laziness: or, Students at Law of Leisure. This source contains one scene and many characters — including an idle scrivener — that appear to have influenced Melville's narrative.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{notorious for}} {{commissioning}} hack-written biographies of famous people {{as soon as}} they died and for publishing them without regard for inaccuracies and inventions. Perhaps the reference to Curll most often repeated by posterity is John Arbuthnot's quip that Curll's biographies had become [...] "one of the new terrors of death" [...] (quoted in Robert Carruthers, The Poetical Works of Pope, 1853, vol. 1, ch. 3). Curll's entire goal was {{to be the first to}} the shops with a biography and not in any way to be the best or most accurate account. [...] Thus, his method was to announce that a biography was about to be published and ask the public to contribute any memories, letters, or speeches of the deceased. [...] He would then include these (and sometimes <b>nothing</b> <b>else)</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "biography." [...] He had no care at all for accuracy and would accept accounts from enemies as quickly as friends. [...] When contributions failed, he would hire an author to invent material. [...] In 1717 alone, he produced biographies of Bishop Burnet and Elias Ashmole. [...] He would later produce, exactly as Swift predicted in his 1731 Lines on the Death of Dr. Swift, a hack biography of Swift. [...] Arbuthnot's terror was apt, for there was virtually no recourse against Curll's press. [...] In 1721, he published a biography of the Duke of Buckingham. [...] He was summoned to the House of Lords for trial, and Lords made a new law making it illegal to publish anything about or by a lord without permission.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the series}} premiere, [...] "Give Me a Ring Sometime" [...] (1982), Diane Chambers, a college student, enters Cheers and meets Sam Malone, a {{recovering}} alcoholic and a womanizer. While {{she waits for}} her fiancé Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire), Diane realizes that Sumner has left her, and that she is jobless and penniless with <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> her life. Sam offers Diane {{a job as a}} cocktail waitress, and she accepts. In the next episode, [...] "Sam's Women" [...] (1982), Diane snootily teases Sam for preferring just beautiful women with below average intelligence. In response, Sam involves his ex-wife, Debra (Donna McKechnie), in a pretend relationship to prove Diane wrong. (In some syndicated prints, Sam's past marriage is omitted.) When Sam and Debra are leaving [...] "for" [...] an opera, Diane retrieves the opera pamphlet from Debra only to find it two years old, foiling Sam's scheme. Sam blames Diane for making his romantic life less fun anymore, and Diane assures that he would never win an intelligent woman. They argue but then make up. When Sam explains a color of the sky at a ski resort and compares it to Diane's eyes in vivid detail, apparently distracted Diane is nearly touched but then averts herself and treats it as repulsive to an intelligent woman. Throughout the season, Sam and Diane are attracted to each other and trade each other flirts and innuendos, but they never consummate their relationship. In the two-part season finale, [...] "Showdown" [...] (1983), Diane briefly dates Sam's successful, handsome, well-educated brother Derek, making Sam jealous. No longer able to suppress their feelings, Sam and Diane kiss passionately in the bar's office.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
