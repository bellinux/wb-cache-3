25|$|Under British rule, {{initially}} the school served the purpose only for Europeans and British children, then extended to Anglo-Indians and finally exclusive to the wards of Railway employees who serve anywhere in India. In the early 1990s, admission {{was open to}} all, with substantially a little higher fee for wards of <b>Non-Railway</b> employees than that of Railway employee.

25|$|This work {{required}} {{the demolition of}} 20 grade 2 listed buildings and many other buildings within Borough Market, which is a Borough High Street Conservation Area, and the original Thameslink programme was rejected at public inquiry partly {{on the grounds that}} suitable arrangements were not included to replace the buildings to be demolished within the market. A revised proposal involving remedial work to the market was accepted at a second public inquiry. By January 2009 businesses {{in the path of the}} new viaduct were closing down or relocating in preparation for demolition work, and the first section of the new viaduct was installed over the weekend of 10 October 2010. These works had been brought forward to fit in with other, <b>non-railway,</b> developments in the Borough High Street area; the viaduct only came into use in January 2016 as part of the Key Output 2 stageworks when the Charing Cross services started passing through new platforms on the south side of London Bridge High Level Station.|$|E
40|$|Although {{historical}} asset price ‘bubbles’ are often attributed to irrationality, the empirical analysis of such episodes has been limited. The results {{presented in this}} paper suggest that during an historical price reversal, investors successfully incorporated forecasts of short-term dividend changes into their valuations, but were unable to predict longer-term changes. When short-term growth is controlled for, it appears that the railways were priced consistently with the <b>non-railways</b> for almost the entire episode. These findings may imply that investors had imperfect foresight, but that they acted consistently. ...|$|R
40|$|Historical ‘bubbles’ {{are often}} {{attributed}} to mispricing, but the empirical analysis of such episodes has been limited. This paper examines a notable but academically neglected period, {{known as the}} British Railway Mania, using a new dataset and a cross-sectional methodology which is unique {{to the study of}} historical asset price reversals. The main finding is that the cross-sectional variation in stock prices, in every week of the sample, is explained by the cross-sectional variation in dividends, growth and risk, with {{no significant differences between the}} railways and <b>non-railways.</b> This implies that an economic bubble was not responsible for the rise and fall in the prices of railway assets at this time. ...|$|R
25|$|Prior to the 18th century, Golden Rock, was earlier {{referred}} by Robert Orme to the British as Sugar-Loaf Rock, where after the Battle of Golden Rock, the erstwhile Trichinopoly {{was divided into}} two parts, one called the Cantonment, which contains the residences of European & Anglo-Indian community and the garrison-barracks for stationing the European and Indian Regiments. The cantonment then comprised the present day areas of Cantonment, Tiruchirappalli Junction, Senthaneerpuram, Varahaneri, Golden Rock, Tiruchirapalli Central Prison and other major parts of southern and eastern trichy. During 1878, when the Afghan War broke, {{the whole of the}} European troops were withdrawn. According to Oral lore, some parts of the barracks were converted to dispensary and clinic. Later, the buildings were transformed for Cholera/T.B. Hospital and again as barracks and again to hospital, which was mostly devoted and preferred for the Europeans and Anglo-Indians. Around the 1920s, provision was contemplated for a Railway School since there were considerations to move the railway workshop from Negapatnam to Trichinopoly, for strategic purposes, for which foundations were laid in 1926 and permanently moved in 1928. Around the same time, two Railway schools at primary level in English Medium and Tamil Medium were established during 1923 and 1925 respectively along with an exclusive Divisional Railway Hospital was also set up and started to function here since 1927. Post-independence the administration was transferred to Indian railways, which opened many more such schools, where quality education is provided at subsidized cost to about one lakh children of railway employees and about 30,000 <b>non-railway</b> wards. There are about 5,500 teachers and about 1,100 non-teaching staff employed in these railway schools. Indian Railways also supports many Kendriya Vidyalayas for the benefit of wards of railway employees.|$|E

Another traction engine, Fergus the Railway Traction Engine also appears in Thomas & Friends, but unlike Trevor, Fergus runs on rails instead of roads.|$|E
2500|$|The bogie {{carriages}} were {{distinctive and}} 'American' in style. The six were {{built by the}} 'Bristol Carriage and Wagon Works', two as [...] Third Class (one also being a thirdbrake) and four as [...] composites for 40 Third and 10 First Class passengers. The carriages were exceptionally wide compared with those used by major railway companies and this led to increased congestion for <b>non-railway</b> traffic when trains were at Bideford Quay. Entry was from either end by a metal fenced platform with steep steps. Later the open ends of these carriages were totally enclosed against the elements. Lighting was by acetylene gas, with ventilators above. Each carriage had its own clock. The seats could be turned around and the carriages had a central gangway. Third Class seats were upholstered with 'rep' and First Class with 'American' leather. They had a polished teak exterior {{with the name of}} the company in full beneath the windows, and the arms of Bideford as a medallion on the side. Buffer beams and shanks were bright red. Interiors were of polished oak, with teak mouldings and the ceilings of the First Class sections were covered in pale green Lincrusta, picked out with gold leaf. In August 1900 the carriages had been delivered, crossing Bideford Bridge with wheels and springs being taken over first and the bodies after.|$|E
