5|$|Two {{other states}} that were created after the war, Rhineland-Palatinate (French zone) and Lower Saxony (British zone), chose to use the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, defaced with the state's coat of arms. These two states were formed from parts of other states, and no colour {{combinations}} from these previous states were accepted as a new state flag. This led {{to the use of}} the black-red-gold for two reasons: the colours did not relate particularly to any one of the previous states, and using the old flag from the Weimar Republic was intended to be a symbol of the <b>new</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{scholarship}} {{finds that}} <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> {{are more likely}} than estab-lished democracies to make binding commitments to international human rights institu-tions. Are <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> also better at following through on these commitments? Stated differently, does their greater willingness to join international institutions reflect a genuine commitment to human rights reform or is it just “cheap talk? ” We analyze this question using a new data set of more than 1, 000 leading European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) cases. Since <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> face judgments that are more difficult to implement than established democracies, we employ a genetic matching algorithm to balance the data set. After controlling for bureaucratic and judi-cial capacity, we find that <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> do implement similar ECtHR judgments ini-tially more quickly than established democracies, but this effect reverses the longer a judgment remains pending. Although <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> have incentives to implement judgments quickly, they sometimes lack checks and balances that help ensure imple-mentation should an executive resist. A growing literature asserts that <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> {{are more likely than}} stable democ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{literature}} on democratic survival, theories of democratic consolidation assume that <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> are more vulnerable to breakdown. Theories of democratic honeymoons, however, claim that <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> are less vulnerable to breakdown. This article addresses this seem-ing contradiction. Using an original data set that includes all democracies from the period 1951 to 1995, the authors use discrete-time duration analysis {{to determine if there}} is evidence for a period of enhanced survivability in <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> Using both continuous and discrete speci-fications of a honeymoon period, they test whether <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> experience an absolute honeymoon (whether newness in itself makes them less prone to breakdown) or a relative honey-moon (where newness insulates them from the effect of poor economic performance). The results suggest that there is a short-lived absolute honeymoon, but that <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> are actually more vulnerable to effects of poor economic performance prior to their third legislative election...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} parties and party systems in <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> Scholars have long touted the importance of political parties and stable party system for <b>new</b> <b>democracies,</b> which {{are in the process}} of consolidating their regimes. Robert Dix writes that ?institutionalization of parties and party systems is crucial in the maintenance of the tenuous <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> ? (1992, p. 490). Recently, anti-system politicians have been on the rise, political parties have been heavily attacked and associated with ?old politics? and party fragmentation has increased. Scholars have asked whether or not you can have democracy without political parties. This paper focuses on how important parties are to functioning democracies, and also highlights the importance of stable party systems to <b>new</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R
5|$|Greece– November 2011– After intense {{criticism}} from {{within his own}} party, the opposition and other EU governments, for his proposal to hold {{a referendum on the}} austerity and bailout measures, PM George Papandreou of the PASOK party announced his resignation in favour of a national unity government between three parties, of which only two currently remain in the coalition. Following the vote in the Greek parliament on the austerity and bailout measures, which both leading parties supported but many MPs of these two parties voted against, Papandreou and Antonis Samaras expelled a total of 44 MPs from their respective parliamentary groups, leading to PASOK losing its parliamentary majority. The early Greek legislative election, 2012 were {{the first time in the}} history of the country, at which the bipartisanship (consisted of PASOK and <b>New</b> <b>Democracy</b> parties), which ruled the country for over 40 years, collapsed in votes as a punishment for their support to the strict measures proposed by the country's foreign lenders and the Troika (consisted of the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank). The popularity of PASOK dropped from 42.5% in 2010 to as low as 7% in some polls in 2012. The radical right-wing, extreme left-wing, communist and populist political parties that have opposed the policy of strict measures, won the majority of the votes.|$|E

40|$|Why do <b>new</b> EU <b>democracies</b> {{engage in}} multilateralism? The {{dominant}} explanation proposes that <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> use international treaties {{to lock in}} domestic reforms. This article offers a novel explanation as to why <b>new</b> EU <b>democracies</b> participate in multilateral treaties. We argue that ratifying a treaty serves three external signaling purposes (addressing recognition concerns; increasing strategic autonomy, and pleasing the EU). We test our argument through a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. First, we apply event history analysis. Drawing on a new ratification data set comprising 76 multilateral treaties, we illustrate the prominent role of <b>new</b> EU <b>democracies</b> in multilateralism as compared to other <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> Second, to assess the importance of external signaling {{in the decision to}} ratify multilateral treaties, we examine parliamentary ratification debates in selected Central and Eastern European countries. Third, we compare parliamentary discussions across European and non-European <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> to demonstrate the different motives driving their approaches toward multilateralism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{literature}} on labor politics explains cooperation among unions, employers and state representatives in <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> {{as a function}} of alliances between politically infl uential unions and left governments. This article introduces an original dataset of labor agreements in <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> (1994 – 2004). Using Boolean analysis, it shows that while left governments are typically associated with more labor market regulation, they are not suffi cient for social pacts to emerge in <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> Instead, protective labor market institutions and practices explain most instances of cooperation. Further analysis reveals this to be the case for all types of pacts analyzed...|$|R

The power of the traditional Greek political parties, PASOK and <b>New</b> <b>Democracy,</b> declined from 43% to 13% and from 33% to 18%, respectively, due to their support for austerity measures. The leftist party SYRIZA became the second major party, with an increase from 4% to 16%. No party could form a sustainable government, which led to the parliamentary elections of June 2012.

40|$|We {{argue that}} extreme {{positioning}} benefits parties in <b>new</b> <b>democracies,</b> because - {{given the lack}} of other reliable cues such as party histories - the distinctiveness of their left-right policy positions increases voter certainty about parties' identities and intentions in office. Cross-sectional analyses provide evidence that, in the <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> of postcommunist Europe, parties that are farther away from the mean voter position gain more popular support than those moderately positioned along a policy continuum. In established democracies, by contrast, policy moderation increases popular support. We also find empirical support for the proposed causal mechanism that links policy positions to popular support via voter certainty.

25|$|The {{controversy}} was {{not just}} nationalist, but it also played out in Greece's internal politics. The two leading Greek political parties, the ruling conservative <b>New</b> <b>Democracy</b> under Constantine Mitsotakis and the socialist PASOK under Andreas Papandreou, sought to outbid each other in whipping up nationalist sentiment and the long-term (rather than immediate) threat posed by the apparent irredentist policies of Skopje. To complicate matters further, <b>New</b> <b>Democracy</b> itself was divided; the then prime minister, Mitsotakis, favored a compromise solution on the Macedonian question, while his foreign minister Adonis Samaras took a hard-line approach. The two eventually fell out and Samaras was sacked, with Mitsotakis reserving the foreign ministry for himself. He failed {{to reach an agreement}} on the Macedonian issue despite United Nations mediation; he fell from power in October 1993, {{largely as a result of}} Samaras causing the government's majority of one to fall in September 1993.|$|E

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>democracies</b> {{have emerged}} in {{unprecedented}} numbers in the period {{since the fall of}} the Soviet Union. Virtually all of these countries have created constitutional courts tasked with imposing constitutional constraints on the new democratic process. These courts should be unencumbered by a Madison v. Marbury moment as their role is to oversee the legislative products of the <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> The question then arises why the strong reliance on constitutional courts in these <b>new</b> <b>democracies,</b> a reliance not present in the last great wave of democratizations following World War II. This article analyzes the role of constitutional courts in stabilizing <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> as they emerge from authoritarianism. Relying on both contractual and strategic considerations, the article presents a picture of constitutional courts as mediating or “hedging” the transition to democracy by offering the prospect of further resistance to one-party domination that has doomed many <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> By potentially lending an institutional ally to the losers in the first period of government formation, constitutional court may aid in resisting the process in which the first election is a contest for who gets to assume the power of the state, and in which the first election also proves to be the last election. This analysis is applied to the work that courts have done in shoring the institutional structures of divided government in counties from Eastern Europe to South Africa, and including restored competitive democracies in South Korea and Mexico. The argument then turns to the jurisprudence which does and should follow from the role of courts in stabilizing the transition to democracy...|$|R

40|$|How does {{experience}} with nominally democratic electoral institutions shape {{the politics and}} stability of <b>new</b> <b>democracies?</b> Since at least {{the beginning of the}} Third Wave, <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> have sprung up in countries with vastly different electoral experiences; many non-democracies adopted impressively diverse arrangements of nominally democratic electoral institutions that operated with varying degrees of competitiveness, affording substantial diversity to the institutional legacies inherited by emerging democracies. I assess the degree to which these different legacies impact the political dynamics of <b>new</b> <b>democracies.</b> Does institutional legacy affect levels of participation in <b>new</b> <b>democracies?</b> Does it help explain why some emerging democracies restrict political rights and civil liberties? And most importantly, does institutional legacy make democracies more (or less) likely to face a return to authoritarian rule? Building upon recent advances in the comparative study of authoritarian electoral institutions, I define competitive institutional legacies based on the extent of electoral competition in the preceding regime and apply an original operationalization of the concept to a dataset of 58 <b>new</b> <b>democracies</b> that emerged between 1975 and 2003. In order to answer the questions put forth above, I combine this data with data on regime durability, government crackdowns, and political participation in young <b>democracies.</b> With this <b>new</b> dataset, I conduct cross-national analyses to examine how these key dependent variables vary across democracies with different institutional legacies. The results indicate that legacies of robust, competitive elections lead to more stable new democracies; all else being equal, {{experience with}} competitive elections reduces the chances of a return to non-democratic rule, stems the tide of government restrictions on political rights, and prepares citizens to become active participants in the electoral process...|$|R
