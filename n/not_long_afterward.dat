After the Treaty of Ghent was signed, the United States looked at ending the piracy in the Mediterranean which had plagued American merchants for two decades. On 3 March 1815, the U.S. Congress authorized deployment of naval power against Algiers, beginning the Second Barbary War. Two powerful squadrons under the command of Commodores Stephen Decatur, Jr. and William Bainbridge, including the 74-gun ships of the line , , and , were dispatched to the Mediterranean. Shortly after departing Gibraltar en route to Algiers, Decatur's squadron encountered the Algerian flagship Meshuda, and, in the Action of 17 June 1815, captured it. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> the American squadron likewise captured the Algerian brig Estedio in the Battle off Cape Palos.

Then Israel laid his right hand on the younger Ephraim’s head and his left hand on the eldest Manasseh’s head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father’s right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father’s hands.

60|$|<b>Not</b> till <b>long</b> <b>afterward</b> did Polly see {{how much}} good this little effort had done her, for the first small {{sacrifice}} of this sort leads the way to others, and a single hand's turn given heartily to the world's great work helps one amazingly with one's own small tasks. Polly found this out as her life slowly grew easier and brighter, and the beautiful law of compensation gave her better purposes and pleasures than any she had lost. The parents of some of her pupils were persons of real refinement, and such are always quick to perceive the marks of culture in others, {{no matter where they}} find them. These, attracted first by Polly's cheerful face, modest manners, and faithful work, soon found in her something more than a good teacher; they found a real talent for music, an eager desire for helpful opportunities, and a heart grateful for the kindly sympathy that makes rough places smooth. Fortunately those who have the skill to detect these traits also possess the spirit to appreciate and often the power to serve and develop them. In ways so delicate that the most sensitive pride could not resent the favor, these true gentlefolk showed Polly their respect and regard, put many pleasures in her way, and when they paid her for her work, gave her also the hearty thanks that takes away all sense of degradation even from the humblest service, for money so earned and paid sweetens the daily bread it buys, and makes the mutual obligation a mutual benefit and pleasure.|$|R

25|$|It was in 1891 {{that many}} of Petipa's {{original}} ballets, revivals, and dances from operas began to be notated in the method of dance notation created by Vladimir Stepanov.

25|$|Following his ordination, Gibbs became {{active in}} the {{abolitionist}} movement. He attended a series of black conventions where he worked with Frederick Douglass and served on committees. He gradually became known nationally {{for his work in}} the movement. Gibbs was featured in anti-slavery publications including The Liberator and The National Anti-Slavery Standard. His rising fame was indicative of Gibbs' own ambitions as well his skills as an orator and rising abolitionist minister. His growing involvement in New York's abolitionist movement separated him from his family. In part due to his extensive absences from home and his parish duties, Gibbs became increasingly alienated from his wife. Anna was accustomed to living standards that a young pastor could not afford. The tension between husband and wife prompted Gibbs to consider leaving the United States for Africa to work as a missionary. However, he was persuaded by his congregation to abandon these plans. The marital discord eventually led to lengthy and bitter divorce proceedings, which lasted until 1862. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> Gibbs returned to his native Philadelphia where he continued work in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
25|$|Bogan left Hamilton <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> {{settling}} into working on ranches {{in and around}} the Texas Panhandle. In 1884, Bogan was a ring leader in a cowboy's strike for better wages, which ended in all who took part being blacklisted, finding themselves unable to work in the Panhandle. Bogan rode to Wilbarger County, Texas, and joined up for a cattle drive as a drover, working for the Worsham R-2 Ranch. Cowboy T. J Burkett, also working on that drive, would years later comment that Bogan was a valuable hand to have, and that one night during a fierce thunderstorm, Bogan alone was able to hold 600 head of cattle from breaking into stampede. When the drive reached Dodge City, Kansas, and the cowboys were paid, they commenced to drink and party. Believing they were getting out of hand, Town Marshal Jack Bridges and his deputies confronted them and ran them out of town. This resulted in a brief gunfight between the lawmen and the cowboys, during which cowboy John Briley was shot and killed. Bogan and Burkett were both involved in that escapade, and the cowboys took no action in retaliation.|$|E

Woolsey convinced some of his Music Row (Nashville, TN) connections to come to Texas and to listen to Strait and his band play. Impressed with the performance, but concerned that they couldn't market the Western Swing sound that the band featured, they left without a deal. After several unsuccessful trips to Nashville {{in search of a}} record deal in which Strait was turned down by every label in town, he considered giving up music altogether. He was offered a job designing cattle pens and decided to take it.
