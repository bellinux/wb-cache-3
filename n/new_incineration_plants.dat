However, not all plants are implemented this way, resulting in inconveniences in the locality.|$|R

For example, when he was {{president}} of the Island Development Committee, the Bailiff of the time, Sir Frank Ereaut, stated “Senator Shenton puts a human face on planning”. When he was President of Agriculture and Fisheries he introduced new measures to protect and ensure the unique characteristics of the Jersey cattle breed. He also launched the very successful ‘Jersey Fresh’ campaign to promote local products. As president of the Resources Recovery Board he was responsible for the opening of the <b>new</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> which turned household rubbish in electricity. He also introduced disciplined measures for the sorting of waste which in turn cleaned up Island hedgerows and restored St. Ouen's Bay to its former glory. He drew the line in the sand.|$|R
40|$|Possibilities {{for energy}} {{recovery}} from sludge at Chişinȃu {{wastewater treatment plant}} have been investigated and evaluated. One way of recovering energy from sludge is to produce biogas through anaerobic digestion. Which method of biogas usage that is to prefer in Chişinȃu has been evaluated from a cost-efficiency point of view. There {{is a possibility that}} a <b>new</b> waste <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> will be built next to the wastewater treatment plant, and therefore solutions that benefit from a co-operation have been discussed. The results show that biogas production would be suitable and profitable in a long time perspective if the gas is used for combined heat and power production.

40|$|Since the mid-nineties <b>new</b> waste <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> {{have come}} into {{operation}} in the Netherlands. Burning of waste can result in the emission of potentially toxic compounds. Although the <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> must comply with strict conditions concerning emission control, public concern on the possible impact on {{human health and the}} environment still exists. Multiple year (2004 – 2013) biomonitoring programs were set up around three waste incinerators for early detection of possible effects of stack emissions on the quality of crops and agricultural products. The results showed that the emissions did not affect the quality of crops and cow milk. Concentrations of heavy metals, PAHs and dioxins/PCBs were generally similar to background levels and did not exceed standards for maximum allowable concentrations in foodstuffs (e. g. vegetables and cow milk). Some exceedances of the fluoride standard for cattle feed were found almost every year in the maximum deposition areas of two incinerators. Biomonitoring with leafy vegetables can be used to monitor the real impact of these emissions on agricultural crops and to communicate with all stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Japan, {{the largest}} source of dioxin is solid waste <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> Because workers {{employed}} at these plants handle fly ash and slag contaminated by dioxins, they can take dioxins into the body during work and their health may be adversely effected. This paper describes the dioxin exposure concentration, daily dioxin intake and blood dioxin level in workers employed at municipal <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> The estimated dioxin exposure concentrations were 0. 5 to 7. 2 pg TEQ/m 3 in the daily operation and 0. 2 to 92, 000 pg TEQ/m 3 in the periodic maintenance. It was also expected that the daily dioxin intake can exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) in <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> with fly ash of high dioxin concentration. The mean of blood dioxin concentration was 346 pg TEQ/g lipid in the highest exposed worker group of the Toyono-gun <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> and those were 11 to 40 pg TEQ/ g lipid in the other <b>incineration</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
