30|$|Next, we mathematically {{define the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>line.</b> In this article, for simplicity, a {{reasonable}} expectation on {{the resistance of}} a network system against hazards is that the average percentage of effectively impacted nodes should equal to the percentage of hazard covered area. Therefore, the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> should {{be defined as a}} 45 ° straight line from the point (0  %, 0  %) to the point (100  %, 100  %) (the blue line in Fig.  3 a). According to the impact curve and the <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> we can qualitatively determine whether a network system is vulnerable to spatially localized hazards. If the impact curve completely overlaps with the <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> the network system is neutral to the hazards. If the impact curve is mainly above the <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> the system is vulnerable to the hazards (the red line in Fig.  3 a). If the impact curve is mainly below the <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> the system is robust to the hazards (the green line in Fig.  3 a).|$|R

40|$|The {{active region}} NOAA 11158 {{produced}} the first X-class flare of Solar Cycle 24, an X 2. 2 flare at 01 : 44 UT on 2011 February 15. Here we analyze SDO/HMI magnetograms covering a 12 -hour interval centered {{at the time}} of this flare. We describe the spatial distributions of the photospheric magnetic changes associated with this flare, including the abrupt changes in the field vector, vertical electric current and Lorentz force vector. We also trace these parameters' temporal evolution. The abrupt magnetic changes were concentrated near the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> and in two neighboring sunspots. Near the <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> the field vectors became stronger and more horizontal during the flare and the shear increased. This was due to an increase in strength of the horizontal field components near the <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> most significant in the horizontal component parallel to the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> but the perpendicular component also increased in strength. The vertical component did not show a significant, permanent overall change at the <b>neutral</b> <b>line.</b> The increase in total flux at the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> was accompanied by a compensating flux decrease in the surrounding volume. In the two sunspots near the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> the azimuthal flux abruptly decreased during the flare but this change was permanent in only one of the spots. There was a large, abrupt, downward vertical Lorentz force change during the flare, consistent with results of past analyses and recent theoretical work. The horizontal Lorentz force acted in opposite directions along each side of <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> with the two sunspots at each end subject to abrupt torsional forces. The shearing forces were consistent with field contraction and decrease of shear near the <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> whereas the field itself became more sheared as a result of the flux collapsing towards the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> from the surrounding volume.

50|$|The second problem, the {{inadequacy}} of fuses to act as the sole safety device in most power systems, is probably best resolved {{by the use of}} residual current devices (RCDs). In any properly functioning electrical appliance the current flowing into the appliance on the active line should equal the current flowing out of the appliance on the neutral line. A residual current device works by monitoring the active and <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> and tripping the active line if it notices a difference. Residual current devices require a separate neutral line for each phase {{and to be able to}} trip within a time frame before harm occurs. This is typically not a problem in most residential applications where standard wiring provides an active and neutral line for each appliance (that's why your power plugs always have at least two tongs) and the voltages are relatively low however these issues do limit the effectiveness of RCDs in other applications such as industry. Even with the installation of an RCD, exposure to electricity can still prove lethal.|$|E

In short-day photoperiodic cycle disposition of dynamics of sugar and starch content over a day-light period, their runoff over a moon-light period and also activity of enzymes of photoperiodically <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> change similar to it of short-day lines. At short day <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> more intensively accumulate monosugar and sucrose. At long day, amylose is accumulated in content of starch comparing to short-day lines.

Capability of photoperiodically <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> to change disposition of carbohydrate exchange over a short-day period similar to its disposition of short-day lines is one of the considerable factors in favor of the fact that under the given conditions process of growth and development, this is provided with sufficient amount of substance and energy. As a result morphogenetic processes run at the same speed over both short-day and long-day periods.

40|$|From the {{analysis}} of ISEE 3 data {{it is found that}} a plasmoid is sometimes formed in the middle tail outside the intervals of the substorm expansion phase. This plasmoid is produced by reconnection at the X-type <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> which is located earthward of the distant <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> but beyond the substorm-associated near-tail <b>neutral</b> <b>line,</b> and it is almost stagnant in that the associated flow speed is less than 300 km/s. The blocking effect of the distant <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> is the most probable reason for the slow movement. The quasi-stagnant plasmoid is observed at x = - 60 to - 100 earth radii for a duration of a few tens of minutes, and in about one half of the cases it is followed by the fast tailward streaming. The onset of this streaming tends to coincide with the onset of the substorm expansion phase, and this probably occurs when the reconnection at the middle-tail <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> comes close to processing the last closed field line. Intensification of the dawn-to-dusk electric field that causes the mantle plasma to reach the plasma sheet boundary closer to the earth is suggested as the reason for the formation of the middle-tail <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> earthward of the distant <b>neutral</b> <b>line.</b> The effects on the energetic particle flux and relation to the near-tail reconnection are also discussed...|$|R
