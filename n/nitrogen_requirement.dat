The common ringtail possum has a daily maintenance <b>nitrogen</b> <b>requirement</b> (MNR) of 290 mg N/kg0.75. Common ringtail possums gain much of their MNR from consuming their nitrogen-rich caecal pellets. They would have to gain 620 mg N/kg0.75 otherwise. The ringtail possum recycles 96% of its liver's urea, which is then transferred into the caecum and made into bacterial protein. Only re-ingestion makes this effective and the bacterial protein must be digested in the stomach and the amino acids subsequently absorbed in the small intestine. [...] This recycling also allows the possum to conserve water and urinate less. Reingestion allows the possum to live on low nitrogen eucalyptus leaves which is particularly important during late lactation.|$|E

Five planting ratios (100 % canola 66 % canola + 33 % pea, 50 % canola + 50 % pea 33 % canola + 66 % pea 100 % pea) were evaluated as the first factor and three levels of nitrogen (100 %, 75 % and 50 %  N requirement of canola and pea) as the second factor. Results showed that intercropping in comparison to sole cropping led to increase in the plant height of pea (23. 64 %) but it decreased canola plant height (7. 32 %). Total dry matter of canola and pea increased in intercropping treatments (38. 56 and 6. 15 %, respectively) compared to sole cropping. In canola sole cropping, seed yield increased (21. 9 %) with increase in nitrogen application, however in intercropping the greatest seed yield was observed in 75 % plant <b>nitrogen</b> <b>requirement.</b> The crop  yield in intercropping treatments with application of 50 and 75 % plant <b>nitrogen</b> <b>requirement</b> was higher than sole cropping of either crop, but crop yield in pea – canola 66 - 33 % and 50 - 50 % with 100 % plant <b>nitrogen</b> <b>requirement</b> was decreased compared to their sole cropping.

Kelp detritus, bacteria and kelp consumers' faeces available in the water column surpass several times the carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>requirements</b> of intertidal and subtidal clam populations.

Wide and shallow continental shelves with gentle slopes probably limit the penetration of upwelled waters to the nearshore waters, decreasing the influence of external inputs and increasing the importance of internal flows of nutrients and carbon within the nearshore zone.

40|$|A common {{production}} practice {{throughout the}} United States is to supplement protein to cattle consuming low-quality forage (forage with a {{crude protein content}} of less than 7 %) {{in order to improve}} animal performance (i. e., maintain body condition score and body weight) during the winter. Protein supplementation increases forage utilization (intake and digestion) and cow performance by supplying ruminal microbes with protein that is essential for microbial growth. Increased microbial activity in turn provides sources of both protein and energy to the cow. In addition to the protein that is fed and degraded in the rumen, ruminants have the ability to recycle urea—the same compound found in fertilizer and cattle feed—to the rumen, where microbes can use the urea to fulfill a portion of their <b>nitrogen</b> <b>requirement.</b> Although nutritionists know that recycling occurs, we have inadequate data to describe this process and, subsequently, the contribution from recycled urea is not adequately included in our present cattle feeding systems.

The annual increment of biomass to meet these needs is quantified as net primary production (NPP). Here we show that an underlying assumption in some current models may lead to underestimates of the potential production from managed landscapes, particularly of bioenergy crops that have low <b>nitrogen</b> <b>requirements.</b> Using a simple light-use efficiency model and the theoretical maximum efficiency with which plant canopies convert solar radiation to biomass, we provide an upper-envelope NPP unconstrained by resource limitations.

Recalculating the upper envelope estimate of NPP limited by available water reduced it by half or more in 91 % of the land area globally.
