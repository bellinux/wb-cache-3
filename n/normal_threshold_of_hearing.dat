5000|$|The tone decay test (also {{known as}} the {{threshold}} tone decay test or TTDT) is used in audiology to detect and measure auditory fatigue. It was developed by Raymond Carhart in 1957. In people with normal hearing, a tone whose intensity is only slightly above their absolute <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> can be heard continuously for 60 seconds. The tone decay test produces {{a measure of the}} [...] "decibels of decay", i.e. the number of decibels above the patient's absolute <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> that are required for the tone to be heard for 60 seconds. A decay of between 15 and 20 decibels is indicative <b>of</b> cochlear <b>hearing</b> loss. A decay of more than 25 decibels is indicative of damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Results of {{previous}} studies gave support {{to the idea that}} machines in power plants produce noise of different levels of loudness and frequency, and that it could cause deterioration <b>of</b> the <b>hearing</b> ability <b>of</b> workers. As a matter <b>of</b> fact, noiseinduced <b>hearing</b> loss is the most widespread occupational disease nowadays. As noise is a complex acoustic phenomenon, more factors have to be considered when studying it, such as frequency, intensity and the period of exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} find if there are differences in the absolute <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> between workers in the factory production lines that are constantly exposed to the industrial noise of higher spectrum and those exposed to the noise of standard spectrum at different frequencies of sound. Methods. In the research plan, there were 308 workers employed in the production line of the Factory “Knjaz Miloš”, Aranđelovac. A total of 205 of them were working in the conditions of higher spectrum noise (4, 000 Hz – 8, 000 Hz) and 103 workers were exposed to standard noise spectrum (31. 5 Hz – 2, 000. 0 Hz). The objective measures of noise (frequency and amplitude) were acquired by phonometer, and measures <b>of</b> absolute <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> for both ears were obtained by audiometer by exposure to nine sound frequency levels. Data were statistically analyzed by establishing the significance of differences between absolute <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> for both groups and for all nine frequency levels. Results. It was found that the absolute <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> is significantly higher for the group exposed to highfrequency noise at the 4, 000 Hz and 8, 000 Hz levels of frequency. Conclusion. Reduction <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> sensitivity is evident for those exposed to higher spectrum noise, which is particularly evident at the higher frequency levels. Employees are often unaware of its effects because they are the results of prolonged exposure. Therefore, working in those conditions requires preventive measures and regular testing <b>of</b> the <b>hearing</b> ability...|$|R

40|$|Setup: To set‐up {{for this}} part of the test, the {{participant}} is asked to wear a set of TDH headphones and is instructed to respond to tones presented to them one ear at a time by pressing a button. The audiometer, a device consisting of a stimulus generator and an attenuator, is used to vary both the frequency and the level of the tone heard by the participant. The goal of {{this part of}} the study is to determine the lowest level the participant responds to the tone and as such, to determine the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> for the individual at each frequency. The tones are presented in accordance with the Hughson‐Westlake procedure [1]. Comments: The term air conduction threshold is used because the behavioural <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> is determined through the use of THD headphones. The tones produced by the audiometer are transmitted through the air from these headphones, through the external auditory canal, across the middle ear and to the inner ear. Air conduction <b>thresholds</b> for a <b>normal</b> hearing individual are characterized as being below 25 dB HL [1]. As such, this patient has <b>normal</b> <b>thresholds</b> at all frequencies for both their right and left ears. The participant commented on the fact that he felt he could hear better from his left ear. An otoscopic examination revealed that his left ear canal had a fairly large bend and was much narrower than his right. Also, the above air conduction thresholds support the patient’s observation <b>of</b> his own <b>hearing</b> ability. At 750 Hz and 1000 Hz, the left ear has a significantly better hearing threshold than the right. This amount of asymmetry between ears is normal...|$|R
2500|$|A more {{rigorous}} {{exploration of the}} lower limits of audibility determines that the minimum threshold at which a sound can be heard is frequency dependent.

50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{audiometer}} generates pure tones, or transmits parts of speech.Another kind of audiometer is the Bekesy audiometer, in which the subject follows a tone of increasing and decreasing amplitude as the tone is swept through the frequency range by depressing a button when the tone is heard and releasing it when it cannot be heard, crossing {{back and forth over the}} <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> Bekesy audiometry typically yields lower thresholds and standard deviations than pure tone audiometry.|$|R

Subgroup analysis was performed on categories in which lactate {{has been described as}} predictor of mortality (sepsis and circulatory failure) [10 – 13].
