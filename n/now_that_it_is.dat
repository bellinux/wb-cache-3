5|$|Once {{they reach}} Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells {{the group that}} the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After {{defeating}} Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. Yuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries {{and the fact that}} Sin would still be reborn. Disappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon. After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to battle Seymour, and Jecht's imprisoned spirit. With Sin's host defeated, Tidus' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon. Sin's cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, who had earlier been revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane. Just then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, {{in a speech to the}} citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> free of Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water. He then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.|$|E
25|$|Widely used {{terminology}} is awkward <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{generally accepted}} that quasars and radio galaxies {{are the same}} objects (see above). The acronym DRAGN (for 'Double Radiosource Associated with Galactic Nucleus') has been coined.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Brightest Day crossover event, Alan lies in the arms of Obsidian, convulsing and writhing as a green light pours from his body. His body possessed, Alan flies off with his JSA teammates in hot pursuit, eventually led the team to Germany. The JSA meet up with Batman's new Justice League and find that Jade, who had been staying on Oa since her resurrection, has returned to Earth inside a green meteor, later revealed to be the legendary Starheart that gave Alan his powers. Sebastian Faust tells the two teams that the Starheart has been gradually taking control of people on Earth for quite some time. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> on Earth, it is growing more powerful and driving metahumans all over the world insane. Jade states that the Starheart captured her in space and purposely brought her to Earth to find Alan and that it is her fault that her father is now in danger. Just then, Alan awakens and his costume transforms into a suit of armor identical to the one he wears in Kingdom Come, and he then tells the assembled heroes that he intends on destroying the world.|$|E

500|$|Leaving for Nomanisan once again, Bob discovers Mirage {{is working}} for Buddy Pine, a disaffected former fan whom Mr. Incredible had {{rejected}} as his sidekick. Having adopted the name Syndrome, he has been perfecting the Omnidroid by hiring different Supers to fight it, adding new features on the rare occasion that a Super wins. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> capable of defeating Bob, Syndrome intends to send the machine {{to the city of}} Metroville; there, he will secretly manipulate its controls to defeat it in public, becoming a hero himself. Later, he will sell his inventions so that everyone will become equally [...] "super", making the term meaningless.|$|E
500|$|Family matters {{also made}} Priestley's time in America difficult. His {{youngest}} son Harry died on December 11, 1795, probably of malaria. Mary Priestley died on September 17, 1796; {{she was already}} ill and never fully recovered after the shock of her son's death. On September 19 of that year Joseph wrote: [...] "This day I bury my wife....she had taken much thought in planning the new house and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> far advanced and promises to be everything she wished, she is removed to another." [...] After dinner on Monday 14 April 1800, various members of Priestley's household fell ill, with symptoms of food poisoning, which prompted the Reading Advertiser to falsely accuse Priestley's son William, of trying to poison them with arsenic.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is more precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find the one person who he believes can answer his questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious than it was before <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas's {{view of a}} Jewish {{plot was}} nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst {{recognizing}} [...] "the Jewish Peril", noted that [...] "Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race". In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to [...] "shift responsibility" [...] on to the Jews. In his Autobiography in 1929 he would write [...] "I feel <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish" [...] , and then indicate the country only had itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{university}} of Western civilization, the University of Bologna, {{is located in}} Italy, where until modern times the only degree granted {{was that of the}} doctorate, and all other Italian universities followed that model. During the 20th century Italian universities introduced more advanced research degrees, such as the Ph.D., and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> part of the E.U. Bologna Process, a new three-year first degree, or [...] "laurea" [...] (equivalent to a B.A. of other countries), has been introduced. The old-style [...] "laurea" [...] is now known as [...] "laurea magistrale/specialistica" [...] (Bologna Process second cycle/ISCED 2011 Level 7). For historical reasons, even to this day, the title of [...] "dottore/dottoressa" [...] (abbrev. both as dott/dott.ssa or as dr./dr.ssa [...] ) is awarded even to those who have studied for a [...] "laurea". Upper levels of degree are anyway shown in the title, as those who obtain a master's degree can be referred to as [...] "dottore/dottoressa magistrale" [...] (masterly doctor) while those who achieve the relatively new program of [...] "dottorato di ricerca" [...] (research doctorate, equivalent of a Ph.D.), carry the title of [...] "dottore/dottoressa di ricerca" [...] (research doctor), which can be abbreviated as [...] "Dott. Ric." [...] or [...] "Ph.D." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Darts initial {{opinion was}} that the {{standard}} of replacement for Hodgetts, who had been reinstated as an amateur, Jones and Farnall– [...] "two or three players who have done well with local clubs have been signed up, and a smart left-wing forward in Kirton, of Lincoln City, has also been secured"– but as the directors preferred to spend their money on ground improvements, {{in the shape of}} the purchase of Aston Villa's old stands from the Perry Barr ground, rather than on [...] "stars", these would be inadequate to return the club to the First Division. Having seen the new additions, they changed their mind. [...] "The Small Heath ground presents quite an imposing appearance <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> adorned with the old Perry Barr grand stand, and as there is now plenty of covered accommodation for spectators the [...] "gates" [...] should materially increase", and though Hodgetts would be missed, Jack Kirton [...] "appears to be a smart player, while the other new men secured are far from being 'duffers'", and apart from Jones and Farnall, [...] "the whole of the other first team players from last season have signed again, and there is no reason why the Heathens should not render a good account of themselves" [...] next season.|$|E

2500|$|Later that year, her {{writings}} on arson attacks in Frankfurt as {{protests against the}} Vietnam War resulted in her developing an acquaintance with the perpetrators, most significantly Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin. She stopped writing for konkret which had in her opinion evolved into a completely commercial magazine {{in the early part}} of 1969, and many other authors followed her. She stated that neither she nor her collaborators wanted to give a left-wing alibi to the magazine, that sooner or later [...] "would become part of the counter-revolution, a thing that I cannot gloss over with my co-operation, especially <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible to deter its course". Later, they organised an occupation at konkrets office (along with several members of the [...] ), to distribute proclamations to the employees, something that failed since Röhl learned about it, and moved the employees to their homes to continue their work from there. Finally, Röhl's house was vandalised by some of the protesters. Meinhof arrived in Röhl's villa at 11:30, after police and journalists had already arrived. She was accused by Röhl (and subsequently described by the media) as the organizer of the vandalism. It was difficult to prove, as she was not there when it happened.|$|E
