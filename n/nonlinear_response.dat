40|$|Alpine tree-line ecotones are {{characterized}} by marked changes at small spatial scales that {{may result in a}} variety of physiognomies. A set of alternative individual-based models was tested with data from four contrasting Pinus uncinata ecotones in the central Spanish Pyrenees to reveal the minimal subset of processes required for tree-line formation. A Bayesian approach combined with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods was employed to obtain the posterior distribution of model parameters, allowing the use of model selection procedures. The main features of real tree lines emerged only in models considering <b>nonlinear</b> <b>responses</b> in individual rates of growth or mortality with respect to the altitudinal gradient. Variation in tree-line physiognomy reflected mainly changes in the relative importance of these <b>nonlinear</b> <b>responses,</b> while other processes, such as dispersal limitation and facilitation, played a secondary role. Different <b>nonlinear</b> <b>responses</b> also determined {{the presence or absence of}} krummholz, in agreement with recent findings highlighting a different response of diffuse and abrupt or krummholz tree lines to climate change.

40|$|In {{the seismic}} design of {{structures}} in Japan, the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>responses</b> are usually estimated using the equal energy assumption or equal displacement assump ion. However, the periodic characteristics of input earthquake motions strongly affect the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>responses</b> of structures {{so that the}} estimation results using equal energy assumption or equal displacement assumption are not always so accurate. In this study, we propose a new estimation method for the elasto-plastic maximum displacement of bridge piers using the natural-period-dependent spectrum intensity (SI). The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated according {{to the results of}} nonlinear dynamic analyses using SDOF models with observed earthquake waves. The natural-period-dependent SI is a mean value of velocity response spectrum in the range corresponding to the target pier. Moreover, it is an index taking account of the prolongation of natural period due o the damage of structures. Therefore, the natural-period-dependent SI has a strong correlation with the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>responses</b> of structures. Consequently, it is found that the elasto-plastic m ximum response displacement can be estimated more accurately using the natural-pe iod-dependent SI than using the equal energy assumption or equal displacement assumption...|$|R
