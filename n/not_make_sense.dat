5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} from what was originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, for Emmanuel Levinas, God is ethics, so one {{is brought}} closer to God when justice is {{rendered}} to the Other.

25|$|A type system {{associates}} a type {{with each}} computed value and, {{by examining the}} flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no type errors can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general {{the aim is to}} prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> (logic errors); memory errors will also be prevented. Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.|$|E
25|$|Stiglitz {{complains}} bitterly {{that the}} IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow {{in order to}} qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.|$|E

The huge, devil-like figure decides to give his power to the Master, and fires electricity at the Doctor to kill him. However, Jo, steps {{in front of the}} Doctor, asking Azal to kill her instead. This act of self-sacrifice does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to Azal, and sends him into a confused rage. The Doctor tells everyone to flee the Church. With Bok also rendered motionless, Azal erupts and the whole Church is blown up. The Master tries to escape but is captured by the UNIT troops and taken away. The Doctor, Jo, Miss Hawthorne and the UNIT team join the villagers in their May Day celebrations.|$|E
25|$|GGYC {{also argued}} that the rules that should apply to the race must be the SNG rules that were in force when GGYC filed its challenge. Otherwise, said GGYC, SNG could {{arbitrarily}} change the rules {{so as to make}} it impossible for the challenger to win. For example, said GGYC, the modified rules could specify that the challenger would have to race while dragging an anchor. According to GGYC, it did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to envisage that the rules could be changed after the challenge was issued, since the challenger based its challenge on SNG's rules {{at the time of the}} challenge. GGYC also challenged certain provisions of the agreement between ISAF and SNG, in particular concerning the powers of the jury.|$|E
25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E

25|$|Early {{stages of}} {{development}} on Mass Effect: Andromeda began in 2012, following the release of Mass Effect 3. One of the first decisions that BioWare made was not to include Commander Shepard, the series' original protagonist, in the game. This strategy allowed them to make changes {{to some of the}} series' traditional gameplay elements, such as the old Paragon/Renegade morality system, which they felt was tied to Shepard and would <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> without the character. Originally, they considered developing a prequel, but decided against it after soliciting feedback from fans, focus groups, and the development team. Instead of preparing for another trilogy, the company tried to avoid locking themselves into a specific plan with regards to future installments in the franchise, which they felt gave them more creative freedom.|$|E
25|$|The third Conservative {{budget was}} tabled on February 26, 2008. The {{government}} announced {{there would be}} little to no new tax breaks as major tax cuts took place in the economic update during the fall of 2007 in anticipation of economic slowdowns in 2008. It was to be the last budget of the Conservative government's first term in office. Among the key announcements was {{the creation of a new}} $5000/year tax-free savings account (TFSA), funding for troubled manufacturing and forestry industries, a new Student Grant Program, higher defense spending, $500 million for transit and infrastructures and $400 million for hiring new police officers. The TFSA was touted as a badly needed addition to the Canadian tax system as it did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for low income earners and seniors to make use of existing savings programs with tax incentives, such as RRSPs. In contrast, the TFSA could be used by such demographics to enjoy savings with tax benefits.|$|E
25|$|Following Secret Wars and the {{restoration}} of Earth-616 prior to the Incursions, Emma Frost is among a small team of X-Men that {{come into contact with}} the Terrigen mists at Muir Island, where they found Jamie Madrox dead on the facility grounds. Discovering that the Terrigen Mist cloud was toxic to mutants Scott and Emma formulate a plan to extinguish one of the Inhumans' Terrigen cloud. And while they are able to hold off the Inhumans just long enough to neutralize the green cloud, Cyclops is apparently killed by Black Bolt in self-defense. However at Scott's funeral, Alex is seen afar speaking to Emma that something does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> leading to Emma filling Alex in on some unrevealed details. Black Bolt did not kill Cyclops, in fact, he never made it out of the facility at Muir Island, as he suffered an immediate reaction to the Terrigen mists, dying in Emma Frost's arms. Since then Emma had been projecting an illusion of him to everyone else as a means of declaring war against the Inhumans in Scott's name.|$|E
