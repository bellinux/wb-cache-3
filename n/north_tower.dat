5|$|Construction of the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> (One World Trade Center) {{began in}} August 1966; {{extensive}} use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process. The first tenants moved into the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> in December 1970.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel to the <b>north</b> <b>tower,</b> {{and the west}} face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} the <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Both the <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> and {{the south}} tower of the Rincon Hill complex bear a {{resemblance}} to The Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago, a building of a similar height to the south tower also designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. The architectural style for both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late-modernist. The three sides of the South Tower facing southeast, northeast, and northwest have a linear glass curtainwall. The <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> has a similar design, except it is shorter and the curved aluminum and glass side faces northeast. Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval-shaped crown housing mechanical equipment.|$|E

5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, which was {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight11 into the northern facade of the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> (Tower1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344people. The <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 local time. Countless {{people in the streets}} of New York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment. Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.|$|E

Those looking to live at the North Shore must be interviewed by the co-op's Board of Directors through a serious screening process.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> {{was scheduled}} to begin construction after summer 2008 and be completed in 2009. Originally, construction was supposed to commence in January 2008. Later, the developer mentioned construction was going start in March, but the construction firm wasn't selected at that time. After March, the developer said construction {{was going to start}} in May 2008. However, following the worldwide financial crisis of the late summer and fall of 2008, the project's developers announced that construction of the second tower was indefinitely on hold. With improving economic conditions in the city, construction started on this tower on October 2012; its first residents moved in August 2014. The <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> was later renamed The Harrison.|$|E
5|$|The three-storey <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> {{is reached}} by a 13th-century {{staircase}} in the hall, which leads onto the first floor. The first floor {{was divided into}} two separate rooms shortly after {{the construction of the}} tower, and contain various decorative tiles, probably from Laurence's house in Ludlow. The walls of the second floor are mostly half-timbered, jettying out above the stone walls beneath them; the tower has its original 13th-century fireplace, although the wooden roof is 19th-century, modeled on the 13th-century original, and the windows are 17th-century insertions. The details and the carpenters' personal marks on the woodwork show that the hall, solar and <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> were all constructed {{under the direction of the}} same carpenter in the late 1280s and early 1290s.|$|E
5|$|Three {{buildings}} in the World Trade Center collapsed due to fire-induced structural failure. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59a.m. after burning for 56minutes in a fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel. The <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed at 10:28a.m. after burning for 102minutes. When the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building (7WTC), damaging it and starting fires. These fires burned for hours, compromising the building's structural integrity, and 7WTC collapsed at 5:21p.m. The {{west side of the}} Pentagon sustained significant damage.|$|E
500|$|The three {{buildings}} that compose the <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers</b> are connected by an indoor, underground arcade with 9 residential units and 7 staff residential rooms.

5|$|At 8:46a.m. (EDT) on September 11, 2001, five hijackers {{affiliated}} with al-Qaeda crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern {{facade of the}} <b>North</b> <b>Tower.</b> Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03a.m. (EDT), a second group of terrorists crashed the hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower, striking between the 77th and 85th floors.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties in {{accurately}} locating Flight 11 {{caused a}} delay of five minutes, to 8:43am, before the scramble order was given and pilots Duffy and Nash could respond. When Flight 11 hit the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> at 8:46, the two jets were still readying for flight {{and did not}} take off until 8:52am.|$|E

500|$|The {{neighborhood}} where the <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers</b> were built was a rural, unnamed section of Flushing, {{part of a}} [...] land grant to Massachusetts settlers. [...] In 1923, the Glen Oaks Golf Club was built, created on [...] purchased from William K. Vanderbilt II's country estate. [...] By 1971, the golf course {{was replaced by the}} <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers.</b> The <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers</b> were constructed in Glen Oaks because of Queens's lax zoning rules, which are less restrictive than those in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in Long Island. Some Glen Oaks residents, mostly single-home dwellers, protested the construction of the <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers</b> because they were afraid it would dominate the horizon. [...] However, it was a highly anticipated [...] "big Queens project" [...] for most New Yorkers.|$|R

5|$|The oldest {{portion of}} the {{existing}} building {{is part of the}} <b>north</b> <b>tower,</b> which was built in the late 14th century. The north aisle, together with the nave and its arcades, dates from the early 15th century, while the south aisle, with its fine hammer-beam roof, was added about 1450. The carved stone font was placed in the church soon afterwards, dating from about 1480.|$|E

5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the <b>North</b> <b>Tower,</b> 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{city hall}} was {{partially}} destroyed. Along {{the northwest corner}} of the building, the exterior wall in its entirely collapsed, while the <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> was destroyed. The bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man who suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E
5|$|After the crash, the <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the long-lasting fire ignited by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} structural failure of the tower. In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed. Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an investment bank on floors 101–105 of the World Trade Center One, lost 658employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer.|$|E
