40|$|In nature, mice live in burrows with nest {{chambers}} {{where they}} breed and may hide from predators. In the laboratory, a shelter or refuge is an easily applicable form of enrichment which may enhance {{the welfare of}} laboratory mice by giving them {{more control over their}} environment. Six <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> made of different materials were evaluated in a preference test with male and female mice of two strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J and BALB/c). In general, mice showed a preference for cages with a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> made of grid metal as compared to clear or white perspex <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> or no <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> They also showed a preference for a cage with a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> of perforated metal as compared to <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> made of grey PVC or sheer metal, or no <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> When offered a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with one open side or a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with two open sides, most mice preferred the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with one open side and were observed to lie in it with their heads directed towards the opening. The results of this study show that <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> may be used for enrichment purposes in caged mice, although it is not yet entirely clear what are the main features influencing the animals' preferences. When providing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> as shelters, the structure and design of this type of enrichment should be taken into account, because these may {{have an effect on the}} social structure of groups of mice...|$|R
40|$|Nest box {{selection}} in the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in Southern Norway was estimated from fieldwork in Trysil Municipality in 2007 and {{by use of}} additional field data from 2005 and 2006. Used versus not used <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> was used as response variables and tested against multiple explanatory variables. Time of hatching also was used as response variable in 2007, where early arrivals were hypothesized to select the best <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> or the best habitats. Microhabitat analyses within a 0. 1 ha quadrate around the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> and macrohabitat analyses outside this quadrate gave "general preference" over time, "year effect" preference and "early arrival" preference. Kestrels generally selected <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in open, flat habitats such as bogs and falling areas where there were not too many competing pairs nearby. Differences in vole numbers between years resulted in year effect when voles were scarce. Kestrels selected <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> {{in close proximity to}} developed areas in 2005 when voles were scarce, probably because of higher density of alternative prey, such as birds, lizards and insects. Neither <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> size nor construction was important for <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> selection, but kestrels seemed to prefer boxes where the entrance hole was not too big. Some degree of cover around the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> tree, measured as number of trees around the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> also seemed to matter. In addition, south facing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were selected earlier than others. I recommend using time of hatching in addition to <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use as response variable in further studies on <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> selection by kestrels. The thesis was supported by the Directorate for Nature Management...|$|R

40|$|Nest {{boxes are}} {{frequently}} used in conservation programs for tree-cavity dependent wildlife. There is growing {{concern that the}} poor insulation properties of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> may produce an ecological trap, because species may require microclimates less extreme or less variable than those experienced inside <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> I investigated the fitness consequences of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use in a non-flying mammal. Fifty-two of 104 squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) trapped over a 3 -year period used <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Population modelling of the capture data revealed that the probability of apparent survival increased with increasing <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use. There {{was no difference in}} breeding frequency between females that used or did not use <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> There was no evidence that offspring development was hindered within <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> These findings may arise because: (1) gliders could access tree hollows during extreme temperatures, (2) ambient temperatures were mild during the study, (3) gliders construct leaf nests which insulate against low temperatures in winter, and (4) gliders breed between autumn and spring when temperatures are relatively benign. The estimate of annual survival of animals using <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (0. 60), was equivalent to estimates at locations where squirrel gliders were either reliant on <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (0. 54) or on tree cavities (0. 55) for shelter. Studies such as this need to be conducted on a range of species across a range of locations to better understand the influence of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use on non-flying mammals...|$|R

Nest box construction material, colour (brown or green) and volume (0. 008 m 3 or 0. 025 m 3) had variable influences on temperature. Nest box installations for non-flying mammals should place <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> to minimise extreme temperatures.

40|$|Biodiversity {{offsetting}} {{is widely}} applied but its effectiveness is rarely assessed. We evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> program intended to offset clearing of hollow-bearing trees associated with a freeway upgrade in southern Australia. The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in nearby woodland (1 : 1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (0 - 0. 76 % of accessible <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> by the squirrel glider (0 - 2. 1 % of accessible <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> used per survey period). Rates of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations. Low levels of use by target species coupled with the extent of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> attrition suggest the offset program will not have counterbalanced the loss of the hollow-bearing trees. We make suggestions for improving future offset programs including a greater emphasis on: (1) avoiding impacts on hollow-bearing trees; (2) offset effectiveness as a measure of compliance; and (3) using realistic offset ratios...|$|R
40|$|House sparrow (Passer domesti-cus) nesting {{activities}} {{cause problems}} {{in and around}} structures and in <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> intended for other species. Previous {{studies have shown that}} house sparrows are selectively repelled from feeding sites by monofilament lines spaced 30 or 60 cm apart. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine house spar-row response to lines spaced about 37 cm apart around <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> One hundred forty-six <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were installed, with lines randomly assigned to 73 <b>boxes.</b> All <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were checked approximately every 5 days for nest materials, eggs, nestlings, and fledglings. Successful clutches were record-ed for nests that fledged at least one bird. Results indicated no difference between the numbers of treated and control <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> that had <b>nest</b> materials (70 control, 66 treat-ed), but onset of the first set of clutches was earlier (- 13 days) in control than in treated <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). In addition, there were more control <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> with eggs present (51 control, 34 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and more control <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> with at least 1 (39 control, 21 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) or 2 (24 con-trol, 6 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) successful clutches. Although, monofilament lines do not repel house sparrows from <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> as they do from feeding sites, they do appear to reduce the number of clutches and fledglings. Still unclear is whether differences noted resulted directly from line interference with the nesting process or indirectly from some other factor such as age or experience of birds occupying the treated <b>nest</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} habitat fragmentation {{on the use of}} nest site resources by a secondary cavity-nesting bird species, the great tit (Parus major), we placed 443 artificial <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> on 21 islands in Thousand Island Lake from February to August 2008. Among the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> 72 (16. 3 %) were used by great tits. We analyzed the relationships between island area, island isolation, predator activity, vegetation cover and <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> orientation and the use of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> by great tits. Great tits preferred <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> with lowerpredator activity, lower vegetation cover, and an eastern or southern orientation. Island area and isolation did not affect the use of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> directly, but island area indirectly influenced the use of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> by affecting predator activity. Our results suggest that attention should be paid to environmental variables that directly affect the use of nest site resources by great tits.

40|$|The use of {{artificial}} <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> {{has led to}} significant progress in bird conservation and {{in our understanding of}} the functional and evolutionary ecology of free-ranging birds that exploit cavities for roosting and reproduction. Nest boxes and their improved accessibility have made it easier to perform comparative and experimental field investigations. However, concerns about the generality and applicability of scientific studies involving birds breeding in <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> have been raised because the occupants of boxes may differ from conspecifics occupying other nest sites. Here, we review the existing evidence demonstrating the importance of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> design to individual life-history traits in three falcon (Falconiformes) and seven owl (Strigiformes) species, as well as the extent to which publications on these birds describe the characteristics of exploited artificial <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in their "Methods" sections. More than 60 % of recent publications did not provide any details on <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> design (e. g. size, shape, material), despite several calls > 15 years ago to increase the reporting of such information.

40|$|We placed and {{monitored}} 2, 137 <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> {{to determine how}} the size of the entrance hole andthe <b>box</b> placement influenced <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> selection by secondary cavity-nesting birds and to derive recommendationsfor the use of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> for management of cavity-nesting birds in forested environments. A total of 566 pairs of seven bird species used the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> from 1997 to 2006, 562 of which were secondarycavity-nesters. Sympatric tits such as varied tits (Parus varius), great tits (P. major), and marsh tits (P. palustris) were common breeding birds in <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> and showed clear preferences for 4. 0 cm, 3. 5 cm and 3. 0 cm nestholes, respectively. Tree sparrows (Passer montanus) and Eurasian nuthatches (Sitta europaea) preferred 4 cmand 3. 5 cm holes, respectively. We did not detect selection for the directional orientation for the entrance hole,but the birds appeared to avoid <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> that faced steep or gentle upward slopes and those less than 1. 8 m from the ground. These results are probably related to avoidance of disturbance and predation. We suggestthat diverse species can be supported by the placement of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> with entrance holes of various sizes andthat specific species can be targeted by selecting the hole sizes preferred by those species.

50|$|Bluebirds are {{territorial}} and prefer {{open grassland}} with scattered trees. This {{is similar to}} the behaviour of many species of woodpecker. Bluebirds can typically produce between two and four broods during the spring and summer (March through August in the Northeastern United States). Males identify potential nest sites and try to attract prospective female mates to those nesting sites with special behaviors that include singing and flapping wings, and then placing some material in a <b>nesting</b> <b>box</b> or cavity. If the female accepts the male and the nesting site, she alone builds the nest and incubates the eggs.|$|E

50|$|The {{population}} of the wood duck was in serious decline in the late 19th century {{as a result of}} severe habitat loss and market hunting both for meat and plumage for the ladies' hat market in Europe. By the beginning of the 20th century, wood ducks had virtually disappeared from much of their former range. In response to the Migratory Bird Treaty established in 1916 and enactment of the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, wood duck populations began to recover slowly. By ending unregulated hunting and taking measures to protect remaining habitat, wood duck populations began to rebound in the 1920s.

It uses no nesting material and a clutch of normally seven to ten eggs is laid (occasionally five, six, eleven or twelve). The eggs average 20.8 x 15.4 mm and weigh about 0.2 g. They are a dull white colour and partially opaque. Both sexes are involved in incubation which takes twelve days, but the female plays the greater part. Both parents feed the chicks for about twenty days before they fledge. There is usually a single brood.|$|E

Sixteen pairs Great tits were bred in the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> so this species was the most dominant breeder and followed by Coal Tit three pairs, Varied Tit three pairs, Tree Sparrow two pairs and Yellow-rumped Flycatcher two pairs. The using rate of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> was 28. 2 % (11 out of 39) and 38. 5 % (15 out of 39) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Thus, the using rate was increased in 2004. Birds were using only A-type <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> so the using rate of A-type was 68. 0 % (17 out of 25) while none of bird used B-type (0 out of 14).
