5|$|Although three launch battalions {{were formed}} by the Germans in late 1943, they <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance to deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the Oberkommando West {{authorised}} the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker {{to make it a}} LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.|$|E
5|$|Believing Mercer to {{have been}} captured, General Currie assumed command of the battle and {{with the use of}} {{saturation}} bombardment was able to retake the lost trenches and drive the Germans back to Mount Sorrel despite heavy casualties. On the 21 June a Canadian burial party found 30 bodies in a sector of trench, amongst them General Mercer's remains, only recognisable by his uniform decoration. Mercer was buried in a military grave at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery, later surmounted with a Commonwealth War Grave headstone. Mercer's funeral was attended by many men of his Division and from his old regiments as well as numerous Canadian and British officers who had worked alongside him. Mercer was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his courage under fire, the third time he had been so mentioned, and his division was taken over by Major-General Louis Lipsett who was himself killed in action two years later. Mercer is remembered as an efficient and capable organiser who <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to demonstrate the tactical nous he had shown in training and exercises. He also remains the highest ranking Canadian officer to ever be killed in combat and reportedly by friendly fire.|$|E

25|$|The NASL brought {{suit against}} the NFL, arguing that its {{restrictions}} on cross-ownership were an unfair trade practice to deny other sports and leagues full access to the pool of experienced franchise owners. After losing in district court, it won on appeal but by then was in desperate straits, and folded two years later. The NFL's ownership policies were slightly modified; Rozelle <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> full limitations he wanted.|$|E
25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E

25|$|Early wickets and few runs {{early on}} meant that Warwickshire Bears posted 187 for 8 {{at their home}} ground, Edgbaston. Australian Brad Williams took two wickets for the Durham Dynamos, as Warwickshire lost their first four wickets for 43, and despite a run-a-ball 48 from number 8 Dougie Brown, Warwickshire <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> run rate up above 4.5 an over. Durham lost Gordon Muchall for 3, but half-centuries from Australian Jimmy Maher and England all-rounder Paul Collingwood put Durham to a score of 135 for 2, and Durham passed the revised target of 154 with 17 balls to spare.|$|E

25|$|The 1894 English cricket season saw a close battle {{play out}} for the County Championship title between Surrey and last year's champions Yorkshire. Before the round of 23 August, the two teams were tied on 10 points, with one match left to play and all other teams hopelessly distanced. Yorkshire {{travelled}} to Taunton in Somerset, and after the first day was rained off, Somerset had to bat on a rain-affected pitch. George Herbert Hirst took seven for 32 as Somerset fell to 99, but Yorkshire <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance to reply as the third day was rained off. Meanwhile, in Sussex, Tom Richardson and Bill Lockwood roared through the hosts' batting line-up, bowling them out for 44 and 109 and securing Surrey victory by an innings and 15 runs – and the Championship title.|$|E

25|$|An {{attempt was}} made in the 1870s to {{introduce}} academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholm Nation acquired a rowing boat in 1877, soon followed by the Gothenburg Nation, and {{for a number of years}} rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24–23 in Uppsala's favor.|$|E
25|$|Although the Animal Bioscience Building was {{the first}} {{building}} constructed during Cruzado's tenure, it was one she {{had little to do}} with. In 1997, the Montana Land Board sued MSU, arguing that the university sold at below-market value or used for non-intended purposes land bequeathed to the university by Bozeman area farmers and ranchers. In 1999, the Land Board reached a settlement with MSU which, in part, required the university to set aside $3 million by 2005 to build a livestock research center. More than $13 million was earmarked by Congress {{over the next few years}} to build the structure. Additional fundraising also occurred, and more than 141 individuals gave more than $10,000 each to fund construction of the new center. The Wanke family of Rudyard, Montana, gave $2.7 million in honor of Harold Wanke (who always wanted to be a veterinarian but <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance). Construction began on the , $15.7 million building in 2008, and was complete in November 2010.|$|E
25|$|Henry and Emma {{return to}} Regina's cave. Emma asks {{to speak with}} Regina alone, and tells {{her that if she}} tells Robin the truth about how she feels, {{everything}} will be fixed and they can both get their happy endings with the men they love, acknowledging that she herself <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance to tell Hook how she really felt before it was too late. The trio arrive at the chapel to stop the wedding, but before they can do so, Rumple suddenly appears to stop them. Emma and Henry try to distract Rumple as Regina tries to work up the nerve to interrupt the ceremony. Emma engages Rumple in a sword fight, until he is able to knock her out temporarily. He then aims his sword at Henry, but Regina jumps in front of him just in time to take the hit herself, opting to save Henry instead of pursuing Robin. Moments later, Robin and Zelena exit the chapel and Robin rushes to Regina's side as Zelena's envy starts to take over, causing her to start turning green. Robin tells Regina that she won't have to die alone.|$|E

500|$|Working with {{a budget}} of $200,000, Dassin could not afford top stars for the film. To carry the lead role, Dassin {{selected}} Jean Servais, an actor whose career had slumped due to alcoholism. For Italian gangster Mario Ferrati, Dassin cast Robert Manuel after seeing him perform a comic role {{as a member of}} Comédie-Française. After a suggestion made by the wife of the film's producer, Dassin cast Carl Möhner as Jo the Swede. Dassin would use Möhner again in his next film He Who Must Die. Dassin himself played the role of the Italian safecracker César the Milanese. Dassin explained {{in an interview that he}} [...] "had cast a very good actor in Italy, whose name escapes me, but he <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> contract!...So I had to put on the mustache and do the part myself".|$|E

2500|$|The BDL {{met with}} some successes and some failures. [...] After several years they {{brought down the}} Caprivi {{government}} over the question of tariffs.

The BDL was particularly effective on small issues, where the Reichstag members were less committed to their constituencies, such as forbidding yellowing of margarine and stiff restrictions on brandy and sugar imports.
