A side effect of <b>nicarbazin,</b> a veterinary drug used to control coccidiosis in chickens, is decreased egg production and hatching. Exploiting this side effect, studies of <b>nicarbazin</b> for reducing the hatchability of eggs from Canada geese were conducted.

DNC residues in liver samples of broilers scheduled as being withdrawn from <b>nicarbazin</b> for ≥ 6 days ranged from 20 to > 1600 μg/kg (the specified withdrawal period for <b>nicarbazin</b> is 5 days and the JECFA MRL is 200 μg/kg liver). Further on-farm investigations on 12 of these flocks, {{selected on the basis}} of the feeding system in use and the levels of DNC residues determined in liver, identified issues in feed management contributing to elevated residues in broiler liver. A significant correlation (0. 81, p < 0. 01, n = 10) between DNC residues in liver samples and in feed samples from the feeding pans was observed. The second investigation on 12 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for DNC in liver samples and feed samples from feeding pans and from the feed mill at the three thinnings of birds for commercial slaughter. In the case of one flock, a clear relationship between <b>nicarbazin</b> in feed from the feed mill (10. 5 mg/kg DNC), in feed from the feeding pans (6. 6 mg/kg DNC) and in liver (583 μg/kg DNC) at first thinning (9 days scheduled withdrawal from <b>nicarbazin)</b> was observed.

40|$|<b>Nicarbazin</b> (NCZ) is an {{anticoccidial}} drug routinely used in {{the poultry}} industry that can negatively affect reproduction by reducing egg production, egg weight, and egg hatchability. The molecular mechanisms by which NCZ affects reproduction are unknown. Lipoprotein lipase, vitellogenin, transglutaminase, and calcium are all involved in egg formation and embryogenesis. Therefore, in vitro assays were used to evaluate 4 potential mechanisms of action of NCZ on egg formation and embryogenesis. First, a lipoprotein lipase assay was conducted to determine if NCZ increases lipoprotein lipase activity. Second, vitellogenin phosphorylation was evaluated to determine if NCZ acts as a vitellogenin phosphatase. Third, transglutaminase activity was measured to determine if NCZ inhibits transglutaminase activity. Finally, bull sperm {{was used as a}} model to determine if specific channel-mediated calcium uptake can be blocked by NCZ. <b>Nicarbazin</b> increased the activity of lipoprotein lipase in vitro at 3. 9 and 7. 8 μg of NCZ/mL. <b>Nicarbazin</b> increased intracellular calcium levels in bull sperm, suggesting it also acts as a calcium ionophore.

We monitored movement, habitat use, and nesting of 51 resident Canada geese, all adult females, at Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary (BBWS), Green Bay, Wisconsin, during 2001 and 2002. Our objective was to determine if geese were sufficiently sedentary during the nest initiation period to allow effective dosage with <b>nicarbazin</b> to assess its potential as a management tool.

Decreased egg production occurred from Days 5 and 6 of the treatment through Days 1 and 2 of withdrawal. On Days 9 and 10 of treatment, the control hens peaked at 92 % hen-day production, while hens fed 20, 50, and 100 ppm of NCZ peaked late-at 90, 82, and 80 %, respectively. Compared to the controls, egg weight was reduced linearly as the level of dietary NCZ increased. The egg-yolk DNC level increased from Days 3 and 4 of treatment through Days 9 and i 0 of withdrawal. Egg yolk mottling generally increased along with the level and duration of feeding NCZ. If the NCZ was mistakenly fed to White Leghorn layers, ill effects would be alleviated within 10 days after drug withdrawal. In Experiment 2, halofuginone (3 ppm), maduramicin (5 ppm), monensin (100 ppm), narasin (70 ppm), <b>nicarbazin</b> (125 ppm), robenidine (33 ppm), and salinomycin (60 ppm) were fed to White Leghorn hens at the levels specified in parentheses. <b>Nicarbazin</b> reduced egg production, depressed egg weight, reduced shell thickness, and caused egg-yolk mottling; but internal egg quality, as measured by Haugh Units, was unaffected. Halofuginone, maduramicin, monensin, narasin, robenidine, and salinomycin did not have a meaningful effect on the variables measured when fed to White Leghorn layers. {Key words: layers, egg quality, mottling, coccidiostats...|$|E
40|$|TH E {{appearance}} of an abnormality in eggs, {{referred to as}} mottled yolks, has been recognized for many years, but little is known of its incidence in eggs from farm flocks. The mottled condition observed on egg yolks {{has been described as}} transparent, orange-yellow, oily ap-pearing spots which appear {{on the surface of the}} yolks. Almquist (1933) observed mottled yolks in eggs from hens fed cottonseed meal in their diet. Yolks from newly-laid eggs appeared normal bu t the incidence and degree of mottling increased during stor-age. Since mottled yolks contained more water, more egg white protein and a higher protein-fat ratio than normal eggs, he concluded that mottled yolks were caused by diffusion of egg white protein into the yolk because the vitelline mem-brane was more permeable than that of normal eggs. Polin et al. (1956) reported the presence of mottled yolks in eggs from hens fed <b>Nicarbazin</b> 3 (equimolecular complex of 4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) and 2 -hy-droxy- 4, 6 -dimethylpyrimidine). No sig-nificant increase in the occurrence of mottled yolks was shown until the level of <b>Nicarbazin</b> in the ration was increased t...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryLeland McKinneyCarryover of {{medicated}} feed additives between batches of feed can potentially result in harmful drug residues in the edible tissues of food-animals. Flushing the equipment with an ingredient, such as ground grain, is one method used {{to remove any}} residual {{medicated feed}} from the system. It is generally recommended that the quantity of flush used be between 5 and 10 % of the mixer's capacity. However, there is little data that supports this recommendation. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to 1.) determine which manufacturing equipment is {{the major source of}} carryover, 2.) evaluate which flush size adequately prevents drug carryover, and 3.) quantify the interrelationship between flush size and drug concentration. In Experiment 1, feed medicated with <b>nicarbazin</b> (Nicarb 25 %®; 0. 0125 %) was manufactured and conveyed from the mixer, through a drag conveyor and bucket elevator, and then into a finished product bin. The system was then flushed using ground corn in the amount of 2. 5, 5, 10, 15, or 20 % of the mixer's capacity (454. 5 kg). Subsequently, a non-medicated diet was conveyed through the system and samples were collected and analyzed for <b>nicarbazin.</b> No significant (P > 0. 05) differences were detected among the flush treatments, and all treatments were effective in preventing <b>nicarbazin</b> carryover to the non-medicated diet. In Experiment 2, feed medicated with three levels of monensin (Rumensin® 80; 100, 600, and 1, 200 g/ton) was manufactured and handled {{in the same manner as}} in Experiment 1. The flushing treatments examined were: 1, 2. 5, and 5 % of the mixer's capacity. Samples of the non-medicated diet for each treatment were collected and analyzed for monensin. There was significant interaction (P < 0. 05) between drug level and sampling location between treatments. As the drug level in the medicated diet increased, higher concentrations of monensin were detected in the non-medicated diet. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that a 2. 5 %, even a 1 % flush size, is effective in preventing carryover of medicated feed additives. It was also demonstrated that the bucket elevator and finished product bin were the major sources of drug carryover in this particular feed manufacturing system...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Nicarbazin</b> (NCZ), a {{coccidiostat}} com-monly used in {{the poultry}} industry, causes reduced hatchability and egg quality in layer hens at a concentra-tion of 125 ppm (8. 4 mg/kg) in the feed. Although this effect is undesirable in the poultry industry, NCZ could provide a usefulwildlife contraception tool forwaterfowl, particularly urban geese. We tested the absorption of NCZ in chickens (Gallus gallus), mallards (Anas platy-rhynchos), and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) gavaged with 8. 4 mg of NCZ/kg per bird each day for 8 d.

40|$|Coccidiostats are {{authorized}} in the European Union (EU) {{to be used}} as {{poultry feed}} additives. Maximum (residue) levels (M(R) Ls) have been set within the EU for consumer and animal protection against unintended carry-over, and monitoring is compulsory. This paper describes the single-laboratory validation of a previously developed multiplex flow cytometric immunoassay (FCIA) as screening method for coccidiostats in eggs and feed and provides and compares different approaches for the calculation of the cut-off levels which are not described in detail within Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. Comparable results were obtained between the statistical (reference) approach and the rapid approaches. With the most rapid approach, the cut-off levels for narasin/salinomycin, lasalocid, diclazuril, <b>nicarbazin</b> (DNC) and monensin in egg, calculated as percentages of inhibition (%B/B 0), were 60, 32, 76, 80 and 84, respectively. In feed, the cut-off levels for narasin/salinomycin, lasalocid, <b>nicarbazin</b> (DNC) and monensin were 70, 64, 72 and 78, respectively, and could not be determined for diclazuril. For all analytes, except for diclazuril in feed, the rate of false positives (false non-compliant) in blank samples was lower than 1 %, and the rate of false negatives (false compliant) at the M(R) Ls was below 5 %. Additionally, very good correlations (r ranging from 0. 994 to 0. 9994) were observed between two different analysers, a sophisticated flow cytometer (FlexMAP 3 D®) and a more cost-efficient and transportable planar imaging detector (MAGPIX®), hence demonstrating adequate transferability...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In vivo and {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} an effort to elucidate the mechanism of suppression by halofuginone of skin strength in broilers. In the in vivo study, halofuginone was included at concentrations of 0, 1. 5, 3, and 6 mg/kg of diet, corresponding to 0, 50, 100, and 200 %, respectively, of the amount recommended for use as a coccidiostat. Each dietary treatment was given to 260 female broiler day-old chickens. Skin tearing was evaluated at the processing plant Skin collagen and Kjeldahl-nitrogen were determined chemically. At the age of 7 wk, BW and feed efficiency were affected only in birds consuming the diet containing the highest concentration of the drug. Skin tearing increased but skin collagen concentration decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Fibroblasts were obtained by collagenase digestion from chicken skin and cultured. The cultured cells were incubated with various concentrations of halofuginone, monensin, and <b>nicarbazin,</b> and [TTIproline incorporation was evaluated in coUagenase-digestible (representing mostly collagen) and nondigesnble proteins exported by the cells into the medium. Halofuginone, at a concentration as low as 10 - 1 1 M, inhibited incorporation of [3 H]proline into collagenase-digestible proteins, but did not affect incorporation of [3 H]proline into collagenase-nondigestihle proteins. Even at concentrations as high as 10 " 9 hi, neither monensin nor <b>nicarbazin</b> affected collagenase-digestible proteins. The in vitro results suggest that halofugi-none specifically inhibits collagen synthesis by skin fibroblasts. Results of both in vivo and in vitro trials suggest that the increase of skin tearing during processing, induced by halofuginone, is caused by direct suppression of skin collagen synthesis.
