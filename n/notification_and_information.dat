40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present {{the concept of}} {{context-aware}} Emergency Notification and Rescue Service (ENRS) utilizing user information from the 4 G EPC network. The 4 G EPC is an all IP next generation architecture that {{makes it easy for}} various 3 GPP and non- 3 GPP standards to co-exist and provide network access to the end user. The proposed architecture consists of two parts; first part is emergency <b>notification</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> gathering to use for the event notification. The second part consists of an intelligent context-aware decision engine that processes the collected information in real time and generates notification messages for the end user. Our proposed service is based on the RESTful concepts and can be used to effectively notify and help users during the emergency. Currently a prototype of the service is being developed to validate the ENRS...|$|E
40|$|Data breach {{notification}} {{laws have}} detailed numerous failures {{relating to the}} protection of personal information that have blighted both corporate and governmental institutions. There are obvious parallels between data breach <b>notification</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> privacy law as they both involve the protection of personal information. However, a closer examination of both laws reveals conceptual differences that give rise to vertical tensions between each law and shared horizontal weaknesses within both laws. Tensions emanate from conflicting approaches to the implementation of information privacy law that results in different regimes and the implementation of different types of protections. Shared weaknesses arise from an overt focus on specified types of personal information which results in ‘one size fits all’ legal remedies. The author contends that a greater contextual approach which promotes the importance of social context is required and highlights the effect that contextualization could have on both laws...|$|E

Attention is also paid to the tasks of OSPOD, NZDM and the role of entrusted persons in the system. The practical part is focused on three main topics. 1) Do the NZDMs have an authorisation to perform social and legal protection of children (and advantages and disadvantages associated with it) ? 2) What is the role of NZDM in the system of Child protection (With what clients they work? How can NZDMs help their clients?

Based {{on the outcome of}} the evaluation a Best Practice Model for WTO SPS <b>notification</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> management was develop to improve WTO SPS compliance for South Africa Phytosanitary capacities of regulatory systems are challenged with increased global agricultural trade and a proliferation of international and regional phytosanitary standards. International Standards for Phytosanitary measures (ISPMs) are developed by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). The concept of phytosanitary capacity was analysed and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) Phytosanitary Capacity Evaluation (PCE) tool evaluated in terms of its scope, purpose and usefulness. South Africa has attempted to address some of its phytosanitary capacity challenges system and organisational challenges by restructuring and strengthening the capacity of its National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) {{in order to meet the}} demands of international phytosanitary obligations and commitments. This study evaluates the phytosanitary capacity of South Africa and uses the IPPC Phytosanitary Capacity Evaluation (PCE) tool to identify and assess the current constraints impacting on the capacity. Based on the outcome of the PCE recommendations to address information management and capacity constraints are made. The study the used the IPPC Phytosanitary Capacity Evaluation (PCE) tool to evaluate phytosanitary regulatory capacity constraints impacting on the phytosanitary capacity of Malawi. The results from the PCE for Malawi was compared with the results obtained from the PCE for South Africa. The results highlighted the different levels of phytosanitary capacity between a developing country such as South Africa and a Least Developed Country such as Malawi and made recommendations to address the country specific constraints.

40|$|National audienceContent {{syndication}} {{has become}} a popular mean for timely delivery of frequently updated information on the Web. It essentially enhances traditional pull-oriented searching and browsing of web pages with push-oriented protocols. In such paradigm, publishers deliver brief information summaries on the Web, called news items, while information consumers subscribe {{to a number of}} feeds seen as <b>information</b> channels <b>and</b> get informed about the addition of recent items. However, many Web syndication applications imply a tight coupling between feed producers with consumers, and, they do not help users finding news items with interesting content. This demonstration shows a prototype which integrates the whole processus of thin filtering steps on numerous RSS feeds in memory, based on keyword-based subscriptions. Our system proposes to notify items related to set of keywords either by broad-match semantic, partial matching and a diversity/novelty filtering.

The study's aim was to estimate {{the incidence}} of bacterial meningitis by aetiological agent in the period 2001 – 2005, in Lazio Italy (5. 3 mln inhabitants). Methods: Data collected from four sources – hospital surveillance of bacterial meningitis, laboratory information system, the mandatory infectious diseases <b>notifications,</b> <b>and</b> hospital <b>information</b> system – were combined into a single archive. Results: 944 cases were reported, 89 % were classified as community acquired. S. pneumoniae was the most frequent aetiological agent in Lazio, followed by N. meningitis. Incidence of H. influenzae decreased during the period. 17 % of the cases had an unknown aetiology and 13 % unspecified bacteria. The overall incidence was 3. 7 / 100, 000. Children under 1 year were most affected (50. 3 / 100. 000), followed by 1 – 4 year olds (12. 5 / 100, 000). The percentage of meningitis due to aetiological agents included in the vaccine targets, not considering age, is 31 %.

40|$|Thermal {{stimulation}} is a rich, emotive and salient {{feedback channel}} that {{is suitable for}} mobile HCI. It can act as an alternative non-visual notification channel for mobile situations that are too bumpy or noisy for vibrotactile and audio feedback. It can augment both visual and non-visual feedback to add an extra richness to the interaction experience. In addition, thermal output is entirely private, so it is suitable for quiet environments or when secrecy is important. This demonstration will consist of some example applications which highlight a variety of uses. We show an application titled "Tempera-tour", where environmental temperatures {{from around the world}} can be felt. We also show thermal augmentation of visual and audio media as a means of influencing hedonic experience.

40|$|A {{real time}} {{dashboard}} {{was developed in}} order to inform <b>and</b> present users <b>notifications</b> <b>and</b> integrated <b>information</b> regarding airport surface operations. The dashboard is a supplement to capabilities and tools that incorporate arrival, departure, and surface air-traffic operations concepts in a NextGen environment. As trajectory-based departure scheduling and collaborative decision making tools are introduced {{in order to reduce}} delays and uncertainties in taxi and climb operations across the National Airspace System, users across a number of roles benefit from a real time system that enables common situational awareness. In addition to shared situational awareness the dashboard offers the ability to compute real time metrics and analysis to inform users about capacity, predictability, and efficiency of the system as a whole. This paper describes the architecture of the real time dashboard as well as an initial set of metrics computed on operational data. The potential impact of the real time dashboard is studied at the site identified for initial deployment and demonstration in 2017; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. Analysis and metrics computed in real time illustrate the opportunity to provide common situational awareness and inform users of metrics across delay, throughput, taxi time, and airport capacity. In addition, common awareness of delays and the impact of takeoff and departure restrictions stemming from traffic flow management initiatives are explored. The potential of the real time tool to inform the predictability and efficiency of using a trajectory-based departure scheduling system is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Congenital ocular {{anomalies}} {{contribute significantly}} to childhood visual morbidity, with congenital cataract being {{a major cause of}} visual impairment throughout the world. As in many other countries, a National Congenital Anomaly System (NCAS) exists in England and Wales to monitor the frequency of ocular and other anomalies in order to identify new public health hazards and inform aetiological research. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess level of ascertainment by the NCAS of children with congenital cataract.  METHODS—Using independent ophthalmic and paediatric national active surveillance schemes, all infants (⩽ 1 year) newly diagnosed with congenital and infantile cataract in England and Wales in 1  year from September 1995  were identified. These notifications were compared with those made independently to the NCAS during the same period. The proportion of cases identified by the active surveillance schemes and also notified to the NCAS was determined.  RESULTS— 10 % (15 / 149) of eligible children with newly diagnosed congenital or infantile cataract were actually notified to the NCAS. A higher proportion of those diagnosed as neonates (16 %, 14 / 85) than in later infancy (2 %, 1 / 64) was ascertained through the NCAS. There is a need for better verification of <b>notifications</b> <b>and</b> reported <b>information</b> in the NCAS.  CONCLUSION—Currently, ascertainment of congenital cataract through the NCAS is low and the system is likely to be insensitive to small but important changes in risk factors for this disorder. This limits its use for monitoring secular and other trends in ocular anomalies. Strategies to improve its future use are discussed, including enhancing the awareness and participation of ophthalmic professionals involved in managing children with anomalies. ...|$|R
