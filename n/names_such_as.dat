5|$|London's vast {{urban area}} is often {{described}} using a set of district <b>names,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel.

5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter.

5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade <b>names</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{concerns}} for secrecy kept the military designation of the Katyushas from being {{known by the}} soldiers who operated them. They were called by code <b>names</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Kostikov guns, after {{the head of the}} RNII, the Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute, and finally classed as Guards Mortars. The name BM-13 was only allowed into secret documents in 1942, and remained classified until after the war.|$|E

5|$|The Latin {{specific}} name pennanti {{is named for}} Thomas Pennant, who described the fisher in 1771. Buffon had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a pekan. Pennant examined the same specimen but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar <b>names,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Schreber, who named it Mustela canadensis, and Boddaert, who named it Mustela melanorhyncha. The fisher was eventually placed in the genus Martes by Smith in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines {{was named}} in honor of King PhilipII of Spain. Spanish {{explorer}} Ruy López de Villalobos, during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then-Prince of Asturias. Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other <b>names</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Islas del Poniente (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.|$|E

Since 2011, certain storms have official <b>names,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Subtropical Storm Arani. At least one storm has formed near the West Coast of Africa.|$|E

5|$|The boyars, {{members of}} the landed nobility, formed the most {{important}} social group in the principality. The {{vast majority of the}} population was formed by peasants who were called several <b>names,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> vecini ("neighbors") or rumâni ("Romanians"), in medieval documents. In this period, animals, especially sheep, remained the main item of export, but from the Wallachian Plain great quantities of grain were transported to the Mediterranean area. The basis of the peasants' diet was formed by millet eaten as porridge, while the boyars also used wheat.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} taxonomic order, Coleoptera, {{comes from}} the Greek koleopteros (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, {{hardened}} shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing. The English name beetle comes from the Old English word bitela, little biter, related to bītan (to bite), leading to Middle English betylle. Another Old English name for beetle is ceafor, chafer, used in <b>names</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cockchafer, from the Proto-Germanic *kabraz- (compare German Käfer).|$|E
5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific <b>names,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the Little Ice Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their <b>names</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
5|$|Following the conquest, many Anglo-Saxons, {{including}} {{groups of}} nobles, {{fled the country}} for Scotland, Ireland, or Scandinavia. Members of King Harold Godwinson's family sought refuge in Ireland and used their bases in that country for unsuccessful invasions of England. The largest single exodus occurred in the 1070s, {{when a group of}} Anglo-Saxons in a fleet of 235 ships sailed for the Byzantine Empire. The empire became a popular destination for many English nobles and soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries. The English became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, until then a largely Scandinavian unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn. Some of the English migrants were settled in Byzantine frontier regions on the Black Sea coast, and established towns with <b>names</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> New London and New York.|$|E
5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood <b>names</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E
