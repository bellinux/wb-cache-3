40|$|BACKGROUND: Di-(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP) {{has been}} widely used in polyvinyl chloride products and is ubiquitous in developed countries. Although maternal exposure to DEHP during fetal and/or <b>neonatal</b> <b>periods</b> reportedly affects reproductive and developmental systems, its effects on allergic diseases in offspring remain to be determined. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we examined whether maternal exposure to DEHP during fetal and/or <b>neonatal</b> <b>periods</b> in NC/Nga mice affects atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions related to mite allergen in offspring. METHODS: We administered DEHP at a dose of 0, 0. 8, 4, 20, or 100 µg/animal/week by intraperitoneal injection into dams during pregnancy (gestation days 0, 7, and 14) and/or lactation (postnatal days 1, 8, and 15). Eight-week-old male offspring of these treated females were injected intradermally with mite allergen into their right ears. We then evaluated clinical scores, ear thickening, histologic findings, and protein expression of eotaxin in the ear. RESULTS: Maternal exposure to a 100 -µg dose of DEHP during <b>neonatal</b> <b>periods,</b> but not during fetal periods, enhanced atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions related to mite allergen in males. The results were concomitant with the enhancement of eosinophilic inflammation, mast cell degranulation, and protein expression of eotaxin in overall trend. CONCLUSION: Maternal exposure to DEHP during <b>neonatal</b> <b>periods</b> can accelerate atopic dermatitislike skin lesions related to mite allergen in male offspring, possibly via T helper 2 (TH 2) -dominant responses, which can be responsible, at least in part, for the recent increase in atopic dermatitis.

The neonatal line, visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy, was used to demarcate the pre- and postnatal regions of the sample teeth. Lead levels in pre- and postnatally formed enamel and dentine were compared to blood-lead levels measured at birth and one year of age for four of these participants. Mean dentine-lead levels ranged from 0. 17 ± 0. 02 to 5. 60 ± 1. 79 μg/g, and mean enamel-lead levels ranged from 0. 04 ± 0. 01 to 1. 47 ± 0. 20 μg/g.

Habituation has been demonstrated in fetuses as early as 22 weeks and corresponds to the onset of fetal auditory abilities. Both auditory and vibroacoustic stimulation have been used in habituation. Vibroacoustic stimulation is a technique involving the repetitive stimulation of the fetus, by applying a vibroacoustic stimulus (in predetermined intervals) to the abdomen of the mother.

This process is repeated until habituation, defined as a lack of response to the stimulus by the fetus, is reached.

This study aimed to investigate for the first time whether immune challenge with a viral mimic, synthetic double-stranded ribonucleic acid (Poly I: C) during different <b>neonatal</b> <b>periods</b> can differently affect depression-related behaviors in adolescent and adult mice. Methods: Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated with either saline or Poly I:C (1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) on postnatal days (PND) 3 - 5 (early neonatal phase) or PND 14 - 16 (late neonatal phase), and then subjected to behavioral tests, including tail suspension test and forced swimming test, during adolescence (PND 35 or 40) and adulthood (PND 85 or 90). Results: The results demonstrated that early neonatal immune activation increases depression-related behaviors in both adolescent and adult mice, but late neonatal immune activation only increases depression in adult mice. In other words, these findings indicated that the nature of the offspring's neuropathology can depend on the severity of the insult, the pup's age {{at the time of the}} insult, and offspring age at the time of behavioral testing.
