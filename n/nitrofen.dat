40|$|Introduction. Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF), an angiogenic factor {{secreted}} by type II pneumocytes, {{could play a}} role in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) pathogenesis. Animal studies suggest that VEGF accelerates lung growth. Aim. To quantify VEGF on fetal lungs in a <b>nitrofen</b> rat model for CDH and to analyze the effect of tracheal occlusion (TO) in VEGF in fetal lung rats after <b>nitrofen</b> and in control rats not exposed to <b>nitrofen.</b> Methods. Pregnant rats received <b>nitrofen</b> on day 9. 5 of gestation. Fetuses were divided into 2 groups: those that underwent TO on day 20 and those that did not. On day 21, fetuses were delivered, and the lungs were dissected for subsequent VEGF quantification. Results. CDH was detected in 43 % of the fetuses that received <b>nitrofen.</b> Fetuses with CDH showed significantly reduced lung weight/fetal weight ratio and lower VEGF levels than the remainder. A higher VEGF value was observed after TO. Conclusions. VEGF protein was significantly lower in fetuses with CDH. TO induced a significant increase in VEGF compared to the fetuses that did not undergo TO. Although not statistically significant, we observed higher VEGF levels in fetuses with CDH and TO compared to fetuses with CDH and no further intervention...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{hypoplasia}} {{associated with}} {{congenital diaphragmatic hernia}} (CDH) remains a major therapeutic problem. Moreover, the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypoplasia in case of CDH is controversial. In particular, {{little is known about}} early lung development in this anomaly. To investigate lung development separate from diaphragm development we used an in vitro modification of the 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl-p-nitrophenylether (<b>Nitrofen)</b> animal model for CDH. This enabled us to investigate the direct effects of <b>Nitrofen</b> on early lung development and branching morphogenesis in an organotypic explant system without the influence of impaired diaphragm development. Epithelial cell differentiation of the lung explants was assessed using surfactant protein-C and Clara cell secretory protein- 10 mRNA expression as markers. Furthermore, cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated. Our results indicate that <b>Nitrofen</b> negatively influences branching morphogenesis of the lung. Initial lung anlage formation is not affected. In addition, epithelial cell differentiation and cell proliferation are attenuated in lungs exposed to <b>Nitrofen.</b> These data indicate that <b>Nitrofen</b> interferes with early lung development before and separate from (aberrant) diaphragm development. Therefore, we postulate the dual-hit hypothesis, which explains pulmonary hypoplasia in CDH by two insults, one affecting both lungs before diaphragm development and one affecting the ipsilateral lung after defective diaphragm development...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} myosin in muscle fibers of the diaphragm in experimental congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). METHODS: Fetuses of pregnant rats were divided into four groups: External Control (EC), composed of non-manipulated rats; <b>Nitrofen,</b> composed of pregnant rats that received 100 mg of <b>nitrofen</b> (2, 4 -dichloro- 4 ' nitrodiphenyl ether) diluted in olive oil on gestational day (GD) 9. 5, whose fetuses developed CDH (N+) or not (N-), and Olive Oil Placebo (OO), composed of pregnant rats that received the oil on the same GD. The fetuses were collected on GD 18. 5, 19. 5, 20. 5 and 21. 5 (term = 22 days). We obtained body weight (BW) and photographed the diaphragm area (DA), hernia area (HA) and subsequent calculated the HA/DA ratio in N+ group. Samples of Diaphragm muscle were processed for histological staining with H/E and immunohistochemistry (IHQ) for myosin.

40|$|<b>Nitrofen</b> (2, 4 -dichloro- 4 '-nitrodiphenyl ether) is an {{herbicide}} with potent teratogenic {{activity in}} rats. When administered at doses {{as low as}} 0. 15 mg/kg/day during organogenesis, abnormal development of the heart, kidneys, diaphragm, and lung occurs. The specific pattern of visceral malformations produced {{in the absence of}} overt maternal toxicity or embryolethality/cytotoxicity suggest that the compound perturbs processes unique or highly selective for embryonic differentiation. Despite findings of metabolic activation to mutagenic intermediates and carcinogenic activity in adult rodents, several lines of evidence indicate that teratogenicity is not based on mutagenic insult to the embryo. Rather, evidence is accumulating that <b>nitrofen</b> exerts a teratogenic effect via alterations in thyroid hormone status. The premature and pharmacologic exposure of the embryo to a nitrofen-derived thyromimetic challenge {{is believed to be the}} cause of abnormal morphogenesis of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and diaphragm. The parent compound itself could directly bind to embryonic nuclear receptors for T 3, leading to altered differentiation of target organs. Alternatively, increased availability and placental transport of free thyroid hormones in the maternal compartment could be the source of thyromimetic challenge to the embryo.

We investigated {{the production of}} NOS 2 and NOS 3 and expression of VEGF and its receptors after ventilation in rat fetuses with CDH. Methods: CDH was induced by <b>Nitrofen.</b> The fetuses were divided into 6 groups: 1) control (C); 2) control ventilated (CV); 3) exposed to <b>nitrofen</b> (N-); 4) exposed to <b>nitrofen</b> ventilated (N-V), 5) CDH and 6) CDH ventilated (CDHV). Fetuses were harvested and ventilated. We assessed body weight (BW), total lung weight (TLW), TLW/BW ratio, the median pulmonary arteriolar wall thickness (MWT). We analyzed the expression of NOS 2, NOS 3, VEGF and its receptors by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Results: BW, TLW, and TLW/BWratiowere greater on C than on N- and CDH (p < 0. 05). The MWT was higher in CDH than in CDHV (p < 0. 001). CDHV showed increased expression of NOS 3 (p < 0. 05) and VEGFR 1 (p < 0. 05), but decreased expression of NOS 2 (p < 0. 05) and VEGFR 2 (p < 0. 001) compared to CDH.

40|$|Babies with {{congenital}} {{diaphragmatic hernia}} (CDH) have {{a hole in the}} diaphragm and abnormal lung development resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension. CDH leads all birth defects with the highest death rate among neonates. <b>Nitrofen</b> (2, 4 -diclorophenyl-pnitrophenyl ether) is a pesticide that induces CDH and pulmonary hypoplasia in rodents in a strikingly similar pattern to humans. To date, the mechanism underlying nitrofen-induced lung hypoplasia is not well defined. We aimed to identify regulatory microRNA interactions with organogenesis networks associated with <b>nitrofen</b> in a rodent model of CDH. Methods: We used Next Generation Sequencing technology to profile changes in expression of RNA subclasses from fetal rat lungs at embryonic day E 13. 5 upon treatment of dams with <b>nitrofen</b> or vehicle olive oil at E 9. A dataset of significantly different mRNA, miRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA were generated. After normalization, mRNA-encoding genes and miRNAs found to be significantly different were selected and identified through fold-change filtering. Selected genes were annotated for biological functions before a subsample was validated using RT-qPCR. Selected miRNAs and their corresponding human orthologous were identified using mirBase and mirOrtho databases. Rat miRNAs and their corresponding human orthologous sequences were clustered and analyzed for their structure conservation and function relatedness using a phylogeny inference approach. Results: <b>Nitrofen</b> treatment induced 87 mRNA genes by more than 2 fold while 112 other genes were downregulated by at least 2 fold. mRNA gene expression was found to be organized into several clusters including extrinsic apoptotic signaling, thymic T cell selection, ventricular cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis, water transport, sterol biosynthetic processes, iron transmembrane transporters, potassium ion transmembrane transport and was also involved in amphetamine treatment.

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypoplasia}} {{and persistent}} pulmonary hypertension {{are the main}} causes of mortality and morbidity in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Prenatal tracheal occlusion or ligation (TL) is known to accelerate lung growth, but the mechanism of this is poorly understood. <b>Nitrofen</b> is well known to induce CDH and lung hypoplasia in a rat model of CDH, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. The aim {{of the present study}} is to increase the understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying growth and development after prenatal TL in the fetal lung and the underlying pathogenesis of CDH, in order to improve outcomes for neonates with CDH. The experiments were conducted in an animal model of stimulated lung growth after prenatal TL, and in the teratogen model of induced CDH and lung hypoplasia after <b>nitrofen</b> administration. In {{order to be able to}} establish the accuracy of the experimental model for further molecular examinations, the histological structure of these fetal lungs was first evaluated, and global gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix Platform and the RAE 230 set arrays was then performed. For validation of the microarray data quantitative real-time PCR of the most significantly up or down-regulated genes was performed, combined with immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of lung sections, or Western Blot analysis, for validation at a protein level. Fetal lungs after TL showed evidence of growth stimulation with increased volume density of alveolar air space (Vva) and increased radial alveolar count (RAC), comparable to findings in normal neonatal lungs. After <b>nitrofen</b> administration lungs had a more immature appearance, both in the ipsi and contralateral side of the diaphragm defect, with decreased Vva and RAC. In the TL-group, several transcripts with growth factor activity had an increased expression, including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF- 18). Some of the genes with a decreased expression after TL are involved in surfactant synthesis and metabolism, such as surfactant protein A (SP-A), apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) and phospholipase group II A 2 (plg 2 a 2). These results were confirmed with real-time PCR and IHC studies. Genes with a decreased expression in <b>nitrofen</b> induced CDH included several growth factors, including CTGF, and growth factors receptors involved in lung development, transcription factors, water and ion channels, genes involved in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix. These results were confirmed with real-time PCR and Western Blot. CTGF expression on gestational day 14 (E 14) was localized to the epithelium of distal airways, increasing during gestation in days 17 (E 17) and 21 (E 21). CTGF was increased after TL, both at the mRNA and protein level, and decreased in <b>nitrofen</b> induced CDH, compared to controls (E 21). The expression pattern for CTGF in TL-lungs was mostly located to the epithelium of the terminal bronchiole, with decreasing expression pattern distally, whereas in the CDH group, CTGF protein expression seemed to be located mostly to the lung mesenchyma. Summarizing, prenatal TL has been proven to accelerate lung growth, with increased expression of genes and proteins with growth factor activity, such as CTGF. We further describe the CTGF expression pattern during lung development. The pathogenesis of lung hypoplasia and congenital diaphragmatic hernia in the <b>nitrofen</b> model includes alteration at a molecular level of several pathways involved in lung growth and development, fluid balance and vascular development. The complexity of the <b>nitrofen</b> mechanism of action reminds of human CDH, and the picture is consistent with lung hypoplasia and vascular disease, both important contributors to the high mortality and morbidity in CDH.

In the present study we examined the expression of CGRP-positive PNEC during lung development in rats with CDH induced by 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl-p-nitrophenylether (<b>Nitrofen).</b> Cesarean sections were performed on Days 16, 18, 20, or 22, and the lungs were immunostained for CGRP and immunoreactive cells were quantitated through image analysis. On Day 16, CGRP-immunoreactive staining was negative; on Day 18, CGRP-immunoreactive cells were found in all controls (not exposed to <b>Nitrofen),</b> whereas in CDH pups, CGRP-positive cells were present in only four of six cases. On Day 20, CGRP immunoreactivity was similar in CDH pups, Nitrofen-exposed pups without CDH, and controls. On Day 22 (term), significantly more CGRP-positive cells (i. e., number of positive cells per surface area [mm 2] or lung volume [mm 3]) were found in ipsilateral lungs of CDH pups than in controls (P < 0. 05). The difference was even more striking in contralateral lungs of CDH pups (P < 0. 001), ruling out nonspecific effects of <b>Nitrofen.</b> In CDH lungs, the proportion of immunostained epithelium {{and the size of the}} neuroendocrine cell clusters (neuroepithelial bodies [NEB]) were not significantly different from those of controls.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Coincidental {{with the onset of}} secondary septation, FGF 18 protein increased threefold in control human lungs, which failed to occur in CDH. FGF 18 labeling was found in interstitial cells of septa. Elastin staining demonstrated poor septation and markedly decreased elastin density in CDH lungs. Consistently, lung FGF 18 transcripts were diminished 60 and 83 % by CDH in sheep and rats, respectively, and elastin density and expression were diminished. TO and vitamin A restored FGF 18 and elastin expression in sheep and rats, respectively. TO restored elastin density. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired septation in CDH is associated with decreased FGF 18 expression and elastic fiber deposition. Simultaneous correction of FGF 18 and elastin defects by TO and vitamin A suggests that defective elastogenesis may result, at least partly, from FGF 18 deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Congenital daphragmatic hernia is a {{congenital}} abnormality with high morbidity and mortality. In our study, we aimed to analyse {{the effect of}} tracheal occlusion in lung development in nitrofen-induced congenital daphragmatic hernia. Method: Wistar albino rats {{of the same age}} were mated. The rats, in whom the presence of sperm in vaginal smear was observed, were included in the study. It was zero day of pregnancy. At the ninth day of pregnancy, 100 mg <b>nitrofen</b> was introduced to pregnant rats by gavage and at the 18 th day of pregnancy, laparotomy and hysterotomy were performed. Tracheal occlusion was performed in one of two fetuses. At the 22 nd day of pregnancy, the lungs of the fetuses were excised. Lung development was analysed histopathologically.

40|$|Carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) {{were exposed}} to <b>nitrofen</b> (NIP) by {{different}} routes (via water or food) to compare bioaccumulation parameters and tissue distribution. The bioconcentration factor of NIP was 5, 100, and the lipid-corrected biomagnification factor was 0. 137. Growth-corrected elimination half lives were 2. 1 – 3. 0  days via aqueous exposure and 2. 7 – 2. 9  days via dietary exposure. From either uptake route, the tissue distribution of NIP was highest in the head, followed by muscle, viscera, dermis, digestive tract and hepatopancreas, which was highly correlated with the tissue lipid content. We conclude that the uptake route has no influence on tissue distribution of NIP and that the accumulation potential in tissues depends on the lipid content...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{vascular}} endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) in pulmonary vessels {{have been described}} in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and {{may contribute to the}} development of pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension; however, how the expression of VEGF receptors changes during fetal lung development in CDH is not understood. The aim of this study was to compare morphological evolution with expression of VEGF receptors, VEGFR 1 (Flt- 1) and VEGFR 2 (Flk- 1), in pseudoglandular, canalicular, and saccular stages of lung development in normal rat fetuses and in fetuses with CDH. Pregnant rats were divided into four groups (n= 20 fetuses each) of four different gestational days (GD) 18. 5, 19. 5, 20. 5, 21. 5 : external control (EC), exposed to olive oil (OO), exposed to 100 mg <b>nitrofen,</b> by gavage, without CDH (N-), and exposed to <b>nitrofen</b> with CDH (CDH) on GD 9. 5 (term= 22 days). The morphological variables studied were: body weight (BW), total lung weight (TLW), left lung weight, TLW/BW ratio, total lung volume, and left lung volume. The histometric variables studied were: left lung parenchymal area density and left lung parenchymal volume. VEGFR 1 and VEGFR 2 expression were determined by Western blotting. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. CDH frequency was 37 % (80 / 216). All the morphological and histometric variables were reduced in the N- and CDH groups compared with the controls, and reductions were more pronounced in the CDH group (P< 0. 05) and more evident on GD 20. 5 and GD 21. 5. Similar results were observed for VEGFR 1 and VEGFR 2 expression. We conclude that N- and CDH fetuses showed primary pulmonary hypoplasia, with a decrease in VEGFR 1 and VEGFR 2 expression...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Congenital {{diaphragmatic hernia}} (CDH) is a birth defect with {{significant}} morbidity and mortality. Knowledge of diaphragm morphogenesis and the aberrations leading to CDH is limited. Although classical embryologists described the diaphragm as {{arising from the}} septum transversum, pleuroperitoneal folds (PPF), esophageal mesentery and body wall, animal {{studies suggest that the}} PPF is the major, if not sole, contributor to the muscular diaphragm. Recently, a posterior defect in the PPF has been identified when the teratogen <b>nitrofen</b> is used to induce CDH in fetal rodents. We describe use of a cell-based computer modeling system (Nudge++ ™) to study diaphragm morphogenesis. Methods and results Key diaphragmatic structures were digitized from transverse serial sections of paraffin-embedded mouse embryos at embryonic days 11. 5 and 13. Structure boundaries and simulated cells were combined in the Nudge++ ™ software. Model cells were assigned putative behavioral programs, and these programs were progressively modified to produce a diaphragm consistent with the observed anatomy in rodents. Homology between our model and recent anatomical observations occurred under the following simulation conditions: (1) cell mitoses are restricted to the edge of growing tissue; (2) cells near the chest wall remain mitotically active; (3) mitotically active non-edge cells migrate toward the chest wall; and (4) movement direction depends on clonal differentiation between anterior and posterior PPF cells. Conclusion With the PPF as the sole source of mitotic cells, an early defect in the PPF evolves into a posteromedial diaphragm defect, {{similar to that of the}} rodent <b>nitrofen</b> CDH model. A posterolateral defect, as occurs in human CDH, would be more readily recreated by invoking other cellular contributions. Our results suggest that recent reports of PPF-dominated diaphragm morphogenesis in the rodent may not be strictly applicable to man. The ability to recreate a CDH defect using a combination of experimental data and testable hypotheses gives impetus to simulation modeling as an adjunct to experimental analysis of diaphragm morphogenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Light-induced proton efflux of Anabaena variabilis {{was found}} to be biphasic, the second phase being {{inhibited}} by the ATPase inhibitor <b>nitrofen</b> (2, 4 -dichloro- 1 -[4 -nitrophenoxy]benzene). The first, fast phase was triggered by monochromatic light of 707 nanometers, whereas the second, slower phase was not. With 707 nanometers, light, respiratory O 2 uptake was inhibited. Using light composed of two wavelengths (616 and 707 nanometers) a marked enhancement of both O 2 evolution as well as the second phase of proton efflux was observed. The first phase was not enhanced. Thus, phase II is driven by both photosystems. As concluded from the action spectrum phase I is markedly determined by photosystem-I activity. Altogether the data show that two different mechanisms of light-induced proton efflux exist on the cytoplasmic membrane of Anabaena, the slower one being dependent on ATP and linear photosynthetic electron flow...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{study the}} effect of {{prenatal}} glucocorticoid treatment on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in rats with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).  METHODS—CDH was induced in fetal rats by the maternal administration of <b>nitrofen</b> on day 9. 5 of gestation. Dexamethasone was administered on days 18. 5 and 19. 5 before delivery of the fetuses on days 20. 5 and 21. 5. Pulmonary eNOS protein expression was studied by western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.  RESULTS—On day 20. 5, eNOS expression was significantly reduced in CDH pups compared with normal control rats. Dexamethasone treated CDH pups had eNOS concentrations equivalent to those of normal animals. By day 21. 5, however, there was no detectable difference in eNOS expression between the experimental groups.  CONCLUSIONS—eNOS is deficient in near term (day 20. 5) CDH rats. Dexamethasone restores eNOS expression in these animals to that seen in normal rat lungs. At term, the precise role of eNOS in the pathophysiology of CDH remains uncertain. ...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the {{etiology}} of the serious developmental anomaly congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is unknown. We have used an animal model of CDH to address this issue. We characterized four separate teratogens that produced diaphragmatic defects in embryonic rats {{that are similar to}} those in infants with CDH. We then tested the hypothesis that all these agents share the common mechanism of perturbing the retinoid-signaling pathway. Specifically, inhibition of retinal dehydrogenase- 2 (RALDH 2), a key enzyme necessary for the production of retinoic acid and that is expressed in the developing diaphragm, was assayed by measuring retinoic acid production in cytosolic extracts from an oligodendrocyte cell line. The following compounds all induce posterolateral defects in the rat diaphragm; <b>nitrofen,</b> 4 -biphenyl carboxylic acid, bisdiamine, and SB- 210661. Importantly, we demonstrate that they all share the common mechanism of inhibiting RALDH 2. These data provide an important component of mounting evidence suggesting that the retinoid system warrants consideration in future studies of {{the etiology}} of CDH...|$|E
40|$|The Rai and Van Ryzin {{dose-response}} model proposed for teratology experiments {{has been characterized}} for its appropriateness and applicability in modeling the dichotomous response data from developmental toxicity studies. Modifications {{were made in the}} initial probability statements to reflect more accurately biological events underlying developmental toxicity. Data sets used for the evaluation were obtained from the National Toxicology Program and U. S. EPA laboratories. The studies included developmental evaluations of ethylene glycol, diethylhexyl phthalate, di- and triethylene glycol dimethyl ethers, and <b>nitrofen</b> in rats, mice, or rabbits. Graphic examination and statistical evaluation demonstrate that this model is sensitive to the data when compared to directly measured experimental outcomes. The model was used to interpolate to low-risk dose levels, and comparisons were made between the values obtained and the no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) divided by an uncertainty factor. Our investigation suggests that the Rai and Van Ryzin model is sensitive to the developmental toxicity end points, prenatal deaths, and malformations, and appears to model closely their relationship to dose...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{hypoplasia}} {{is central}} to the poor prognosis of babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Prolapse of abdominal organs through a diaphragmatic defect has traditionally been thought to impair lung growth by compression. The precise developmental biology of CDH remains unresolved. Refractory to fetal correction, lung hypoplasia in CDH may instead originate during embryogenesis and before visceral herniation. Resolving these conflicting hypotheses may lead to reappraisal of current clinical strategies. Genetic studies in murine models and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster are elucidating the control of normal respiratory organogenesis. Branchless and breathless are Drosophila mutants lacking fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its cognate receptor (FGFR), respectively. Sugarless and sulphateless mutants lack enzymes essential for heparan sulphate (HS) biosynthesis. Phenotypically, all these mutants share abrogated airway branching. Mammalian organ culture and transgenic models confirm the essential interaction of FGFs and HS during airway ramification. Embryonic airway development (branching morphogenesis) occurs in a defined spatiotemporal sequence. Unlike the surgically-created lamb model, the <b>nitrofen</b> rat model permits investigation of embryonic lung growth in CDH. Microdissecting embryonic lung primordia from the <b>nitrofen</b> CDH model and normal controls, we demonstrated that disruption of stereotyped airway branching correlates with and precedes subsequent CDH formation. To examine disturbed branching morphogenesis longitudinally, we characterised a system that preserves lung hypoplasia in organ culture. We tested FGFs and heparin (an HS analogue) as potential therapies on normal and hypoplastic lungs. Observing striking differences in morphological response to FGFs between normal and hypoplastic lung primordia, we postulated abnormalities of FGF/HS signalling in the embryonic CDH lung. Evaluating this hypothesis further, we examined effects of an HS-independent growth factor (epidermal growth factor, EGF) on hypoplastic lung development. Visible differences in morphological response indicate an intrinsic abnormality of hypoplastic lung primordia that may involve shared targets of FGFs and EGE. These studies indicate that lung hypoplasia precedes diaphragmatic hernia and may involve disturbances of mitogenic signalling pathways fundamental to embryonic lung development. What does this imply for human CDH? Fetal surgery may be 'too little, too late' to correct an established lung embryopathy. In utero growth factor therapy may permit antenatal lung rescue. Prevention of the birth defect by preconceptual prophylaxis may represent the ultimate solution...|$|E
