5|$|Wallace Glenn Wilkinson (December 12, 1941 – July 5, 2002) was an American {{businessman}} and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1987 to 1991, {{he served as}} the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson {{dropped out of college}} at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend to a book retail business he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes</b> and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most political observers by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election.|$|E

500|$|Joseph entered Cabinet-level {{politics}} on 19 April 1984 when, following the ALP's general election victory, {{he was made}} a Minister without Portfolio. In 1991 he became Minister of Finance and Trade, and along with Financial Secretary Keith Hurst and Minister of Economic Development Rodney Williams negotiated the rescheduling of Antigua's national debt with European creditors. The government's 1992 budget, announced and drafted by Joseph, included <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes</b> but did involve a cut to government spending, in response to what he claimed was reduced spending by tourists and smaller amounts of international aid in 1990 and 1991. The 1993 budget contained similar provisions, ruling {{out the possibility of}} an income tax, as suggested by one of Antigua's major trade unions. This was accompanied by a programme of fiscal reforms, including [...] "expenditure control, improved revenue collection, external debt management, proper evaluation of projects, improved public sector efficiency, price controls on basic foods and commodities, tax reform and good governance".|$|E

500|$|Sforza quickly {{captured}} independent Pavia {{when his}} mother-in-law persuaded the city's ruling condotierro to relinquish it to him, and the Republic grudgingly {{allowed him to}} keep it with the title of Count, fearing that the Pavians and their large arsenal might instead offer themselves to Venice if they refused. Sforza promised the Pavians <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes,</b> respect for the old laws, payment for the officials he retained, and the repair of the city bridges and walls. He kept these promises faithfully and so won over the people of Pavia, establishing his rule. Pavia was previously almost a second capital to Milan, and gave Sforza his own seat of power. The city was also in a strategic location on the Po River, situated where it could block the Venetians from coming to the relief of the beleaguered Piacenza by water. Returning to the siege of Piacenza and finding the city not likely to crumble by starvation, he resolved to storm it. Employing cannon in an almost unheard-of manner, he opened up a breach in Piacenza's walls and sacked the city. The news of Piacenza's sack was greeted by three days' rejoicing in Milan. Meanwhile, Milanese Captain Bartolomeo Colleoni captured Tortona which had previously proclaimed Sforza as its lord, stealing it from the now dangerously powerful Sforza. [...] This caused even greater rejoicing, for the Milanese feared Sforza.|$|E

2500|$|Duncan's first {{budget was}} {{introduced}} on March 23, 2006. [...] It focused on infrastructure spending, and particularly new spending on public transit {{projects in the}} Greater Toronto Area including extension of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line, and roads and bridges {{in other parts of}} the province. [...] Health spending increased by $1.9 billion, and Ontario's universities were given $290 million more in operating revenue. [...] The budget deficit was $2.4 billion, consistent with the previous year's projection. [...] There were <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes</b> or tax increases. [...] One month later, the federal government announced that it would provide Ontario with a further $1 billion for public transit spending in Toronto.|$|E
2500|$|The {{provision}} for admitting new states became relevant at {{the purchase of}} Louisiana. It was constitutionally justifiable under the [...] "treaty making" [...] power of the federal government. The agrarian advocates sought to make the purchase of land {{that had never been}} administered, conquered, or formally ceded to any of the original thirteen states. Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans would divide the Louisiana Purchase into states, speeding land sales to finance the federal government with <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes.</b> The new populations of new states would swamp the commercial states in the Senate. They would populate the House with egalitarian Democrat-Republicans to overthrow the Federalists. Jefferson dropped the proposal of Constitutional amendment to permit the purchase, and with it, his notion of a confederation of sovereign states.|$|E
2500|$|On May 16, 2012, {{after coming}} to agreement, McGinn, Constantine, and Hansen {{presented}} the proposed Memorandum of Understanding to the public. McGinn and Constantine {{had insisted on}} a number of protections for the citizens of Seattle and King County, specifically that no public financing on the project would be committed until Hansen and his investors had secured an NBA team to be primary tenant. The MOU proposal included a financial model that made the project [...] "self-financed", in which <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes</b> would be levied to provide funds and city bonds issued would be paid back by taxes and revenue generated solely by the new arena. The proposal was turned over to the Seattle City Council and the King County Council for review and approval.|$|E

The ZIF {{has the potential to}} improve the allocation of resources for subsidizing low-income housing, to reduce risk exposure to rapidly declining property values, and to improve the self-esteem of a group of Americans who have been depressed for far too long by making homeownership a reality. ...|$|R
50|$|Between the {{enactment}} of the Constitution and 1840, <b>no</b> <b>new</b> general <b>taxes</b> on income appeared. In 1796, Delaware abolished its faculty tax, and in 1819 Connecticut followed suit. On the other hand, in 1835, Pennsylvania instituted a tax on bank dividends, paid by withholding, which by about 1900 produced half its total revenue.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>no</b> <b>new</b> {{property}} <b>taxes</b> were levied in Federal Budget but {{the provincial}} Punjab Budget 2013-14 imposed <b>new</b> <b>taxes</b> on property.

Despite imposition of the heavy taxation, country's leading economists and financial experts believe it won't hamper {{the growth of the}} booming property market of Pakistan. The budget also allocates ₨. 57.4 billion for development of various areas in higher education— highest in the history of Pakistan.|$|R
2500|$|As the new Governor of Massachusetts in 2003, Romney {{declined}} to publicly support {{the federal tax}} cuts proposed by the Bush Administration. (Romney reportedly told members of the state's congressional delegation {{that he would not}} [...] "be a cheerleader" [...] for proposals he did not agree with but that he felt he needed to [...] "keep a solid relationship with the White House.") Romney also said he was open to increases in the federal gasoline tax, to support transportation construction projects. In 2007, after leaving the governor's office and deciding to seek the party' presidential nomination, Romney said that he had supported the Bush tax cuts overall. In that same year, Romney signed the anti-tax pledge put forth by Americans for Tax Reform, pledging <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes</b> or increases of existing taxes. (In 2002, he had refused to sign an anti-tax pledge because he considered them [...] "government by gimmickry.") ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1777 to 1781, Necker was {{essentially}} {{in control of}} all of France's wealth. [...] Near {{the end of this}} period, Necker published his most influential work: the Compte rendu au roi. In it, Necker summarized governmental income and expenditures to provide the first record of royal finances ever made public. It was meant to be an educational piece for the people, and in it he expressed his desire to create a well-informed, interested populace. Before, the people had never considered governmental income and expenditure to be their concern, but the Compte rendu made them more proactive. This birth of public opinion and interest {{played an important role in}} the French Revolution. The statistics given in the Compte rendu were completely false and misleading. Necker wanted to show France in a strong financial position when the reality was much worse. He hid the crippling interest payments that France had to make on its massive 520 million livres in loans (largely used to finance the war in America) as normal expenditure. When he was criticized by his enemies for the Compte rendu, he made public his [...] "Financial Summary for the King", which appeared to show that France had fought the war in America, paid <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>taxes</b> and still had a massive credit of 10 million livres of revenue.|$|E

Flaherty said that it is the [...] "single most important savings vehicle since the introduction of the RRSP". Funding was also announced for public transit, infrastructures, hiring new police officers, the reconstruction of Afghanistan, a new Student Grant Program (replacing the Millennium Scholarship Fund) and for the manufacturing sectors. In addition, the government announced {{the creation of a new}} independent crown corporation to administer the Employment Insurance System while gas tax rebate fund to the cities was made permanent. 10.2 billion dollars will be spent on the payment of the national debt.|$|R
2500|$|Within {{weeks of}} taking office, Turner was {{attacked}} by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) for his <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>tax</b> pledge, and painted by the DCC as representing wealthy individuals and corporations rather than the average district voter. Turner expressed support for hydrofracking in upstate New York, and would allow states {{to opt out of}} No Child Left Behind. Remarking on the tenth anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Turner said he would [...] "leave our military commitment in Afghanistan up to the generals in the field," [...] adding that, [...] "If they believe the sacrifice of our soldiers continues to be necessary to prevent attacks on U.S. soil, then {{we have no choice but}} to let them finish the task." [...] Turner was an advocate for removing the tolls on the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, and applauded Gov. Cuomo for his motions towards changing the policy.|$|R
25|$|The third Conservative {{budget was}} tabled on February 26, 2008. The {{government}} announced {{there would be}} little to <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>tax</b> breaks as major tax cuts took place in the economic update during the fall of 2007 in anticipation of economic slowdowns in 2008. It was to be the last budget of the Conservative government's first term in office. Among the key announcements was {{the creation of a new}} $5000/year tax-free savings account (TFSA), funding for troubled manufacturing and forestry industries, a new Student Grant Program, higher defense spending, $500 million for transit and infrastructures and $400 million for hiring new police officers. The TFSA was touted as a badly needed addition to the Canadian tax system as it did not make sense for low income earners and seniors to make use of existing savings programs with tax incentives, such as RRSPs. In contrast, the TFSA could be used by such demographics to enjoy savings with tax benefits.|$|R

50|$|No law can be passed, repealed, {{changed or}} {{reviewed}} without {{the acceptance of}} parliament. However, the initiative for the law to be passed or for the existing one to be changed can come from government to parliament or vice versa, but formal legislative projects {{can be made by}} government only. The role and the position of parliament was quite damaged by this fact. Parliament had the right to pass the budget, but for doing so it could not ask for the conditions that were not related to it. In other words, rejection of the budget cannot be used to dissolve a government, so, if parliament was to repeal the budget, the prince could extend the validness of the last year's budget to the following year. This particular example shows that the constitution did not complete the task of limiting the ruler's power. Finally, <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>tax</b> can be imposed without the agreeance of parliament.|$|R

40|$|During the nineties, the {{tax policy}} stance was clearly subordinated to the fiscal {{consolidation}} {{strategy of the}} federal government. “Maastricht” and “ 3 %” were the key words and figures that dominated the decennia (Decoster, Gérard and Valenduc, 2001). On the revenue side, two main reforms contributed to fiscal consolidation: the automatic indexation of personal income tax was suspended, apart for the zero rate bands and the related family tax credits, and a crisis surcharge was introduced, for personal income taxes (PIT {{in the rest of}} this chapter) and corporate income taxes (CIT in the rest of this chapter). On the CIT side, the nineties appears to be, ex-post, a decennium of base broadening and the gap between nominal and effective taxation was substantially reduced (Valenduc, 1999). Finally, on the PIT side, <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>tax</b> expenditures were introduced and the tax incentives for long term savings were made less generous, by replacing allowances valuated at the marginal tax rate by a tax credit that ranged from 30 to 40 %...|$|R

The Articles of two kingdoms were to be in perpetual alliance, but each of them was to retain its own laws and customs. Sweden was also to enjoy its religion, subject to such changes as the Privy Council might make; but neither pope nor council was to claim or exercise the right of releasing Sigismund from his obligations to his Swedish subjects. During Sigismund's absence from Sweden that realm was to be ruled by seven Swedes, six elected by the king and one by his uncle Duke Charles of Södermanland, the leader of the Swedish Protestants. <b>No</b> <b>new</b> <b>tax</b> was to be levied in Sweden during the king's absence, but Sweden was never to be administered from Poland.
