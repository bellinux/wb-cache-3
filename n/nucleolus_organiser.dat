40|$|A {{molecular}} {{genetic analysis}} of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene locus expression is described. Locus activity was estimated by cytological assays of <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organiser</b> volume. Gene structure was determined from DNA sequencing and restriction endonuclease mapping of isolated genes. Relative <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organiser</b> activity is {{correlated with the}} number of 135 base pair (bp) repeats that lie upstream of the gene promoter. A model is proposed in which gene and locus-relative activity is determined by the ability of the 135 bp and other promoter sequences of the genes in a locus to compete for regulatory proteins in limiting concentration in the nucleus. Active loci are enriched with genes which have unmethylated cytosines at specific sites in the promoter and the 135 bp repeats and in which chromatin structure is perturbed. It is concluded that the processes that produce different numbers of regulatory DNA sequences between rRNA genes are responsible for the differential expression of nucleolus organisers in hexaploid wheat and in interspecies hybrids...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} NOR bearing non-acrocentric chromosomes {{were detected}} during prenatal diagnosis performed on two probands because of advanced maternal age. In the first case, a chromosome 4  carried a NOR in the telomeric {{region of the}} long arm (4 qs), while in the second case a NOR was inserted into chromosome 8 q 11. Family analysis showed the variant chromosomes to be transmitted through at least three generations in each family. There were no reports of reproductive problems or phenotypic effects in the carriers of these chromosomes, indicating the benign character of the aberrant chromosomes. In order to characterise the chromosomal variants more precisely, various differential banding techniques were applied.    Keywords: <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organiser</b> region; non-acrocentric chromosome; 4 qs; NOR insertio...|$|E
40|$|Thoracocharax stellatus (Characiformes, Gasteropelecidae) {{is a small}} Neotropical {{species of}} fish, widely dis-tributed in several rivers of South America. Evidence for {{karyotype}} heteromorphysm in populations from different geographical regions has been reported for this species. In this way, populations of T. stellatus from the Paraguay River basin were cytogenetically characterized {{and the results were}} compared with oth-er studies performed in the same species but from different basins. The results showed a diploid number of 2 n = 54 for T. stellatus, with chromosomes arranged in 6 metacentric (m), 6 submetacentric (sm), 2 sub-telocentric (st) and 40 acrocentric (a), for both sexes, with a simple <b>Nucleolus</b> <b>Organiser</b> Region (NOR) system reported by the techniques of silver nitrate impregnation and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) using 18 S rDNA sequences as probe. The distribution of constitutive heterochromatin, observed by the C-band technique and Chromomycin A 3 staining showed great similarity among the analyze...|$|E
40|$|A reconstructed barley {{karyotype}} (T- 35) was utilised {{to study}} the influence of chromosomal rearrangements on the DNA methylation pattern at chromosome level. Data obtained were also compared with the distribution of Giemsa N-bands and high gene density regions along the individual chromosomes that have been previously described. In comparison to the control karyotype (T- 1586), the DNA methylation pattern was found to vary {{not only in the}} reconstructed chromosomes but also in the other chromosomes of the complement. Significant remodelling process of methylation pattern was found also in the residual <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organiser</b> regions (NOR) on chromosome 5 H as a consequence of deletion comprising the whole NOR of chromosome 6 H in T- 35. Moreover, differences between corresponding segments of the homologues with respect to some other chromosome locations were also observed. Repositioning of genomic DNA methylation along the metaphase chromosomes following chromosomal reconstruction in barley seems to be essential to ensure correct chromatin organisation and function...|$|E
