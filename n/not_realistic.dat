5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is <b>not</b> <b>realistic,</b> Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was <b>not</b> <b>realistic,</b> as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E

25|$|In figure {{preferences}} {{the use of}} silhouettes is {{the most}} commonly used method. There are many issues with this method though; for one, the drawings are <b>not</b> <b>realistic</b> looking and were originally portrayed as adults so it made them unsuitable for children. Silhouettes are used to show to the subject and have them react to the different body types.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>realistic</b> for the Court {{to assume}} that there are {{unlimited}} funds {{to address the needs}} of all. A judicial approach on this basis would tend to make a government reluctant to create any new social benefit schemes because their limits would depend on an accurate prediction of the outcome of court proceedings under s. 15(1) of the Charter.|$|E
25|$|Mainstream {{economics}} {{has attempted}} to become a value-free 'hard science', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally <b>not</b> <b>realistic.</b> Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of utility, efficiency, and cost-benefits such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for sustainable development, and may have goals similar to green politics.|$|E

25|$|Nickell, in 1983, and Gregory S. Paul in 2010, {{separately}} {{state that}} the proportions of the image are <b>not</b> <b>realistic.</b> Paul stated that the face and proportions of the shroud image are impossible, that the figure cannot represent that of an actual person and that the posture was inconsistent. They argued that the forehead on the shroud is too small; and that the arms are too long and of different lengths and that {{the distance from the}} eyebrows {{to the top of the}} head is non-representative. They concluded that the features can be explained if the shroud is a work of a Gothic artist.|$|E
25|$|In {{a letter}} dated 30 April 1982 to Mayor Kåre Minde, Kjell Kristensen and sixteen other former councilors from {{northern}} Askøy {{stated that they}} were not satisfied with the progress in the planning, and proposed that advanced tolls be placed on the ferry. The petition was supported by several other politicians, but was dismissed by Rutelaget Askøy–Bergen, who stated that the bridge plans not specific yet, that the ferry tickets were expensive enough as they were, and that many of the travelers with the ferry would continue to use it after the bridge came and would thus not have any use of the bridge, but yet pay for it. Advanced tolls were supported by 33 against 7 votes in the municipal council on 24 June; the Socialist Left Party and some Liberal Party members were the only to oppose. However, the decisions had so many technical faults to it that the Public Roads Administration rejected it, commenting among other things that the decision presumed a bridge would be completed in 1988—which was <b>not</b> <b>realistic.</b> A new municipal decision was made in October, supporting the advanced tolls starting from 1983.|$|E
500|$|The genesis for {{the episode}} was a storyline Duchovny had {{developed}} during the series' eighth season. He had originally pitched an idea featuring a mysteriously disfigured person introducing himself to Scully and admitting {{that he has a}} connection to Mulder. Reportedly, the idea for Scully to give William up for adoption was mandated by Carter and Spotnitz. Duchovny, Anderson, and executive producer John Shiban were not happy with this turn of events, due to them being parents and feeling that the action was <b>not</b> <b>realistic,</b> but [...] "grudgingly consented".|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{rated the}} episode with an [...] "A" [...] grade. He felt the episode was the [...] "highlight" [...] of the season. McNutt applauded that Michael was portrayed {{in a way}} that was neither [...] "too dumb or too ignorant" [...] and that he was able to have the final moment where he showed that he was a skilled salesman. Despite noting that the sting was <b>not</b> <b>realistic,</b> he further enjoyed that Michael, Dwight, and Jim were allowed to react to the {{situation}} rather than becoming part of it. Jason Hughes of AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review and praised the use of Meredith, calling her [...] "hilarious and so spot-on". Furthermore, he, like McNutt, enjoyed that Michael was portrayed as competent in the end. Hughes also enjoyed the B-story and wrote that [...] "it was a sweet moment when Darryl told Andy he didn't have to pay him any more to jam with them".|$|E
2500|$|Weak exogeneity. [...] This {{essentially}} {{means that}} the predictor variables x can be treated as fixed values, rather than random variables. [...] This means, for example, that the predictor variables {{are assumed to be}} error-free—that is, not contaminated with measurement errors. Although this assumption is <b>not</b> <b>realistic</b> in many settings, dropping it leads to significantly more difficult errors-in-variables models.|$|E
2500|$|Scaramella was, however, {{doubtful}} as to {{the authenticity}} of the emails he had received: [...] "The problem for me was these mails were so full of details, so specific that they didn't seem genuine."

2500|$|American {{astronaut}} Buzz Aldrin {{said the}} movie is [...] "quite action packed" [...] and a [...] "touching father/son story" [...] but is <b>not</b> <b>realistic</b> because [...] "there {{was a lot of}} noise.

Aldrin was impressed by the set design stating that [...] "the scenes of the cities were really remarkable" [...] but differed significantly from his experience on the moon, which he described as [...] "'magnificent desolation' in contrast to the magnificent experience that humanity could move itself ahead to get to the moon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Occupying an {{intermediate}} {{place in this}} line of development, the work of several European and American painters whose most important work dates from the 1930s through to the 1950s, including Bettina Shaw-Lawrence, Paul Cadmus, Ivan Albright, Philip Evergood, George Tooker, Ricco, even Andrew Wyeth, such as in his well-known work Christina's World, is designated as [...] "magic realist". This work departs sharply from Roh's definition, in that it (according to artcyclopedia.com) [...] "is anchored in everyday reality, but has overtones of fantasy or wonder". In the work of Cadmus, for example, the surreal atmosphere is sometimes achieved via stylized distortions or exaggerations that are <b>not</b> <b>realistic.</b>|$|E

[...] Zhuge Liang did not agree with Yu Jun's view initially, but later he praised Yu for having foresight when Yu's prediction came true. He also pondered over the causes of Zhang Wen's downfall for several days before concluding, [...] "I know already.

2500|$|An unnamed American {{intelligence}} official stated that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 {{may have been}} shot down in error by pro-Russian separatists, citing evidence that separatists launched an SA-11 surface-to-air missile that blew up the Malaysian airliner. They said it was possible the rebel was {{a former member of}} the Armed Forces of Ukraine who had defected to the pro-Russian separatists. The official dismissed Russian allegations that MH17 took evasive action and said the claim that the Ukrainian government had shot down MH17 was <b>not</b> <b>realistic,</b> as Kiev had no such missile systems in that area, which was rebel-controlled. American {{intelligence official}}s also said that Russia was attempting to disguise the flow of weaponry it was delivering to the rebels by sending older weapons that matched Ukraine's inventory. The British Foreign Office stated that it was [...] "highly likely" [...] that the missile was fired from an area controlled by Russian-backed separatists.|$|E
