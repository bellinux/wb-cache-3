40|$|International audienceIn the {{simplest}} and original case of study of the Taylor–Couette TC problems, the fluid is contained between a fixed outer cylinder and a concentric inner cylinder which rotates at constant angular velocity. Much of the works done has been concerned on steady rotating cylinder(s) i. e. rotating cylinders with constant velocity and the various transitions that take place as the cylinder(s) velocity (ies) is (are) steadily increased. On this work, we concentrated our attention in the {{case in which the}} inner cylinder velocity is not constant, but oscillates harmonically (in time) clockwise and counterclockwise while the outer cylinder is maintained fixed. Our aim is to attempt to answer the question if the modulation makes the flow more or less stable with respect to the vortices apparition than in the steady case and if there are any reversing or <b>non</b> <b>reversing</b> flows apparition. If the modulation amplitude is large enough to destabilize the circular Couette flow, two classes of axisymmetric Taylor vortex flow are possible: reversing Taylor Vortex Flow (RTVF) and Non-Reversing Taylor Vortex Flow (NRTVF). Our work presents an experimental investigation of the effect of oscillatory Couette-Taylor flow on the instantaneous and local mass transfer and wall shear rates evolutions, i. e. the impact of vortices at wall; and the detection of any RTVF and/or NRTVF apparition. The vortices may manifest themselves by the presence of time-oscillations of mass transfer and wall shear rates; this generally corresponds to an instability apparition even for steady rotating cylinder. On laminar CT flow, the time-evolution of wall shear rate is linear. It can be presented as a linear function of the angular velocity. For a mean Taylor number corresponding to a laminar Couette flow, a modulation frequency F = 0. 1 Hz and an amplitude respectively β = 0. 53 andβ = 1. 08 are sufficient to destabilize the laminar CT flow, Taylor vortices appear. Comparing to a steady rotational velocity case, oscillatory flow accelerates the instability apparition, i. e. the mean critical Taylor number corresponds to the transition is smaller than that of the steady rotational case. The vortices direction can be deduced from the sign of the instantaneous wall shear rate time evolution...|$|E

Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of 1, 038 HIV-HCV co-infected patients who commenced a new HAART in the Italian MASTER database. Patients were stratified into naïve and experienced to antiretroviral therapy before starting the study regimens. Time to grade ≥III hepatotoxicity (as by ACTG classification) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcome was time to grade IV hepatotoxicity. Results Incidence of grade ≥III hepatotoxicity was 17. 71 per 100 patient-years (p-yr) of follow up in naïve patient group and 8. 22 per 100 p-yrs in experienced group (grade IV: 4. 13 per 100 p-yrs and 1. 08 per 100 p-yrs, respectively). In the latter group, the only independent factors associated with shorter time to the event at proportional hazards regression model were: previous liver transaminase elevations to grade ≥III, higher baseline alanine amino-transferase values, and use of a <b>non</b> nucleoside <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitor based regimen. In the naive group, baseline aspartate transaminase level was associated with the primary outcome. Conclusion Use of a single or multiple protease inhibitor based regimen was not associated with risk of hepatotoxicity in either naïve or experienced patient groups to a statistically significant extent. A cautious approach with strict monitoring should be applied in HIV-HCV co-infected experienced patients with previous liver transaminase elevations, higher baseline alanine amino-transferase values and who receive regimens containing <b>non</b> nucleoside <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitors. </p...|$|R

Unfortunately, in about 30 % of legs the ipsilateral saphenous vein is inadequate rendering in situ bypass grafting impossible. To profit from a valveless autologous vein graft in these cases we routinely performed ex situ valvulotomy after harvesting the contralateral saphenous vein or good quality segments of the ipsilateral saphenous vein. Methods:The ex situ valvulotomy was performed under angioscopic guidance using a flushing-type Mill's valvulotome.

The acquisition costs of HAART are substantial. However, these costs are partially offset by reduced inpatient care for opportunistic infections and other AIDS-related diseases. Furthermore, job productivity in patients infected with HIV is increased under HAART. In developed countries with a low unemployment rate, the discounted value of savings caused by increased productivity in earlier years exceeds the discounted value of later increases in costs resulting from morbidity.

Aim: To search for mutations associated with ARV resistance in recently HIV- 1 infected patients naïve to treatment, in Chile. Material and Methods: Patients over 18 years old with HIV- 1 infection, naïve to antiretroviral drugs before the study were included. Patients with CD 4 cell counts less than 200 cells/mm³, viral load below 2. 000 copies/mL or any condition indicative of advanced AIDS were excluded. Criteria for diagnosis of recent infection (< 18 months) were a previous negative test for HIV antibodies or a history of an acute retroviral syndrome in the past 18 months. Resistance to drugs was analyzed using the TRUGENEtm HIV- 1 assay from Bayer and the OpenGene DNA sequencing system. Results: Ninety nine percent of patients {{had at least one}} mutation, 27 % had 4 or more mutations, but high level resistance to ARV was found only in 2. 7 % of cases. Point mutations for <b>non</b> nucleoside <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) were detected in 4. 1 % of cases (K 103 N in 1 patient, V 179 D in 2 patients), for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in 8. 1 % of cases (T 215 S in 1 patient, V 118 I in 4 patients, M 41 L in 1 patient) and for protease inhibitors (PI) in 1. 3 % of cases.

Therefore, this investigation aimed at screening the effects of short term and chronic exposure of sutherlandia on oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of nevirapine (NVP), a <b>non</b> nucleoside <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitor, in Sprague Dawley rats. NVP (6 mg/kg) was administered orally alone (control) and with co-administration of sutherlandia; short term (12 mg/kg single dose) and long term (12 mg/kg, once a day for 5 days). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters of NVP was found upon short term co-administration of Sutherlandia. However, there was a 50 % decrease (p < 0. 05) in the AUC and Cmax values of NVP after 5 days of chronic exposure with Sutherlandia. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated a 2 – 3 fold increase in the hepatic and intestinal mRNA expression of CYP 3 A 2, relative to vehicle control. To further confirm, if this could translate into a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction in patients, we tested this hypothesis employing LS- 180 cells as an in vitro induction model for human CYP 3 A 4. Ninety six hours post treatment, similar to positive control rifampicin (25 µM), sutherlandia extract (300 µg/mL) resulted in elevated m-RNA expression levels and functional activity of CYP 3 A 4 (human homologue of rodent CYP 3 A 2) in LS- 180 cells.

Though World Health Organization recommends co-treatment of TB/HIV to improve its outcome, Rifampicin potentially induces metabolism and sub-therapeutic antiretroviral plasma levels of <b>non</b> nucleoside <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors which may cause inadequate virological suppression if corrections are not timely done. In Tanzania Therapeutic drug monitoring is not done; so the proportion of sub-therapeutic ARV plasma levels among TB/HIV patients co-treated with anti-tuberculous drugs is not known. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to determine the magnitude and risk factors of sub-therapeutic ARV plasma levels among adult HIV patients co-treated with anti tuberculous Medications. Materials and methods: A cross sectional hospital based study was conducted among adult HIV patients on ARV and TB co-treatment for at least one month.

The information about demographic, clinical and adherence level, Anti-TB duration, viral load, baseline and enrollment CD 4 counts, Hepatitis B co-infection and ARV plasma levels was collected and analyzed using STATA 12 software. Results: In total 118 patients were included in this study; of whom 26 (22 %) had sub-therapeutic ARV plasma levels. The sub-therapeutic ARV levels were independently associated with adherence < 95 % (OR =  6. 8, p =  0. 001), female gender (OR =  3. 4, p =  0. 028) and virological failure (OR =  3. 8, p =  0. 016).

The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to determine the magnitude and risk factors of sub-therapeutic ARV plasma levels among adult HIV patients co-treated with anti tuberculous Medications. Materials and methodsA cross sectional hospital based study was conducted among adult HIV patients on ARV and TB co-treatment for at least one month. Patients were serially enrolled through routine HIV care and treatment services until the sample size was reached. The information about demographic, clinical and adherence level, Anti-TB duration, viral load, baseline and enrollment CD 4 counts, Hepatitis B co-infection and ARV plasma levels was collected and analyzed using STATA 12 software. ResultsIn total 118 patients were included in this study; of whom 26 (22 %) had sub-therapeutic ARV plasma levels. The sub-therapeutic ARV levels were independently associated with adherence < 95 % (OR= 6. 8, p= 0. 001), female gender (OR= 3. 4, p= 0. 028) and virological failure (OR= 3. 8, p= 0. 016). NVP based regimen was associated with sub-therapeutic drug levels on univariate model (OR= 2. 1, p= 0. 010). ConclusionThe magnitude of sub-therapeutic ARV plasma levels is high among adult HIV/TB co-infected patients on anti-TB co-treatment in Tanzania. These patients stand a high risk of inadequate virological suppression with a potential resistance development and a long term poor clinical outcome. Identifying at risk patients and adherence enhancement could potentially improve the overall outcome of this subgroup of patients in resource restricted setting like ours where TDM is not available...|$|R
40|$|Since 1997, {{expert panel}} {{guidelines}} for HIV care have recommended {{the use of}} combination antiretroviral therapy with at least 3 antiretroviral drugs. Several {{studies have examined the}} cost effectiveness of 3 -drug combination antiretroviral regimens for the treatment of HIV infection. Analyses comparing a 3 -drug protease inhibitor-containing regimen with a 1 - or 2 -drug non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimen have consistently yielded incremental direct cost estimates ranging from $US 10 000 to just over $US 13 000 per year of life saved. In Western societies, such an incremental cost per year of life saved compares favourably with chronic therapy for other diseases and argues for the adoption of these drugs by payors and policy makers. The reason for this favourable cost-effectiveness ratio appears to be the decrease in opportunistic complications and hospitalisation associated with the effective use of combination antiretroviral therapy. Whether this initial benefit will be maintained is not yet known. Other comorbid illnesses such as hepatitis C or renal failure may subsequently increase the cost of HIV care, and some analyses suggest that resistance may develop to these drugs over the long term. In addition, studies are needed to assess the cost effectiveness of these therapies in developing countries where the expense of these drugs appears to put them out of reach. The collection and analysis of economic data will continue to be needed as newer HIV therapies become available and the HIV healthcare environment evolves. Quantifying medical care costs and calculating cost effectiveness involve assessing a moving target. Economic analyses of HIV infection must evolve in tandem with therapeutic changes to continue to be relevant to policy makers, payors of care, and those who provide and receive HIV care.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of drug resistant strains of HIV represents {{a major challenge}} {{in the treatment of}} patients who contract the virus. We investigate the use of classical molecular dynamics to give quantitative and qualitative molecular insight into the causes of resistance in the two main drug targets in HIV, protease and reverse transcriptase. We initially establish a simulation and free energy analysis protocol for the study of resistance in protease. Focusing on the binding of the inhibitor lopinavir to a series of six mutants with increasing resistance we demonstrate that ensemble simulations exhibit significantly enhanced thermodynamic sampling over single long simulations. We achieve accurate and converged relative binding free energies, reproducible to within 0. 5 kcal mol^- 1. The experimentally derived ranking of the systems is reproduced with a correlation coefficient of 0. 89 and a mean relative deviation from experiment of 0. 9 kcal mol^- 1. Our protocol is then applied to investigate a patient derived viral sequence for which contradictory resistance assessments for lopinavir were obtained from existing clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Mutations at only three locations (L 10 I, A 71 I/V and L 90 M) in uenced the ranking. Free energies were computed for HXB 2 wildtype sequences incorporating each mutation individually and all possible combinations, along with the full patient sequence. Only {{in the case of the}} patient sequence was any resistance observed. This observation suggests an explanation for the discordance found using the CDSS. The effects on drug binding of the mutations at positions 10, 71 and 90 appear to be highly dependent on the background mutations present in the remainder of the sequence. In preparation for the extension of our simulation and free energy protocol to reverse transcriptase the impact of binding both natural DNA substrates and two <b>non</b> nucleoside <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class drugs on the dynamics of reverse transcriptase are investigated. Free energies of both inhibitors (efavirenz and neviripine) are determined which are seen to be independent of the subdomain motions of the protein observed during simulation. Preliminary calculations of the free energies for a set of NNRTI resistant mutants bound to efavirenz are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Although highly active {{antiretroviral}} regimen' (HAART) reduces HIV-related {{morbidity and}} mortality, it affects patients and induces HIV viral resistance {{which could lead}} to more complex therapeutic regimens. The present study evaluated and compared the cost-effectiveness of a protease inhibitor based highly active antiretroviral regimen' (PHAART) with a <b>non</b> nucleoside <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitor based highly active antiretroviral regimen' (NHAART) in HIV-patients. The impact of initial HAART was investigated using retrospective cost analysis over a 10 -year period and 6 months prospective HRQoL analysis of 150 patients (male 125, mean age 40 years) attending the Cardiff Royal Infirmary and the University Hospital of Wales. Data was collected on each patient's care resource utilization and their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessed using the Health Utility Index Mark III (HUI 3) questionnaire. The effect of the HAART regimen, demographic attributes and clinical characteristics on costs and HRQoL were analyzed using a multilevel model of change. A Markov Monte Carlo model was then developed to simulate the impact, and evaluate the cost effectiveness, of both regimens beyond the study time horizon. The mean monthly outpatient cost for all patients was estimated to be 237. 59. Patients receiving NHAART as the initial regimen cost significantly more (p 0. 01, mean 262. 19) than patients receiving PHAART (mean 234. 98). Other factors associated with higher costs were being a non-British national, having a low CD 4 count, a high viral load, and having AIDS. Patients receiving an initial NHAART regimen had a significantly better HRQoL (p 0. 05). Factors associated with a higher HRQoL included being in employment and being in the asymptomatic stage of HIV. With respect to lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis, PHAART was found to be more cost-effective as an initial regimen since the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 8, 871 per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained, was below the UK threshold of 30, 000 per QALY. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} patients receiving NHAART as their initial regimen had higher outpatient costs than those initiated on PHAART, but had a better HRQoL. In the long term, however, PHAART was estimated to be more cost- effective than NHAART as an initial regimen for HIV patients...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} formed of three manuscripts (chapters) about {{variance}} estimation. Each of the chapters focuses on developing new original variance estimators. The Chapter 1 proposes a novel jackknife variance estimator for self weighted two-stage sampling. Customary jackknifes for these designs rely {{only on the}} first sampling stage. This omission may induce a bias in the variance estimation when cluster sizes vary, second stage sampling fractions are small or when there is low variability between clusters. The proposed jackknife accounts of all sampling stages via deletion of clusters and observations within clusters. It does not need join-inclusion probabilities and naturally includes finite population corrections. Its asymptotic design-consistency is shown. A simulation study show {{that it can be}} more accurate than the customary jackknife used for this kind of sampling designs (Rao, Wu and Yue, 1992). The Chapter 2 proposes a totally new replication variance estimator for any unequal-probability without-replacement sampling design. The proposed replication estimator is approximately equal to the linearisation variance estimators obtained by the Demnati and Rao (2004) approach. It is more general than the Campbell (1980); Berger and Skinner (2005) generalised jackknife. Its asymptotic design consistency is shown. A simulation study shows it is more stable than standard jackknifes (Quenouille, 1956; Tukey, 1958) with ad hoc finite population corrections and than the generalised jackknife (Campbell, 1980; Berger and Skinner, 2005). The Chapter 3 proposes a new variance estimator which accounts the item non-response under unequal-probability without-replacement sampling when estimating a change from rotating (overlapping) repeated surveys. The proposed estimator combines the original approach by Berger and Priam (2010, 2012) and the <b>non</b> response <b>reverse</b> approach for variance estimation (Fay, 1991; Shao and Steel, 1999). It gives design-consistent estimation of the variance of change when the sampling fraction is small. The proposed estimator uses random Hot-deck imputation, but it can be implemented with other imputation techniques. Further, there are two more complementary chapters. One introduces the R package called samplingVarEst which implements of some methods for variance estimation utilised for the simulations. Finally, there is a brief chapter which discusses future research work...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} ascending serotonergic pain modulation system projecting from the dorsal raphe (DR) {{nucleus of the}} midbrain to the parafascicularis (PF) nucleus of the thalamus. Previous studies by other investigators {{have led to the}} hypothesis that the DR would modulate responses to noxious stimuli in the PF by using 5 HT. These other {{studies have shown that the}} DR contains serotonergic (5 HT) cell bodies which project to many areas of the forebrain including the PF, that the PF is involved in pain perception, that electrical stimulation of the DR causes analgesia, and 5 HT is necessary for this type of analgesia. One theory of the mechanisms of an endogenous pain modulation system is that brainstem nuclei have a decsending projection to the spinal cord to inhibit responses to noxious input at this level. The present study tests the hypothesis that there is also an ascending pain modulation pathway from the brainstem to the thalamus. ^ To test this hypothesis, several types of experiments were performed on anesthetised rats. The major results of the experiments are as follows: (1) Three types of spontaneously active PF neurons were found: slow units firing at 1 - 10 spikes/sec, bursting units firing 2 - 5 times in 10 - 20 msec, pattern repeating every 1 - 2 sec, and fast units firing at 15 - 40 spikes/sec. The first two groups showed similar results to the treatments and were analysed together. The fast firing units did not respond to any of the treatments. (2) Noxious stimuli primarily increased neuronal firing rates in the PF, where as DR stimulation primarily decreased neuronal activity. DR stimulation applied simultaneously with noxious stimuli decreased the responses to the noxious stimuli as recorded in the PF units. (3) Microiontophoretically applied 5 HT in the PF decreased spontaneous activity in the PF in a dose dependent manner and decreases responses to noxious stimuli in the PF. (4) Reduction of brain 5 HT by 5, 7 dihydroxytryptamine, a potent 5 HT neurotoxin, caused PF units to be hypersensitive to both noxious and <b>non</b> noxious stimuli, <b>reversed</b> the effects of DR stimulation so that DR stimulation increased single units activity in the PF, and prolonged and intensified the depressant action of microiontophoretically applied 5 HT. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the DR uses 5 HT in a direct ascending pathway to the PF to modulate pain in the thalamus. ...|$|R
