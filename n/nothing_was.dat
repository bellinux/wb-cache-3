5|$|Woodland {{called for}} a decision; either South Sudan should be {{separated}} from the north and administered as a territory {{in the same way as}} Uganda, or the British should encourage development by the Arabs within the structure of the North Sudan. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> done.|$|E

5|$|A fairly strong easterly {{wind had}} been blowing for three days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about fifty feet, and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay. At the ranch, they set {{everything}} on fire that had blood in it, and all work was suspended by unanimous consent...little or <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done for nearly five days; by this time the main body had passed, though plenty remained to make everything uncomfortable for about two weeks. This migration was from east to west and the line was about three miles wide.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists dug up the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> found {{that could be used}} as evidence.|$|E
5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; {{he was almost}} too ill {{to participate in the}} battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> revealed in the autopsy.|$|E

5|$|First {{mentioned}} {{during the}} 17th century, the Rodrigues solitaire {{was described in}} detail by François Leguat, {{the leader of a}} group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693. It was hunted by humans and introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 18th century. Apart from Leguat's account and drawing, and a few other contemporary descriptions, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> known about the bird until a few subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1789. Thousands of bones have subsequently been excavated. It is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius.|$|E
5|$|Harding also {{wished to}} promote aviation, and Hoover again took the lead, {{convening}} a national conference on commercial aviation. The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection of airplanes, and licensing of pilots. Harding again promoted legislation but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done until 1926, when the Air Commerce Act created the Bureau of Aeronautics within Hoover's Commerce Department.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{congregation}} voted {{by a margin}} of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to the walls, and the vestibule moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.|$|E
5000|$|Eduardo Izquierdo, {{writing in}} Spanish {{magazine}} Ruta 66, said: [...] "Beautiful melodies, rich instrumentation... Honesty, feeling, variety, essence... <b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> superfluous and <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> lacking. One of my albums of the year." ...|$|R
5000|$|Often {{denies that}} there is such a thing as {{historical}} truth, clinging to the extreme skeptical notion that only what is absolutely certain can be called 'true' and <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> absolutely certain, so <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> true ...|$|R
5000|$|In Boolean logic, the {{universal}} statements [...] "all S is P" [...] and [...] "no S is P" [...] (contraries {{in the traditional}} Aristotelian schema) are compossible provided that the set of [...] "S" [...] is the empty set. [...] "All S is P" [...] is construed to mean that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>is</b> both S and not-P"; [...] "no S is P", that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>is</b> both S and P". For example, since there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>is</b> a round square, it is true both that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> a round square and purple, and that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> a round square and not-purple. Therefore, both universal statements, that [...] "all round squares are purple" [...] and [...] "no round squares are purple" [...] are true.|$|R
5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} {{proposals for}} a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to come of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations of the holes, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet Woollard {{called for}} the statue's {{genitalia}} to be covered up, but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again {{called for the}} statue's groin to be covered, {{on the grounds that}} such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is {{the creation of a new}} statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E

5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> left of the original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate {{in the first place}} was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E
5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup. The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm’s actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{five different}} {{uses of the}} word ‘nothing’ {{in the work of}} Meister Eckhart. These senses of <b>nothing</b> <b>are</b> understood to function within an ontological hierarchy, beginning with the understanding that all <b>nothings</b> <b>are</b> things, and moving in ascending order to the assertions that all things <b>are</b> <b>nothing,</b> that things <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> but God, nothing but God, and finally God as Nothing. This scale of degrees is ultimately understood to mean that the <b>nothings</b> <b>are</b> nothinged by the nothinger nothinged. The mystical, theological, and philosophical implications of this are then discussed. Accordingly, the metaphysical significance of the word ‘nothing’ as relative rejection, rather than absolute denial, is seen to point to a grammatical ground as opposed to a grammatical fiction...|$|R
5|$|Possible remakes {{of one or}} more of the Hammer film adaptations {{were also}} mooted at various points during the 1990s, with Dan O'Bannon {{scripting}} a potential new version of The Quatermass Experiment in 1993, but again <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> eventually filmed. In February 2012 Simon Oakes, president of the revived Hammer Films, announced that a new Quatermass film was in active development.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{signs of}} human activity in Leigh are evidenced by a Neolithic stone axe found in Pennington and a bronze spearhead from south of Gas Street. A single Roman coin was found at Butts in Bedford. After the Roman departure from Britain, and {{into the history of}} Anglo-Saxon England, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> written about Leigh. However evidence for the presence of Saxons in what was a sparsely populated and isolated part of the country is provided by local township place names that incorporate the Old English suffix leah, such as Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E
5|$|The family records, many {{of which}} were {{translated}} and published in the , reveal the personality of the man who figures prominently in the history of colonization as the founder of the only successful patroonship that ever existed in New Netherland. But beyond the fact that he managed this patroonship and that he was a merchant and director of the West India Company, practically <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> known until the organization and translation of the family records in the early 1900s (decade).|$|E
