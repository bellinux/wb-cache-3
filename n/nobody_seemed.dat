[...] "Orson believed in good acting, and he realized that rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors.

500|$|After the Balls to Picasso {{supporting}} tour finished, {{he started}} {{working on a new}} studio record, Skunkworks. Dickinson decided that Skunkworks would be the title of the band as well, but the record company refused to release the album without his name on the cover. Dickinson hired producer Jack Endino, most noted for producing the first Nirvana album. The [...] "Skunkworks" [...] entity ceased to be when the tour ended. [...] "I was devastated by the Skunkworks thing", stated Dickinson, [...] "Skunkworks was a record which I tore myself apart to make and <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> to give a shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> to care. But now that there are all these guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I say, I think My Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E
500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. <b>Nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Jones {{enjoyed the}} fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{see beyond the}} craziness. Determined {{to show the world}} that he was capable of {{producing}} legitimate [...] "pretty" [...] music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of [...] "serious," [...] accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.|$|E

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but <b>nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E
2500|$|Jones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned [...] "No Money in This Deal", was {{recorded}} on January 19, and appeared in February on Starday Records, beginning the singer's association with producer and mentor H.W. [...] "Pappy" [...] Daily. The song was actually cut in Starday Records' co-founder Jack Starnes' {{living room and}} produced by Starnes. Jones also worked at KTRM (now KZZB) in Beaumont around this time. [...] Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones acquired the nickname [...] "possum" [...] while working there: [...] "One of the deejays there, Slim Watts, took to calling him George P. Willicker Picklepuss Possum Jones. [...] For one thing, he cut his hair short, like a possum's belly. [...] He had a possum's nose and stupid eyes, like a possum." [...] During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. [...] In later years, Jones would have little good {{to say about the}} music production at Starday, recalling to NPR in 1996 that [...] "it was a terrible sound. [...] We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. [...] You could hear the trucks. [...] We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again." [...] Jones' first hit came with [...] "Why Baby Why" [...] in 1955. [...] That same year, while touring as a cast member of the Louisiana Hayride, Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. [...] "I didn't get to know him that well," [...] Jones said of Presley to Nick Tosches in 1994. [...] "He stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room. [...] <b>Nobody</b> <b>seemed</b> to get around him much any length of time to talk to him." [...] Jones would, however, remain a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash. [...] Jones was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry in 1956.|$|E
