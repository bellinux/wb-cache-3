At the outset, there was a <b>national</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>plan</b> with six main activities: a) determinant analysis before the implementation of a guideline, b) innovation strategies tailored to the determinants, c) dissemination to all professionals, d) ongoing evaluation of the awareness and use of the guidelines, e) trained implementation coordinator(s) in each PCHC organization and f) a national help desk. The awareness and use of the guidelines in random samples of doctors, nurses and doctor's assistants were surveyed using questionnaires. The respondents stated (on a 7 -point scale) the proportion of all children they had exposed to given core elements in a guideline.

40|$|In November 2007 the {{countries}} around the Baltic Sea signed the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). The action plan was an initiative from HELCOM due to the environmental status in the Baltic Sea. The action plan implemented a new approach with measures targeting the whole ecosystem. Eutrophication, hazardous substances, biodiversity and maritime activities constituted the main segments. The parties were to establish <b>national</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> to fulfil the BSAP goals, which shall lead to good environmental status in the Baltic Sea by 2021.    The aim of this thesis is to investigate the points in common regarding conceptions of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea between the management, the science, {{the media and the}} public. There are often complex connections between scientific knowledge and decision-making. With the purpose to elucidate these connections the risk management of eutrophication was compared with the scientific knowledge in the area along with the perceptions of the public and media. The <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> of the HELCOM parties differ in both content and ambitions. Overall the <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> are technical and many of them give no background descriptions to the causes of eutrophication. The scientific uncertainty that surrounds the calculation models of eutrophication is mentioned in about half of the <b>implementations</b> <b>plans.</b> Some uncertainty is mentioned due to the timescale {{of the effects of the}} measures. This can be compared with the fact that some scientists mean that the BSAP goals are unrealistic. Several parties mention the agriculture as an important sector for the reduction of the nutrient supply to the Baltic Sea. The Russian, Lithuanian and Estonian <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> also put forward the municipality treatment plants as important actors. There is a big difference between how many times the notion “eutrophication” is mentioned in the <b>implementation</b> <b>plans.</b> In the German <b>implementation</b> <b>plan</b> the notion is mentioned most frequently (29 times), while the Danish <b>implementation</b> <b>plan</b> only mention the notion twice. In the Finnish, Polish and German <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> eutrophication is described as a big threat. Only in the Latvian, Polish and German <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> eutrophication is described as a risk. The analysis of the <b>implementation</b> <b>plan</b> content shows that the parties has not succeeded to fully use the risk notion in relation to eutrophication. This can affect the risk governance, but also the perception of eutrophication among different stakeholders. Both media and politics affect the complex interactions that constitute the fundament of the relationship between scientific knowledge and public risk awareness. The consequence of eutrophication that is given most of the space in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter is algal growth. 73 % of the Swedes consider the algal growth as a rather big issue or a very big issue. A plausible conclusion is that there is a connection between the descriptions of eutrophication in Swedish media and the perceptions and knowledge of eutrophication by the Swedish respondents. The perceptions and management of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea are surrounded by complex interactions, uncertainty in the scientific basis and ambiguous opinions. Despite this eutrophication is often treated as a simple risk. For the purpose of successful implementation of the action plans is it important that the public participate in the elaboration of the risk measures. To accomplish real change it might be necessary to make the complex interactions more visible and to make the public participate more. ...|$|R

Most island nations within the PIR are isolated from the developed nations and hold {{some of the most}} pristine and delicate ecosystems.

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} are either deliberately produced substances {{by the industry}} {{for a wide range}} of applications or occurred as byproducts from various activities, such as industrial or combustion processes. Despite a considerable decrease in POP levels during the last decades, unintentional production and accumulation of these substances still occur, mostly due to uncontrolled combustion processes, the lack of life cycle assessment and long-range transboundary air pollution. Remediation methods (mostly phytoremediation) are being developed in order to reduce POPs in the environment, but there are some legal obstacles of certain methods involving the application of transgenic plants, which might offer a fairly fast solution, provided that the precautionary principle is not compromised. The proper life-cycle analysis of industrial products, the combination of bio-energy crop production, constructed wetlands, reed-beds and phytoremediation resulting in complete agro-ecocycles, may constitute the basis of a sustainable, poison-free society.

We included municipal solid waste incineration, hazardous and medical waste incineration, pulp bleaching, sodium pentachlorophenate production and usage, illegal electrical and electronic waste ("e-waste") recycling, and ferrous and non-ferrous metal production, and prepared a preliminary analysis of dioxin emissions in China. The results show that ferrous metal production (104. 2 - 6648. 3 g TEQ), non-ferrous metal production (2. 6 - 3389. 8 g TEQ), and sodium pentachlorophenate production and usage (120 - 368. 0 g TEQ) should be major potential sources of dioxins and furans. Moreover, municipal solid waste and hazardous and medical waste incineration (35. 5 g TEQ) should also be considered high priority sources owing to a rapidly increasing incineration ratio anticipated for the near future.

It contains {{the results of}} a EuroSDR (European Spatial Data Research) project ‘Atlas of INSPIRE implementation methods’. Aim of the project was to make an inventory of experiences when implementing INSPIRE, in order to share exemplary practices and solutions among national mapping agencies and national INSPIRE contact points. This inventory formed the basis for the generation of the prototype Atlas for all national mapping agencies, policy makers and other stakeholders who have to implement INSPIRE. For SDI research the Atlas provides empirical base material for the conceptualization of SDI implementation approaches. The analytical framework to look at INSPIRE implementation drew on two theoretical notions of how implementation actions can lead to information infrastructure development: a cultivation approach and a design approach. A qualitative data collection process, through a survey and two workshops, tested the extent to which either of the two approaches were prevalent for the INSPIRE implementation. The survey and the workshops provided primary data on INSPIRE implementation experiences of representatives from twelve European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom). Comparing the national experiences showed that both types of approaches of INSPIRE implementation are present the EU countries. The cultivation approach is more prevalent in countries which established SDI organizational structures outside the NMAs, and the design approach is more prevalent in countries relying solely on NMAs for INSPIRE implementation. Embedding INSPIRE <b>implementation</b> in <b>national</b> SDI activities seems furthermore to relate to cultivation approaches, consisting of a gradually flatter inter-organizational working relations, and a scaling up strategy which iteratively links the (supra) <b>national</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> of INSPIRE to the local <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> in <b>national</b> and sub national organizations, and vice versa. The variety in approaches imply that a uniform, best practice, INSPIRE implementation approach for all countries does exist, but that the choices for certain practices strongly relate to the local contextual conditions and windows of opportunities. The implication of these findings for research in SDI development is that more emphasis should be placed on the mechanism of interaction between the slowly changing socio-organizational context and rapidly technologies.

To this end the toolkit combines sector specific activity data with related emission factors for releases to air, land, water, residues and products. In 2007 the Expert Group for updating and improving the Toolkit, chaired by the Secretariat of the SC (SSC) and UNEP, identified priority areas of reasearch. The group highlighted the need for screening POPs sources that so far are poorly characterized in the Toolkit. Among these, brick kilns in developing countries were given highest priority since so far, no data were available. The Expert Group recommended as a first step to measure soil or vegetation samples close to (small) brick kilns in developing countries to obtain preliminary orientation as to the impact from this source. In the fore field of the experimental planning the question in how far different kinds of fuels, in particular waste derived fuels, may impact the formation of POPs was approached through the analyses of bottom ashes from kilns co-incinerating waste in comparison with brick kilns operated with virgin wood. The results from bottom ash reveal a distinct impact on the presence of POPs in the brick making process when waste is co-incinerated, thus suggesting to include the brick kilns operated with waste fuels as a different category into the toolkit and to include the issue of co-incineration of waste into the experimental set up.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "As the current H 1 N 1 outbreak underscores, an influenza pandemic remains a real threat to our nation. Over the past 3 years, GAO conducted a body of work, consisting of 12 reports and 4 testimonies, to help the nation better prepare for a possible pandemic. In February 2009, GAO synthesized the results of most of this work and, in June 2009, GAO issued an additional report on agency accountability for protecting the federal workforce {{in the event of}} a pandemic.

However, culturally congruent, feasible interventions for HIV-positive women who have experienced past and/or current violence are not widely available. The Office on Women's Health Gender Forum has made several recommendations for responding to the <b>National</b> HIV/AIDS Strategy <b>Implementation</b> <b>Plan,</b> including recommendations to incorporate gender-based violence prevention into a comprehensive, gender-responsive national strategy.

Strong community partnerships, responsiveness to community needs and local cultural norms, a trained workforce, and culturally competent care are programmatic cornerstones of gender-responsive services. HIV-positive women with histories of gender-based violence and risk factors for current and future violence deserve the highest quality gender-responsive services to ensure that they can address their health needs within contexts of safety and respect. © 2011...|$|R
