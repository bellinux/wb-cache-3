Meanwhile, Bart and Todd find out about an upcoming children's miniature golf tournament, with the first prize of $50. They enter it, and although Todd {{is very good at}} miniature golf, Homer becomes confident that Bart will win. He tells Bart that it is <b>not</b> <b>okay</b> to lose and forces him to stare angrily at a picture of Todd for 15 minutes every day. Later, when Bart looks at his meager collection of trophies in his room, Lisa offers to help him practice. Utilizing spiritual books that calm Bart's mind, they meditate. Meanwhile, Homer makes a bet with Ned on whose boy is a better golfer: the father of the boy who does not win the tournament will mow the other father's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.|$|E

[...] The {{character}} is loosely based on his own father. He had O'Malley in mind when casting the role, and felt confident about his capability: [...] "It's a real tour de force role and I knew what Mike could do. This isn't an after-school special. ... It's heavy and Mike {{has the ability to}} cut through the sentiment." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Mike's talent is deep. I will always write for Mike O'Malley." [...] The actor did not have to audition, and was invited to read for the part by Murphy personally. The two men, along with Falchuk, had previously worked together on the television movie Pretty/Handsome. While reading the first twenty pages of script, O'Malley was not initially enthusiastic about playing the role, as the character appeared to be an intolerant stereotype. He changed his mind, however, after realizing that Burt was to be portrayed as a more accepting man, with [...] "grace and love that comes first for his son." ...|$|E

It's {{one thing to}} include him {{as part of a}} historical perspective, which I believe is okay, and it's another thing to promote him, which is <b>not</b> <b>okay.</b> The situation is very similar to that of O.J.

[...] In 2015, Benoit's name was mentioned as part of the WWE Network Monday Night Wars series that looks back at the fall of WCW.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Out Magazine, Amos used the song [...] "Maybe California", a track from the album in which a mother ruminates on leaving her husband and child(ren) [...] "better off" [...] as she contemplates suicide, to explain just how personal writing and composing both the song and the record as a whole were for her: [...] "I wouldn’t have written this record if I hadn’t been pushed — {{for all kinds of}} reasons. I don’t want to go into all of it but “Maybe California” doesn’t come from nowhere. You’re not able to write that by having a drink with somebody who’s had the experience and you haven’t. You have to be pushed to that place." [...] She speaks of the mother figure in the song: [...] "there's nothing that she can give to stop this terrible emotional cancer that has taken over her family - her life - everything around her." [...] Adding credence to the notion that the song is deeply autobiographical, Amos chose to highlight the despair older, more mature women, such as herself, face: [...] "I began to realize how serious this quiet, tragic problem was and that it's <b>not</b> <b>okay</b> to talk about it, whereas teen suicide - it gets discussed and it's almost something where there are [...] for it.

Sophia, a former actress, had been hanging around Santa Barbara disguised as a man because everyone believed she was dead. Augusta immediately informed C.C. Capwell, Sophia's former husband and the archenemy of Lionel, about the ruse. She then confronted Lionel, resulting in an old-fashioned food-fight that led to love making.|$|R
