40|$|In the {{telecoms}} industry, {{the need}} for standardised interfaces and independent <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> is of paramount importance, especially with the rapidly evolving 3 G. In 3 G telecoms systems, the number of <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> to be managed will increase compared to 2 G. Investing in vendor and implementation independent <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> is crucial to minimise hardware, development and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a telecoms system.

40|$|Using the 155 -h coordinated magnetograph data of Huairou and Big Bear Solar Observatories, we {{have studied}} the {{evolution}} and lifetime of magnetic <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> in an enhanced network region. Both statistical and counting methods give a mean lifetime of <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> of 50 h. The <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> are divided into two categories according to their evolution: 'breakup' and 'merging'. They have similar average lifetimes. We also find {{that the number of}} the elements that disappear by merging is about twice that by breakup. This may indicate that the creation and disappearance of magnetic <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> are balanced...|$|R

In the context of this paper, a security policy specifies access control rules on network traffic. We introduce the problem and give a software architecture to solve it. The solution has four components that form the distributed network element: the controller, adaptor, driver and the <b>network</b> <b>element.</b> We also discuss the application of the solution to two cases: one in which the <b>network</b> <b>element</b> is an ATM switch and the other in which the <b>network</b> <b>element</b> is an IP switch...|$|R

50|$|As a last resort, in {{the absence}} of higher quality timing, a <b>network</b> <b>element</b> can go into a {{holdover}} mode until higher-quality external timing becomes available again. In this mode, the <b>network</b> <b>element</b> uses its own timing circuits as a reference.|$|R
50|$|The {{services}} {{which are}} assigned to the customer in the customer relationship management (CRM) have to be provisioned on the <b>network</b> <b>element</b> which is enabling the service and allows the customer to actually use the service. The relation between a service configured in the CRM and a service on the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> {{is not necessarily a}} 1:1 relation. Some services can be enabled by more than one <b>network</b> <b>element,</b> e.g. the Microsoft Media Server (mms://) service.|$|R
50|$|The UNE-P model {{consisted}} of local loop and switching and transportation, and allowed CLECs {{to enter the}} market without investing in supporting equipment and facilities. The further Unbundled <b>Network</b> <b>Element</b> -inclusive enhanced extended loop (EEL) model allowed CLECs to serve customers more easily by using their own local and tandem switching equipment. While CLECs and new market entrants said UNE-P helped open the local telecommunications market, ILECs claimed Unbundled <b>Network</b> <b>Element</b> practices served as a heavily discounted resale of their own <b>network</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{creating}} traffic paths {{through a}} series of <b>Network</b> <b>Elements</b> has involved configuration of individual cross-connects on each <b>Network</b> <b>Element.</b> ASTN allows the user to specify the start point, end point and bandwidth required, and the ASTN agent on the <b>Network</b> <b>Elements</b> will allocate the path through the network, provisioning the traffic path, setting up cross-connects, and allocating bandwidth from the paths for the user requested service. The actual path that the traffic will take through the network is not specified by the user.|$|R

5000|$|In {{terms of}} the network {{management}} model, a network management station (NMS) is one that executes network management applications (NMAs) that monitor and control <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> (NE) such as hosts, gateways and terminal servers. These <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> use a management agent (MA) to perform the network management functions requested by the network management stations. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to communicate management information between the network management stations and the agents in the <b>network</b> <b>elements.</b> NMS is described in RFC 1157 [...] "A Simple Network Management Protocol".|$|R

40|$|Generally it {{has been}} {{considered}} that the plages and sunspots are the main contributors to the solar irradiance. There are small scale structures on the sun with intermediate magnetic fields that could {{also contribute to the}} solar irradiance. It has not yet been quantified how much of these small scale structures contribute to the solar irradiance and how much it varies over the solar cycle. In this paper, we used Ca II K images obtained from the telescope installed at Kodaikanal observatory. We report a method to separate the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> from the background structure and plage regions. We compute the changes in the <b>network</b> <b>element</b> area index during the minimum phase of solar cycle and part of the ascending phase of cycle 24. The measured area occupied by the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> is about 30 % and plages less than 1 % of the solar disk during the observation period from February 2008 - 2011. During the extended period of minimum activity it is observed that the <b>network</b> <b>element</b> area index decreases by about 7 % compared to the area occupied by the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> in 2008. A long term study of <b>network</b> <b>element</b> area index is required to understand the variations over the solar cycle. Comment: 12 pages, 9 Figures, Accepted for publication in RA...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} provides {{real time}} dynamic resource management to improve end-to-end QoS by mobile devices regularly updating a resource availability server (RAS) with resource update information. Examples of resource update information are device battery status, available memory, session bandwidth, delay, packet loss, and jitter, <b>network</b> <b>element</b> storage capacity, <b>network</b> <b>element</b> processing power. This information is made {{available by the}} RAS. In addition, the RAS generates and maintains predictive models and makes available predictive data from these models. <b>Network</b> <b>elements</b> and devices retrieve this information {{in the form of}} notifications from the RAS or by way of querying the RAS. The <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> and devices, based on these predictions, act to negotiate sessions to optimise QoS. In one embodiment the RAS is updated by only mobile devices subscribed to the operator which hosts the RAS. The update information is addressed to the RAS as a stand- alone entity. However, it is envisaged that the server may be hosted by multiple operators and may receive updates from devices subscribed to different operators. Also, it is envisaged that not only mobile devices but also <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> such as MMSCs may send update information...|$|R
