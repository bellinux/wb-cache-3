5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if <b>not</b> <b>likely,</b> <b>that</b> unit strengths changed {{over the course of the}} 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{also made}} {{preparations}} in late 1942 {{for the movement}} of the 9th Division back to Australia. Four large troop ships were allocated to the task, and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort. However, as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at Singapore and Japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near Aden, this was judged to be unacceptably risky, especially as it was <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret. Moreover, transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long-standing policy of assigning at least one capital ship to protect troop convoys in this region, and would not have been accepted by the Australian government. In November, the Chiefs of Staff Committee decided to allocate an escort to the convoy, but did not specify what it should comprise.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientific}} name Gavia was the Latin {{term for the}} smew (Mergellus albellus). This small sea-duck is quite unrelated to loons and {{just happens to be}} another black-and-white seabird which swims and dives for fish.

25|$|Because {{there has}} been no Supreme Court {{decision}} on the issue of what exactly constitutes a “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult to say whether the Bucci case is still good law. However, because {{there have been so many}} divergent opinions and fact specific determinations from subsequent cases, it is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the case would be strictly followed by other courts.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} many {{interesting}} special cases that are decidable. In particular, {{it is possible to}} reason about the behaviour of a network of finite-state machines.

This problem is PSPACE-complete, i.e., it is decidable, but it is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.|$|E

25|$|It {{is alleged}} by some that the Duke of Brunswick was well-inclined {{to enter into}} the views of the Pope, but that he found he could neither raise men nor money {{sufficient}} to warrant even a probability of success.

25|$|The {{taxpayer}} whose residence {{has been}} ‘locked’ into a trust {{has now been}} given another opportunity {{to take advantage of}} these CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> it will ever become available thereafter.|$|E

25|$|No {{data have}} been {{compiled}} showing the susceptibility {{of the sheep}} to disease, although tests have been run on similar species of sheep and the data may be similar. Since Marco Polo sheep are reluctant to approach people, it is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> they can catch diseases common to domestic flocks, although some domestic sheep are allowed to run wild over the mountains, and it is unknown if they {{come into contact with}} Marco Polo sheep. However, the shepherds in the area do not generally have access to veterinary care for their animals, and it is possible that these could transmit diseases to the wild sheep.|$|E
25|$|The {{trochanter}} is the basal {{segment of}} the telopodite; {{it is always a}} small segment in the insect leg, freely movable by a horizontal hinge on the coxa, but more or less fixed {{to the base of the}} femur. When movable on the femur the trochantero femoral hinge is usually vertical or oblique in a vertical plane, giving a slight movement of production and reduction at the joint, though only a reductor muscle is present. In the Odonata, both nymphs and adults, there are two trochanteral segments, but they are not movable on each other; the second contains the reductor muscle of the femur. The usual single trochanteral segment of insects, therefore, probably represents the two trochanters of other arthropods fused into one apparent segment, since it is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the primary coxotrochanteral hinge has been lost from the leg. In some of the Hymenoptera a basal subdivision of the femur simulates a second trochanter, but the insertion of the reductor muscle on its base attests that it belongs to the femoral segment, since as shown in the odonate leg, the reductor has its origin in the true second trochanter.|$|E
25|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field in}} southeastern British Columbia consists of numerous small, basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows. Many individual volcanoes {{in the field}} have been active for the last 3 million years during which time the region was covered by thick glacial ice at least twice, prior to the well known Fraser Glaciation (also known as the Wisconsin Glaciation). The origin of the volcanism is yet unknown but is probably related to crustal thinning. The last eruption in the field was at Kostal Cone in 1500. Volcanism within the field has also created the -high Helmcken Falls, which is the fourth highest waterfall in Canada. It owes its foundation to the deposits of volcanic rock that were placed down in the wide valley of the Murtle River. Layer upon layer of fresh lava created flat areas, over which enormous floods flowed during the last ice age. These floods shaped the upright cliff in the lava flows over which the river now flows. The protection of Helmcken Falls {{was one of the}} major causes for the development of Wells Gray Provincial Park. As a result, {{if it had not been}} for the volcanic eruptions, it is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> such a large wilderness region would have been made.|$|E

500|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Dinocephalosaurus {{used its}} long neck for {{breathing}} by extending it vertically.
