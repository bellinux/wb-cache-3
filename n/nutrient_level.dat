2500|$|Slow {{sand filters}} {{may be used}} where there is {{sufficient}} land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, {{at the bottom and}} finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or Schmutzdecke, {{on the surface of the}} filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available <b>nutrient</b> <b>level</b> which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.|$|E
5000|$|The picture {{surrounding}} hypoxia in Hood Canal is complex; research models {{point to}} more than one contributing factor: <b>Nutrient</b> <b>level.</b> <b>Nutrient</b> <b>level</b> is a large issue due to the human impact. The supply of nutrients, primarily nitrates, to the euphotic zone is thought to impact levels of dissolved oxygen. Nutrients feed algae, which under the right conditions, [...] "bloom" [...] and then die and decompose; the entire process requires a large amount of oxygen. This decreases the oxygen in the water column, lowering the dissolved oxygen level.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nutrient</b> <b>level</b> {{of certain}} macro and micronutrients varies {{throughout}} the life {{history of the}} organism. There are few large differences in nutrient levels between workers and gynes; however, gynes process lipids differently by retaining them. On the other hand, the differences in nutrient levels in reproductive larvae and non-reproductive larvae are strong. Additionally, nutrient levels does not change throughout the lifetime of both male and females Polistes metricus. Based on these observations, the <b>nutrient</b> <b>level</b> at the larval stage tends to correlate with the reproductive ability of the larvae as it develops.|$|E
50|$|Loch of the Lowes forms {{part of a}} {{chain of}} lochs known as the Lunan Lochs. The Lunan Lochs are Lochs Craiglush, Lowes, Butterstone, Clunie and Marlee, and are {{connected}} by the Lunan Burn, which drains into the River Isla, itself {{a tributary of the}} River Tay. Loch of the Lowes, along with Loch Craiglush and Loch Butterstone, are situated just north of the Highland Boundary Fault, and are mesotrophic lochs, and are characterised by a relatively low <b>nutrient</b> <b>level,</b> as their catchment areas are mostly acidic uplands. By comparison, Lochs Clunie and Marlee are situated south of the Highland Boundary Fault, and have a higher <b>nutrient</b> <b>level.</b> The Lunan Lochs are an example of a rare habitat in the United Kingdom, which start from nutrient-poor ogliotrophic lochs further upstream; to richer, mesotrophic lochs downstream.|$|E

50|$|Professor Alan Steinman {{explains}} {{that among the}} major causes for the algal blooms in general, and Lake Erie specifically, is because blue-green algae thrive with high nutrients, along with warm and calm water. Lake Erie, he says, is more prone to blooms {{because it has a}} high <b>nutrient</b> <b>level</b> and is shallow, which causes it to warm up more quickly during the summer.|$|E

50|$|Discretion {{should be}} used to {{determine}} whether one snack is a better choice than another based on nutrient density. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) establishes the amount of nutrients required daily to avoid deficiencies and allow the body to function properly. Knowing that one snack has more nutrients than another per calorie can help provide required nutrients without exceeding the discretionary calorie allowance. When analyzing the ratio of nutrients to calories in foods, the caloric level must be lower than the <b>nutrient</b> <b>level</b> in order for it to be nutrient dense. Otherwise, it could potentially cause a deficiency in an essential nutrient.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{pesticides}} to control chironomids (non-biting midges) is a potential threat to aquatic invertebrate and bird life; in 1984 about 220 shorebirds were killed at the lake {{as a result of}} such spraying. Increased groundwater abstraction may exacerbate already declining water levels. The area of bulrushes in the fringing vegetation has increased and threatens its ecological character by changing its floristics, reducing the amount of open water, and reducing the area of mudflat available to migratory shorebirds. Disturbance of waterbirds by humans and dogs may occur, especially in late summer and autumn when the lake is drying out. Increasing urbanisation of the catchment may change the water balance or increase the already high <b>nutrient</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

50|$|Eutrophication has {{occurred}} in the lake due to algal bloom; the dominant species causing this are algae: Microcystis sp and submerged macrophytes. Urbanization around the lake has also degraded water quality, which is a risk to public health {{of the people who are}} dependent on the lake for their water supply requirements. Siltation has caused reduction of storage capacity. Increase in <b>nutrient</b> <b>level</b> is also taking place on account of leaching from agricultural activity in the marginal agricultural lands around the lake periphery. These are some of the reasons attributed for lake degradation. The Udaipur city, set around the lakes, with its numerous hotels catering to the large influx of tourists and a large number of residential complexes on the slopes of the lake, also add pollutants to the lake.|$|E

5000|$|Today, {{livestock}} graze in open areas {{during the}} day, but are sheltered in corrals during the night, except for goats, which {{are permitted to}} manage on their own within limits. A similar pattern must have developed by {{the latter part of}} the 18th into the 19th century. Nonetheless, the disposal of livestock waste, which became woman's work, required a systematic way of disposing of it. And, over time, the women worked out a method for doing so. In organic gardening, their solution is called sheet composting or mulching. Over time, the women mixed a variety of other organic matter with the manure (kitchen scraps, harvest residues, and vegetative materials from a living fence or hedgerow) and piled it each day on their garden beds and trees to decompose and become nutritious humus. In the 20th century, livestock among the Fulɓe shifted from large animals to smaller types. Horses, perhaps due to the tsetse fly decreased, while goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry increased, and [...] n'dama cattle remain an integral asset.The tapade gardens of Fouta Djallon have been highly researched by international scholars from various disciplines. This research has revealed that the cuntuuje system has a higher soil <b>nutrient</b> <b>level</b> than any other soil in the region. Almost all labor, except for the initial preparation, is performed and managed by women and children, in the past and now, within each family group. The gardens are important for both food and cash crops for their families. PLEC, a project of the United Nations University, measured yields on 6.5 ha from tapade fields at Missidè Héïré, Fouta Djallon and found that maize yielded up to 7 t/ha, cassava 21 t/ha, sweet potatoes 19 t/ha, and groundnuts (peanuts) about 8 t/ha.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the tolerance to weed harrowing of four spring barley varieties {{and examined the}} possible interactions between varietal weed suppressive ability and two nutrient levels. Tolerance {{was defined as the}} combined effect of crop resistance (ability to resist soil covering) and crop recovery (the ability to recover in terms of yield). The weed harrowing strategy was a combination of one pre- and one post-emergence weed harrowing. In terms of yield, the four varieties responded significantly differently to weed harrowing and the response depended on <b>nutrient</b> <b>level.</b> At the lower <b>nutrient</b> <b>level,</b> weed harrowing caused an increase in yield of 4. 4 hkg ha- 1 for a strong competitor (cv. Otira), while there was no effect on yield at the higher <b>nutrient</b> <b>level.</b> For a weaker competitor (cv. Brazil), weed harrowing caused no change in yield at the lower <b>nutrient</b> <b>level,</b> whereas yield decreased by 6. 0 hkg ha- 1 at the higher <b>nutrient</b> <b>level.</b> There were marked differences between the weed suppressive ability of the four varieties when not harrowed, with less pronounced but significant differences when harrowed. Weed harrowing did not change the weed suppressive ability of a variety. Varieties that are tall at post-emergence harrowing and have increased density after pre-emergence harrowing, are the ones that benefit most from weed harrowing...|$|E
