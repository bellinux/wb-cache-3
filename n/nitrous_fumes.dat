50|$|The {{committee}} reported:“The sandwich panels {{used for}} the roof construction meet the legal requirements {{for this type of}} building with regard to the flammability and/or fire development. However, they do bring a huge danger. When heated the polyurethane will produce gases and smoke which may lead to an unexpected and quick spread of fire. Although the dangers of sandwich constructions have been previously acknowledged during fire hazard testing and fire practice, they are not known throughout the fire service.”These panels comply with the legal requirements that apply to such a building with regard to flammability and/or the spread of a fire, {{but at the same time}} they also present a major risk: if the panels are sufficiently heated, the polyurethane present will lead to gas emission, flammable and toxic fumes will be released. These fumes include ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, and <b>nitrous</b> <b>fumes.</b> The <b>nitrous</b> <b>fumes</b> have a characteristic yellow-brown colour. Initially, these fumes are released at the edges of the panels, but they also build up inside the sandwich panels themselves.|$|E

Known chemical toxicities of X material (uranium), <b>nitrous</b> <b>fumes,</b> fluorine, vanadium, magnesium, and lime are described followed by safe exposure levels, symptoms of exposure, and treatment recommendations. The report closes with an overview of general policy in a question and answer format...|$|E
40|$|Four {{cases of}} {{poisoning}} by <b>nitrous</b> <b>fumes</b> are reported. Three patients presented with pulmonary oedema, {{and one of}} these progressed to the phase of bronchiolitis obliterans; the fourth patient presented with the clinical features of bronchiolitis obliterans. Pulmonary function studies in both phases showed a predominantly restrictive pattern of ventilatory abnormality with a tendency to hypoxaemia, hypocapnia, and reduced transfer factor. Complete recovery followed prompt treatment with corticosteroids. It is emphasized that three of these four accidents were preventable. The oxides of nitrogen have been incriminated as {{the main cause of}} the pulmonary disease which follows exposure to fumes from slow burning nitrocellulose x-ray film (Nichols, 1930), the use of acetylene welders in confined spaces (Lindqvist, 1944; Norwood et al., 1966), detonation of certain types of explosives (Becklake, Goldman, Bosman...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{combustion}} experiments {{have been conducted}} for investigating the regression rates of mixed hybrid propellants using Red <b>Fuming</b> <b>Nitrous</b> Acid (RFNA) as liquid oxidizer and Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) {{with the addition of}} Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) upto 20 percent as the solid fuel. HTPB is the state-of-the-art binder used in solid propellant rocket motors and {{is considered to be a}} potential candidate fuel for hybrid rocket applications due to its higher regression rate characteristics, greater fuel value, higher carbon/hydrogen ratio and solid loading capability. One of the effective ways of increasing the regression rates in hybrids is the addition of solid oxidizer such as AP in the fuel in small percentages. This type of configuration is called “mixed hybrid ” and regression rate enhancement upto 100 % is obtained. A series of static tests are conducted to establish the ignition and combustion in the hybrid mode. It is seen that the hybrid propellant has burnt smoothly. The ignition pressure could also be controlled and kept to a reasonable value. Stable combustion within a variation of chamber pressure ± 2 % and combustion efficiency above 0. 95 was achieved. The characteristics of the combustion products are calculated using the NASA CEA code. Regression rate correlations for the different combinations are obtaine...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge based {{expert system}} to assess fires and. {{pollution}} due to fires in underground coal mIne A {{considerable amount of}} coal is lost due to the fires in underground/surface mines and it pollutes the natural environment because {{of the evolution of}} the pollutant gases like carbon monoxide, oxides of sulphur and <b>nitrous</b> <b>fumes</b> besides the unburnt hydrocarbons. Subsoil water loss in the area are severely damaging the strata. The movement of water overfire areas createfurther problems of low dissolved oxygen and downward movement of salts thereby increasing soil salinity, restricting end use potential of water. Hence, the knowledge based expert system model is developed for the combat of fires and also pollution due to fires by analysing the different causes of fires in underground workings with the help of certainty factor techniques. The modification of mining methods can be suggested to avoid dangerous combinations. These models help us to understand the optimisation of the parameters needed to controlfires as well as pollution due to fires in underground coal mines...|$|E
40|$|Carbonaceous Organic Aromatic Lump (COAL) is a {{heterogeneous}} and stratified Organic rock, formed from decay of vegetable matters or sub-merging forest due to tectonic movement with carbon content varies from 60 to 100 %. According to carbon content, Coals are classified in different stages like Peat (50. 9 %), Lignite (61. 8 %), Sub-Bituminous (64. 5 %), Semi-Bituminous (69. 5 %), Bituminous (78. 5 %), Anthracite (91 %), keeping in view that Graphite (100 %) {{will be the}} last stage of formation. As the major elemental constituents of coal are Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen and Sulphur so when these coals are exposed to open-air, it absorbs Oxygen from atmospheric air, liberating heat and ultimately leading to fire. As this liberation of heat is due to the characteristics of Coal, so it is known Spontaneous Heating or Auto-oxidation of Coal or Endogenous Fires which extends during mining. The propensity of this fire is so large noxious gases like CO, CO 2, SO 2, <b>Nitrous</b> <b>fumes</b> and ultimately, mining activity stops, by blocking up the huge amount of capital and sterilization of reserve [18]. This project deals with the assessment of propensity of different coal samples towards spontaneous heating by assessment of various constraints determined by experimental procedures. The intrinsic properties as well as susceptibility indices of the coal samples have factually been reflected to predict self-heating liability of coal. Four coal samples were collected from MCL (Mahanadi Coalfields Limited) and five from SECL (South Eastern Coalfields Limited), covering some coal fields of India. Liability of collected coal samples were determined using Crossing point temperature and Olpinski index apparatus and the intrinsic properties were determined using proximate analysis method following Indian standards. Based on the results correlation analysis was done among the parameters of proximate analysis and CPT and Sza, also found out the best correlation among them...|$|E
