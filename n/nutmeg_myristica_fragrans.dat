50|$|Nutmeg oil is a {{volatile}} essential oil from <b>nutmeg</b> (<b>Myristica</b> <b>fragrans).</b> The oil is colorless or light yellow and smells and tastes of nutmeg.

Among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with mean MIC value ranging from 0. 625 to 1. 25 ± 0. 00 (SD) mg/mL; P= 0. 017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean MBC value ranging from 0. 625 [*]mg/mL to 20 ± 0. 00 (SD) mg/mL. While for seed and mace of <b>Myristica</b> <b>fragrans,</b> their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. All of the extracts of <b>Myristica</b> <b>fragrans</b> did not show any antibacterial activities against Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586. Thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of <b>Myristica</b> <b>fragrans</b> to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of molluscicidal components of <b>Myristica</b> <b>fragrans</b> Houtt. (Myristicaceae) on certain enzymes in the nervous tissue of freshwater snail Lymnaea acuminata Lamarck (Lymnaeidae). In vivo and in vitro treatments of trimyristin and myristicin (active molluscicidal components of <b>Myristica</b> <b>fragrans</b> Houtt.) significantly inhibited the acetylcholinesterase (AChE), acid and alkaline phosphatase (ACP/ALP) activities in the nervous tissue of Lymnaea acuminata. The inhibition kinetics of these enzymes indicates that both the trimyristin and myristicin caused competitive noncompetitive inhibition of AChE. Trimyristin caused uncompetitive and competitive/noncompetitive inhibitions of ACP and ALP, respectively whereas the myristicin caused competitive and uncompetitive inhibition of ACP and ALP, respectively. Thus results from the present study suggest that inhibition of AChE, ACP, and ALP by trimyristin and myristicin in the snail Lymnaea acuminata may be the cause of the molluscicidal activity of <b>Myristica</b> <b>fragrans...</b>|$|R
