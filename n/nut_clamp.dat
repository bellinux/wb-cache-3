50|$|The {{key length}} of the {{workpiece}} (for example screws, <b>nuts,</b> <b>clamps)</b> is nominally {{the same as that}} on the tool.|$|R
50|$|The body {{is small}} {{with a deep}} double cutaway similar to the Fender Swinger. The tuning {{machines}} are found on the upper edge of the triangular headstock and a locking <b>nut</b> <b>clamps</b> the strings behind a plastic nut, as typically found on Fender guitars. The rosewood fretboard has 24 jumbo frets and features a locking nut. The bridge is a floating System I tremolo. The controls have inset rubber grips, the tuning heads have fully enclosed gears, and the jack socket is an enclosed, not 'skeleton', type, in contrast to many other Fender products with 'economy' hardware. A variety of metallic poly finishes were available including a sunburst pattern (non-metallic).|$|R
40|$|System {{for testing}} bolts with various platings, lubricants, nuts, and {{tightening}} procedures tests 200 fasteners, and processes and summarizes the results, within one month. System measures input torque, <b>nut</b> rotation, bolt <b>clamping</b> force, bolt shank twist, and bolt elongation, data is printed in report form. Test apparatus is described...|$|R
50|$|The {{damping force}} of a {{friction}} shock absorber is adjusted with the central pivot and clamping bolt. A star-shaped spring applies a force to the stack of disks. The damping force is roughly proportional to this force and the <b>clamping</b> <b>nut</b> is provided with a pointer arm to indicate the approximate setting.|$|R
50|$|Hanging crafts can project {{abstract}} shapes {{fashioned from}} sheet metal, wood, paper or plastic materials, connected by wire or chord, whose individual elements {{are capable of}} moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or direct contact. Heavy hangings are hung with a lag bolt with deep grooves in the threads for maximum grip, or with a toggle bolt that uses a large collapsible <b>nut</b> to increase <b>clamping</b> pressure of the bolt.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrical}} generator has been integrated with a locally produced, biomass-fed clay cooking stove in rural Malawi. The generator produces {{small amounts of}} electricity based on the thermoelectric effect. Five demonstrator stoves were deployed into a rural community in the Balaka district for up to 6 months. This study investigates the power generation performance of the devices over the first 80 days of the field trial. It was determined that the users were able to charge mobile phones, lights and radios from the generator stoves. The power generating performance of the stoves deteriorated slightly over the 80 day period. The {{was due to the}} effects of thermal cycling on the generator system as a whole which caused eventual drying out of the thermal paste and a loosening of the <b>clamping</b> <b>nuts</b> which reduces <b>clamping</b> pressure and power output. One stove failed due to a mechanical problem. It was found that the power produced significantly exceeded the power consumed in most cases, which indicates an over-supply. It appears that 3 W h is sufficient to meet the average daily electrical power requirements for the participants in this study. The data obtained from the field trial has been used to inform a redesign of the device for a second field trial...|$|R
40|$|Company XYZ {{wanted to}} improve product quality and {{productivity}} by enhancing the current process for inserting copper <b>nuts.</b> The <b>clamping</b> device {{has an important}} role in this manufacturing process. The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle has been known to promote never-ending improvement and was chosen as the process improvement methodology to improve process variation and help make profit for the company. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to help improve manufacturing eficiency by implementing continuous improvement methods for analyzing the current process and redesign the clamping apparatus for the company. The objectives of this study were to 1. Create and evaluate a flow chart of current operation steps to determine thecompany's current performance. 2. Gather and analyze the data to determine the company's current performance. 3. Learn the relationship between the operator and the clamping device. 4. Develop a new clamping apparatus for effective processing...|$|R
30|$|Version 2 (Fig.  3 b) {{was created}} to improve the {{shortcomings}} of Version 1. Two stainless steel clamps were made to house {{the body and the}} two end-caps by using four stainless steel studdings and wing <b>nuts</b> holding the <b>clamps.</b> This design improved the leakage problem and minimized incidences of breakage. However, this design was inconvenient for packing sediment material because the lower end-cap and the body were not fixed together once the upper end-cap was taken off for packing. Furthermore, manufacturing of the stainless steel clamps was costly.|$|R
40|$|A failed oxygen-charging valve of an {{aircraft}} was analyzed. Evidences suggest that fire was caused due to leakage in the valve. Analysis {{shows that the}} leakage was due to failure of the sealing in the valve. This had resulted in sudden movement of the spindle in the axial direction. The movement appears to have caused frictional heating at the threaded region of the spindle. The heat thus generated resulted in ignition of aluminium {{in the presence of}} high-pressure oxygen. Following this, the hand-wheel along with the spindle had popped out of the valve by fracturing the <b>clamping</b> <b>nut...</b>|$|R
50|$|The bevel {{protractor}} {{is used to}} establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12° and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°. The {{bevel protractor}} consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by thumb <b>nut</b> and <b>clamp.</b> When {{the edges of the}} beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way. Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn case of KAPS and KGS, {{different}} ingots {{were used}} for manufacturing the coolant channels. Due to difference in the creep related material properties of different ingots, the coolant channels in these reactors experienced different creep rate. Due to the differential creep rates, especially in the neighboring channels, the coolant channels {{came into contact with}} each other. This is a serious deviation from as installed conditions wherein the gaps and spacing between closely assembled coolant channel components are decided based on accurate assessment of known loads and forces. Differential creep results in closing of gaps between neighboring feeder pipes or between feeder pipe and gray-loc clamp. Depending on the orientation of the clamp and direction of the feeder pipe at that location, worst contact could be between the first elbow of feeder pipe and the sharp edge of the crown <b>nut</b> on <b>clamp.</b> Several such contacts have been detected in KAPS and KGS. Seriousness of the contact emerges {{from the fact that the}} coolant channel and the feeder pipes vibrate due to coolant flow with high velocity. With time the contact conditions like the contact force and location(s) of contact change and this has significant influence on the life and performance of the coolant channel as a whole. Since feeder pipes are constantly vibrating, the contacting locations are likely to be dented or damaged. Whenever and wherever possible, NPCIL has tried to remove the contact locally. Since the process of creep is ongoing, more and more feeder pipes are likely to come in contact and those in which the local corrections for removing the contact are made could also need correction as the time progresses. In order to assess the severity of damage, a full scale setup was erected. Contact was established between feeder pipe and the hard locking <b>nut</b> of gray-loc <b>clamp.</b> Based on previous vibration data collected from feeder pipes and end fittings, and the ASME‘s O&M guidelines on acceptable level of piping vibration in nuclear piping, vibration was induced in the contacting feeder pipes. The test was continued for more than 1007 cycles. On the basis of damage seen on the feeder pipe due to contact, R 6 method has been employed to determine the critical crack size in the feeder pipe with a postulated axial part-through semi-elliptical crack. The failure assessment diagram was constructed in the K-L plane. The lowest critical crack depth was calculated as 4. 67 mm as against observed depth of dent of 1. 1 mm. The paper deals with the critical assessment of contact between neighboring coolant channels caused by differential creep and assessment of safety margin available before corrective action need to be initiated...|$|R
