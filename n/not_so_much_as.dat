5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> in heavy draft breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E
5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E

25|$|Buddhist teacher S.N. Goenka {{describes}} Buddhadharma as a 'pure {{science of}} mind and matter'. He claims Buddhism uses precise, analytical philosophical and psychological terminology and reasoning.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the biblical text Vulgate editions almost invariably print 17 prologues, 16 of which were written by Jerome. Jerome's prologues were written <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> prologues than as cover letters to specific individuals to accompany copies of his translations. Because they were not intended for a general audience, some of his comments in them are quite cryptic. These prologues are to the Pentateuch, to Joshua, and to Kings, which is also called the Prologus Galeatus.|$|E

Single-seat fighters that lacked wingmen were shown to be especially vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Various ancient peoples {{enjoyed a}} {{reputation}} for skill with the sling. Thucydides mentions the Acarnanians and Livy refers to the inhabitants of three Greek cities on the northern coast of the Peloponnesus as expert slingers. Livy also mentions {{the most famous of}} ancient skillful slingers: the people of the Balearic Islands. Of these people Strabo writes: And their training in the use of slings used to be such, from childhood up, that they would <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> give bread to their children unless they first hit it with the sling.|$|E
25|$|In forming {{their view}} of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes {{inherited}} from the Greeks. These were the vilest creatures imaginable. They came from the North and everyone knew that the colder the climate was, the more barbaric the people were. They knew nothing of metal, had no religion and lived like savages, without fire, eating their food raw, living off roots, and meat tenderized by placing it under their horses' saddles. They had no buildings, of course, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a reed hut, indeed, they feared {{the very idea of}} venturing under a roof.|$|E

25|$|Some contemporaries of Couturat, notably Edward Sapir saw the {{challenge}} of an auxiliary language <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> that of identifying a particular linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to pressing pragmatic problems of communication, but rather as one of promoting the principle of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though scholarly interest waned greatly throughout the 20th century, such differences of approach persist today. Some scholars and interested laymen make concrete language proposals. By contrast, Pei and others place the broader societal issue first. Yet others argue {{in favor of a}} particular language while seeking to establish its social integration.|$|E
25|$|Non-possessiveness: Many polyamorists view {{excessive}} {{restrictions on}} other deep relationships {{as less than}} desirable, as such restrictions {{can be used to}} replace trust with a framework of ownership and control. It is usually preferred or encouraged that a polyamorist strive to view their partners' other significant others (often referred to as OSOs) in terms of the gain to their partners' lives rather than a threat to their own (see compersion). Therefore, jealousy and possessiveness are generally viewed <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> something to avoid or structure the relationships around, but as responses that should be explored, understood, and resolved within each individual, with compersion as a goal.|$|E
25|$|Around 20 dance suites {{transmitted}} in a 1683 manuscript (now destroyed) {{were previously}} attributed to Pachelbel, but today his authorship is questioned {{for all but}} three suites, numbers 29, 32 and 33B in the Seiffert edition. The pieces are clearly not without French influence (but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Buxtehude's) and are comparable in terms of style and technique to Froberger's suites. Seventeen keys are used, including F-sharp minor. Number 29 has all four traditional movements, the other two authentic pieces only have three (no gigue), and the rest follow the classical model (Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue), sometimes updated with an extra movement (usually less developed), a more modern dance such as a gavotte or a ballet. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. It has been influentially argued by J. C. Holt that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, {{and that it would}} be mistaken to see in him a figure of peasant revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes. He appears <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes. Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} year, the social psychologist Gerhard Vinnai (University of Bremen), came to similar conclusions. When writing his work Hitler – Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; “Hitler – Failing and rage of destruction”), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitler’s book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the destructive potential in Hitler's psyche <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a result of early childhood experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War I. Not only Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitler’s political world view could have emerged from his trauma and how this could appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E
25|$|The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 {{prohibited}} contraception {{and required}} sex crimes cases {{to be tried}} in camera, preventing media coverage and contributing to the illusion of Irish purity. In the 1950s there was much public attention around the plight of Irish women working as prostitutes in England. These were portrayed <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 'fallen' women, but rather as innocents lured into evil. The Women’s Liberation Movement of the 1970s helped to expose the double standards. Notable {{was the story of}} June Levine who collaborated with Lyn Madden, a former Dublin sex worker for twenty years in the 70s and 80s, to write Lyn: A Story of Prostitution (1987) Madden had seen her lover and pimp John Cullen firebomb the home of former sex worker and women's rights activist Dolores Lynch. Lynch perished in the fire together with her elderly mother and aunt. Madden denounced Culen and began writing the book during the ensuing trial, at which Cullen received eighteen years imprisonment. At around this time a group of street sex workers brought a successful supreme court challenge to the constitutionality of Victorian laws that required a defendant to first be identified as a common prostitute through the citing of previous convictions before conviction was possible. This successful challenge created a situation of effective decriminalisation, that also offered the women the same access to the protection of the law as anyone else. During this period prostitutes were largely independent and had a good relationship with the Gardaí. Pimping was almost unheard of, as were the other crimes previously associated with prostitution. Any suggestion of organised prostitution was limited to a small number of massage parlours in an environment where the workers were empowered to negotiate favourable terms and conditions for themselves. Also improving economic conditions and a weakening force of the Church allowed for a more visible and largely tolerated sex industry.|$|E

500|$|Astley {{became more}} industrialised {{during the early}} 19th century, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{neighbouring}} [...] Leigh, Tyldesley and Boothstown. A factory was built by James and Robert Arrowsmith on Peel Lane at [...] Astley Green, near the Bridgewater Canal in 1833. Until then, agriculture and cottage spinning and weaving had been the main economic activities. Fustians, muslins and, after 1827, silk were woven in the area. Handloom weaving declined after the cotton factory was built. Arrowsmith's factory lasted until 1955, when mining subsidence damaged its foundations and it was demolished, ending Astley's link with the textile industry.|$|E
500|$|In Muslim societies, {{insulting}} Muhammad {{is considered}} one of the gravest of all crimes. According to Ana Belen Soage of the University of Granada, [...] "The Islamic sharî'a has traditionally considered blasphemy punishable by death, although modern Muslim thinkers such as Mohammad Hashim Kamali maintain that, given that the Quran does not prescribe a punishment, determining a penalty is left to the judicial authorities of the day." [...] In the Quran itself, [...] "God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca." [...] Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> against pictures in general. According to the BBC, [...] "It is the satirical intent of the cartoonists and the association of the Prophet with terrorism, that is so offensive to the vast majority of Muslims." [...] This link played into a widespread perception among Muslims across the world that many in the West are hostile towards Islam and Muslims.|$|E
