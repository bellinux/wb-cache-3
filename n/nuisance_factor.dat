30|$|Experimental {{design has}} three principles: randomization, replication, and blocking. The {{order of the}} runs in the {{experimental}} design is randomly determined. Randomization helps in avoiding violations of independence caused by extraneous factors, and the assumption of independence should always be tested. Replication is an independent repeat of each combination of factors. It allows the experimenter to obtain {{an estimate of the}} experimental error. Blocking is used to account for the variability caused by controllable nuisance factors, to reduce and eliminate the effect of this factor on the estimation of the effects of interest. Blocking does not eliminate the variability; it only isolates its effects. A <b>nuisance</b> <b>factor</b> is a factor that may influence the experimental response but in which we are not interested.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nuisance</b> <b>factors</b> in a protein-array study add obfuscating {{variation}} to spot intensity measurements, {{diminishing the}} {{accuracy and precision}} of protein concentration predictions. The effects of <b>nuisance</b> <b>factors</b> may be reduced by design of experiments, and by estimating and then subtracting nuisance effects. Estimated nuisance effects also inform {{about the quality of}} the study and suggest refinements for future studies. We demonstrate a method to reduce nuisance effects by incorporating a non-interfering internal calibration in the study design and its complemental analysis of variance. We illustrate this method by applying a chip-level internal calibration in a biomarker discovery study. The variability of sample intensity estimates was reduced 16 % to 92 % with a median of 58 %; confidence interval widths were reduced 8 % to 70 % with a median of 35 %. Calibration diagnostics revealed processing nuisance trends potentially related to spot print order and chip location on a slide. The accuracy and precision of a protein-array study may be increased by incorporating a non-interfering internal calibration. Internal calibration modeling diagnostics improve confidence in study results and suggest process steps that may need refinement. Though developed for our protein-array studies, this internal calibration method is applicable to other targeted array-based studies. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Missing {{data are}} a widely {{recognized}} <b>nuisance</b> <b>factor</b> in phylogenetic analyses, {{and the fear}} of missing data may deter systematists from including characters that are highly incomplete. In this paper, I used simulations to explore the consequences of including sets of characters that contain missing data. More specically, I tested whether the benets of increasing the number of characters outweigh the costs of adding missing data cells to a matrix. The results show that the addition of a set of characters with missing data is generally more likely to increase phylogenetic accuracy than decrease it, but the potential benets of adding these characters quickly disappear as the proportion of missing data increases. Furthermore, despite the overall trend, adding characters with missing datadoes decrease accuracy in some cases. In these situations, themissing data entries are not themselves misleading, but their presence maymimic the effects of limited taxon sampling, which can positively mislead. Criteria are discussed for predicting whether adding characters with missing datamay increase or decrease accuracy. The results of this study also suggest that accuracy can be increased to a surprising degree by (1) “lling the holes ” in a data matrix as much as possible (even when relatively few taxa are missing data), and (2) adding fewer characters scored for all taxa rather than adding a larger number of characters known for fewer taxa. Missing data can also be eliminated from an analysis through the exclusion of incomplete taxa rather than incomplete characters, but this approach may reduce the usefulness of the analysis and (in some cases) the accuracy of the estimated trees.
