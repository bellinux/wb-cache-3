40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} studies were {{conducted}} to determine the basis for increased sensitivity of people to noise during aircraft noise studies.

In order to investigate the time-of-day factor, noise sensitivity measures were obtained from subjects at home with cassette tape recorders/headsets over a 24 hour period. The effect of number of aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> on <b>noise</b> sensitivity was investigated within a laboratory. In these tests, measures of sensitivity to noise were obtained from subjects before and after their exposure to varying numbers of aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>events.</b> The 24 hour data showed no evidence that noise sensitivity is physiologically cyclical. Consequently, these data can not explain annoyance response variation to aircraft noise tests conducted during the daytime.

While there have been attempts to apply similar noise-event concepts to road and rail traffic noise signals for many decades, the idea has remained largely peripheral to the current paradigm of surface traffic noise measurement, assessment and management.

The value of the tradeoff cannot be confidently specified in any survey because the tradeoff estimate may have a large standard error of estimate and because the tradeoff estimate may be seriously biased by unknown noise measurement errors.

Sleep disturbance was measured by several indices of behaviorally confirmed awakening (button pushes upon awakening) and body movement (as measured with wrist-worn actimeters).

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of unexpected aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> will frequently evoke intense complaints about annoyance over such events. It is {{recognized that the}} relationship between the volume of complaints and the corresponding maximum noise levels does in fact depend on the circumstances of the complainants and the time of year. The frequency of {{occurrence of}} the respective <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> is also a factor. The possible practical value of the addition of the maximal noise level, to the well-known cumulative noise descriptors L(sub eq), L(sub dn), etc. may be considered. One might start by considering the difference between the L(sub eq) and the average maximal noise level of the twenty loudest single <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> on an average day. A somewhat less sharply focused consideration of the maximum noise levels was adopted. In that standard the scope of noise-mitigation measures is defined generally with reference to L(sub eq). If the average maximal noise level L(sub max) of the entire aircraft fleet mix exceeds the L(sub eq) by more than 20 dB(A) and if more than 20 daily aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> exceed the L(sub eq) than the difference L(sub max) - 20 becomes the key criterion for noise-mitigation measures. A statistical correlation {{of a large number of}} data from aircraft-noise-monitoring sensors located both directly underneath and laterally disposed to an aircraft flight-path has supplied a basis for the determination of the distribution of the maximal noise levels about the average value, L(sub max), of each type of aircraft.

We simulate the time-varying noise level histories at various distances from roadways using a dynamic micro-traffic model and a distribution of sound power levels of individual vehicles.

40|$|Introduction: Surveys {{suggest that}} - {{at the same}} noise level - railway noise is less {{annoying}} than aircraft or road traffic noise. Thus, railway noise is less strongly regulated in some European countries. However, in a laboratory study performed at the DLR-Institute of Aerospace Medicine railway noise lead to higher degrees of sleep fragmentation than aircraft noise. Our objective was to compare reactions to aircraft and railway noise in the field. Methods: In a field study on railway noise, 33 healthy participants (mean age 36. 2 years ± 10. 3 (SD); 22 females) were examined during nine consecutive nights. Polysomnography and <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> were recorded during every night. In total, 8866 railway <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> were used for analysis of noise-induced awakenings.

The number of <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> and LAS,eq were kept constant. Each morning noise annoyance questionnaires and performance tasks were administered. Aircraft noise annoyance ranked first followed by railway and road noise. A possible explanation is the longer duration of aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> used in this study compared to road and railway <b>noise</b> <b>events.</b> In contrast to road and rail traffic, aircraft noise annoyance was higher after nights with combined exposure. Pooled noise exposure data showed small but significant impairments in reaction times (6 ms) compared to nights without noise. The noise sources did not have a differential impact on performance. Combined exposure to multiple traffic noise sources did not induce stronger impairments than a single noise source. This was reflected also in low workload ratings...|$|R

Transient Event Detection is a relevant issue in many different fields, and much work has been done to find methods that work in specific applications.

Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for instance {{is one of the most}} widely used methods for speech processing, and is used in many commercial programs that has to deal with transient noise events, like automatic speech recognizers. There is a lack of an extensive comparison of the existing methods, to find how well they perform against each other.

The speech used is from the TIMIT database, and a wide variety of transients are mixed in with the speech to test the detection performance of the different methods. Some tweaks to existing algorithms are proposed. It turns out that a well-trained MFCC Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), reaches almost 100 % correct detection.

This paper reports on a secondary analysis of a large sample of maximum pass-by noise data that was collected in Brisbane, Australia. The data set provides the noise level maxima (LAFmax) of the pass-by of some 85, 000 vehicles in service on urban arterials and motorways. Concurrent attended monitoring of vehicle type has allowed an analysis of the distribution of the noise level maxima according to some road characteristics and for the range of the different types of vehicle. There have often been suggestions that road traffic noise criteria should include, in addition to integrated energy measures such as Leq, Lden or similar, some metric of the individual <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> (LAFmax, SEL) or number of <b>noise</b> <b>events,</b> generated by individual noisier vehicles within the traffic stream. Apart from selecting such a metric in terms of its relationship to health impacts, such as sleep disturbance, that metric needs to be able to be measured reliably, and preferably able to be predicted.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: It is a {{well known}} fact that noise {{annoyance}} depends on the traffic mode. Much less is known about differences in physiological effects, especially on combined effects. Therefore, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) investigated the effects of air (AI), road (RO) and rail (RA) traffic noise on sleep in the AIRORA study. METHODS: 72 subjects (40 +/- 13 years, 32 male) were polysomnographically investigated during 11 consecutive nights in the laboratory. Electrophysiological signals included EEG, EOG, EMG, EKG, respiratory movements and finger pulse amplitude. Cortisol and noradrenalin were measured in nocturnal urine samples. Each traffic mode consisted of five noise categories (maximum SPL 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65 dBA) with 8 different <b>noise</b> <b>events,</b> i. e. 40 <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> in total. Therefore, between 40 and 120 <b>noise</b> <b>events</b> were realistically played back during single (AI, RO, RA, RORO), double (AIRO, AIRA, RORA) and triple (AIRORA) exposure nights. The design was complemented with a noise-free control night and carefully balanced. RESULTS: Although annoyance due to aircraft noise was stronger compared to both rail and road traffic noise, preliminary analyses of parts of the physiological data {{do not support the}} same order.
