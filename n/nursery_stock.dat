25|$|Crown gall disease {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best means of control for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of <b>nursery</b> <b>stock</b> and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial entry. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E
25|$|O.glaber is more {{potentially}} dangerous {{in some places}} than in others. The United States, and especially the state of California, prohibits the ant from entering lest it should disrupt the country's ecosystems. Its relationship with honeydew-producing insects and consumption of parasitoids could disrupt the biological control of certain pests, risking long-term ecological damage that could reduce biodiversity, disrupt natural communities, or change ecosystem processes. Therefore, the high-risk team and dog team of the California Department of Food and Agriculture have intercepted the ant in <b>nursery</b> <b>stock</b> and fresh plants from Hawaii, and a border station found and stopped it on beehives from Florida. California is especially vulnerable to O.glaber infestation because the state's climate resembles that of those regions where the ant already lives. Nonetheless, O.glaber would not lower crop yields, increase farming costs, degrade water supplies, or likely disrupt Californian agricultural commodity markets.|$|E

40|$|Field plots {{were used}} to assess the {{restoration}} potential of three salt marsh species, Juncus maritimus, Leptocarpus similis and Schoenoplectus pungens, within an established salt marsh near Christchurch, New Zealand. A split-block design was used to asses the effects of soil type, (soil from a proposed marsh construction site or estuarine mud from a natural salt marsh), species and plant source (commercial <b>nursery</b> <b>stocks</b> or natural marsh stock). In December, after 9 months, there was no mortality in L. similis and {{a significant increase in the}} biomass compared with J. maritimus. S. pungens failed to regenerate following seasonal die-back. Plant biomass was unaffected by soil type, despite occasional higher salinities recorded in the reclamation soil. Natural stocks had significantly higher biomass than <b>nursery</b> <b>stocks</b> (p < 0. 01). These results suggest that both L. similis and J. maritimus are appropriate species for transplanting in the Canterbury region and that the soil from the proposed area is suitable for the restoration and construction of tidal wetlands. The success of the transplants could be enhanced by sourcing hardy stock and management regimes may be necessary to reduce salinity extremes and herbivory by rabbits.

2500|$|A plant nursery is an {{agricultural}} operation where (non-bonsai) plants are propagated and grown to usable size. <b>Nursery</b> <b>stock</b> {{may be available}} directly from the nursery, or may be sold in a garden centre or similar resale establishment. <b>Nursery</b> <b>stock</b> is usually young but fully viable, and is often potted with sufficient soil to allow plants to survive a season or two before being transplanted into a more permanent location. Because the nursery tree is already pot-conditioned, it can be worked on as a bonsai immediately.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} of damage on beech in Europe since the 1990 s, especially in central Europe and Germany. The first report on beech in Sweden was in 2010 in Malmö and since then there have been additional observations of symptomatic beech trees at multiple locations, among which Söderåsens national park is one such location. The aim of this thesis was to investigate which Phytophthora species are present at Söderåsen and to confirm previous observations of symptomatic trees within the park. Through tissue plating and environmental sequencing the presence of Phytophthora at Söderåsen was confirmed, specifically Phytophthora plurivora and Phytophthora cambivora, of which P. plurivora is a newly confirmed species. The main spreading pathway of Phytophthora in Europe is thought to be via <b>nursery</b> <b>stocks.</b> Between 2002 and 2006 many trees were planted at Söderåsen, grown at <b>nursery</b> <b>stocks</b> in Germany and Poland. This is one possible spreading pathway through which Phytophthora may have become established at Söderåsen. Finally, this thesis gives further suggestions for management strategies within the park, of which monitoring of new symptomatic trees is the most pressing one. The success of sampling Phytophthora is heavily dependent on the freshness of the sampled lesions. For further research it is of importance to sample symptomatic trees soon after discovery for best chance of isolation success. These results give further understanding of the Phytophthora situation at Söderåsen, however there is still a lot to understand about these pathogens and how they interact with their surroundings. Further monitoring and management strategies will be needed for the future ensuring of Söderåsen as a hotspot for nature conservation in Sweden and Scandinavia...|$|R
