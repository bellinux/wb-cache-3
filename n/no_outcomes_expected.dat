Although the negotiation process started on 15 th January 2000, there were <b>no</b> <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes</b> as of end of October 2008. In order to identify the challenges of the negotiation process, the study has specifically provided in-depth analyses of the land conflict and the negotiation process in Mulanje. The study consequently has recommended, among other things, the introduction of conflict transformation initiatives as a way of mending the relationship between the conflicting parties, institutionalization of conflict management training, review of the role of government and strategic cooperation of stakeholders in addressing the structural causes of conflicts among other recommendations.

While in vertebrates behaviour can be driven by <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes,</b> it is unknown whether {{this is true for}} non-vertebrates as well. We find that, in the Drosophila larva, odour memories are expressed behaviourally only if animals can <b>expect</b> a positive <b>outcome</b> from doing so. The <b>expected</b> <b>outcome</b> of tracking down an odour is determined by comparing the value of the current situation with the value of the memory for that odour. Memory is expressed behaviourally only if the <b>expected</b> <b>outcome</b> is positive. This uncovers a hitherto unrecognized evaluative processing step between an activated memory trace and behaviour control, and argues that learned behaviour reflects the pursuit of its <b>expected</b> <b>outcome.</b> Shown in a system with a simple brain, an apparently cognitive process like representing the <b>expected</b> <b>outcome</b> of behaviour seems to be a basic feature of behaviour control...|$|R

40|$|According to self-efficacy theory, self-efficacy—defined as {{perceived}} capability {{to perform a}} behavior—causally influences <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes</b> of behavior, but not vice versa. However, {{research has shown that}} <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes</b> causally influence self-efficacy judgments, and some authors have argued that this relationship invalidates self-efficacy theory. Bandura has rebutted those arguments saying that self-efficacy judgments are not invalidated when influenced by <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes.</b> This article focuses on a contradiction in Bandura’s rebuttal. Specifically, Bandura has argued (a) <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes</b> cannot causally influence self-efficacy, but (b) self-efficacy judgments remain valid when causally influenced by <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes.</b> While the debate regarding outcome expectancies and self-efficacy has subsided in recent years, the inattention to this contradiction has led to a disproportionate focus on self-efficacy as a causal determinant of behavior at the expense of <b>expected</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Keywords expectancies, motivation, goals, attitudes When deciding on a course of action, people consider what they stand to gain or lose from performing the behavior. This weighing of expected consequences is the central tenet of expectancy-value theories (for a review, see Feather, 1982), including social learning theory (Rotter, 1954). Bandura’s (1977) insight—that people’s behavior is also influenced by their perceived capability to perform the behavior—was a seminal addition to social learning theory and has had tre-mendous influence on psychological theory and research. Indeed, self-efficacy is a robust predictor of behavior (fo...|$|R
