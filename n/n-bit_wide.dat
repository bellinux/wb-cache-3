50|$|The DDR4 SDRAM is a {{high-speed}} {{dynamic random-access memory}} internally configured as sixteen-banks, 4 bank group with 4banks for each bank group for x4/x8 and eight-banks, 2 bank group with 4 banks for each bankgroup for x16 DRAM.The DDR4 SDRAM uses a 8n prefetch architecture to achieve high-speed operation. The 8n prefetch architecture is combined withan interface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O pins. A single read or write operation for the DDR4 SDRAMconsists of a single 8n-bit wide, four clock data transfer at the internal DRAM core and eight corresponding <b>n-bit</b> <b>wide,</b> one-half clockcycle data transfers at the I/O pins.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 77) Part 1 : In {{this the}} main {{objective of the}} project was to produce a VHDL design which can be programmed on Altera DE 2 board. This project gives an overview of how different components of DE 2 board can be interfaced. This project uses the various part of DE 2 board like LCD screen, LEDs, Push Buttons, 7 -segment display etc. Part 2 : In this the main objective {{of the project was}} to produce ASIC design and optimize the design using synopsys tool. This optimization is done using 90 nm technology. The target was to create design of asynchronous FIFO for <b>n-bit</b> <b>wide</b> (using parameter) data. Whose default width is 16 bits. Since it is asynchronous it???s input clock chosen is 200 MHz and output clock is 40 MHz. In this data arrive in 32 word (<b>n-bit</b> <b>wide)</b> bursts. This interface signals to the transmitting device when it is clear to send a burst. This design was synthesized and simulated at the gate level. This design was optimized for time and area...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we are {{assessing}} {{a theoretical}} proposition of improving power consumption in complex VLSI circuits through a scheme of digital-analog-digital conversion of data. The proposed scheme replaces <b>n-bit</b> <b>wide</b> bus, running between cores, {{with a single}} line, by encoding the data(that was to be carried on the n-bit bus) into 2 n levels of voltage on a single wire. The bus power consumed by the proposed analog scheme compared to a typical digital scheme can significantly decrease. Bus encoding such as ours, may also be productively employed in test access mechanism for digital circuits. It can compress the amount of data to be communicated between the test head and the chip, and thereby reduce test time. We have carried out experiments that serve as proof-of-concept by evaluating power consumption of a case where an n- bit bus in a large digital circuit is replaced with a single wire using our proposed DAC/ADC bus encoding. SPICE simulation for an ideal case shows that, when replacing an 8 -bit digital bus, the analog bus architecture can save up to 38. 5 % power. Experiment Setup In order to evaluate the power reduction with the proposed scheme...|$|E
