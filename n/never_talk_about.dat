A new couple, the Braces, buy the house and we hear Milly telling the story of the Wheelers to them. Shep stops the story and walks out of the house, crying. When Milly asks Shep what's wrong, he asks her in return to <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Wheelers ever again.|$|E
500|$|She {{occasionally}} {{drifted into}} the public's eye, attracting publicity in 1989 when she admitted voting for Labour {{in an election}} as opposed to her father's Conservative Party, and then criticised Margaret Thatcher in print. Regarding her political relationship with her father, Lawson has stated, [...] "My father would never expect me to agree with him about anything in particular and, to be honest, we <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> politics much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{aspects of}} the show are never fully explained: Terry's {{supposedly}} injured leg, which {{he claims to have}} injured in the Army ("I <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it"), and his dislike of being referred to as [...] "thin" [...] or [...] "slim", preferring to describe himself as [...] "wiry". The latter is, in fact, a continuation of a running gag in the original 1960s series, in which Terry was paranoid about being thought weedy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} Austin {{politicians}} and politicos have expressed sorrow at Gale's death. Marti Bier, a policy aide for the Austin City council member Randi Shade, directly attributed Gale's {{death to the}} Salvation Army, saying, [...] "Something Jennifer would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> but was a reality for her, {{is that she is}} a transwoman living in a transphobic society. Homelessness in the trans-community is a really big problem, and one that goes ignored. There are no laws in Texas protecting transgender people, whether from job discrimination, housing discrimination or hate crimes," [...] and [...] "The Salvation Army would not let her in there unless she was grouped with the men. They would make her use her male birth name and completely disregard, and disrespect, her identity as a trans-woman." [...] The Burnt Orange Report blog posted a reflective essay on her life along with photos and a plea to support homelessness.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Ogden, Utah, Borglum was {{the younger}} brother of Gutzon Borglum and uncle of Lincoln Borglum, the two men most {{responsible}} {{for the creation of}} the carvings at Mount Rushmore. [...] Solon's Danish immigrant father James Borglum was a Mormon polygamist, being married to two sisters, Ida and Christina Michelson. [...] When the family [...] each wife had two children [...] moved to Nebraska they could no longer openly be husband and wives, so Solon and Gutzon's mother Christina was listed as the family servant. [...] When the father moved the family again to St. Louis in 1871, so that he could attend medical school, {{the decision was made to}} leave Christina behind. The children were told to <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> her again. Solon was about three years old at the time. [...] Solon grew up in [...] Fremont, Nebraska and Omaha and spent his early years as a rancher in western Nebraska.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1941, Weil and {{his family}} sailed from Marseille to New York. He spent the {{remainder}} of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at Lehigh University, where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he didn't have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. But, he hated Lehigh very much for their heavy teaching workload and he swore that he would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Lehigh" [...] any more. He quit the job at Lehigh, and then he moved to Brazil and taught at the Universidade de São Paulo from [...] 1945 to 1947, where he worked with Oscar Zariski. He then returned to the United States and taught at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1954 in Amsterdam, and in 1978 in Helsinki. In 1979, Weil shared the second Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Jean Leray.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} this {{withdrawal}} is a mystery; she <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it. Speculation that love disappointments with Canaro {{could have been an}} important element was never confirmed.|$|R

2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that he became {{interested}} in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903), and Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903). Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a [...] "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation." [...] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: [...] "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quite a few critics {{cited the}} long and {{fragmented}} development time as {{a major factor in}} the finished product. In a positive review PC Gamer noted that [...] "years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some", adding, [...] "There’s no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur... Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers", and concluded, [...] "Don’t expect a miracle. Duke is still the hero we love, but struggles to keep up with modern times." [...] Game Informer, whilst disappointed in the game concluded [...] "I'm glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, I have no desire to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what Duke Nukem Forever is and ready to <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it again. Welcome back, Duke. I hope your next game (which is teased after the credits) goes off without a hitch." [...] GiantBomb however concluded that for those [...] "part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on." [...] Jake Denton of Computer and Video Games wrote that parts of the game were fun to play and listed it as one of the [...] "5 most underrated games of 2011", while admitting the game's overall faulty structure. Also Joseph Milne of FPSguru.com featured the game on his list of [...] "Top 5 underrated games" [...] at number 4 on the list.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to his willingness to speak to reporters immediately after the sinking in 1912, in later years Daniel refused to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Titanic disaster. Perhaps it was the traumatic nature of the event, or {{it could have been}} related to the stigma that many surviving male passengers felt as survivors of a tragedy that had claimed the lives of so many women and children. [...] In a 1993 article by Daniels granddaughter, she said [...] "he <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the Titanic disaster because, after all, he was a man, 28 years old, a very athletic and healthy man who survived, and the whole thing about women and children first was a stigma. So he <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Cornell {{said the}} major {{change with the}} {{reformed}} Soundgarden {{was a lack of}} alcohol: [...] "The biggest difference I noticed... and we haven't even really <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it: there are no bottles of Jack Daniel's around or beers.
