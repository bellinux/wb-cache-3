5|$|Having {{stepped down}} from the exiled cabinet in 1941, Koht lived in the United States for the {{remainder}} of the war. There he continued his literary production; however, the books <b>Norway</b> Neutral and Invaded (1941) and The Voice of <b>Norway</b> (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in <b>Norway,</b> and was released in Swedish in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of <b>Norway.</b> It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to <b>Norway</b> at the end of war.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 <b>Norway</b> {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, <b>Norway</b> was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded <b>Norway</b> as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in <b>Norway</b> compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and <b>Norway.</b> This {{operation}} preempted Britain's own {{plans to}} invade <b>Norway.</b> Denmark surrendered immediately, and, after a short-lived {{attempt by the}} British to make a stand {{in the northern part}} of the country, <b>Norway</b> also fell. The invasion of <b>Norway</b> was a combined forces operation in which the German war machine projected its power across the sea; this German success would come to be seen by the British as a dire portent.|$|E

5|$|Air Europe {{fell under}} {{financial}} distress in 1991 and terminated all its Gatwick operations on 8 March. This resulted in <b>Norway</b> Airlines having to ground both its aircraft. Before operations could commence, the two creditors of the aircraft, Fokus Bank and Christiania Bank, had to refinance the two holding companies. As the aircraft remained grounded {{when the military}} contract started on 1 April, <b>Norway</b> Airlines had to lease aircraft externally to operate the charters. The aircraft were freed up {{towards the end of}} April, allowing the services with Gullivers Reiser to commence on 28 April. Originally the leases on the aircraft expired 1 April 1993 and 1994, respectively, but <b>Norway</b> Airlines renegotiated them to both expire 1 April 1994. The Gullivers Reiser contract involved flying from <b>Norway</b> to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Air Europe's bankruptcy cost <b>Norway</b> Airlines NOK6 million and required the company to reduce its staff from 196 to 106 employees. One aircraft was fully utilized, although the second was occasionally operated for Star Tour, Vingreiser and British Airways.|$|E

5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with <b>Norway</b> in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, <b>Norway</b> relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty {{did not address the}} situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both <b>Norway</b> and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, {{a need to}} formalize {{the border}} between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian {{countries}} became evident. The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what now is Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Voryema River, which now is a part of <b>Norway.</b> The Sami population was forced to pay tribute. The Norwegians, however, were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of <b>Norway</b> led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in <b>Norway.</b> Also in 1251, the first treaty with <b>Norway</b> was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections, making the Sami people pay tribute to both Novgorod and <b>Norway.</b> By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except {{in the eastern part of}} Tersky Coast. No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty.|$|E

5|$|German {{forces had}} started gradual {{withdrawal}} to northernmost Finland in early September 1944 in Operation Birke. As {{the value of}} Petsamo region had decreased, the Germans decided in early October 1944 to abandon Finland and most of northern <b>Norway</b> and had begun Operation Nordlicht (Northern Light), a retreat into prepared positions at Lyngen in northern <b>Norway.</b> Operation Nordlicht {{had come to an}} end at the beginning of January 1945, with only a few miles of Finnish territory remaining in German hands, and several isolated garrisons in Norwegian Finnmark. Soviet forces occupied eastern Finnmark, and the USSR asked that Western Allied forces be landed to support them. Only a single company of Norwegian mountain infantry could be spared for this duty, though the British and Norwegian governments provided food supplies for the civilian population in the area. Due to the failure of the recent offensive in the Ardennes and the fact that several new types of U-Boat were ready to be deployed, the German positions in <b>Norway</b> became of great value to Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command as a way to continue submarine warfare against the Allies. They also were to Adolf Hitler, who denied requests from General Heinz Guderian that divisions should be withdrawn from <b>Norway</b> for use in the defence of Germany, and from Böhme in March that northern <b>Norway</b> should be abandoned and that construction of submarine pens should come to a halt due to lack of materials. He feared that any withdrawal might tempt neutral Sweden to enter the war in support of the Allies, and that any withdrawal from northern <b>Norway</b> would endanger U-Boat bases in the southern parts of the country. Until {{the last days of the}} war, Dönitz believed that <b>Norway</b> should be kept in order to deploy submarines against Allied vessels, and on 3 May the Kriegsmarine Naval Warfare Command informed U-Boat staff that even if Germany itself were occupied, submarines would still sail from <b>Norway.</b> Only on 4 May were orders issued by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht that all German troops in <b>Norway</b> were to avoid actions that might provoke Allied forces.|$|E
