It is doubtful, however, that <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> qualifies as a principle of law. It should be regarded, rather, as a rule of criminal procedure, traditionally based on the principle of res judicata. Giving the rule of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> a transnational dimension therefore requires either transnationalising the principle of res judicata, or giving the rule of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> a new foundation. The principle of res judicata principally serves the credibility of the justice system in a given jurisdiction by prohibiting several tribunals, all acting within the parameters of their jurisdiction, from contradicting each other’s interpretation of the same facts. For this reason, the principle of res judicata does not provide an adequate basis for a transnationalised rule of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem.</b> From a human rights perspective, multiple prosecutions against the same person for the same facts collides with protecting individuals against arbitrary judicial treatment.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the relationship between the substantive interpretation of the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle in the case law of the European Court of Justice in competition matters in particular and the scope of application of the principle in the light of Article 51 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In its case law on Article 54 of the Convention on the Implementation of the Schengen Agreement the European Court of Justice emphasises the wording and function of the principle in the context of enhanced cooperation whilst in competition matters, the Courts’ interpretation of the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle derives from the contours of the enforcement landscape. By contrast, the European Court of Human Rights precisely emphasises the uniform and coherent development of the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle in its case law, revealing differences in the attitudes taken by the two European courts to the realisation of the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle on the European level.

40|$|One of the {{concerns}} expressed about the implementation of complementarity under the ICC statute is whether a state will have the prerogative of deciding which crimes to charge without running {{the risk that the}} ICC will minimize the State’s choice by prosecuting the same acts under the ICC statute. The primary question is what happens if a State chooses to prosecute for an “ordinary” crime, such as murder or rape, rather than for an “international” crime, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes? Suppose, for example, that a State is prosecuting or has prosecuted an accused for multiple murders for a particular incident that also arguably was part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. Is the case inadmissible in the ICC or could there be a prosecution in the ICC for crimes against humanity of murder? Assuming that jurisdictional requirements are met, the issue becomes one of admissibility of the matter and, in the case of completed cases, also an issue of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem,</b> or double jeopardy. A case is not admissible in the ICC if a State with primary jurisdiction is willing and able to proceed with the investigation and prosecution or if the accused was already tried for the conduct and a further prosecution is now barred under the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> provision. There are exceptions, however, to the willing and able provision and to the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> bar if the State prosecution is a “sham” trial, shielding the accused from responsibility, or was an improper proceeding, lacking in independence or impartiality and inconsistent with bringing the accused to justice. While the issue of “ordinary” crimes occurs with both the “willing and able” standard and the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> standard, the focus of this paper will be on the situation in which a State has already prosecuted an accused for a crime, resulting in a conviction, an acquittal, or another final determination of the case. The prior adjudication triggers the principle of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem,</b> or double jeopardy. I will develop the point that the design of the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle in the ICC statute is highly protective of State prosecutions and is expressly different from the statutes for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) that permit greater control by the international tribunal than exists with the ICC. The definitions chosen for <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> in the ICC statute foster the priority of States in initially prosecuting crimes, give states great leeway to prosecute after an ICC prosecution, and greatly limit the ability of the ICC to prosecute after a state adjudication of the facts. Although the application of the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> provision is not settled since the ICC has yet to interpret it, a broad interpretation of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> that favors state prosecutions over ICC prosecutions would be more consistent with the language of the statute and the underlying principle of complementarity. This {{is not to say that}} the extensive deference to State prosecutions is necessarily the best balance between national and international prosecutions. The deferential approach will potentially preempt ICC jurisdiction in cases in which one might argue that an international prosecution based on more serious crimes would result in greater justice. Significantly for the accused, the State-protective approach of the ICC statute may result in multiple prosecutions for the same conduct. While these concerns are not inconsequential and deserve consideration from a policy and drafting perspective, this paper focuses on the interpretation that, from a legal analysis, follows from the ICC statute as it was in fact drafted. As presently constituted, the ICC <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> provisions are protective, rather than preemptive, of State prerogatives. The general principle of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> and a detailed analysis of the ICC provisions are laid out in the following sections. Section II provides an overview of the basic terminology and concepts used with <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem,</b> including the difference between a narrow definition that uses “crime” or “elements” and a broad definition that uses “conduct,” “acts,” or “facts. ” Section III describes the statutory provisions of the ICC statute and analyzes the meaning of the terms “crime” and “conduct” in the statute. The meaning is considered in light of the drafting history, the language differences in each paragraph of the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> provision, the distinction between the provisions in the ICC statute and the statutes of the ICTY and the ICTR, and a comparision with the interpretation of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> language with regard to the European arrest warrant. The conclusion is that the most accurate interpretation of the ICC statutory provisions would provide for a broad <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> prohibition when a national prosecution is followed by a potential ICC prosecution, blocking a subsequent ICC prosecution based on the same conduct. Section IV then explores whether the exceptions to <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> would have the effect of narrowing the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> protection. Here, too, the conclusion is reached that, barring evasive, deceptive practices, it is unlikely that the exceptions would change the result that most national prosecutions would bar subsequent ICC prosecutions for the same conduct. As a conclusion, Section V is a summary of the major points why state prosecutions are given deference under the ICC <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> provisions and also a brief commentary on other unresolved issues related to <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem...</b>|$|E

The multiplicity of the processes damages the rights and interests of the individual with the danger of duplication of criminal proceedings. In an area of freedom, security and justice evolved is necessary to avoid such consequences disadvantageous, hindering the establishment of many processes on the same historical facts. The legal limit is precisely the principle of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem.</b> This principle does not prevent conflicts of jurisdiction when several processes are underway in two or more member States; it may come into play only by preventing the prosecutions for the second time on the same case, when the proceedings in a member State has concluded with a decision that prevents the opening of a new one (res judicata).

In order to value the compatibility of a parallel competence system with the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle, the article is structured as follows: 1) The analysis of certain aspects of ECN; 2) The development of {{the application of the}} <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> in the competition cases ruled by the Community Courts; 3) the compatibility of the parallel competencesystem with the ne bib in idem efects of its adoption on the reg. 1 / 03.

One of the most important guarantees is the principle of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem,</b> which protected persons against multiple prosecutions for the same crime. The main legal consequence of the application of <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> in most systems is the prohibition and inadmissibility of subsequent prosecutions on the same facts blocking effect). The national <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle is established asan individual right in international human rights legal instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 19 December 1966, in Article 14 (7). At the regional level, Article 8 (4) of the American Convention of Human Rights (1969) and Article 4 (I) of the Seventh Protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights merit mention. In Europe, the <b>ne</b> <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> <b>idem</b> principle is enshrined in Article 54 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, which prohibits the initiation of a second trial for the same offence when final judgment has been imposed upon a person by a court of a contracting party...|$|E

The first one is the “communautarisation” of the Schengen Aquis. The second one is the extension of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over the (former) third pillar (Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters). As a result, several cases were referred to the European Court of Justice for the interpretation, inter alia, of the dispositions of the Schengen Convention dealing with criminal matters. This article gives a general overview of the case-law of the European Court of Justice in the field of ‘ne <b>bis</b> <b>in</b> idem’ principle, shortly presenting the legal framework, the facts, the questions addressed to the Court by the national jurisdictions, the findings of the Court, as well as some conclusions on the interpretation of the principle.
