5|$|The <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>mockingbird</b> is an omnivore. It eats both {{insects and}} fruits. It is {{often found in}} open areas and forest edges but forages in grassy land. The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> breeds in southeastern Canada, the United States, northern Mexico, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and the Greater Antilles. It is replaced further south by its closest living relative, the tropical mockingbird. The Socorro mockingbird, an endangered species, is also closely related, contrary to previous opinion. The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> is listed as of Least Concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> pairs hatch about 2 to 4 broods a year. In one {{breeding}} season, the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> lays {{an average}} of 4 eggs. They hatch after about 11 to 14 days of incubation. After about 10 to 15 days of life, the offspring become independent.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{categorized}} as the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> as the closest living relative to M. gilvus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird's</b> {{lifespan}} {{is observed}} {{to be up}} to 8 years, but captive birds can live up to 20 years.|$|R

5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Natur√¶ in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos. The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> {{is known for}} its mimicking ability, as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name, 'many-tongued mimic.' The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly. Its tail and wings have white patches which are visible in flight.|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> is {{the state}} bird of Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, and {{formerly}} the state bird of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{recognized}} subspecies for the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird.</b> There {{have been proposed}} races from the Bahamas and Haiti placed under the orpheus section.|$|E
50|$|Bird species include red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, prairie falcons, black-throated sparrows, Gambel's quail, cactus wrens, pyrrhuloxia, <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>mockingbirds,</b> <b>northern</b> flickers, common poorwills, northern cardinals, {{and great}} horned owls. Many mammals inhabit the park, such as ringtails, javalinas, cougars, rock squirrels, desert cottontails, black-tailed jackrabbits, mule deer, and white-tailed deer. Reptiles and amphibians {{found in the}} area include the western box turtles, Arizona alligator lizards, Colorado River toads, bull snakes, and western diamondback rattlesnakes.|$|R
50|$|Their {{common name}} comes from their {{peculiar}} behavior: if excited, they will show a much more exaggerated version of the wing-flicking also seen in other mimids, for example the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbirds.</b> The tremblers do not just flick their wings, but shake their entire bodies in a trembling motion.|$|R
5|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>mockingbirds</b> are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbirds.</b> Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|R
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> (Mimus polyglottos) is {{the only}} mockingbird {{commonly}} found in North America. This bird is mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather. This species has rarely been observed in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> is a {{medium-sized}} mimid {{that has long}} legs and tail. Males and females look alike. Its upper parts are colored gray, while its underparts have a white or whitish-gray color.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the South Carolina Federated Women's club {{adopted the}} Carolina wren as the {{unofficial}} state bird over the eastern mourning dove and pushed for its official state adoption until 1939, when the South Carolina Legislature named the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> {{as the state}} bird. In 1948, the legislature repealed their previous decision, and the wren became the official state bird.|$|E

50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>mockingbirds</b> are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, {{they are}} born {{relatively}} immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.A recent study shows that both food availability and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbirds.</b> Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to care for the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|R
2500|$|Many species attack predators or {{apparent}} predators {{near their}} nests. Kingbirds attack other birds that come too close. In North America, <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbirds,</b> blue jays, and Arctic terns can peck {{hard enough to}} draw blood. [...] In Australia, a bird attacking a person near its nest is said to swoop the person. The Australian magpie is particularly well known for this behavior.|$|R
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> {{is known}} for its intelligence. A 2009 study showed that the bird was able to {{recognize}} individual humans, particularly noting those who had previously been intruders or threats. Also birds recognize their breeding spots and return to areas in which they had greatest success in previous years. Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior. Finally, the mockingbird is influential in United States culture, being the state bird of five states, appearing in book titles, songs and lullabies, and making other appearances in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird,</b> females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E
5|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird's</b> mimicry {{is likely}} {{to serve as a}} form of sexual {{selection}} through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird's song repertoire size. A 2013 study attempted to determine model selection in vocal mimics, and the data suggested that mimicry in the mockingbird resulted from the bird being genetically predisposed to learning vocalizations with acoustic characteristics such as an enlarged auditory template.|$|R

5|$|The <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>mockingbird</b> is {{a species}} that is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more northern mockingbirds living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|E

25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird,</b> blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E

500|$|The {{song of the}} <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> {{inspired}} many classic American {{folk songs}} of the mid-19th century, such as [...] "Listen to the Mocking Bird".|$|E
500|$|Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Linnaeus {{first described}} this species in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos. Its current genus name, Mimus is Latin for [...] "mimic" [...] {{and the specific}} polyglottos, is from Ancient Greek poluglottos, [...] "harmonious", from polus, [...] "many", and glossa, [...] "tongue", representing its outstanding ability to mimic various sounds. The <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbird</b> {{is considered to be}} conspecific with the tropical mockingbird (Mimus gilvus).|$|E
500|$|Although {{many species}} of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>mockingbird</b> is the best known in North America for doing so. Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren, northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, eastern towhee, house sparrow, wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs, calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher, jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay, and alarm, chups, and chirrs [...] of the American robin. It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub-jay.|$|E
5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents {{are found to}} reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbirds</b> and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|R
5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male‚Äôs territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in <b>northern</b> <b>mockingbirds.</b>|$|R
