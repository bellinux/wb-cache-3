He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E

25|$|Bohr was {{compelled}} to modify {{his understanding of the}} uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see EPR paradox) published an analysis of widely separated entangled particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.|$|E

In 1940, Italian industry probably {{was no more than}} 15% of that of France or of the United Kingdom.

25|$|Galileo {{showed a}} remarkably modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of friction and other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E
25|$|A {{separate}} {{source of}} inaccuracy of multiplying several relative risks, considering only positive tests, {{is that it}} tends to overestimate the total risk as compared to using likelihood ratios. This overestimation {{can be explained by}} the inability of the method to compensate for the fact that the total risk cannot be more than 100%. This overestimation is rather small for small risks, but becomes higher for higher values. For example, the risk of developing breast cancer at an age younger than 40 years in women in the United Kingdom can be estimated at approximately 2%. Also, studies on Ashkenazi Jews has indicated that a mutation in BRCA1 confers a relative risk of 21.6 of developing breast cancer in women under 40 years of age, and a mutation in BRCA2 confers a relative risk of 3.3 of developing breast cancer in women under 40 years of age. From these data, it may be estimated that a woman with a BRCA1 mutation would have a risk of approximately 40% of developing breast cancer at an age younger than 40 years, and woman with a BRCA2 mutation would have a risk of approximately 6%. However, in the rather improbable situation of having both a BRCA1 and a BRCA2 mutation, simply multiplying with both relative risks would result in a risk of over 140% of developing breast cancer before 40 years of age, which can <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> accurate in reality.|$|E

500|$|Expo {{did not get}} off to {{a smooth}} start; in 1963, many top {{organizing}} committee officials resigned. The main reason for the resignations was Mayor Drapeau's choice of the site on new islands to be created around the existing St. Helen's Island and also that a computer program predicted that the event could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> constructed in time. Another more likely reason for the mass resignations was that on April 22, 1963, the federal Liberal government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson took power. [...] This meant that former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservative government appointees {{to the board of directors}} of the Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition were likely forced to resign.|$|E
500|$|Von Neumann's {{abstract}} treatment permitted him also {{to confront}} the foundational issue of determinism versus non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> averages of an underlying set of determined [...] "hidden variables," [...] as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1966, John S. Bell published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid. However, in 2010, Jeffrey Bub argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, and {{pointed out that the}} proof, though not valid for all hidden variable theories, does rule out a well-defined and important subset. Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.|$|E

The laboring classes, in their turn, appeared to him coarse and degraded, drinking heavily in public, speaking in a stream of curses, making obscene jokes in front of women and children. Skarstedt felt surrounded by [...] "arrogance {{on one side and}} obsequiousness on the other, a manifest scorn for menial labor, a desire to appear to be more than one was". This traveller too was incessantly hearing American civilization and culture denigrated from the depths of upper-class Swedish prejudice: [...] "If I, in all modesty, told something about America, it could happen that in reply I was informed that this could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> so or that the matter was better understood in Sweden." ...|$|E

500|$|As a {{means of}} augmenting the meagre {{allowance}} provided by her father, Mitford began writing, encouraged by Waugh. Her first efforts, anonymous contributions to gossip columns in society magazines, led to occasional signed articles, and in 1930 The Lady engaged her to write a regular column. That winter, she embarked on a full-length novel, Highland Fling, in which various characters—mostly identifiable among her friends, acquaintances and family—attend a Scottish house-party which develops chaotically. The book made little impact when {{it was published in}} March 1931, and she immediately began work on another, Christmas Pudding. Like the earlier novel, the plot centres on a clash between the [...] "Bright Young People" [...] and the older generation. Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of [...] "Bobby Bobbin", and John Betjeman is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby's tutor. The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale, who thought it could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> published under Mitford's own name.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E
