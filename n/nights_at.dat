5|$|The Five <b>Nights</b> <b>at</b> Freddy's: Survival Logbook is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017.

This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five <b>Nights</b> <b>at</b> Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it will have pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device.
