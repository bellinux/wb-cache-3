50|$|According to the ONE Campaign, 589 {{million people}} in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to {{electricity}}. The lack of electricity makes it difficult or impossible for some healthcare facilities to store drugs (that need to be chilled to certain temperatures, for example) or use life-saving equipment. The lack of electricity also limits business growth, forces people to spend time looking for fuel sources, exposes people to harmful fumes from indoor fires used for cooking, heating, and lighting, and limits safety (due {{to a lack of}} <b>night</b> time <b>lighting</b> and <b>telephones).</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{visual system}} plays an {{important}} role in maintaining balance. As a person ages, gait becomes slower and stride becomes shorter, especially in dimly lighted environments. Falls risk has been associated with reduced speed and increased gait variability. Methods Twenty-four older adults (half identified at risk for falls) experienced three lighting conditions: pathway illuminated by 1) general ceiling-mounted fixtures, 2) conventional plug-in <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> and 3) plug-in <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> supplemented by laser lines outlining the pathway. Gait measures were collected using the GAITRite © walkway system. Results Participants performed best under the general ceiling-mounted light system and worst under the <b>night</b> <b>light</b> alone. The pathway plus <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> increased gait velocity and reduced step length variability compared to the <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> alone in those at greater risk of falling. Conclusions Practically, when navigating in more challenging environments, such as in low-level ambient illumination, the addition of perceptual cues that define the horizontal walking plane can potentially reduce falls risks in older adults. </p...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{regional}} {{income inequality}} in Africa has been challenging {{due to the}} lack of reliable and consistent sub-national income data. I employ <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> data to circumvent this limitation.

Thus, in the absence of income data, we can construct regional inequality proxies using <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> data. Further investigation on the night lights-based regional inequality trends reveals two main findings: first, increasing regional inequality trends between 1992 and 2003; and second, declining regional inequality trends between 2004 and 2012...|$|R
