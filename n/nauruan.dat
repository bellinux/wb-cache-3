5|$|English {{is widely}} spoken {{and is the}} {{language}} of government and commerce, as <b>Nauruan</b> is not common outside of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} language of Nauru is <b>Nauruan,</b> a distinct Pacific island language, which is spoken by 96% of ethnic Nauruans at home.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, deserters from European ships {{began to}} live on the island. The islanders traded food for {{alcoholic}} palm wine and firearms. The firearms were used during the 10-year <b>Nauruan</b> Tribal War that began in 1878.|$|E
50|$|To date, three <b>Nauruans</b> -Reanna Solomon, Marcus Stephen and Yukio Peter- {{have won}} gold medals, {{and a total}} of eight <b>Nauruans</b> -Reanna Solomon, Marcus Stephen, Yukio Peter, Jalon Renos Doweiya, Ebonette Deigaeruk, Sheba Deireragea, Mary Diranga, and Itte Detenamo- have won medals.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} 1948, {{revenues}} from phosphate mining were A$745,000. A minuscule 2% (A$14,900) was being {{returned to the}} <b>Nauruans,</b> while 1% was being charged for [...] "administration". In the 1960 future president Hammer DeRoburt negotiated royalties of profit to the <b>Nauruans</b> to be 22% while administration would increase to 14%.|$|R
25|$|Nauru, as of 2011, {{is mainly}} {{inhabited}} by <b>Nauruans</b> (94%), while the main minority groups include Fijians (1%), Chinese (1%), and Solomon Islanders (1%). This shows {{a major change}} from the previous major census of 2002, when <b>Nauruans</b> represented 75% of the population. According to the Constitution of Nauru does not exclude any ethnic group to become a citizen.|$|R
5|$|Angam Day, held on 26 October, {{celebrates the}} {{recovery}} of the <b>Nauruan</b> population after the two World Wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic. The displacement of the indigenous culture by colonial and contemporary Western influences is significant. Few of the old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.|$|E
5|$|Nauru {{does not}} have any formal {{structure}} for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in <b>Nauruan</b> politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.|$|E
5|$|Nauru {{participated in}} five Summer Olympic Games between {{its debut in}} the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. The country sent their largest {{delegation}} to a Summer Games with three athletes to the 1996 Olympics and the 2004 Summer Games. No <b>Nauruan</b> athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympic Games.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after their}} arrival, the Japanese {{appointed}} Timothy Detudamo {{as the chief}} of the natives. The <b>Nauruans</b> were ordered to obey him, otherwise they would be [...] "skinned and treated as pigs". Detudamo had served as Head Chief of the Council of Chiefs in the pre-War administration and was respected by the <b>Nauruans.</b> Under the Japanese regime, however, he had no autonomy; his duty was only to take orders from the occupiers and apply them. Those who did not follow the Japanese rules could be severely punished. The <b>Nauruans</b> would witness the beheading of several Chinese, Gilbertese, and Japanese accused of breaking the law.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, a new {{agreement}} was reached, giving the <b>Nauruans</b> seven and one-half pence per ton.|$|R
5|$|The island {{experienced}} an influenza epidemic in 1920, with a mortality rate of 18% among native <b>Nauruans.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Nauruan</b> {{weightlifter}} Marcus Stephen won twelve {{medals at}} the Games between 1990 and 2002, of which seven gold, and was elected President of Nauru in 2007. His performance has helped place Nauru (the smallest independent {{state in the}} Commonwealth, at 21km2 and {{with a population of}} fewer than 9,400 in 2011) in nineteenth place on the all-time Commonwealth Games medal table.|$|E
5|$|After an {{agreement}} with Great Britain, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes. The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. The most widely known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888. The German settlers called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades. Robert Rasch, a German trader who married a <b>Nauruan</b> woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Nauru {{recognised}} Kosovo as {{an independent}} country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia {{was reported to be}} giving Nauru $50million in humanitarian aid {{as a result of this}} recognition. On 15 July 2008, the <b>Nauruan</b> government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9million of development aid received from Russia. The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia.|$|E
25|$|First, {{determined}} {{to control their}} own lives after having been pawns in a major war, they rejected the British Phosphate Commission's offer to relocate them. <b>Nauruans</b> wanted to maintain ties to their island. After the war the fight for phosphate royalties continued with renewed vigor, ending only when the <b>Nauruans</b> bought the phosphate industry from the commission for A$20 million, a transaction entwined intimately with Nauru's declaration of independence in 1968.|$|R
25|$|Nauru is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} <b>Nauruans</b> (93.6%), while minorities include I-Kiribati (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%) and other (3.1%). The demographic history of Nauru {{is marked by}} several migrations: the area was first inhabited by Micronesian people about 3,000 years ago. The first European to find the island was John Fearn in 1798. Then, the country was annexed by Germany in the 1888. The next was when Japanese occupied the island during World War II in the 1942. During this time, the Japanese deported several thousands of <b>Nauruans</b> to other islands. In the 1960s, the country gained independence, where the percentage of <b>Nauruans</b> started to increase. The most recent demographic switch was in the 2000s, when the government repatriated several non-Nauruan population from the country.|$|R
5000|$|Section 4 of the Ordinance in {{question}} establishes legal {{belonging to the}} [...] "Nauruan community". <b>Nauruans</b> under this law include ...|$|R
5|$|Nauru {{and nearby}} Ocean Island were {{important}} sources of phosphate for Australian and New Zealand fertilizer production and {{played an important}} role on both countries agriculture industries at the time of World War II. The Melbourne-based British Phosphate Commission (BPC) managed the extraction and export of phosphate from the islands and dominated all aspects of <b>Nauruan</b> life. During the year ending 30June 1940, the BPC shipped almost a million tons of phosphate from Nauru and about half that amount from Ocean Island using its fleet of four vessels (Triadic, Triaster, Triona and Trienza) and chartered merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Nauruan</b> economy {{peaked in}} the early 1980s, as it was {{dependent}} almost entirely on the phosphate deposits that originate from the droppings of sea birds. There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported. Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, {{formerly known as the}} Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves were exhausted.|$|E
5|$|Literacy on Nauru is 96percent. Education is {{compulsory}} {{for children}} {{from six to}} sixteen years old, and two more non-compulsory years are offered (years 11 and 12). There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru. Before this campus was built in 1987, students would study either by distance or abroad. Since 2011, the University of New England, Australia has established a presence on the island with around 30 <b>Nauruan</b> teachers studying for an associate degree in education. These students will continue onto the degree to complete their studies. This project is led by Associate Professor Pep Serow and funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.|$|E
50|$|The average {{body weight}} among <b>Nauruans</b> is {{estimated}} to be approximately 100 kg. Nauru has an average BMI between 34 and 35.|$|R
50|$|Radio Nauru has {{collected}} numerous recordings of local people's music. But even old <b>Nauruans</b> can rarely understand {{the contents of}} these songs.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{prominent}} <b>Nauruans,</b> notably René Harris, who have headed the Nauru Phosphate Corporation, {{have gone on}} to serve as President of Nauru.|$|R
5|$|The {{delegation}} of the Nauru for the 2008 Summer Olympics consisted of four men. The first, Itte Detenamo, {{was the sole}} athlete and competed in the weightlifting competition. Also in the delegation as a manager of Itte was Yukio Peter—2004 Olympian—who holds {{the record for the}} best placing in any Olympics by any <b>Nauruan,</b> eighth in the lightweight category (69kg) of the weightlifting event in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Delegation was also accompanied by Vinson Detenamo, father of Itte and the then and first President of the Nauru Olympic Committee. As the former sport minister of Nauru, Vinson had helped in the establishment of Nauru Olympic Committee in 1991 during his term in the Ministry of Sport. The final member of the delegation was Lou Keke as Nauru's Olympic chef de mission.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Nauruan</b> {{language}} {{is the official}} language of Nauru. English is widely understood and is used for most government and commercial purposes. According to the 2011 census, 95.3% of the population speaks <b>Nauruan,</b> 66.0% speak English, and 11.9% speak another language. <b>Nauruan</b> is an Austronesian language, however, no adequate written grammar of the language has been compiled, and its relationships to other Micronesian languages are not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{their land}} {{became even more}} {{precious}} to them. Most Nauruans continue to live on Nauru. Those who do migrate do so either to seek education, to take positions in <b>Nauruan</b> diplomatic missions, or, in a few cases, to take jobs in Australia. But {{the bulk of the}} <b>Nauruan</b> population can be found living on the island of Nauru. In this they differ markedly from other Pacific Island nations where a growing proportion of the population {{is to be found in}} metropolitan countries.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 the <b>Nauruans</b> {{purchased}} {{the assets of}} the B.P.C. and, in 1970, the newly independent Republic of Nauru established the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>Nauruans</b> are Christians, {{and members of}} the Nauru Congregational Church. They often celebrate Christmas with cakes made from banana and coconut.|$|R
50|$|Japanese troops {{occupied}} Nauru on 26 August 1942. The native <b>Nauruans</b> {{were badly}} {{treated by the}} occupying forces. On one occasion thirty nine leprosy sufferers were reputedly loaded onto boats which were towed out to sea and sunk. The Japanese troops built an airfield on Nauru which was bombed {{for the first time}} on 25 March 1943, preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru. In 1943 the Japanese deported 1,200 <b>Nauruans</b> to work as labourers in the Chuuk islands.|$|R
25|$|The authorities, {{fearful of}} {{starvation}} on an overpopulated island kept under blockade, resolved to deport the entire <b>Nauruan</b> population. Shortly after {{the arrival of}} the last military convoy, the Japanese called together a <b>Nauruan</b> council and made the announcement of the deportation of some of the islanders under the leadership of Timothy Detudamo. They refused to tell the Nauruans their destination, which increased anxiety among the population; they were only told that the island to which they would be sent had an abundance of food. Just before departure, Nakayama, second in the military hierarchy of the island, gave Detudamo a letter bearing the seal of the emperor Hirohito, indicating that the Nauruans were under his protection. This document was later used for safe-conduct by the exiles.|$|E
25|$|The Empire of Japan became firmly {{established}} in the vast area north of Nauru {{as a result of}} the South Pacific Mandate of the League of Nations, and aggressive development of plantation agriculture in the islands was often facilitated by the use of <b>Nauruan</b> phosphate.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, however, Nauru {{closed its}} newly {{established}} embassy in Beijing. Two years later, ROC President Chen Shui-bian met <b>Nauruan</b> President Ludwig Scotty in the Marshall Islands. In May 2005, the ROC and Nauru re-established diplomatic relations, and opened embassies in each other's capitals. The PRC consequently severed {{its relations with}} Nauru.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nauruans</b> are {{an ethnic}} group {{indigenous}} to Nauru, which inhabit the Pacific island of Nauru. They are most likely a blend of other Pacific peoples.|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} insulin gene was determined in American Pima Indians and Micronesian <b>Nauruans,</b> two populations in whom the prevalence of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus is {{the highest in the}} world. The insulin gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction to generate single-stranded DNA suitable for direct sequencing. The {{nucleotide sequence}}s of the coding and adjacent regions of the insulin gene in six Pima Indians and two <b>Nauruans</b> with type II diabetes were identical to previously published insulin gene sequences of nondiabetic subjects...|$|R
25|$|If Japanese {{rule was}} harsh when {{contrasted with the}} more paternalistic Australian approach, it was, {{at least for the}} native <b>Nauruans,</b> not as brutal as in other areas {{controlled}} by the Japanese. The occupiers tried to seduce the natives using propaganda, educational programs, and entertainment. They opened a Japanese school, a language which many <b>Nauruans</b> learned during the war, and hired native dancers for celebrations they organized, which brought the <b>Nauruans</b> extra money. They opted not to interfere with the work of the two European priests, who had great influence among the population, and allowed religious services to take place. They also hired some of the employees of the former administration. However, the Japanese were particularly harsh with the Chinese, who were at the bottom of their perceived racial hierarchy. They were underfed and beaten more often and more brutally than the other inhabitants.|$|R
