5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on the witness testimonies, the family {{did not believe that}} Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not be}} substantiating the requested amount, as <b>no</b> <b>money</b> could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|A second labor action {{took place}} in July 1935, as {{construction}} on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but <b>no</b> <b>money</b> was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.|$|E

5|$|According {{to other}} reports, a {{motivating}} factor was {{the desire to}} establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with new construction. A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that <b>no</b> <b>money</b> was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival. A $15,000 grant from the state helped to fund the 1979 Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>no</b> <b>money</b> is {{exchanged}} {{and laws}} are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E
5|$|During the Panic of 1893, Lilly {{created a}} {{commission}} to help provide food and shelter to the poor people who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led {{him to make a}} personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.|$|E

Card games, darts, billiards and other games are permitted as long as <b>no</b> <b>money</b> is exchanged, and no prizes are given.|$|E
5|$|I cannot help being displeased, {{that this}} {{valuable}} observation, purchasable with <b>no</b> <b>money,</b> elegantly described {{and prepared for}} the press, should have laid for two-and-twenty years, and that no-one should {{have been found to}} take charge of so fair an offspring at its father's death, to bring to light a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our country's credit and for the advantage of mankind.|$|E

5|$|In 1852, {{the pioneer}} town of Mount Carroll, Illinois, lacking a public school, {{incorporated}} the Mount Carroll Seminary with no land, no teachers and <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> The town persuaded Frances Wood and Cindarella Gregory, two schoolteachers from Ballston Spa, New York, {{to come and}} teach. On May 11, 1853, the new seminary opened in a local church with eleven students.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, a {{labor dispute}} {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday's conscience would not allow him to break his contract with Pittsburgh. Sunday was named team captain, and he was their star player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons in baseball history. By August the team had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's four {{infantry}} regiments and two cavalry {{units that}} {{served in the}} Spanish–American War were beset by poor sanitation and disease in the army camps where they were stationed.

When the time came for the troops to return home, Bradley found that the state had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to pay for the hospital trains needed for their trip. Bradley personally borrowed money from a bank to secure their passage, and trusted that the General Assembly would reimburse him.|$|E
5|$|Ricardo Flores {{said that}} police found date rape drugs in his daughter's car, parked about 50 {{blocks from the}} hotel where she died. Her jewelry, money, {{identification}} and credit cards were missing, including about $1,000 her father had given her to purchase a laptop, and over $10,000 she had won earlier at the casino. Stephany reportedly kept this money in her car, but a police search found <b>no</b> <b>money</b> in it.|$|E

5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to fund repairs.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{believe they}} have won the study, but the guards have tricked them into winning, {{allowing}} them to escape. Keith tells the police the story of Kendall and Cormac's deaths: Kendall gave Keith a valuable painting disguised as money in a case, and Cormac tried to kill Kendall and Keith to get the case's contents. Cormac killed Liam out of anger that there was <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> The episode concludes with Logan streaking through sociology class, fulfilling a bet made earlier in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Philadelphia Eagles on August 13, 2009. The contract was worth $1.6 million, with <b>no</b> <b>money</b> guaranteed.
