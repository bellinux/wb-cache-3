5000|$|... 3-HM's {{levorotatory}} stereoisomer, <b>norlevorphanol,</b> {{in contrast}} to (+)-3-HM, is an opioid analgesic. It was never marketed as such however, probably due {{to a combination of}} the facts that <b>norlevorphanol</b> has low bioavailability and that its potency is diminished compared to its N-methylated analogue levorphanol.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Norlevorphanol</b> is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan family {{that was never}} marketed. It is the levo-isomer of 3-hydroxymorphinan (morphinan-3-ol). <b>Norlevorphanol</b> is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance in the United States with an ACSCN of 9634 and in 2014 it had an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 52 grammes. It is used as the hydrobromide (free base conversion ratio 0.750) and hydrochloride (0.870).|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Hydroxymorphinan (3-HM), or morphinan-3-ol, is a {{psychoactive drug}} of the morphinan family. It is the racemic {{counterpart}} to <b>norlevorphanol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{dextrorotatory}} stereoisomer of {{the compound}} is an active metabolite of dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, and 3-methoxymorphinan, and similarly to them has potent neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects on LTS- and MPTP-treated dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, but notably without producing any neuropsychotoxic side effects (e.g., dissociation or hallucinations) or having any anticonvulsant actions. It {{does not seem to}} bind to the NMDA receptor, and instead, its neuroprotective properties appear result from inhibition of glutamate release via the suppression of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry and protein kinase C activity. In any case, as such, the compound has been investigated as a potential antiparkinsonian agent. A prodrug, GCC1290K, has been developed on account of 3-HM's poor bioavailability (18%), and a New Drug Application has been approved for it by the United States Food and Drug Administration. It is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. [...] It does not have a Controlled Substances Act 1970 schedule, ACSCN, or annual aggregate manufacturing quota and may not necessarily be controlled, whilst <b>norlevorphanol</b> is; none of the dextrorotary derivatives of the dromoran and <b>norlevorphanol</b> sub-families of morphinan derivatives are controlled as they do not have opioid activity but the other racemic compounds are.|$|E
