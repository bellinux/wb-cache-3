40|$|We {{previously}} identified four functionally distinct human <b>NUMB</b> isoforms. Here, {{we report}} {{the identification of}} two additional isoforms and propose {{a link between the}} expression of these isoforms and cancer. These novel isoforms, <b>NUMB</b> 5 and <b>NUMB</b> 6, lack exon 10 and are expressed in cells known for polarity and migratory behavior, such as human amniotic fluid cells, glioblastoma and metastatic tumor cells. RT-PCR and luciferase assays demonstrate that <b>NUMB</b> 5 and <b>NUMB</b> 6 are less antagonistic to NOTCH signaling than other <b>NUMB</b> isoforms. Immunocytochemistry analyses show that <b>NUMB</b> 5 and <b>NUMB</b> 6 interact and complex with CDC 42, vimentin and the CDC 42 regulator IQGAP 1 (IQ (motif) GTPase activating protein 1).

To further assess the role of different <b>numb</b> isoforms in cortical neural development, we first created a Numb-null state with antisense morpholino, followed by the re-expression of specific <b>numb</b> isoforms.

40|$|Abstract. The cell fate {{determinant}} <b>Numb</b> orchestrates numerous cell {{physiological and}} pathological processes and previous evidence {{has indicated that}} <b>Numb</b> expression is associated with tumorigenesis. The present study investigated the potential role of <b>Numb</b> in endometrial cancer (EC). <b>Numb</b> expression was compared between the normal endometrium and EC tissue by immunohistochemistry, and the protein levels were assessed by western blotting and confocal microscopy in the human endometrial HEC- 1 B cancer cell line and normal epithelial cells. The intracellular localization of <b>Numb</b> in HEC‑ 1 B cells was examined by immunofluorescence. <b>Numb</b> {{was found to be}} expressed at higher levels in endometrial cancer compared with the normal endometrium. Although <b>Numb</b> localizes to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane in the normal epithelium, the present study found that <b>Numb</b> accumulated in the nucleus of HEC- 1 B cells. The present data reveals the upregulation of <b>Numb</b> expression in EC tissues and indicates that <b>Numb</b> plays a role in the occurrence of EC, which may be mediated by its translocation into the nucleus.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether <b>NUMB</b> plays {{roles in the}} differentiation of the dental cells. Background. <b>NUMB</b> has been implicated to play roles in lineage commitment by both gain- and loss-of function approaches. Its function {{has been attributed to}} the asymmetric distribution in daughter cells. Methods. RT-PCR, western blot, immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy and PCR super-array analysis were applied to study the expression and signaling regulatory effects of <b>NUMB.</b> Results. We isolated 2 fulllength clones for <b>NUMB</b> from mouse dental pulp mRNA. One novel sequence contains 200 bp insertion in the Phosphotyrosine Binding Domain (PTB) may encode for a new isoform of <b>NUMB.</b> Confocol microscopy detected strong <b>NUMB</b> expression in human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC), odontoblasts (Od) and pre-ameloblasts (pre-Ab). Western blot analysis indicated <b>NUMB</b> isoforms were differentially expressed in dental tissues. In postnatal mouse tooth germs, <b>NUMB</b> was expressed in the preameloblasts and Odontoblasts, cervical loops, and DPSC {{in the vicinity of the}} immature odontoblasts. <b>NUMB</b> overexpression in pre-ameloblasts, significantly reduced activated Notch 1 protein expression level. In the super array analysis of Notch 1 signaling, <b>NUMB</b> down regulates Shh expression in preamelobasts. Conclusion. New <b>NUMB</b> mRNA was detected in dental pulp cells. <b>NUMB</b> has a temporal expression pattern in developing tooth germs suggesting critical role of <b>NUMB</b> in ameloblasts and odontoblasts differentiation. <b>NUMB</b> negatively regulate activated Notch 1 and SHH signaling in Hat- 7 cells.

40|$|<b>Numb</b> {{has been}} implicated in {{cortical}} neurogenesis during nervous system development, {{as a result of}} its asymmetric partitioning and antagonizing Notch signaling. Recent studies have revealed that <b>Numb</b> functions in clathrin-dependent endocytosis by binding to the AP- 2 complex. <b>Numb</b> is also expressed in postmitotic neurons and plays a role in axonal growth. However, the functions of <b>Numb</b> in later stages of neuronal development remain unknown. Here, we report that <b>Numb</b> specifically localizes to dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons and is implicated in dendritic spine morphogenesis, partially through the direct interaction with intersectin, a Cdc 42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Intersectin functions as a multidomain adaptor for proteins involved in endocytosis and cytoskeletal regulation. <b>Numb</b> enhanced the GEF activity of intersectin toward Cdc 42 in vivo. Expression of <b>Numb</b> or intersectin caused the elongation of spine neck, whereas knockdown of <b>Numb</b> and Numb-like decreased the protrusion density and its length. Furthermore, <b>Numb</b> formed a complex with EphB 2 receptor-type tyrosine kinase and NMDA-type glutamate receptors.

40|$|In Drosophila, the {{partition}} defective (Par) complex containing Par 3, Par 6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) directs the polarized distribution and unequal segregation {{of the cell}} fate determinant <b>Numb</b> during asymmetric cell divisions. Unequal segregation of mammalian <b>Numb</b> has also been observed, but the factors involved are unknown.

A form of mammalian <b>Numb</b> lacking two protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites (<b>Numb</b> 2 A) accumulates at the cell membrane and is refractory to PKC activation. In epithelial cells, mammalian <b>Numb</b> localizes to the basolateral membrane and is excluded from the apical domain, which accumulates aPKC. In contrast, <b>Numb</b> 2 A is distributed uniformly around the cell cortex. Mutational analysis of conserved aPKC phosphorylation sites in Drosophila <b>Numb</b> suggests that phosphorylation contributes to asymmetric localization of <b>Numb,</b> opposite to aPKC in dividing sensory organ precursor cells.

40|$|Specification of unequal {{daughter}} cell fates in the Drosophila external sense organ lineage requires asymmetric localization of the intrinsic determinant <b>Numb</b> {{as well as}} cell-cell interactions mediated by the Delta ligand and Notch receptor. Previous genetic studies indicated that <b>numb</b> acts upstream of Notch, and biochemical studies revealed that <b>Numb</b> can bind Notch. For a functional assay of the action of <b>Numb</b> on Notch signaling, we expressed these proteins in cultured Drosophila cells and used nuclear translocation of Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H) ] {{as a reporter for}} Notch activity.

Notably, nuclear localization of <b>Numb</b> in early thymocyte precursors favors p 53 nuclear stabilization, whereas pre-TCR-dependent <b>Numb</b> nuclear exclusion promotes the p 53 downmodulation essential for further differentiation.

6000|$|As to disease, {{it is so}} rare in wild animals, or in a large {{majority}} of cases so quickly proves fatal, that, compared with what we call disease in our own species it is practically non-existent. The [...] "struggle for existence," [...] in so far as animals in a state of nature are concerned, is a metaphorical struggle; and the strife, short and sharp, which is so common in nature, is not misery, although it results in pain, since it is pain that kills or is soon outlived. Fear there is, just as in fine weather there are clouds in the sky; and just as the shadow of the cloud passes, so does fear pass from the wild creature when the object that excited it has vanished from sight. And when death comes, it comes unexpectedly, and is not the death that we know, even before we taste of it, thinking of it with apprehension all our lives long, but a sudden blow that takes away consciousness--the touch of something that <b>numbs</b> the nerves--merely the prick of a needle. In whatever way the animal perishes, whether by violence, or excessive cold, or decay, his death is a comparatively easy one. So long as he is fighting with or struggling to escape from an enemy, wounds are not felt as wounds, and scarcely hurt him--as we know from our own experience; and when overcome, if death be not practically instantaneous, {{as in the case of}} a small bird seized by a cat, the disabling grip or blow is itself a kind of anodyne, producing insensibility to pain. This, too, is a matter of human experience. To say nothing of those who fall in battle, men have often been struck down and fearfully lacerated by lions, tigers, jaguars, and other savage beasts; and after having been rescued by their companions, have recounted this strange thing. Even when there was no loss of consciousness, when they saw and knew that the animal was rending their flesh, they seemed not to feel it, and were, at the time, indifferent to the fate that had overtaken them.|$|E

Methodology: The expression of <b>Numb</b> was detected in 107 cases of clinical paraffin-embedded hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, 5 matched paris of fresh tissues and six hepatocellular cell lines by immunohistochemistry with clinicopathological analyses,RT-PCR or Western blot. Moreover, loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to evaluate the effect of <b>Numb</b> on cell proliferation in vitro. Conclusions: We found that <b>Numb</b> was obviously up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines (p, 0. 05). The <b>Numb</b> up-regulation correlated significantly with poor prognosis, and <b>Numb</b> status was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Over-expression of <b>Numb</b> increased proliferation in SMMC- 7721 and BEL- 7402 cells, while knock-down of <b>Numb</b> showed the opposite effect. Our study indicates that <b>Numb</b> up-regulation significantly correlates with cell proliferation and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. It may be a useful biomarker for therapeutic strategy in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment...|$|R
50|$|The protein <b>Numb</b> is coded {{for by the}} gene, <b>NUMB,</b> whose {{mechanism}} {{appears to}} be evolutionarily conserved. <b>Numb</b> has been extensively studied in both invertebrates and mammals, though its function is best understood in Drosophila. <b>Numb</b> {{plays a crucial role}} in asymmetrical cell division during development, allowing for differential cell fate specification in the central and peripheral nervous systems. During neurogenesis, <b>Numb</b> localizes {{to one side of the}} mother cell such that it is distributed selectively to one daughter cell. This asymmetric division allows a daughter cell containing <b>Numb</b> to acquire a different fate than the other daughter cell.|$|R

40|$|<b>Numb</b> is an endocytic adaptor {{protein that}} regulates the {{endocytosis}} and trafficking of transmembrane recep-tors including Notch, E-cadherin, and integrins. Verte-brate <b>Numb</b> is alternatively spliced at exons 3 and 9 to {{give rise to}} four protein isoforms. Expression of these isoforms varies at different developmental stages, and although the function of <b>Numb</b> isoforms containing exon 3 has been studied, the role of exon 9 inclusion has not been shown. Here we use affinity purification and tan-dem mass spectrometry to identify <b>Numb</b> associated proteins, including novel interactions with REPS 1, BMP 2 K, and BCR. In vitro binding measurements indi-cated exon 9 -independent <b>Numb</b> interaction with REPS 1 and Eps 15 EH domains. Selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry was used to quantitatively compare the proteins associated with the p 72 and p 66 <b>Numb</b> isoforms, which differ by the exon 9 region. This showed that significantly more EPS 15 and three AP- 2 subunit proteins bound <b>Numb</b> isoforms containing exon 9. The EPS 15 preference for exon 9 -containing <b>Numb</b> was confirmed in intact cells by using a proximity ligation assay. Finally, we used multiplexed selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry to assess the dynamic regulation of <b>Numb</b> association with endocytic proteins. <b>Numb</b> hyper-phosphorylation resulted in disassociation of <b>Numb</b> endocytic complexes, while inhibition of endo-cytosis did not alter <b>Numb</b> association with the AP- 2 complex but altered recruitment of EPS 15, REPS 1, and BMP 2 K. Hence, quantitative mass spectrometric analy-sis of <b>Numb</b> protein-protein interactions has provided {{new insights into the}} assembly and regulation of pro-tein complexes important in development an...|$|R
40|$|<b>Numb</b> is {{a protein}} that in Drosophila determines cell fate {{as a result}} of its {{asymmetric}} partitioning at mitosis. The function of <b>Numb</b> has been linked to its ability to bind and to biologically antagonize Notch, a membrane receptor that also specifies cell fate. The biochemical mechanisms underlying the action of <b>Numb,</b> however, are still largely unknown. The wide pattern of expression of <b>Numb</b> suggests a general function in cellular homeostasis that could be additional to, or part of, its action in fate determination. Such a function could be endocytosis, as suggested by the interaction of <b>Numb</b> with Eps 15, a component of the endocytic machinery. Here, we demonstrate that <b>Numb</b> is an endocytic protein. We found that <b>Numb</b> localizes to endocytic organelles and is cotrafficked with internalizing receptors. Moreover, it associates with the appendage domain of α adaptin, a subunit of AP 2, a major component of clathrin-coated pits. Finally, fragments of <b>Numb</b> act as dominant negatives on both constitutive and ligand-regulated receptor-mediated internalization, suggesting a general role for <b>Numb</b> in the endocytic process...|$|R
40|$|The gene <b>numb</b> encodes for {{a protein}} (<b>Numb)</b> {{involved}} in cell fate decisions in Drosophila, with proposed endocytic and developmental functions in mammalians. The distribution pattern of <b>Numb</b> in human tissues however, {{has not been}} fully characterized. We set out to explore the immunohistochemical expression of <b>Numb</b> in normal and neoplastic (28 adenoid cystic and 34 mucoepidermoid carcinomas) salivary glands, and correlated the results with the clinico-pathologic features of the neoplasms. Intense <b>Numb</b> immunoreactivity was detected in normal ductal cells and in a subset of acinar cells. In salivary carcinomas, we detected diffuse and intense <b>Numb</b> immunostaining in 5 adenoid cystic and 8 mucoepidermoid carcinomas. By contrast, the majority of adenoid cystic and mucoepidermoid cancers showed only moderate (14 and 5 cases) or focal staining (9 and 21 cases), respectively. The corresponding expression of <b>Numb</b> mRNA was documented in normal parotid gland and adenoid cystic carcinoma. <b>Numb</b> immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with the histological grade and Ki- 67 immunoreactivity of both adenoid cystic and mucoepidermoid carcinomas. In addition, while tumor grade, stage, Ki- 67 and <b>Numb</b> immunoreactivity were associated with disease-free survival in univariate analysis, only <b>Numb</b> and Ki- 67 immunoreactivities retained independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. These data suggest that loss of <b>Numb</b> is implicated in aberrant differentiation programs of salivary gland carcinomas and {{may serve as a}} prognostic indicator in patients treated for these neoplasms...|$|R
