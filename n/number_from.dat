5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1995–96 season, Bure changed his jersey <b>number</b> <b>from</b> 10 to 96.

After the Canucks traded with the Buffalo Sabres for Alexander Mogilny, reuniting the two Russian players, the jersey number was deemed acceptable because Mogilny had used number 89 since defecting to North America in 1989.|$|E

A week later, on the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League, he scored and assisted again in a 3–2 win against newly promoted Southampton. He then scored against Ajax in a 3–1 loss in the UEFA Champions League group stage.

5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related.

The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E
