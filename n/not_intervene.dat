5|$|A {{more modern}} and {{convenient}} competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply. There were serious public {{concerns about the}} safety of the bridge by this time, after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors, who did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> because both parties had paid their fares.|$|E
5|$|Between January and February, Thảo {{finalized}} his own coup plans. Thảo consulted Kỳwho {{wanted to}} seize power for himselfand exhorted {{him to join}} the coup, but the air force chief claimed he was remaining neutral. Thảo thus mistakenly thought Kỳ would <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> against him. Kỳ had actually been preparing his own coup plans for a fortnight and was strongly opposed {{to the likes of}} Thảo and Phát.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted {{the principles of the}} Congress of Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E

5|$|In December 2014, the United States Justice Department allowed {{recognized}} Indian Reservations {{to regulate}} cannabis laws within their reservation. The {{laws in the}} reservations are allowed {{to be different from}} state and federal laws. As with State and Territories, the Federal government will <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> as long as the reservations regulate strict control over marijuana. Some domestic nations such as the Yakama Nation and the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council rejected the approval to allow marijuana on their reservation.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus {{spent the}} last years of his life {{wandering}} from place to place. Hungary's central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did <b>not</b> <b>intervene,</b> although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support him against Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that he was ready to make peace with him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of {{psychological}} intervention on social support condition of the first settlers in Dan jiangkou reservoir area. Methods: Using the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) to measure the social support condition of the first batch of immigrants {{before and after the}} intervention, and then compare it with the immigrants who were <b>not</b> <b>intervened.</b> Results: Compared with the immigrants who were <b>not</b> <b>intervened,</b> the immigrants who received intervention have a higher score on the availability of social support (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Psychological intervention can improve the social support condition for immigrants, especially in enhancing the availability of social support...|$|R

5|$|Although Louis {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with the Republic of Genoa in October 1352, he did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> in the Genoese–Venetian War, because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force. Louis married Elizabeth of Bosnia, who {{was the daughter of}} his vassal, Stephen II, in 1353. Historian Gyula Kristó says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula. While he was hunting in Zólyom County (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a brown bear attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds on his legs. Louis's life was saved by a knight of the court, John Besenyő, who killed the beast with his sword.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February, {{with the}} help of the French {{ambassador}} Léon Roches, a plan was formulated to stop the imperial court's advance at Odawara, the last strategic entry point to Edo, but Yoshinobu decided against the plan. Shocked, Léon Roches resigned from his position. In early March, under the influence of the British minister Harry Parkes, foreign nations signed a strict neutrality agreement, according to which they could <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> or provide military supplies to either side until the resolution of the conflict.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

5|$|In {{observing a}} {{multitude}} of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> in local or central government affairs {{for the benefit of}} their local prefecture or county. This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of central government officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies.|$|E
5|$|Jared's silence {{leads to}} the {{breakdown}} of his relationships with both Rachel and his mother Diane. In the plays last scene Jared confesses to Diane that he witnessed the three youths raping Tracy, though he did <b>not</b> <b>intervene.</b> He is unsure why he did nothing though he believes {{it was out of}} loyalty to the boys who were his mates. Ricko left Jared a suicide note giving him his van, though Jared asks Cherie to dump the keys to the van in the ocean when she goes out surfing.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E

50|$|Had the war <b>not</b> <b>intervened</b> it is {{believed}} that the F9 would have replaced the F8 in 1940. In the event, production of the F8 Meisterklasse was prolonged until 1942 when passenger car production at Zwickau came to an end.|$|R
5|$|Sviatopolk {{lost the}} throne soon {{afterwards}} {{and lost his}} life the following year. As Bolesław {{was involved in a}} conflict with Holy Roman Emperor Henry II, he did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> on behalf of his son-in-law when he was deposed and instead signed a pact with Yaroslav, who had successfully regained the throne. Although he lost control of Kiev, Bolesław succeeded in keeping the Cherven Towns captured by Vladimir the Great in 981; he was crowned King of Poland in 1025. Yaroslav outlived Bolesław and contributed greatly to the strengthening of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Treloar's work {{patterns}} took {{a toll on}} his health, and {{the deterioration}} in his performance after 1946 was possibly the result of exhaustion. Despite this, the Memorial's board did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> in the institution's management and allowed Treloar to remain in his position. In January 1952, Dawn found him ill in bed after noticing {{that he had not}} signed the attendance book. Treloar was subsequently admitted to the Canberra Community Hospital where he died on 28January {{as a result of an}} intestinal haemorrhage. His funeral was held two days later at Reid Methodist Church in Canberra, and he was subsequently buried in the returned soldiers section of Woden Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|While Arbour {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting {{his point of view}} concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences that both sides were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, that led the UN to <b>not</b> <b>intervene.</b>|$|E

5|$|As freshmen {{struggled}} with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts {{in the field of}} the current work studied. In their dorms, the college students were known for their lack of respect for property, with three times the breakage in dorm assets {{than the rest of the}} university. Meiklejohn saw this as desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could <b>not</b> <b>intervene.</b> Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.|$|E
5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first family into the second family. This incident took place {{under the supervision of}} German officials, who did <b>not</b> <b>intervene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even if the ARBiH had not {{provided}} aid, the HV {{would almost certainly}} have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military was unable to check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj {{for less than a}} single day. The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did <b>not</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily as Milošević did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.|$|E
