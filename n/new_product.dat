5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its <b>new</b> <b>product,</b> {{most of the}} company's sales gains {{were the result of}} aggressive price cutting by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The price cutting promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own price cutting program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive-In, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains.|$|E

Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from the shelves and recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. <b>New</b> <b>product</b> shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I. Joe: Retaliation Movie Prequel was published by IDW Publishing from February 2012 to April 2012. Written by John Barber, it acted as a prequel to the 2013 movie.|$|E
5|$|Eka-caesium was {{discovered}} in 1939 by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, when she purified a sample of actinium-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80keV. Perey thought this decay activity might {{have been caused by}} a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The <b>new</b> <b>product</b> exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.|$|E

In mid-2010, Rogen shot scenes for another upcoming film, Take This Waltz, with Michelle Williams. Another of his movies, Paramount Pictures's road movie The Guilt Trip, also starring Barbra Streisand, was released in cinemas in 2012. The film was about an inventor (Rogen) who invites his mother (Streisand) on a road trip, as he attempts to sell his <b>new</b> <b>product</b> while also reuniting her with a lost love. In 2013, Rogen along with screenwriting collaborator Evan Goldberg made their directorial debut with This Is the End, a comedy movie featuring Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride playing fictional versions of themselves facing a global apocalypse.

5|$|Hydrogen cyanide, {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The <b>new</b> <b>product</b> was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The <b>new</b> <b>product</b> was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E
5|$|Tactical design {{management}} addresses the organisation of design resources and design processes. Its {{goal is to}} create a structure for design in the company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic {{design management}} and the implementation of design on the operational level. It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding new market opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related {{to the creation of a}} structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical design manager, design director, design & innovation manager, brand design manager, <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.|$|E
40|$|In five studies, {{the authors}} examine {{the impact of}} an {{independent}} (vs. interdependent) mindset on consumer adoption of <b>new</b> <b>products.</b> Study 1 demonstrates that consumers in a predominantly independent (vs. interdependent) culture are more willing to adopt really <b>new</b> <b>products,</b> whereas consumers in a predominantly interdependent (vs. independent) culture are more willing to adopt incrementally <b>new</b> <b>products.</b> Studies 2 and 3 conceptually replicate these findings using situationally activated mindsets and demonstrate that this effect is driven by the perceived fit between the product’s newness level and the optimal level of distinctiveness consumers want. Finally, Studies 4 a and 4 b show that the presence of distinctiveness-dampening cues (i. e., popularity cues) and distinctiveness-enhancing cues (i. e., scarcity cues) can reverse the effect of self-perspective such that the independent self becomes less willing to adopt really <b>new</b> <b>products</b> and more willing to adopt incrementally <b>new</b> <b>products</b> than does the interdependent self. These findings offer practical implications for managing innovation adoption in both domestic and international marketplaces...|$|R
