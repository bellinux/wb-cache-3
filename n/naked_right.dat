60|$|The palpable or visible Aaron sat at {{the side}} of the boat, on the end of the middle seat, with his <b>naked</b> <b>right</b> elbow leaning out over the side. And now the boat entered upon shallows. The impalpable Aaron in the bows saw the whitish clay of the bottom swirl up in clouds at each thrust of the oars, whitish-clayey clouds which would {{envelope}} the strange fishes in a sudden mist. And on the right hand of the course stakes stood up in the water, at intervals, to mark the course.|$|E
60|$|I was {{a little}} {{surprised}} at hearing this answer, and at witnessing this manifestation of feeling in Chainbearer, who, ordinarily, was a cool, and uniformly a courteous man. On reflection, however, I saw he was not so wrong. An exchange of anything like civilities between us and our captors, might seem to give them some claim on us; whereas, by standing on the <b>naked</b> <b>right,</b> we had every advantage of them, in a moral sense, at least. Zephaniah and his brethren left us, on receiving this repulse of Andries; but Susquesus kept loitering around the storehouse, apparently little better off now he was on its outside than he had been when in it. He had nothing to do, and his idleness was that of an Indian--one of a race of such terrible energies, when energy is required, and so frequently listless, when not pressed upon by necessity, pleasure, war or interest.|$|E
40|$|This comment {{focuses on}} the Louisiana Legislature’s recent {{deletion}} of a <b>naked</b> owner’s explicit <b>right</b> to alienate or encumber {{his or her own}} property. Part II of this comment provides the historical background of Louisiana Civil Code article 603, particularly the loss of the explicit <b>right</b> of the <b>naked</b> owner to alienate the property itself and the addition of the more tenuous right to alienate his naked ownership. Part III applies several different statutory interpretations to the article to determine how the revised article should be interpreted. Part IV explains the practical implications of the 2010 revision on Louisiana immovable property. Finally, Part V concludes by reiterating that despite the statutory comment that the 2010 revision did not change the law, the most recent alteration to the language affords the <b>naked</b> owner less <b>rights...</b>|$|R

6000|$|Lowering a boat instantly, he {{equipped}} Wymontoo and the Dane with a cutlass apiece, and seizing another himself, {{off they}} started in pursuit, the ship's ensign {{flying in the}} boat's stern. The alarmed islanders, beaching their canoe, with loud cries fled through the village, the mate after them, slashing his <b>naked</b> weapon to <b>right</b> and left. A crowd soon collected; and the [...] "Karhowree toonee," [...] or crazy stranger, was quickly taken before Wilson.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier {{in season}} 2, she dated Joe Swanson's son Kevin Swanson, but in [...] "Stew-Roids" [...] it is {{mentioned}} that Kevin died in Iraq. In the episode, [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", she dates {{a boy named}} Doug, but he breaks up with her when he sees her <b>naked</b> <b>right</b> before almost having sex. In the episode [...] "Peter's Daughter", Meg {{falls in love with}} a medical student named Michael Milano after coming out of a short coma (caused by Peter when he asked her to [...] "rescue" [...] beer and make him a sandwich out of an already flooded kitchen) and they start to date. After he breaks up with Meg (because of Peter being overprotective of her after promising that if she came out of the coma, he would [...] "treat her like a princess"), she announces that she is pregnant by Michael and the two get engaged. After finding out that she is not actually pregnant, Meg tells Michael the truth hoping that he will stay, however, Michael quickly leaves Meg at the altar. In the episode [...] "Dial Meg for Murder", she is dating a convict, while in the episode [...] "Go, Stewie, Go!" [...] she dates an attractive young man named Anthony, who is absolutely normal (much to the surprise and chagrin of many of the other characters). They were so shocked that they had to do tests just to see if he was completely normal which annoyed Meg. It is presumed that she broke up with him after he and Lois had an affair.|$|E

When found, he is tied to a chair. At some point Nardo frees himself, jumps into the truck and drives away. He gets to see Tracy through a hotel window but before he gets to her, he gets caught by a guard and sent to jail.|$|R
60|$|And thus, while {{standing}} on the scaffold, in this vain show of expiation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind, as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his <b>naked</b> breast, <b>right</b> over his heart. On that spot, in very truth, there was, and there had long been, the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain. Without any effort of his will, or power to restrain himself, he shrieked aloud: an outcry that went pealing through the night, and was beaten back from one house to another, and reverberated from the hills in the background; as if a company of devils, detecting so much misery and terror in it, had made a plaything of the sound, and were bandying it to and fro.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the main}} portal {{is one of}} the most {{complete}} Late Gothic sculpture collections in Europe. This collection represents the Christian belief in a Last Judgment where the wicked will be separated from the righteous. This sculpture shows the wicked <b>naked</b> on the <b>right,</b> while the righteous stand clothed in white on the left. In the center is Justice, with Saints and the wise and foolish virgins around her. In the centre stands Michael the Archangel with a raised sword.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{his eyes}} opened and took in the scene beneath him--even in that brief instant of perception, {{followed}} reason, judgment, and decision, so rapidly one upon {{the heels of the}} other that almost simultaneously the ape-man was in mid-air, for he had seen a white-skinned creature cast in a mold similar to his own, pursued by Tarzan's hereditary enemy. So close was the lion to the fleeing man-thing that Tarzan had no time carefully to choose the method of his attack. As a diver leaps from the springboard headforemost into the waters beneath, so Tarzan of the Apes dove straight for Numa, the lion; <b>naked</b> in his <b>right</b> hand the blade of his father that so many times before had tasted the blood of lions.|$|R
30|$|The {{increasing}} number of environmental organizations is a good indicator for insufficiency and anomalousness. As Utting (2005) mentioned that several environmental disasters, linked to large companies or specific industries, became high-profile international issues around which activists and non-governmental organizations mobilized. Numerous international (WNO, 1 WWF, 2 PETA, 3 Greenpeace, etc.), regional (EEA, 4 PEMSEA, 5 etc.) and national (Birds Australia—Australia, Toronto Environmental Alliance—Canada, etc.), governmental, intergovernmental, or non-governmental organizations were established to control or protest companies because of their harmful operations. These organizations engaging in both legal and illegal activities, civilians protesting world leaders at G 8 summits because of environmental issues, and even models going <b>naked</b> for animal <b>rights!</b> (PETA), can all be given as examples of anomalous behaviors. Furthermore, an {{increasing number}} of scientists criticizing companies for their harmful effects on the environment and journals focused on environmental issues are evidence of anomalous behaviors in business literature. When all of these anomalies are evaluated together, it can be foreseen that in today’s society, it is possible to find many individuals and groups engaging in anomalous activities and people adopting the nature centered paradigm and abandoning the human centered one.|$|R
5000|$|The ivory figurine {{is about}} 7.5 cm high, 2.9 cm long and c. 2.6 cm wide and {{partially}} damaged. Its outer surface was originally smooth and polished to a sheen. The statuette depicts Khufu with the Red crown (deshret) of Lower Egypt. The King {{sits on a}} largely undecorated throne with a low back. In his right hand, which is placed over his breast, he holds a flail against his right shoulder with the flail lying over his upper arm. His left arm is bent with his lower arm resting on his left thigh. The left hand is open, with the palm resting on his left knee. His feet have broken away, along with the pedestal. The red crown is damaged - both the ridge at the back and the decorative spiral at the front have broken off. His head is slightly over proportioned relative to his body, with large, projecting ears. His chin is angular {{and he does not}} wear the Pharaonic ceremonial beard. The king wears a short, pleated loincloth - his upper body is <b>naked.</b> On the <b>right</b> side, at Khufu's knee is the Horus name [...] "Medjedu" [...] and {{on the left side of}} the knee, the very faint traces of the end of his nomen [...] "Khnum-Khufu" [...] is visible in a cartouche.|$|R
6000|$|XVII. That {{the first}} of his three instituted projects, namely, the depriving the Rajah of his territories, was by himself {{considered}} as a measure likely to be productive of much odium to the British government: he having declared, whatever opinions he might entertain of its justice, [...] "that it would have an appearance of severity, and might furnish grounds unfavorable to the credit of our government, and to his own reputation, from the natural influence which every act of rigor, exercised in the persons of men in elevated situations, is apt to impress on those who are too remote from the scene of action to judge, by any evidence of the facts themselves, of their motives or propriety." [...] And the second attempt, the sum of money which he aimed at by attacking the fortresses of the Rajah, and plundering them of the treasure supposed to be there secured, besides the obvious uncertainty of acquiring what was thus sought, would be liable to the same imputations with the former. And with regard to the third project, namely, the sale of the Company's sovereignty to the Nabob of Oude, and his having actually received proposals for the same, it was an high offence to the Company, as presuming, without their authority or consent, to put up to sale their sovereign rights, and particularly to put them up to sale to that very person against whom the independence of the said province had been declared by the Governor-General and Council to be necessary, as a barrier for the security of the other provinces, in case of a future rupture with him.[59] It was an heinous injury to the said Rajah to attempt to change his relation without his consent, especially on account of the person to whom he was to be made over for money, by reason of the known enmity subsisting between his family and that of the Nabob, who was to be the purchaser; and it was a grievous outrage on the innocent inhabitants of the zemindary of Benares to propose putting them under a person long before described by himself to the Court of Directors [...] "to want the qualities of the head and heart requisite for his station"; and a letter from the British Resident at Oude, transmitted to the said Court, represents him [...] "to have wholly lost, by his oppressions, the confidence and affections of his own subjects"; and whose distresses, and the known disorders in his government, he, the said Hastings, did attribute solely to his own bad conduct and evil character; admitting also, in a letter written to Edward Wheler, Esquire, and transmitted to the Court of Directors, [...] "that many circumstances did favor suspicion of his [the said Nabob's] fidelity to the English interest, the Nabob being surrounded by men base in their characters and improvident in their understandings, his favorites, and his companions of his looser hours. These had every cause to dread the effect of my influence on theirs; and both these, and the relations of the family, whose views of consequence and power were intercepted by our participation in the administration of his affairs, entertained a mortal hatred to our nation, and openly avowed it." [...] And the said Hastings was well aware, that, in case the Nabob, by him described in the manner aforesaid, on making such purchase, should continue to observe the terms of his father's original covenants and engagements with the Rajah, and should pay the Company the only tribute which he could lawfully exact from the said Rajah, it was impossible that he could, for the mere <b>naked</b> and unprofitable <b>rights</b> of a sovereignty paramount, afford to offer so great a sum as the Rajah did offer to the said Hastings for his redemption from oppression; such an acquisition to the Nabob (while he kept his faith) could not possibly be of any advantage whatever to him; and that therefore, if a great sum was to be paid by the Nabob of Oude, it must be for the purpose of oppression and violation of public faith, to be perpetrated in the person of the said Nabob, to an extent and in a manner which the said Hastings was then apprehensive he could not justify to the Court of Directors as his own personal act.|$|R
