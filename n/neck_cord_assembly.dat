According to Shefford's eye {{measurement}} the stone was nearly oval, perhaps three feet high, by {{a little over two}} in width. Joe threw off his sombrero, took a deep breath, and, bending over, clasped the stone in his arms. He was an exceedingly heavy and powerful man, and it was plain to Shefford that he meant to lift the stone if that were possible. Joe's broad shoulders strained, flattened; his arms bulged, his joints cracked, his <b>neck</b> <b>corded,</b> and his face turned black. By gigantic effort he lifted the stone and moved it about six inches. Then as he released his hold he fell, and when he sat up his face was wet with sweat.|$|R

40|$|Sertoli cells play a {{significant}} role in regulating fetal testis compartmentalization to generate testis cords and interstitium during development. The Sertoli cell Wilms' tumor 1 (Wt 1) gene, which encodes ~ 24 zinc finger-containing transcription factors, is known to play a crucial role in fetal testis <b>cord</b> <b>assembly</b> and maintenance. However, whether Wt 1 regulates fetal testis compartmentalization by modulating the development of peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) and/or fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) remains unknown. Using a Wt 1 -/flox; Amh-Cre mouse model by deleting Wt 1 in Sertoli cells (Wt 1 SC-cKO) at embryonic day 14. 5 (E 14. 5), Wt 1 was found to regulate PMC and FLC development. Wt 1 deletion in fetal testis Sertoli cells caused aberrant differentiation and proliferation of PMCs, FLCs and interstitial progenitor cells from embryo to newborn, leading to abnormal fetal testis interstitial development. Specifically, the expression of PMC marker genes α-Sma, Myh 11 and Des, and interstitial progenitor cell marker gene Vcam 1 were down-regulated, whereas FLC marker genes StAR, Cyp 11 a 1, Cyp 17 a 1 and Hsd 3 b 1 were up-regulated, in neonatal Wt 1 SC-cKO testes. The ratio of PMC:FLC were also reduced in Wt 1 SC-cKO testes, concomitant with a down-regulation of Notch signaling molecules Jag 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, and Hes 1 in neonatal Wt 1 SC-cKO testes, illustrating changes in the differentiation status of FLC from their interstitial progenitor cells during fetal testis development. In summary, Wt 1 regulates the development of FLC and interstitial progenitor cell lineages through Notch signaling, and it also plays a role in PMC development. Collectively, these effects confer fetal testis compartmentalization...|$|R

5000|$|Ultrasound {{diagnosis}} of a <b>cord</b> around the <b>neck</b> was first described in 1982. [...] “Coils occur in about 25% of cases and ordinarily do no harm, but occasionally they may be so tight that constriction of the umbilical vessels and consequent hypoxia result.” Williams Obstetrics 16th Edition, has only one single sentence in the entire textbook regarding cords around the neck:(P.421) By contrast, the First Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica from 1770 had 20 pages of information about Umbilical Cord Pathology with drawings of Umbilical Cord Entanglement. The Royal College of OBGYN has these images on its brochure. There are currently three recent texts on Ultrasonography which demonstrate the ability of ultrasound to identify umbilical cord issues with reliability as of 2009.A study published in 2004 was done to establish the sensitivity of ultrasound in the {{diagnosis of}} a nuchal cord. Each of 289 women, induced the same day, underwent a transabdominal ultrasound scan with an Aloka 1700 ultrasound machine with a 3.5 MHz abdominal probe, using gray-scale and color Doppler imaging immediately prior to induction of labor. Presence of the cord was sought in the transverse and sagittal plane of the <b>neck.</b> A nuchal <b>cord</b> was diagnosed if the cord was visualized lying around at least 3 of the 4 sides of the <b>neck.</b> A <b>cord</b> was actually present at delivery in 52 of the 289 women. Only 18 of the 52 cords or 35% of the nuchal cords were detected on ultrasound done immediately before delivery, and 65% of nuchal cords were not detected. Of the 237 cases {{where there was no}} cord at delivery, ultrasound had false positive results, i.e. diagnosed a cord in 44 of the 237 cases (19%) in which there was no cord present at all. In this study, ultrasound was only 35% accurate at finding a single loop, and only 60% accurate at detecting a nuchal cord wrapped multiple times around the neck.|$|R

It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her. She was shocked by this thought. It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature. Besides, strength to her was a gross and brutish thing. Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender gracefulness. Yet the thought still persisted. It bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck. In truth, she was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for strength. But she did not know it. She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had, who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar.|$|R
50|$|When cougars do attack, {{they usually}} employ their {{characteristic}} neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae {{and into the}} spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Neck,</b> head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal. Children are at greatest risk of attack, and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks prior to 1991 showed that 64% of all victims - and almost all fatalities - were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in British Columbia, particularly on Vancouver Island where cougar populations are especially dense. Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, such as activity during daylight hours, a lack of fear of humans, and stalking humans. There have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people.|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{subluxation}} of the cervical spine {{is a well}} recognised and {{not uncommon}} complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It can occur at the atlanto-axial level and the clinical features were described by Sharp and Purser (1961) and by Robinson (1966). Conlon, Isdale and Rose (I 966) found a 25 per cent incidence of atlanto-axial subluxation in 337 consecutive hospital admissions for rheumatoid arthritis, and the same incidence was found by Mathews (1969) in a tomographic study. Subluxations, which are often serial, also occur at lower levels in the cervical spine (Sharp, Purser and Lawrence 1958; Bland, Davis, London, van Buskirk and Duarte 1963). Many of these patients are free from symptoms, or complain only of increasing pain in the <b>neck,</b> but <b>cord</b> pressure with tetraplegia can ensue (Hopkins 1967).

NSAIDs are not usually recommended due to their counter action to prolotherapy-induced inflammation, but are occasionally used in patients with pain refractory to other methods of pain control. Theoretical adverse events of prolotherapy injection include lightheadedness, allergic reactions to the agent used, bruising, infection, or nerve damage.
