5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats. He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond's two seats at Metro Vancouver. With <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> own party members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation bylaw, and wanting to hire more police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where Wyatt was buried, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
5|$|Rojhaz {{is in fact}} Steve Rogers, {{the future}} costumed superhero known as Captain America. After {{fighting}} against a future fascist government dictatorship of the 21st century run by the President-For-Life, Rogers was captured. Wanting to dispose of Rogers so completely that <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> ashes would remain to inspire future rebellion, the President-for-Life had Rogers placed into a machine which should have killed him but instead sent him into the 1602 timeline. His presence not only brought about a rift that will destroy the universe, but it also caused the heroes {{of the twentieth century}} to appear centuries earlier to counter the Forerunner's negative effects.|$|E

500|$|From August 1989 to March 1990, Rudolf Nureyev {{played the}} King in a North American tour {{opposite}} Liz Robertson, with Kermoyan as the Kralahome, directed by Arthur Storch {{and with the}} original Robbins choreography. Reviews were uniformly critical, lamenting that Nureyev failed to embody the character, [...] "a King who stands around like a sulky teenager who didn't ask {{to be invited to}} this party. ... <b>Not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> one dance number ... goes well. ... Rodgers and Hammerstein's King [...] supposed to be a compelling personality [...] bears no resemblance to the man described ... in the [...] "Something Wonderful" [...] number. [...] The show therefore comes across as something of a charade ... with everyone pretending to be dealing with a fearsome potentate who, in fact, is displaying very little personality at all." ...|$|E
500|$|I, the Supreme (orig. Spanish Yo el supremo) is a {{historical}} novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos. It is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who was also known as [...] "Dr. Francia." [...] The book's title derives {{from the fact that}} Francia referred to himself as [...] "El Supremo" [...] or [...] "the Supreme." [...] The first {{in a long line of}} dictators, the Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. [...] The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two. [...] The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. <b>Not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade. Language, as powerful as it is, can never be controlled and can just as easily be used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance.|$|E

500|$|Hirst {{gave the}} {{impression}} of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile [...] "went right round his head and met at the back." [...] Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's Times obituary said: [...] "No why or wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> record which adorns the pages of Wisden can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, {{and he was one of}} the most illustrious of his time." [...] Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as [...] "George Herbert", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been [...] a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: [...] "He was very good. But he didn't know how to use it, you know. I had to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meyer {{subsequently}} {{worked as}} an engineer and as a high-school teacher of math and physics. [...] By {{the time of his}} death at almost age 90 in 1972, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> family or his neighbors in Bad Bevensen, Germany were aware of the formative role he had played, with Ludwig Prandtl, in the scientific discipline known as compressible flow or gas dynamics.|$|E

Rather, the oft acknowledged [...] "genius" [...] of Dickens seems to have overshadowed all reviews and {{made it impossible for}} most critics to completely condemn the work, the majority of these reviews being a mixture of praise and disparagement.|$|E

2500|$|American {{teenagers}} of the mid-1950s, when James Dean's major {{films were}} made, identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially that of Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause. The film depicts {{the dilemma of}} a typical teenager of the time, who feels that no one, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> peers, can understand him. Humphrey Bogart commented after Dean's death about his public image and legacy: [...] "Dean died {{at just the right}} time. He left behind a legend. If he had lived, he'd never have been able {{to live up to his}} publicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{double wall}} was raised around {{him to keep}} the crowd of people from coming too close and {{disturbing}} his prayerful concentration. Women, in general, were not permitted beyond the wall, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> own mother, reportedly telling her, [...] "If we are worthy, we shall see {{one another in the}} life to come." [...] She submitted to this, remaining in the area, and embraced the monastic life of silence and prayer. When she died, Simeon asked that her coffin be brought to him. He reverently bade farewell to his dead mother.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, a California {{appellate court}} {{discussed}} the film's allegations as it denied Polanski's request {{to have the}} case dismissed. While saying it was [...] "deeply concerned" [...] by the allegations, and that the allegations were [...] "in many cases supported by considerable evidence," [...] it also found that [...] "(e)ven in light of our fundamental concern about the misconduct... flight was not Polanski’s only option. It was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> best option." [...] It said dismissal of the case, which would erase Polanski's guilty plea, wouldn't be an [...] "appropriate result," [...] and that he still had other legal options.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{was born}} to an {{affluent}} family in Copenhagen. His mother, Ane Sørensdatter Lund Kierkegaard, {{had served as a}} maid in the household before marrying his father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard. She was an unassuming figure: quiet, plain, and not formally educated but Henriette Lund, her granddaughter, wrote that she [...] "wielded the sceptre with joy and protected [...] like a hen protecting her chicks". His father was a [...] "very stern man, to all appearances dry and prosaic, but under his 'rustic cloak' demeanor he concealed an active imagination which <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> great age could blunt". He read the philosophy of Christian Wolff. Kierkegaard preferred the comedies of Ludvig Holberg, the writings of Georg Johann Hamann, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Edward Young and Plato, especially those referring to Socrates.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about his early life, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> {{approximate}} birthdate, but he was probably {{from the village of}} Longueval in the Somme region of Picardy (scene of much heavy fighting during the Somme battles in 1916). [...] By 1498, court records indicate that he was employed by Anne of Brittany, and between 1502 and 1504 he was a singer at the Savoy court, where his high pay indicates the respect he was accorded as a musician. From there he went to Ferrara, where he was a singer between December 1503 and September 1504; therefore he was there {{at the same time as}} Josquin des Prez. [...] It is presumed that he wrote his most famous composition, the passion setting Passio Domini nostri for Holy Week of 1504, the same event for which Josquin's famous Miserere was likely written.|$|E
2500|$|By 1903, {{his last}} hope of being hired lay in Natalia's son, King Alexander of Serbia, but {{the latter was}} assassinated that year.

At that point, he was obliged to earn a living by writing, a {{practice}} he took up not just out of obligation, but also {{out of a sense of}} duty to keep alive a vanished world. According to the journalist Corneliu Carp, although an [...] "infirm", his early years in Tătărași, [...] "one of [...] more pleasant" [...] suburbs, were serene and [...] "almost monastic". Yet, [...] "nobody knows the goings-on of his life, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> well-off relatives with their rightful princely splendor; only now and then do young students visit him, keen on learning from his sweet elderly voice the stories of his parents' Bessarabia." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} was first portrayed by William Hartnell in 1963. At the programme's beginning, {{nothing at all}} is known of the Doctor: <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> name, the actual form of which remains a mystery. In the first serial, An Unearthly Child, two teachers from Coal Hill School in London, Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton, become intrigued by one of their pupils, Susan Foreman, who exhibits high intelligence and unusually advanced knowledge. Trailing her to a junk yard at 76 Totter's Lane, they encounter a strange old man and hear Susan's voice coming from inside {{what appears to be}} a police box. Pushing their way inside, the two find that the exterior is camouflage for the dimensionally transcendental interior of the TARDIS. The old man, whom Susan calls [...] "Grandfather", kidnaps Barbara and Ian to prevent them from telling anyone about the existence of the TARDIS, taking them on an adventure in time and space. The first Doctor, says cultural scholar John Paul Green, [...] "explicitly positioned the Doctor as grandfather to his companion Susan." [...] He wore a long white wig and Edwardian costume, reflecting, Green says, a [...] "definite sense of Englishness".|$|E
2500|$|The modernist critic Yuly Aykhenvald, {{analyzing}} the cliché formula that bonded [...] "Maykov, Polonsky and Fet" [...] into a solid group of similar-minded authors, alleged that Maykov [...] "to {{a lesser extent}} {{than the other two}} freed himself from the habit of copying classics" [...] and [...] "in his earlier works was unoriginal, producing verse that shone with reflected light." [...] <b>Not</b> <b>even</b> <b>his</b> passionate love for classics could help the author submerge [...] "wholly into the pagan element," [...] the critic opined.He was a scholar of antiquity and his gift, self-admittedly [...] "has been strengthened by being tempered in the fire of science." [...] As a purveyor of classicism, his very soul was not deep or naive enough to fully let this spirit in or embrace the antique idea of intellectual freedom. Poems, inhabited by naiads, nymphs, muses and dryads, are very pretty, and you can't help being enchanted by these ancient fables. But he gives you no chance to forget for a moment that – what for his ancient heroes was life itself, for him is only a myth, a 'clever lie' he could never believe himself.|$|E
