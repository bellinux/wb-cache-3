25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the <b>normal</b> <b>tolerance</b> in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

AIMS: To report contemporary regression rates from impaired glucose regulation to <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance,</b> identify modifiable factors {{associated with}} early regression, and establish whether it affects subsequent diabetes risk in a population-based cohort. METHODS: Participants with impaired glucose regulation (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance on a 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test) at baseline in the UK-based ADDITION-Leicester study had annual Type 2 diabetes re-screens for 5 years or until diabetes diagnosis. Logistic regression models investigated modifiable risk factors for regression to <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> at 1 year (n= 817). Cox regression models estimated subsequent diabetes risk (n= 630). RESULTS: At 1 year, 54 % of participants had regressed to <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance,</b> and 6 % had progressed to diabetes. Regression to <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> was associated with weight loss of 0. 1 - 3 % [adjusted odds ratio 1. 81 (95 % CI 1. 08, 3. 03) compared with maintaining or gaining weight] and a waist circumference reduction of > 3 cm [adjusted odds ratio 1. 78 (95 % CI 1. 03, 3. 06) compared with maintaining or increasing waist circumference]. Those with <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> at 1 year subsequently had lower diabetes risk than those who remained with impaired glucose regulation [adjusted hazard ratio 0. 19 (95 % CI 0. 10, 0. 37) ]. CONCLUSIONS: Early regression to <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> was associated with reduced diabetes incidence, and might be induced by small reductions in weight or waist circumference.

METHODS: We studied 169 European untreated obese children and adolescents with <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> at baseline. Waist circumference, fasting glucose, lipids, blood pressure, pubertal stage, 2 h glucose in oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), and HbA 1 c were determined at baseline and 1 year later. RESULTS: One year after baseline, 19 (11. 2 %) children demonstrated IGT, 4 (2. 4 %) children had impaired fasting glucose, no (0 %) child suffered from diabetes, and 146 (86 %) children still showed <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance.</b> At baseline, the children with IGT and with <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> in a one-year follow-up did not differ significantly in respect of any analyzed parameter, apart from pubertal stage.

All women with gestational diabetes re-established <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> after delivery. Results Meal intake did not affect serum chemerin levels.

The 95 / 50 <b>Normal</b> <b>Tolerance</b> Limit (NTL) is proposed as a means of determining which test results should be scored. This paper presents comparisons of Shock Response Spectra (SRS) used for the 95 / 50 scoring criteria. The paper also provides a Discussion Section outlining some concerns with scoring LAT results based on test results outside of the proposed 95 / 50 criteria...|$|E
40|$|Tetraparental (allophenic) mice, made {{chimeric}} at the eight-cell stage {{by joining}} two embryos from histoincompatible parental strains, were examined by a microcytotoxicity test. The {{results indicate that}} parental-strain fibroblasts are more effectively destroyed in vitro by lymph node cells from the tetraparental mice than by lymph node cells from the F 1 hybrid or either parental stain. The destruction by tetraparental lymph node cells is indistinguishable from that mediated by lymph node cells from previously immunized allogeneic animals. It can be prevented by serum from the tetraparental mice, but not by sera from the F 1 hybrid or the parental strain animals. The results suggest that a concomitant immunity and serum blocking effect, rather than a central failure of the immune response, may mediate some aspects of <b>normal</b> <b>tolerance...</b>|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the differences in insulin sensitivity (IS) and secretion in obese adolescents with IGT compared with those with <b>normal</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> (NGT) and type 2 diabetes...|$|R

A simplified technique for resection and anastomosis of the trachea was employed.
