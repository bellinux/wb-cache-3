500|$|This set shows a {{stronger}} Toyokuni influence, rather than Sharaku; while basically striving for realism, {{there is an}} idealizing tendency in the rendering of the facial expressions. [...] The prints depict actors in the roles of three brothers from the [...] "Kuruma-biki" [...] episode of the play Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami (1796). [...] The scene depicts Umeōmaru and Sakuramaru waiting in ambush for [...] [...] Their brother Matsuōmaru, who is loyal to Shihei, foils their plot. [...] He appears in the portrait with a protruding beak-like noese and his hair brushed back at the sides. [...] He wears a hat, carries a spear, and wears a check-patterned robe {{with a set of}} h-shaped genji-mon crests on them, indicating a chapter from the Genji Monogatari. [...] The Nakamura Noshio II has <b>no</b> <b>seal,</b> and the other two bear the seal [...] "Kabukidō Ga" [...] ( [...] , [...] "drawn by Kabukidō"). [...] The print of Nakamura Noshio II as Sakuramaru depicts the youngest of the three brothers, a romantic character whose symbol is the sakura cherry blossom. [...] The character was sometimes performed by an onnagata, an actor specializing in female roles.|$|E

6000|$|Kate's impatience was {{too great}} {{to allow her to}} wait, so she {{untwisted}} the paper, which had <b>no</b> <b>seal</b> or fastening. She had hoped in her heart to see the name of her lover at the end of it. Instead of that, her eye fell upon the signature of Ezra Girdlestone. What could he have to say to her? She moved the solitary candle on to the mantelpiece, and read the following note, roughly scribbled upon a coarse piece of paper:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|The Constitutions were read, {{and proved}} to contain much that was {{contrary}} to the canons of the Church; they were discussed and commented on for three days, and then, to Becket's surprise and dismay, he was required not only to agree to them by word of mouth, as he had already done, but to set his archiepiscopal seal to them. He rose, and exclaimed, much agitated, [...] "I declare by God Almighty, that <b>no</b> <b>seal</b> of mine shall ever be set to such Constitutions as these." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next thing}} {{material}} in the Letter, is the questioning {{the legality of the}} Declaration; which the Author sayes by the new style of his Majesty in Council, is order'd to be read in all Churches and Chappels throughout England, And which no doubt the blind obedience of our Clergy, will see carefully perform'd; yet if it be true, that there is <b>no</b> <b>Seal,</b> nor Order of Council, but only the Clerks hand to it, they may be call'd in question as publishers of false news, and invectives against a third Estate of the Kingdom.|$|E

60|$|This happy {{conclusion}} to {{several hours of}} severe toil, occurred just as the field had drifted abreast of the cove, and was about {{the centre of the}} bay. Hazard came up also at that point, on his return from the volcano, altering his course a little to speak the strangers. The report of the mate concerning his discoveries was simple and brief. There was a volcano, and one in activity; but it had nothing remarkable about it. <b>No</b> <b>seal</b> were seen, and there was little to reward one for crossing the bay. Sterility, and a chill grandeur, were the characteristics of all that region; and these were not wanting to any part of the group. Just as the sun was setting, Gardiner piloted his companion into the cove; and the two Sea Lions were moored amicably side by side, and that too at a spot where thousands of the real animals were to be found within a league.|$|E
60|$|Your Committee, {{on reading}} the paper {{delivered}} in by Mr. Scott as a translation, perceive it to be written in a style which they conceived was little to be expected in a faithful translation from a Persian original, being full of quaint terms and idiomatic phrases, which strongly bespeak English habits {{in the way of}} thinking, and of English peculiarities and affectations in the expression. Struck with these strong internal marks of a suspicious piece, they turned to the Persian manuscript produced by Mr. Scott and Mr. Baber, and comparing it with Mr. Goring's papers, they found the latter carefully sealed upon every leaf, as they believe is the practice universal in all authentic pieces. They found on the former <b>no</b> <b>seal</b> or signature whatsoever, either at the top or bottom of the scroll. This circumstance of a want of signature not only takes away all authority from the piece as evidence, but strongly confirmed the suspicions entertained by your Committee, on reading the translation, of unwarrantable practices in the whole conduct of this business, even if the translation should be found substantially to agree with the original, such an original as it is. The Persian roll is in the custody of the clerk of your Committee for further examination.|$|E
6000|$|The day of {{the debate}} had come, and Phineas Finn was still sitting in his room at the Colonial Office. But his {{resignation}} had been sent in and accepted, and he was simply awaiting the coming of his successor. About noon his successor came, {{and he had the}} gratification of resigning his arm-chair to Mr. Bonteen. It is generally understood that gentlemen leaving offices give up either seals or a portfolio. Phineas had been put in possession of <b>no</b> <b>seal</b> and no portfolio; but there was in the room which he had occupied a special arm-chair, and this with much regret he surrendered to the use and comfort of Mr. Bonteen. There was a glance of triumph in his enemy's eyes, and an exultation in the tone of his enemy's voice, which were very bitter to him. [...] "So you are really going?" [...] said Mr. Bonteen. [...] "Well; I dare say it is all very proper. I don't quite understand the thing myself, but I have no doubt you are right." [...] "It isn't easy to understand; is it?" [...] said Phineas, trying to laugh. But Mr. Bonteen did not feel the intended satire, and poor Phineas found it useless to attempt to punish the man he hated. He left him as quickly as he could, and went {{to say a few words}} of farewell to his late chief.|$|E

60|$|Since {{he writes}} this only upon a {{supposition}}, {{it will be}} time enough to answer it, when the supposition is made manifest in all its parts: In the meantime, let him give me leave to suppose too, that in case it be true that there be <b>no</b> <b>Seal,</b> yet since it is no Proclamation, but only a bare Declaration of his Majesty, to inform and satisfie his Subjects, of the reasons which induc'd him to dissolve the two last Parliaments, a Seal in this case, is not of absolute necessity: for the King speaks not here as commanding any thing, but the Printing, publishing and reading. And 'tis not denyed the meanest Englishman, to vindicate himself in Print, when he has any aspersion cast upon him. This is manifestly the case, that the Enemies of the Government, had endeavour'd to insinuate into the People such Principles, as this Answerer now publishes: and therefore his Majesty, who is always tender to preserve the affections of his Subjects, desir'd to lay before them the necessary reasons, which induc'd him to so unpleasant a thing, as the parting with two successive Parliaments. And if the Clergy obey him in so just a Design, is this to be nam'd a blind Obedience! But I wonder why our Author is so eager for the calling them to account as Accessaries to an Invective against a third Estate of the Kingdom, while he himself is guilty in almost every sentence of his discourse of aspersing the King, even in his own Person, with all the Virulency and Gall imaginable. It appears plainly that an House of Commons, is that Leviathan which he Adores: that is his Sovereign in effect, and a third Estate is not only greater than the other two, but than him who is presiding over the three.|$|E
60|$|But, {{with all}} this {{intimate}} familiarity, {{there was still a}} reserve in Beatrice's demeanor, so rigidly and invariably sustained that the idea of infringing it scarcely occurred to his imagination. By all appreciable signs, they loved; they had looked love with eyes that conveyed the holy secret from the depths of one soul into the depths of the other, as if it were too sacred to be whispered by the way; they had even spoken love in those gushes of passion when their spirits darted forth in articulated breath like tongues of long-hidden flame; and yet there had been <b>no</b> <b>seal</b> of lips, no clasp of hands, nor any slightest caress such as love claims and hallows. He had never touched one of the gleaming ringlets of her hair; her garment--so marked was the physical barrier between them--had never been waved against him by a breeze. On the few occasions when Giovanni had seemed tempted to overstep the limit, Beatrice grew so sad, so stern, and withal wore such a look of desolate separation, shuddering at itself, that not a spoken word was requisite to repel him. At such times he was startled at the horrible suspicions that rose, monster-like, out of the caverns of his heart and stared him in the face; his love grew thin and faint as the morning mist, his doubts alone had substance. But, when Beatrice's face brightened again after the momentary shadow, she was transformed at once from the mysterious, questionable being whom he had watched with so much awe and horror; she was now the beautiful and unsophisticated girl whom he felt that his spirit knew with a certainty beyond all other knowledge.|$|E
