5|$|Although <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> domesticated, a {{small number}} of jungle cats have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, suggesting that they may have been used to help control rodent populations.|$|E
5|$|On Friday morning, the Santa Barbara County {{office of}} {{emergency}} services {{declared a state of}} emergency for the region. Additionally a Red flag warning was issued for the region effective through Saturday at 6:00am. While firefighters battled the fire into the weekend, they were aided by weather changes which included reduced winds and higher humidities as the red flag conditions <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> emerged.|$|E

5|$|His successor, Tanutamun, {{also made}} a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He {{successfully}} defeated Necho, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes {{to such an extent}} it <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> recovered. A native ruler, Psammetichus I was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again to pose a threat to either Assyria or Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The Bahamas did {{not come}} under {{external}} threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to bolster the island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 {{in an attempt to}} recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> regained his health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E

5|$|Rupert's {{reputation}} <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> recovered, and {{in subsequent}} sieges and attacks he was frequently accused of acting without restraint. Birmingham, a key arms producing town, {{was taken in}} April 1643, and Rupert faced allegations—probably untrue—of wilfully burning the town to the ground (see the battle of Camp Hill). Shortly afterwards Rupert attempted to take the town of Lichfield, whose garrison had executed Royalist prisoners, angrily promising to kill all the soldiers inside. Only the urgent call for assistance from the King prevented him from doing so, forcing him to agree to more lenient terms {{in exchange for a}} prompt surrender. Towards the end of the war, practices were changing for the worse across all sides; a rebellious Leicester was retaken by the Prince in May 1645, and no attempt was made to limit the subsequent killing and plunder.|$|E
5|$|The Heirs of Fate saga, {{released}} after {{the rest of}} the DLC, focuses around the game's Child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> in their homes, as Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into killing each other. However, Azura's son, Shigure, broke the illusion and banded the two Kanas' armies together, only to leave them to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to take down Anankos for one final time.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E

5|$|Katherine {{continues}} to pursue Mike, believing {{that he is}} {{still in love with}} her. Mike warns her to leave his family alone and claims he <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> loved her. After he leaves, Katherine calls 9-1-1 asking for an ambulance, and then stabs herself with a knife with Mike's fingerprints on it. Katherine frames Mike for her wound. Susan, realizing that Katherine has suffered a total nervous breakdown, calls Katherine's daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca), who comes to town and has her mother committed for psychiatric observation. Susan later forgives Katherine once she recovers from her breakdown. Soon after, Mike reveals that he has accumulated an immense debt in the past year. Unable to balance their debt, Susan and Mike decide to move off Wisteria Lane and rent their house out temporarily. They move into an apartment across town while Paul Young rents their house on Wisteria Lane.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was an avid}} reader even in his youth. He {{completed}} Clinton Grammar School {{from about}} 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, {{also known as the}} Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a trip to New York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey's house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray's specimens that he began a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany more. It was around this time that he began making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice to devote more time to botany.|$|E

25|$|The deaths (of Peter, in particular) were a blow {{from which}} Spilsbury <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> recovered. Depression over both his {{finances}} and his declining health {{are believed to}} have been a key factor in his decision to commit suicide by gas in his laboratory at University College, London, in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{numerous}} invasions by successive foreign powers, {{the city}} was <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> abandoned and was continually inhabited over the following centuries, eventually branching out to become the city of Yerevan. Erebuni's close affinity to Yerevan was celebrated in a splendid festival held in September 1968, commemorating Erebuni's 2,750th birthday.|$|E
25|$|Although Biohazard <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> {{considered}} themselves a hardcore band, Biohazard often found themselves sharing stages with bands {{associated with the}} New York hardcore scene, such as the Cro-Mags and Agnostic Front. They also shared stages with the New Jersey band Mucky Pup and a friendship between the two bands developed.|$|E
50|$|Several days later, Genji again {{challenges}} Rindaman, {{the final}} obstacle on his path to ruling Suzuran. Rindaman expresses {{his belief that}} Suzuran can <b>never</b> be <b>truly</b> conquered, and that {{there will always be}} someone left to fight. The film ends as the skirmish between Genji and Rindaman begins.|$|R
50|$|Kitiara is beautiful, {{a skilled}} warrior and, above all else, she {{is cold and}} calculating. Power-hungry, she has <b>never</b> been <b>truly</b> able to call someone a friend.

5000|$|John Searle's Chinese room argument, {{presented}} in 1980, attempted {{to show that}} a program (or any physical symbol system) could not be said to [...] "understand" [...] the symbols that it uses; that the symbols themselves have no meaning or semantic content, and so the machine can <b>never</b> be <b>truly</b> intelligent from symbol manipulation alone.|$|R
25|$|During World War II, an {{air raid}} siren {{built by the}} chief {{communications}} engineer for the University, Jack Maguire, was placed {{on top of the}} Tower to notify Austin residents of incoming air attack. As there was never an air attack on the city, this siren was only tested and <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> used. The decommissioned siren was superseded by 4 electronic warning sirens that were installed in early 2007.|$|E
25|$|The England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, was <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> settled {{throughout}} the 1980s, which {{will probably be}} remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition {{throughout the}} decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.|$|E
25|$|However, an EMT-CC's {{education}} <b>never</b> <b>truly</b> ends as continuing {{medical education}} requirements are required to maintain certification. Most agencies have a CME (Continuing Medical Education) programs where required core subjects are taught on an ongoing, usually once-a-month, basis to keep providers current. Other ways of earning required CME credits for maintaining certification include state EMS conferences, such as Vital Signs, where classes are given over the duration of a weekend.|$|E
