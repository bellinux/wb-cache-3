In this article a historical perspective is adopted to explore the challenges and multiple insecurities of Pashtun and Uzbek pastoral communities who seasonally engage in long-distance migration from the lowlands in Northern Afghanistan to the high pastures of Badakhshan. The same pasture area is regularly utilised by Shughni mountain farmers who practise combined mountain agriculture in the high mountain settlements close to Lake Shewa. Debates about <b>nomadism's</b> place in transforming societies, {{the drama of the}} commons, human security, and vulnerability issues frame the discussion of pastoralism in contested commons. Based on empirical evidence derived from open interviews with migrating pastoralists and sedentary groups on the Shewa plateau in Badakhshan, interpretations of pastoralism are presented, embedded in the context of contemporary Afghanistan. Pastoralism as a valuable survival and adaptive strategy is challenged by multiple environmental, social and political insecurities, by militancy and weak state authorities, and it unfolds in contested commons and along dangerous routes. The nexus of legal pluralism, tenure insecurity and changing control of space is identified as an important determining factor for the shape of mobile pastoralism in present-day Afghanistan...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{starts from}} an {{analysis}} of contemporary serviced apartments as they re-order and re-emphasise the importance of immaterial qualities in housing. They show that privacy, comfort and freedom as well as happiness, well-being and ease are not unequivocally positive ends which dwellings establish but that they are made possible {{in such a way}} that benefits for further capitalisation can be drawn from them. With serviced apartments, immaterial qualities are important for reasons other than people's good. This understanding of immaterial qualities opens up further investigations of dwellings that analyse the efficient entanglements of architectural design, productions of subjectivity and technologies of power. It shows that dwellings imply incorporeal engagements which are theoretically conceived as events, desires, foldings, diagrams, <b>nomadisms,</b> suspense and disavowal. And it analyses the consequence that these imperatives are not bound to any categorical architectural forms or functions but are identifiable, on a historical scale, in the many different ways in which dwellings were materially organised and, in terms of visual cultures and literature, in instances of life and living that can only be accessed in their particularities. Based on these organizations of immaterial qualities, this thesis proposes to understand dwellings as programmes which make living productive according to particular regimes of power, which work because of intensities that are experienced and made sense of and which are conceived architecturally in terms of appropriating the infinite, virtual and unaffected potential these intensities impassibly imply. This thesis claims that architectural design strategies which are meant to make dwellings serve people's good recognise workings that are in principle indefinite but actualise them so as to serve a capitalisation of living...|$|R

40|$|Resumo: Diante das incertezas que perpassam as ciências sociais na contemporaneidade não há como não questionar as trilhas conceituais e metodológicas de nossa contemplação do mundo diante de um solo humano incerto e sem garantias, seja no mundo que ousamos ver como em nossas próprias lentes. Desse modo, o objetivo desta tese é compreender e interpretar os traços das socialidades em escrituras literárias, ou seja, acompanhar trajetórias de alteridades presentes nas relações que marcam a sociedade, a partir de textos literários. A hipótese apresentada é que os rastros da socialidades estão presentes nessas narrativas literárias contemporâneas. Diante de uma confluência de gêneros e formas literárias estão buscas por exprimir uma experiência social. Na faina incessante da {{literatura}}, está um dos caminhos para uma arqueologia dessa era de incertezas, como ao mesmo tempo é um suporte, ainda que efêmero diante de um mundo que ainda não aprendemos a olhar. A partir de uma visão arqueológica do saber, este trabalho põe em diálogo os saberes das ciências sociais e o da literatura visando compreender os movimentos da vida social ou as narrativas que exprimem os contornos dessas socialidades. Aproprio-me das abordagens sobre a arqueologia dos saberes, tão pertinentes a Michel Foucault, etnografia ficcional, as concepções de Michel Maffesoli sobre a socialidade contemporânea, e reflexões sobre narrativas e escrituras literárias para traçar as leituras sobre aspectos que marcam a vida social atual nos textos dos escritores brasileiros João Gilberto Noll (Porto Alegre-RS) e de Luiz Ruffato (Cataguases-MG). Sendo assim, numa possível "etnografia ficcional" busco evidenciar que esses textos literários trazem os embates da experiência social contemporânea, neles as muitas vozes de alteridades em contraponto se tornam presentes num entrecruzamento de temporalidades, nomadismos, nas marcas de uma "geografia rarefeita das cidades", numa fúria do corpo, nos esquecimentos da memória social nas arenas de alteridades que se configuram na sociedade atual. Desse modo, nas narrativas literárias da socialidade contemporânea estão "desmontes" distintos da escritura literária e neles olhares nômades, migrantes, deslocados, "desestabilizadores da forma e do olhar", escritas que talvez, acompanhem, perpassem os embates do vividoAbstract: Facing {{the uncertainties}} that contemporarily permeate the Social Sciences, our gaze {{upon the world}} steps on uncertain and unwarranted human soil. Daring to see through our own lenses, it is inevitable to question the conceptual and methodological tracks that guide us through this path. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} thesis is to understand and interpret traces of socialities in literary writings. That is, starting from literary texts, to follow the trajectories of alterities present in social relations that mark society. The hypothesis presented here is that the traces of socialities are present in these contemporary literary narratives, and that under a confluence of literary genres and forms, there are quests to express particular social experiences. In the restless work of literature, lies one of the paths to an archeology of this era of uncertainty - a support, even tough ephemeral, in face of a world that we have not yet learned how to look upon. Through an archeological view of knowledge, this work puts in dialogue the knowledges of social sciences and literature, aiming to understand the movements of social life or the narratives that express the outlines of these socialities. I base myself in the approaches of the archeology of knowledge, so dear to Michel Foucault, fictional ethnography, the Michel Maffesoli's conceptions about contemporary sociality, and the reflections on narratives and literary writings, in order to outline the readings about aspects that marks the today's social life in the texts of the brazilian writers João Gilberto Noll (Porto Alegre-RS) and Luiz Ruffato (Cataguases-MG). Therefore, in a possible "fictional ethnography", I try to show that these literary texts raise the struggles of contemporary social experience.

Most of the tenants were Fadl tribesmen who had shifted from a <b>nomadism</b> to a semi-sedentism that combined agriculture and grazing.

The emir married a woman from the well-known Kurdish Damascene family, Buzu. Some Kurdish families, including the Buzu, were afterward incorporated into Al Fadl.

A brief era of relative peace followed for the nomadic tribes in the 1940s and 1950s, when Persia {{was involved in the}} Second World War, and Rezā Shāh was forced to abdicate in 1941. His successor, Mohammed Reza Shah consolidated his power during the 1950s. His land reform program of 1962, part of the so-called White Revolution, despite obvious advantages for landless peasants, destroyed the traditional political organization of nomadic tribes like the Qashqai people, and the traditional way of nomadic life.

25|$|Canaanite civilization was a {{response}} to long periods of stable climate interrupted by short periods of climate change. During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East—Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia), the Hittites, and Minoan Crete—to become city states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in Canaanite mythology by the struggle between the storm god, variously called Teshub (Hurrian) or Ba'al Hadad (Semitic Amorite/Aramean) and Ya'a, Yaw, Yahu or Yam, god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local horticultural products, along with commercial growing of olives, grapes for wine, and pistachios, surrounded by extensive grain cropping, predominantly wheat and barley. Harvest in early summer was a season when transhumance <b>nomadism</b> was practiced—shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the Gezer calendar and in the biblical cycle of the year.|$|E

Many bird populations migrate long distances along a flyway. The most common pattern involves flying north in the northern spring to breed in the temperate or Arctic summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south. In the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance migration. Within a species not all populations may be migratory; this is known as [...] "partial migration". [...] Partial migration is very common in the southern continents. For example, in Australia, 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of [...] species are partially migratory. Many, if not most, birds migrate in flocks.

2500|$|Ulysse was an epic poem in free verse, {{the first}} such work in Fondane's career, and testing a format later adopted in Titanic and L'Exode. Although quite similar to Voronca's own work, which also used Homer's Odyssey as the pretext for a comment on social alienation, it {{included}} an additional allegory of Jewishness (according to critic Petre Răileanu, Voronca had stripped his own text of Jewish symbolism, {{in the hope of}} not entering a competition with Fondane). Fondane's 1933 text echoes his earlier intertextual Homeric references (present in poems he wrote back in 1914), but, to their adventurous escapism, it opposes the Ithaca metaphor—an ideal of stability in the assumption of one's destiny. Claude Sernet referred to Ulysse as [...] "painful and sober, a cry of anxiety, of revolt and resignation, a fraternal and noble song to mankind". The poem is also Fondane's comment on the Wandering Jew story (the mythical figure is rescaled into an urban Ulysses), and, according to cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu, reinterprets the Christian prejudice about Jews being eternal [...] "witnesses" [...] of Christ's Passion. Together, such motifs intimated the writer's own experiences, leading various commentators to conclude that he too was [...] "the Jewish Ulysses". Italian academic Gisèle Vanhese, who connects this lyrical discourse with Fondane's [...] "experience of the abyss" [...] concept, notes that ocean waters are the vehicles of <b>nomadism</b> in Ulysse, while, in Titanic, the same environment serves as a metaphor of dying.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Xiongnu {{finally had}} been driven back into their {{homeland}} by the Chinese in AD 48, within ten years the Xianbei (or Hsien-pei in Wade–Giles) had moved (apparently from the north or northwest) into the region vacated by the Xiongnu. The Xianbei were the northern branch of the Donghu (or Tung Hu, the Eastern Hu), a proto-Mongol and/or Tunguz group mentioned in Chinese histories as existing {{as early as the}} 4th century BC. The language of the Donghu, unlike that of the Xiongnu, is believed to be proto-Mongolic to modern scholars. The Donghu were among the first peoples conquered by the Xiongnu. Once the Xiongnu state weakened, however, the Donghu rebelled. By the 1st century AD, two major subdivisions of the Donghu had developed: the proto-Mongolic Xianbei in the north and the Wuhuan in the south. The Xianbei, who by the 2nd century AD were attacking Chinese farms south of the Great Wall, established an empire, which, although short-lived, gave rise to numerous tribal states along the Chinese frontier. Among these states was that of the Tuoba (T'o-pa in Wade–Giles), a subgroup of the Xianbei, in modern China's Shanxi Province. The Wuhuan also were prominent in the 2nd century, but they disappeared thereafter; possibly they were absorbed in the Xianbei western expansion. The Xianbei and the Wuhuan used mounted archers in warfare, and they had only temporary war leaders instead of hereditary chiefs. Agriculture, rather than full-scale <b>nomadism,</b> was the basis of their economy. In the 6th century, the Wuhuan were driven out of Inner Asia into the Russian steppe.|$|E
60|$|In {{the early}} history of Asia and Africa, <b>Nomadism</b> and Agriculture are the two {{antagonist}} facts. The geography of Asia and of Africa necessitated a nomadic life. But the nomads were the terror of all those whom the soil or the advantages of a market had induced to build towns. Agriculture therefore was a religious injunction, because of the perils of the state from <b>nomadism.</b> And in these late and civil countries of England and America these propensities still fight out the old battle, in the nation and in the individual. The nomads of Africa were constrained to wander, by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives the cattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the rainy season and to drive off the cattle to the higher sandy regions. The nomads of Asia follow the pasturage from month to month. In America and Europe the <b>nomadism</b> is of trade and curiosity; a progress, certainly, from the gad-fly of Astaboras to the Anglo and Italo-mania of Boston Bay. Sacred cities, to which a periodical religious pilgrimage was enjoined, or stringent laws and customs, tending to invigorate the national bond, were the check on the old rovers; and the cumulative values of long residence are the restraints on the itineracy of the present day. The antagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in individuals, as the love of adventure or the love of repose happens to predominate. A man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid domestication, lives in his wagon and roams through all latitudes as easily as a Calmuc. At sea, or in the forest, or in the snow, he sleeps as warm, dines with as good appetite, and associates as happily as beside his own chimneys. Or perhaps his facility is deeper seated, in the increased range of his faculties of observation, which yield him points of interest wherever fresh objects meet his eyes. The pastoral nations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this intellectual <b>nomadism,</b> in its excess, bankrupts the mind through the dissipation of power on a miscellany of objects. The home-keeping wit, on the other hand, is that continence or content which finds all the elements of life in its own soil; and which has its own perils of monotony and deterioration, if not stimulated by foreign infusions.|$|E

As the Persian imitated in the slender shafts and capitals of his {{architecture}} the stem and flower of the lotus and palm, so the Persian court in its magnificent era never gave over the <b>nomadism</b> of its barbarous tribes, but travelled from Ecbatana, where the spring was spent, to Susa in summer and to Babylon for the winter.|$|E
60|$|At Clifton his {{habitation}} was speedily enough set up; household conveniences, {{methods of}} work, daily promenades on foot or horseback, {{and before long}} even a circle of friends, or of kindly neighborhoods ripening into intimacy, were established round him. In all this no man could be more expert or expeditious, in such cases. It was with singular facility, in a loving, hoping manner, that he threw himself open to the new interests and capabilities of the new place; snatched out of it whatsoever of human or material would suit him; and in brief, in all senses had pitched his tent-habitation, and grew to look on it as a house. It was beautiful too, as well as pathetic. This man saw himself reduced to be a dweller in tents, his house is but a stone tent; and he can so kindly accommodate himself to that arrangement;--healthy faculty and diseased necessity, nature and habit, {{and all manner of}} things primary and secondary, original and incidental, conspiring now to make it easy for him. With the evils of <b>nomadism,</b> he participated to the full in whatever benefits lie in it for a man.|$|E
60|$|I {{perceive}} therefore that, besides choosing Parliaments {{never so}} well, the New Colonial Office will have {{another thing to}} do: Contrive to send out {{a new kind of}} Governors to the Colonies. This will be the mainspring of the business; without this the business will not go at all. An experienced, wise and valiant British man, to represent the Imperial Interest; he, with such a speaking or silent Collective Wisdom as he can gather round him in the Colony, will evidently be the condition of all good between the Mother Country and it. If you can find such a man, your point is gained; if you cannot, lost. By him and his Collective Wisdom all manner of true relations, mutual interests and duties such as they do exist in fact between Mother Country and Colony, can be gradually developed into practical methods and results; and all manner of true and noble successes, and veracities in the way of governing, be won. Choose well your Governor;--not from this or that poor section of the Aristocracy, military, naval, or red-tapist; wherever there are born kings of men, you had better seek them out, and breed them to this work. All sections of the British Population will be open to you: and, on the whole, you must succeed in finding a man fit. And having found him, I would farther recommend you to keep him some time! It would be a great improvement to end this present <b>nomadism</b> of Colonial Governors. Give your Governor due power; and let him know withal that he is wedded to his enterprise, and having once well learned it, shall continue with it; {{that it is not a}} Canadian Lumber-log you want there, to tumble upon the vertexes and sign its name by a Birmingham shoulder-crank, but a Governor of Men; who, you mean, shall fairly gird himself to his enterprise, and fail with it and conquer with it, and as it were live and die with it: he will have much to learn; and having once learned it, will stay, and turn his knowledge to account.|$|E
