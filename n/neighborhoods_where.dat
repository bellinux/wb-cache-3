5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South <b>neighborhoods,</b> <b>where</b> the rails were set into the streets.|$|E
5|$|Weaker tornadoes, and {{at times}} even {{stronger}} tornadoes, can occasionally lift, meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground. The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading to the term skipping tornado. These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> the house-skipping effect is observed, except possibly {{at the time of}} the birth and organization of the tornado. This situation is not commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms, the process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying is known as cyclic tornadogenesis, thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell. This series of tornadoes is known as a tornado family.|$|E

25|$|Redlining {{has helped}} {{preserve}} segregated living patterns {{for blacks and}} whites in the United States because discrimination motivated by prejudice is often contingent on the racial composition of <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> the loan is sought and {{the race of the}} applicant.

25|$|In 1910, 10% of Harlem's {{population}} was black but by 1930, {{they had become}} a 70% majority. The period between 1910 and 1930 marks a huge point in the great migration of African Americans from the South to New York. This point also marks an influx from downtown Manhattan <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> blacks were feeling less welcome, to the Harlem area. The black population in Harlem peaked in 1950 with a 98% share of the population (population 233,000).|$|E

40|$|Social {{learning}} is studied when heterogeneous agents can select whom to observe. An agent learns {{from the average}} action in her neighborhood.

25|$|During World War II, San Jose {{experienced}} {{racial tension}} in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> large populations of African Americans, Mexican Americans and Japanese Americans {{lived on the}} city's western and eastern edges. Most of the Japanese community were removed and interned in war detention camps {{in the course of}} the war. Anti-Mexican violence based on the earlier zoot suit riots in Los Angeles took place in the summer of 1943 in San Jose. After large numbers of blacks from the Southern states moved to San Jose's growing wartime manufacturing industry, locals were divided, but grew to accept the thousands of new black residents.|$|E
25|$|Stiff {{vegetable}} fibers such as reeds {{are used}} to make hats, mats and more in addition to baskets for carrying and storage. Most artisans of this type are indigenous and is most commonly done in Jiquipilco, Temascalcingo, Tenancingo and Toluca (in the San Andres Cuexcontitlan and San Cristobal Huichochitlan <b>neighborhoods),</b> <b>where</b> they produce tortilla holders, bags, placemats and more. The use of dyed fibers woven into patterns is a common decorative technique. Most of the designs are passed down from generation to generation. There is also basketry done in Amanalco, Donato Guerra and El Oro, distinguished with ornaments of high fire ceramic, brass and glass.|$|E

25|$|Since it {{was closer}} and {{slightly}} cheaper than Six Flags Great Adventure, Action Park attracted many visitors from urban enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many {{of them were}} often from lower-income <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, {{and this was a}} factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in Spanish-language media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language.|$|E
25|$|While {{he was an}} engineer, Rezko started buying {{vacant lots}} and {{developing}} single family residences. He also began investing in fast-food restaurants, including the first Subway in Chicago. Many properties were in lower-income African American <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> he met Jabir Herbert (J.H.) Muhammad, former manager of heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali and son of the late Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Muhammad. Rezko was asked in 1983 to support the successful mayoral candidacy of African-American Harold Washington. J.H. Muhammad's company, Crucial Concessions, hired Rezko in 1984 and won a food contract on Lake Michigan beaches and in many South Side parks. Rezko put together endorsement deals for Ali, became {{the executive director of}} the Muhammad Ali Foundation, and traveled the world with Ali for five years.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{internment}} of Japanese Americans during World War II, historically Japanese areas {{fell into}} disrepair or became adopted by other minority groups (in {{the case of}} Black and Latino populations in Little Tokyo). Boats owned by Japanese Americans were confiscated by the U.S. Navy. One of the vessels owned by a Japanese American, the Alert, built in 1930, became YP-264 in December 1941, and was finally struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 2014. When Japanese Americans returned from internment, many settled in <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> they {{set up their own}} community centers in order to feel accepted. Today, many have been renamed cultural centers and focus on the sharing of Japanese culture with local community members, especially in the sponsorship of Obon festivals.|$|E

25|$|The transit {{strike was}} the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 in an attempt to decentralize the city's school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city {{complete}} control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities to have more of a say in their schools. The city's teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, however, saw the breakup as a way of union busting, as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result, in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, one of the <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community-run school board. The UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, citing that the teachers had been fired without due process. When their demands were ignored, the UFT called the first of three strikes, leading ultimately to a protracted citywide teachers' strike that stretched over a seven-month period between May and November. The strike was tinged with racial and anti-Semitic overtones, pitting black and Puerto Rican parents against Jewish teachers and supervisors. Many thought the mayor had made a bad situation worse by taking sides against the teachers. The episode left a legacy of tensions between blacks and Jews that went on for years, and Lindsay called it his greatest regret.|$|E
500|$|Fill at Foster Road and Southeast 111th Avenue usually {{prevents}} stormwater {{runoff from}} a [...] {{area of the}} watershed in the Lents and Powellhurst-Gilbert neighborhoods from flowing directly into the creek. Instead, runoff is routed to sumps, where it percolates into the ground. Normal drainage patterns have also been altered further downstream in the Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Westmoreland, and Woodstock <b>neighborhoods,</b> <b>where</b> runoff flows into the Portland sewer system instead of into the creek.|$|E
500|$|The older {{neighborhoods of}} the early 20th century, such as West Central, East Central, Logan, Hillyard, {{and much of the}} lower South Hill, feature a large {{concentration}} of American Craftsman style bungalows. In Hillyard, the most architecturally intact neighborhood in Spokane, 85 percent of these buildings are historic. As the city expanded mainly to the north {{in the middle of the}} 20th century, the bungalows in the [...] "minimal traditional" [...] style commonplace from the 1930s to the 1950s tend to predominate in the Northwest, North Hill, and Bemiss neighborhoods. This architectural style occupies the <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> the integrity of Spokane's street grid pattern is largely intact (especially the areas north of downtown and south of Francis Ave.), and the houses have backyard alleys for carports, deliveries, and refuse collection. Contemporary suburbs and architecture are prevalent at the north and south edges of Spokane as well as in the new Kendall Yards neighborhood north of downtown.|$|E
