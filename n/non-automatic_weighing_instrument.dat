The directive identified four classes of weighing device ranging from Class I (having a minimum accuracy of 1 part in 50,000) to class IIII (having a minimum accuracy of 1 part in 100). Devices that fall within the scope of the directive are required to be recalibrated at regular intervals and to have an output showing SI units, except for those used for weighing precious metals or stones.

40|$|Testing is an {{essential}} factor in the manufacturing processes. While the relevant standards and specifications govern the scope of a given test procedure, the methods and mechanisms used for the testing strongly depend on the rate of product output, operating environment, technological infrastructure and ergonomic requisites. This research work {{is focused on the}} testing requirements of a <b>weighing</b> <b>instrument</b> module that is used in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder filling industry. The current testing method involves manual placement of a test weight on predetermined positions on the <b>weighing</b> <b>instrument</b> module, and; recording of the measurement readings, by an operator. Manual handling of the test weight has led to a constraint on the maximum usable test load as well as the ergonomic concerns related to the repetitive load handling by the operators. In order to increase the load handling capacity and to eliminate the ergonomic related issues, this dissertation has proposed and developed a machine assisted testing solution, giving due consideration to the relevant industrial norms on the design and development of machinery.
