Data on this section which {{is located on the}} J 5 was collected for four months during which 99 rainfall events occurred. The traffic consisted of 75. 80 % cars, 10. 23 % motorcycles, 3. 51 % trucks and 10. 46 %  of other vehicles. Traffic was observed for both rain and no-rain conditions and the data was analysed to see the effect of the rain. The results showed decreases in the speed as the rain intensity increased. Similarly, the traffic flow rates decreased as the rain intensity increased. This trend was observed for both peak and <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods</b> and for both directions. It is concluded that the effect of rain during peak period could have more serious consequences on the traffic flow than during <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods</b> because of the higher flow rates and the constrained nature of the flow. Consequently, capacity degradations up to 30 % during peak periods would require resources to be employed to manage the traffic...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we study}} the {{electricity}} time-of-use (TOU) tariff for an electricity company with stochastic demand. The electricity company offers the flat rate (FR) and TOU tariffs to customers. Under the FR tariff, the customer pays a flat price for electricity consumption {{in both the}} peak and non-peak periods. Under the TOU tariff, the customer pays {{a high price for}} electricity consumption in the peak period and a low price for electricity consumption in the <b>non-peak</b> <b>period.</b> The electricity company uses two technologies, namely the base-load and peak-load technologies, to generate electricity. We derive the optimal capacity investment and pricing decisions for the electricity company. Furthermore, we use real data from a case study to validate the results and derive insights for implementing the TOU tariff. We show that in almost all the cases, the electricity company needs less capacity for both technologies under the TOU tariff than under the FR tariff, even though the expected demand in the <b>non-peak</b> <b>period</b> increases. In addition, except for some extreme cases, there is essentially no signicant reduction in the total demand of the two periods, although the TOU tariff can reduce the demand in the peak period. Under the price-cap regulation, the customer may pay a lower price on average under the TOU tariff than under the FR tariff. We conduct an extensive numerical study to assess the impacts of the model parameters on the optimal solutions and the robustness of the analytical results, and generate managerial implications of the research findings.

Blood {{samples were collected}} in June-October {{at the peak of}} the nesting season and in November-May during the <b>non-peak</b> <b>period.</b> Plasma electrolytes values, except for PO 4 - 3 and Cl- were significant between the two periods.

During nesting the sea turtles undergo strenuous and exhaustive exercise and like other lung breathing reptiles, they ventilate intermittently, thus, they rely on anaerobic metabolism during the nesting exercise. Plasma concentrations of lactate and CO 2 were significant but glucose values remained stable and unchanged during the two nesting periods. Higher concentrations of total protein during June compared to October may be related to the type and the availability of diet in the waters near the nesting sites. High concentrations of electrolytes and lactate are perhaps related to more stressful conditions during June because of higher crowding and intense competition for nesting sites. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of these parameters during nesting activity to evaluate changes under two different crowding conditions and gather information for future population health assessments...|$|E

The {{investigations}} {{focus on}} load shifting, load clipping and energy efficiency through control strategies. Load shifting {{is achieved by}} {{increasing the amount of}} work done in the Eskom <b>non-peak</b> <b>period.</b> This then results in a decrease in the Eskom peak time work load. The mine refrigeration system is modelled and verified with the data. A simulation is made from the model and the simulation is used to develop the new control strategy and new operational parameters. Predicted results are verified to be within production operational constraints. A case study was carried out to prove the effectiveness of the newly developed control strategy and operational parameters. Firstly the cascade mine surface refrigeration system is automated to allow remote viewing and control of the system from a central point. The control strategy is tested through implementation on automated mine refrigeration systems. The real-time energy management system (REMS) is set up and the communication with the SCADA is tested through observing dam level temperatures and stopping and starting refrigeration machines. The decisions the controllers make are monitored until the system is fully automated. The results of the new control system on the flows, temperatures, dam levels, thermal energy and electrical energy are validated and verified. An assessment of the case study proved that DSM can be done on cascade mine refrigeration systems. A 4. 2 MW load shift was predicted and research found an over performance of 0. 3 MW. It is clear from the results that utilising the thermal storage in cascade mine surface refrigeration systems, will allow DSM load shifting. In general, this dissertation proved DSM can be done on refrigeration systems and it is recommended that further studies be done on underground mine refrigeration systems. Master...|$|E

The air pollution problems in these two temples during peak and non-peak periods were characterized. The target air pollutants included particulate matters (PM 10, PM 2. 5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbonyl compounds, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO x), methane (CH 4), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and inorganic ions (Cl -, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, Na +, NH 4 +, and K +). The pollutant levels of the two temples during peak period were shown to be significantly higher than those during <b>non-peak</b> <b>period.</b> The highest average CO level was obtained at Temple 1 during peak period, which exceeded IAQO 8 -h Good Class criteria. In general, the average PM 2. 5 /PM 10 ratios were approximately 82 %. The results revealed that the fine particulates (PM 2. 5) constituted the majority of suspended particulates at both temples. It was noted that formaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl compounds, followed by acetaldehyde. At Temple 1 during peak period, the average benzene concentration exceeded almost 8 times more than Indoor Air Quality Objectives for Office Buildings and Public Places (IAQO) [HKEPD, 2003.

The average OC/EC ratios ranged from 2. 6 to 17 in PM 10 and from 4. 2 to 18 in PM 2. 5 at two temples, which suggested that OC measured in these two temple areas may be due to both direct emission from incense burning and secondary formation by chemical reactions.

LIPA will incorporate lessons learned from this pilot in future deployments, including lessons relating to equipment performance specifications and testing, as well as equipment deployment and tracking issues. LIPA ultimately deployed three AMI technologies instead of the two that were originally contemplated. This enabled LIPA to evaluate multiple systems in field conditions with {{a relatively small number}} of meter installations. LIPA experienced a number of equipment and software issues that it did not anticipate, including issues relating to equipment integration, ability to upgrade firmware and software âover the airâ (as opposed to physically interacting with every meter), and logistical challenges associated with tracking inventory and upgrade status of deployed meters. In addition to evaluating the technology, LIPA also piloted new Time-of-Use (TOU) rates to assess customer acceptance of time-differentiated pricing and to evaluate whether customers would respond by adjusting their activities from peak to <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> LIPA developed a marketing program to educate customers who received AMI in the pilot areas and to seek voluntary participation in TOU pricing. LIPA also guaranteed participating customers that, for their initial year on the rates, their electricity costs under the TOU rate would not exceed the amount they would have paid under the flat rates they would otherwise enjoy. 62 residential customers chose to participate in the TOU rates, and every one of them saved money during the first year. 61 of them also elected to stay on the TOU rate â without the cost guarantee â at the end of that year. The customer who chose not to continue on the rate was also the one who achieved the greatest savings. However, after the first year, the customer in question installed equipment that would have made TOU rates a more costly option than the residential flat rate. During the second year, all but one customer saved money. That customer increased usage during peak hours, and as a result saw an increase in annual costs (as compared to the flat rate) of $ 24. 17. The results were less clear for commercial customers, which LIPA attributes to rate design issues that it will take into account for future deployments. LIPA views this pilot as a complete success. Not only is LIPA better prepared for a larger deployment of AMI, but it is confident that residential customers will accept AMI and TOU rates and shift their energy consumption from peak to <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods</b> in response to pricing. On a larger scale, this will benefit LIPA and all of its customers by potentially lowering peak demand when energy costs are highest...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel method for sampling pathogens in natural environments. It uses fabric boot socks worn over walkers’ shoes allowing collection of composite samples over large areas. Wide area sampling is {{better suited to}} studies focussing upon human exposure to pathogens (e. g. recreational walking). This sampling method is implemented using a Citizen Science approach: groups of three walkers wearing boot socks undertook one of six routes, 40 times over 16 months in the North West (NW) and East Anglian (EA) regions of England. To validate this methodology we report the successful implementation of this Citizen Science approach, the observation that Campylobacter was detected on 47 % of boot socks, and the observation that multiple boot socks from individual walks produced consistent results. Findings indicate elevated Campylobacter presence in the livestock dominated NW in comparison to EA (55. 8 % vs 38. 6 %). Seasonal variation in Campylobacter presence was found between regions, with indications of winter peaks in both regions, but a spring peak in NW. Campylobacter presence on boot socks was negatively associated with ambient temperature (p= 0. 011) and positively associated with precipitation (p< 0. 001), results which are consistent with our understanding of Campylobacter survival and the probability of material adhering to boot socks. C. jejuni was the predominant species found, with C. coli largely restricted to the livestock dominated NW. Source attribution analysis indicated that the potential source of C. jejuni was predominantly sheep in NW and wild birds in EA but did not vary between peak and <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods</b> of human incidence...|$|R

It is imperative to explore transportation alternatives, and the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, with 63 percent unused capacity on average in non-peak hours, presents such an opportunity. If BART’s service is extended to include air-freight movement, extra revenue can be generated, truck miles travelled on highways will be reduced (potentially leading to a reduced traffic {{congestion and}} pollution), and traffic safety could be improved. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify the number of feasible dedicated freight train that can be accommodated by BART lines using its current operational schedule, without creating a negative effect on passenger service. The measurement of time or distance between two successive train-runs at a station, also referred to as the ‘headway’, for selected lines have been considered to evaluate possible freight train insertions into time-space slots of current passenger services. To qualify this, the headway of the two trains needs to be greater than twice the minimum headway required (based on BART train safety requirements). Furthermore, BART trains should be subjected to the limit on acceleration/deceleration capabilities. The findings are as follows: for peak hours and commute directions, it would be impracticable to add more trains. For peak hours in non-commute directions, some capacity could exist for mixed freight cars and on empty passenger cars.

40|$|Time of Use (TOU) pricing is a cost-reflective {{electricity}} pricing scheme; it {{has proven}} to be an effective approach for reducing peak electricity demand in the residential sector around the world, especially in developed countries. The implementation of TOU pricing in low and lower-middle income economies is less appealing than in other settings. This is mainly because a traditional TOU pricing scheme may increase the cost of electricity for low income consumers. The lack of a suitable TOU pricing strategy for these countries results in high peak demand, poor utilization of network infrastructure and, consequently, higher electricity prices than necessary. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse and propose a TOU pricing scheme for the residential sector that will be suitable for countries with a high percentage of low income household consumers. In this study, Bangladesh will be used as an exemplar of a lower-to-middle income developing country. In Bangladesh, the residential sector is responsible for half the country's total electricity consumption, and constitutes an even greater proportion of the peak demand. Residential consumers currently pay inclining block usage rates that provide no financial incentive for them to shift their electricity usage from peak to <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> The proposed TOU pricing scheme is a combination of the traditional TOU and inclining block usage pricing schemes, based on a realistic load shifting capacity that is applicable to Bangladesh, and to other similar developing countries. Analysis of this pricing system for different income levels of residential consumers shows that the proposed scheme effectively reduces the peak demand, while ensuring minimum impact on consumer monthly energy bills and comfort levels...|$|R
40|$|The authors 2015. Pinnipeds spend {{significant}} time hauled out, {{and their}} haul-out behaviour can {{be dependent on}} environment and life stage. In Western Australia, male Australian sea lions Neo - phoca cinerea haul out on Perth metropolitan islands, with numbers peaking during aseasonal (~ 17. 4 mo in duration), non-breeding periods. Little is known about daily haul-out patterns and their association with environmental conditions. Such detail is necessary to accurately monitor behavioural patterns and local abundance, ultimately improving long-term conservation management, particularly where, {{due to lack of}} availability, typical pup counts are infeasible. Hourly counts of N. cinerea were conducted from 08 : 00 to 16 : 00 h on Seal and Carnac Islands for 166 d over 2 yr, including 2 peak periods. Generalised additive models were used to determine effects of temporal and environmental factors on N. cinerea haul-out numbers. On Seal Island, numbers increased significantly throughout the day during both peak periods, but only did so in the second peak on Carnac. During <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods</b> there were no significant daytime changes. Despite high day-to-day variation, a greater and more stable number of N. cinerea hauled out on the significantly smaller beach of Seal Island during 1 peak. Overall, numbers hauled out were associated with temperature and tidal height, but not wind speed. Relative percentages of age classes hauled out also varied with time of breeding cycle. Due to high variability in haul-out behaviour in space and time, and its association with environmental conditions, we conclude that counts for monitoring relative abundance in management decisions should be conducted systematically, using robust survey designs with relatively large sample sizes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{transportation}} {{procurement planning}} {{problems for the}} ship per with three different side constraints. In the transportation market, the key players are shippers and carriers. Shippers are manufacturers, distributors and any company that needs to move freight, and the carriers are the transportation companies which move the freight, e. g. shipping and trucking companies. In the transportation procurement process, the shippers are the auctioneers and the carriers are the bidders. Very often the shipper need to optimize their procurement decisions on selecting carriers and allocating freight volumes under various side constraints. The Minimum Quantity Commitment is motivated by the United States Federal Maritime Commission's stipulation that requires a shipper to guarantee a minimum quantity of freight volumes to each carrier that has engaged to carry cargos to the United States. With such a constraint for volume guarantees, the procurement planning problem becomes intractable. To solve the problem practically, we provide a mixed-integer programming model defined {{by a number of}} strong facets. Based on this model, a branch-and-cut search scheme is applied to solve small-size instances and a linear programming rounding heuristic for large ones. We also devise a greedy approximation method, whose solution quality depends on the scale of the minimum quantity if the shipping cost forms a distance metric. Extensive experiments have been conducted to measure the performance of the formulations and the algorithms and have shown that the linear rounding heuristic behaves best. Moreover, we have also introduced the minimum quantity commitment constraint into the study of facility location problems, and have developed several approximation algorithms that provide constant performance guarantees. Although the minimum quantity commitment provides volume guarantees to carriers, it is sometimes too restrictive for shippers to adopt, and cannot smooth the volume allocation for carriers. According to industrial practice, carriers, who operate in seasonal markets where differences in demand occur in peak and <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> often negotiate for some form of demand smoothing with the customer, i. e., the shipper. We therefore study a shipper's transportation procurement model in which the shipper gives assurances, through volume guarantees negotiated with the transportation companies, that shipments made in <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods</b> will be commensurate with shipments in peak periods. The shipper uses the model in an auction process, in which the transportation companies bid for routes giving prices and capacity limits, to procure freight services from the companies which minimize its total transportation costs. The model is formulated as an integer programming problem, which is shown to he strongly NP-hard even for a single-route network. We develop a solution approach which builds on the solution of the subproblem when only one transportation company is available to construct heuristic algorithms, including a linear programming relaxation-based method. Worst-case analysis is given and the effectiveness of the algorithms is tested in numerical experimentation. By examining parameter sensitivity, insight is provided on how the algorithms can be used by the shipper for making procurement decisions. The practical usefulness of the model and the solution approaches is substantiated by its deployment with a multinational shipper for its sea freight procurement. Since most global shippers are large manufacturers, they have various business units all over the world. When purchasing transportation service from carriers, the central decision maker of the shipper needs to satisfy the preferences of different business units. We therefore study a service provider allocation problem for global shippers to procure transportation service with various preferences constrained by their business units all over the world. The problem has been formulated by a constraint programming model, and its hardness has been discussed extensively. In order to resolve the intractability, we propose a decomposition approach to structure the preference constraints, so that the model can be solved optimally under some conditions. We also illustrate how such conditions can be satisfied in practice. The model and solution approaches have been integrated into a decision support system for a multinational shipper to purchase its express courier service...|$|R
40|$|IT is a known {{fact that}} {{aircraft}} noise and fuel emissions {{are the most}} constraining factors {{for the growth of}} aviation. Continuous Descent Arrivals (CDAs) provide significant reductions in fuel consumption and noise footprint on the ground, by following idle thrust descent and eliminating low altitude leveling off. However, limitations such as unpredictability of the trajectory and separation management for CDAs prevent wide-spread implementation. The thesis focuses on overcoming some of these limitations. Optimal control theory is used to optimize the descent trajectory of the aircraft by using fuel and time as the performance index. The problem is formulated as amulti-phase optimal control and is solved by using a pseudospectral method. The theory is also the backbone of General Pseudospectral OPtimal Control Software (GPOPS). The main focus of the thesis is to enable multi-aircraft trajectory optimization for CDAs and ensure sufficient separation between all aircraft along the entire trajectory by implementing the separation algorithm. The possibility of using both distance based and the time based separation is explored in detail. It is demonstrated using Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) airport’s real-time inbound flight data that it is feasible to apply the separation algorithm to separate aircraft along the entire lateral path while still being able to performCDAs during the peak and <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> All the limitations pertaining to the separation algorithmare analyzed and discussed in detail. By addressing some of these shortcomings, the simulation environment can be improved to bring itmore close to a real-time scenario. Although a lot of other factors have to be considered for a practical wide-spread implementation, success of this method will result in the aircraft trajectory being more predictable to the ground controller, effectively addressing one of the major shortcomings of CDAs. On a more important note, the success of this method will also result in reduced noise footprint and fuel consumption by aircraft, benefiting both the environment and airlines.

The findings suggest that the average High Street business could expect up to 10 core goods and 7. 6 service visits per week, in <b>non-peak</b> trading <b>periods</b> with 25 % additional activity during the build up to Christmas. Vans (‘light goods vehicles’) were the dominant mode, responsible for 42 % of delivery activity with a mean dwell time of 10 min. Where possible, load consolidation should be encouraged by methods such as Delivery and Servicing Plans and using out-of-town freight consolidation centres to bring in goods over the last mile in shared vehicles. Where this is not possible, loading bay monitoring and control, and preferred lorry routes can help manage the movement of vehicles in and out of dense urban areas. Service vehicle activity is a significant contributor to urban freight movements and often requires vehicles to be parked close to the premises being served. Centrally coordinating elements of service provision (e. g. for cleaning, equipment maintenance, recyclate collection), or providing improved, more flexible parking provision for service vehicles could be as or more beneficial in reducing overall freight impacts than focusing on core goods deliveries. In the case of the latter, ‘pay-as-you-leave’ car park charging systems could encourage short-stay service vehicles to park off-street...|$|R
40|$|The journey times of 14, 000  Uber drivers in Melbourne are examined, {{as part of}} a {{new measure}} of {{congestion}} in the Australia 2 ̆ 7 s four biggest cities. Executive summary Australian governments invest tens of billions in transport infrastructure and undertake a range of policy initiatives every year seeking to improve the functionality of our cities and wider transport systems. Historically, transport policy has focused on measuring inputs, like the amount of money invested in new road and rail projects, or the Benefit Cost Ratio estimated for these projects. But the rapid development of technologies across the transport network is generating a wealth of raw data; offering a largely-as-yet-unrealised opportunity to gain a much more sophisticated understanding of how Australia’s transport systems are performing. Indeed, turning ‘big data’ into ‘useful information’ would allow transport planners, governments and users to better understand how transport is performing – and importantly, to measure how successful we are in addressing transport challenges, as our cities grow. Currently, even major states use individual paper surveys, to try and understand complex commuter behaviours – or use a range of physical measurement tools, to try and understand user demand. But already, we are measuring much more sophisticated data that describes how, when and where people travel – the challenge is turning this huge quantity of data, into reliable information, that is useful and transparent. Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and Uber have partnered together to produce Australia’s first regular measurement of road network performance – the IPA Transport Metric – spanning: 	Sydney; 	Melbourne; 	Brisbane; and 	Perth. The IPA Transport Metric, released {{for the first time in}} this paper, measures travel times across the day – providing new information about how the road network performs in the morning and afternoon peak periods, as well as shoulder and <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> across three zones: 	CBD zone; 	the inner metro zone; and 	outer metro zone. Uber’s experience running ridesharing services across Australia has the potential to inform and improve urban planning. The IPA Transport Metric leverages data collected from Uber’s ridesharing network to do just that. The IPA Transport Metric captures data from Uber trips, through which a network of data is collected. Each trip is a mobile collection point for key traffic metrics such as travel times. This use of on-vehicle measurement systems will provide a wider, more detailed and granular picture of how the use of our cities’ transport systems evolves over time. In this way, the IPA Transport Metric is a good example of the type of highly valuable information that is already available, at a very low monetary cost – that can be used to improve cities and transport. IPA and Uber have partnered on this project to provide governments and the community with a new tool, which would allow wide visibility of the transport networks performance – its output – rather than only measuring dollars spent, or estimating potential benefits from individual projects. Used well, Uber’s underlying data and that of other transport operators, allows us new opportunities to better target infrastructure investment, assess the actual benefits of individual projects – and to understand how Australia is tracking in developing smarter, better cities and solving its mobility issues...|$|R
40|$|A SI probe car, defined here as {{a normal}} {{commercial}} car equipped with GPS, in-vehicle FTIR tailpipe emission measurement and real time fuel consumption measurement systems, and temperature measurements, was used for measuring greenhouse gas emissions including CO 2, N 2 O and CH 4 under real world urban driving conditions. The vehicle used was a EURO 4 emission compliant SI car. Two real world driving cycles/routes were designed and employed for the tests, which were located in a densely populated area and a busy major road representing a typical urban road network. Eight trips were conducted at morning rush hours, day time <b>non-peak</b> traffic <b>periods</b> and evening off peak time respectively. The aim is to investigate the impacts of traffic conditions such as road congestion, grade and turnings on fuel consumption, engine thermal efficiency and emissions. The time aligned vehicle moving parameters with fuel consumption and emission data enabled the micro-analysis of the correlations between these parameters. The trip average data for fuel consumption, thermal efficiency and emissions etc were calculated. The impact of vehicle's transient movements and traffic events on emissions were studied. VSP (Vehicle Specific Power) {{has been used for}} the determination of engine power output. The results show that the transient emissions were dominated by sharp accelerations occurred at traffic light and pedestrian crossing. The trip average CO 2 and CH 4 emissions had a good linear correlation with vehicle's average speed which is directly related to vehicle idle periods but no clear correlation between vehicle's speed and N 2 O emissions...|$|R
40|$|Streamflow {{responses}} to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in the tropical Pacific are detectable in many regions. During warm-tropical El Niño and cool-tropical La Niña episodes, streamflows are affected throughout the Americas and Australia, in northern Europe, and in parts of Africa and Asia. In North and South America, correlations between peak-flow season streamflows and seasonal Southern Oscillation Indices (SOIs) show considerable persistence. In South America, correlations between flows in other seasons with December-February SOIs also are notably persistent, whereas, in North America, correlations are smaller when other, <b>non-peak</b> season time <b>periods</b> are considered. At least two modes of streamflow response to ENSO {{are present in the}} Western Hemisphere. When interannual North and South American streamflow variations are analyzed together in a single principal components analysis, two of the leading components are found to be associated with ENSO climate variability. The more powerful of these modes corresponds mostly to ENSO responses by the rivers of tropical South America east of the Andes, along with rivers in southern South America and the southwestern United States, with Brazil experiencing less runof...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the residential heat pump water heater (HPWH) market. Its principal purpose is to evaluate {{the extent to which the}} HPWH will penetrate the residential market sector, given current market trends, producer and consumer attributes, and technical parameters. The report's secondary purpose is to gather background information leading to a generic framework for conducting market analyses of technologies. This framework can be used to compare readiness and to factor attributes of market demand back into product design. This study is a rapid prototype analysis rather than a detailed case analysis. For this reason, primary data collection was limited and reliance on secondary sources was extensive. Despite having met its technical goals and having been on the market for twenty years, the HPWH has had virtually no impact on contributing to the nation's water heating. In some cases, HPWH reliability and quality control are well below market expectations, and early units developed a reputation for unreliability, especially when measured against conventional water heaters. In addition to reliability problems, first costs of HPWH units can be three to five times higher than conventional units. Without a solid, well-managed business plan, most consumers will not be drawn to this product. This is unfortunate. Despite its higher first costs, efficiency of an HPWH is double that of a conventional water heater. The HPWH also offers an attractive payback period of two to five years, depending on hot water usage. On a strict life-cycle basis it supplies hot water very cost effectively. Water heating accounts for 17 % of the nation's residential consumption of electricity (see chart at left) [...] water heating is second only to space heating in total residential energy use. Simple arithmetic suggests that this figure could be reduced to the extent HPWH technology displaces conventional water heating. In addition, the HPWH offers other benefits. Because it produces hot water by extracting heat from the air it tends to dehumidify and cool the room in which it is placed. Moreover, it tends to spread the water heating load across utility <b>non-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> Thus, electric utilities with peak load issues could justify internal programs to promote this technology to residential and commercial customers. For practical purposes, consumers are indifferent to the manner in which water is heated but are very interested in product attributes such as initial first cost, operating cost, performance, serviceability, product size, and installation costs. Thus, the principal drivers for penetrating markets are demonstrating reliability, leveraging the dehumidification attributes of the HPWH, and creating programs that embrace life-cycle cost principles. To supplement this, a product warranty with scrupulous quality control should be implemented; first-price reduction through engineering, perhaps by reducing level of energy efficiency, should be pursued; and niche markets should be courted. The first step toward market penetration is to address the HPWH's performance reliability. Next, the manufacturers could engage select utilities to aggressively market the HPWH. A good approach would be to target distinct segments of the market with the potential for the highest benefits from the technology. Communications media that address performance issues should be developed. When marketing to new home builders, the HPWH could be introduced as part of an energy-efficient package offered as a standard feature by builders of new homes within a community. Conducting focus groups across the United States to gather input on HPWH consumer values will feed useful data back to the manufacturers. ''Renaming'' and ''repackaging'' the HPWH to improve consumer perception, appliance aesthetics, and name recognition should be considered. Once an increased sales volume is achieved, the manufacturers should reinvest in R&D to lower the price of the units. The manufacturers should work with ''do-it-yourself'' (DIY) stores to facilitate introduction of the technology to these sales venues. The HPWH is an excellent example of a technology that would have benefited from the implementation of a market research program run in parallel with the technology R&D program. Understanding consumer values and ''willingness to pay'' for product attributes and recognizing the corresponding influences those values have on purchase decisions are crucial. This knowledge should be incorporated into the R&D process with continuous dialogue between the market research and the R&D programs. Partnerships among stakeholders to gather consumer feedback and market analysis during R&D will facilitate a strong framework for successful market penetration of energy-efficient technologies...|$|R
40|$|Appropriation {{funding for}} our project Ecologically Sustainable Campus - New England College (NH). 67. 09. {{supported}} five environmental initiatives: (1) a {{wood pellet boiler}} for our Science Building, (2) solar hot water panels and systems for five campus buildings, (3) campus-wide energy lighting efficiency project, (4) new efficiency boiler system in Colby Residence Hall, and (5) energy efficient lighting system for the new artificial athletic turf field. (1) New England College purchased and installed a new wood pellet boiler in the Science Building. This new boiler serves as the primary heating source for this building. Our boiler was purchased through New England Wood Pellet, LLC, located in Jaffrey, New Hampshire. The boiler selected was a Swebo, P 500. 300 KW wood pellet boiler. The primary goals, objectives, and outcomes of this initiative include the installation of a wood pellet boiler system that is environmentally friendly, highly efficient, and represents a sustainable and renewable resource for New England College. This project was completed on December 15, 2010. (2) New England College purchased and installed solar hot water panels and systems for the Science Building, the Simon Center (student center), the H. Raymond Danforth Library, Gilmore Dining Hall, and Bridges Gymnasium. The College worked with Granite State Plumbing & Heating, LLC, located in Weare, New Hampshire on this project. The solar panels are manufactured by Heat Transfer; the product is Heat Transfer 30 -tube collector panels (Evacuated Tube Type) with stainless steel hardware. The interior equipment includes Super Stor Ultra stainless steel super insulated storage tank, Taco 009 Bronze circulator pump, Solar Relay Control Pack, and a Taco Thermal Expansion Tank. The primary goals, objectives, and outcomes of this initiative will allow the College to utilize the sun as an energy resource. These solar hot water panels and systems will alleviate our dependency on fossil fuel as our primary fuel resource and provide a reliable energy source that supplies the hot water needs for sanitation, dishwashing at our dining facilities, and shower facilities for our athletes. This project initiative was completed on June 30, 2010. (3) New England College has completed energy efficiency lighting projects throughout campus, which included upgrades and new systems throughout our buildings. This project also installed efficiency controls for the Lee Clement Arena and refrigeration equipment in the Gilmore Dining Hall. The College worked with Atlantic Energy Solutions, located in Foxboro, Massachusetts on our 50 / 50 energy efficiency lighting project and campus-wide audit. The actual implementation {{of the project was}} completed by D. Poole Electrical Services, located in Center Barnstead, New Hampshire. The primary goals, objectives, and outcomes of this initiative were to install energy efficient lighting systems throughout our campus buildings, which ultimately will provide New England College with a more efficient way to manage and control its energy use. This project initiative was completed on February 15, 2010. (4) New England College purchased and installed a high efficiency and clean burning system for the Colby Residence Hall, which is the primary housing for our freshman.

40|$|Capturing CO{sub 2 } from {{coal-fired}} power plants is a necessary component of any large-scale effort to reduce anthropogenic CO{sub 2 } emissions. Conventional absorption/stripping with monoethanolamine (MEA) or similar solvents {{is the most likely}} current process for capturing CO{sub 2 } from the flue gas at these facilities. However, one of the largest problems with MEA absorption/stripping is that conventional process configurations have energy requirements that result in large reductions in the net power plant output. Several alternative process configurations for reducing these parasitic energy requirements were investigated in this research {{with the assistance of the}} Platte River Power Authority, based on recovering energy from the CO{sub 2 } compression train and using that energy in the MEA regeneration step. In addition, the feasibility of selective operation of the amine system at a higher CO{sub 2 } removal efficiency during <b>non-peak</b> electricity demand <b>periods</b> was also evaluated. Four process configurations were evaluated: A generic base case MEA system with no compression heat recovery, CO{sub 2 } vapor recompression heat recovery, and multipressure stripping with and without vapor recompression heat recovery. These configurations were simulated using a rigorous rate-based model, and the results were used to prepare capital and operating cost estimates. CO{sub 2 } capture economics are presented, and the cost of CO{sub 2 } capture (cost per tonne avoided) is compared among the base case and the alternative process configurations. Cost savings per tonne of CO{sub 2 } avoided ranged from 4. 3 to 9. 8 percent. Energy savings of the improved configurations (8 - 10 %, freeing up 13 to 17 MW of power for sale to the grid based on 500 MW unit) clearly outweighed the modest increases in capital cost to implement them; it is therefore likely that one of these improved configurations would be used whenever MEA-based (or similar) scrubbing technologies are implemented. In fact, the payback on capital for the most promising heat integration configurations (Cases 3 and 4) is only six months to one year (based on $ 0. 06 /kWh). Another significant result is that the reboiler steam requirement could be reduced by up to 39 % with the advanced process configurations. Selective operation of the amine system was found to be economic only if the value of peak electricity was in excess of approximately $ 230 /MWh (from the assumed $ 130 /MWh to buy power from a supplemental natural gas peak turbine) and, therefore, is not considered to be a reasonable option for minimizing CO{sub 2 } capture costs. These results indicate an improvement to commercial MEA-based technologies, which helps to incrementally meet DOE's Sequestration Program targets when coupled with other process improvements. For example, DOE's target goal of $ 20 /tonne of CO{sub 2 } could potentially be achieved by combining use of the heat integration configurations evaluated in this study and other advanced amine solvents (instead of conventional MEA) that have been developed to further reduce the reboiler duty steam requirements. It is expected that the advanced amines could add another 15 % savings in cost of CO{sub 2 } captured. In addition, advanced aqueous-based solvent approaches already exist and may be commercialized more quickly than other approaches...|$|R
