5|$|During 2005 the Australian Government {{decided to}} deploy Chinooks to Afghanistan {{as part of}} the Australian forces in the country. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for this task contributed to a {{decision}} in October that year to dispatch Black Hawks rather than Chinooks to Pakistan as part of Australia's contribution to the international relief efforts which followed the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, despite the Chinooks being better suited for operations at the high altitudes affected by the disaster. In November 2005 the Government authorised a program of urgent upgrades to the CH-47Ds to improve their combat readiness ahead of being deployed to Afghanistan. The upgrades included fitting the helicopters with extra armour as well as new electronic warfare and communications systems. The helicopters' machine guns were also replaced with miniguns. A longer-term plan to upgrade the helicopters, designated Phase 5 of project AIR 9000, was also in place at this time. This was to involve two sub-phases: under Phase 5A new engines were purchased in December 2004, and were scheduled to be fitted in late 2006. It was also planned to put the helicopters through a mid-life update as part of Phase 5B, enabling them to remain in service until around 2025.|$|E

25|$|The {{first century}} {{that saw the}} Bourbons on the Spanish throne coincided with series of global {{conflicts}} that pitted primarily France against Great Britain. Spain as an ally of Bourbon France was drawn into these conflicts.

25|$|According to William Cohn, {{television}} programs are typically {{the main source}} used by the American public to know about and interpret the past. The Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> Soviets for war against American aggression.|$|E
500|$|The Fairchild Family, Part I {{tells the}} story of a family striving towards godliness and {{consists}} of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also proper earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting, for example, are immoral). The text incorporates a series of tract-like stories into an overarching narrative in order to illustrate these moral lessons. The stories of the deaths of two neighborhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, for instance, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> their own hearts for salvation. The faithful and [...] "true" [...] Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience (much like Charles Dickens's Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop (1840–1)), suggesting that he was saved; by contrast, the heedless and disobedient Augusta, who plays with candles, burns up and is presumably damned.|$|E

500|$|The strongest {{themes in}} Sherwood's early evangelical {{writings}} are {{the need to}} recognize one's innate [...] "depravity" [...] and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> oneself for eternity. For Sherwood, the most important lessons emphasize [...] "faith, resignation, and implicit obedience {{to the will of}} God." [...] In her adaptation of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678)—The Infant's Progress (1821)—she represents original sin as a child named [...] "In-bred Sin" [...] who tempts the young pilgrims {{on their way to the}} Celestial City (Heaven) and it is these battles with In-bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text. The allegory is complex and, as Demers admits, [...] "tedious" [...] for even the [...] "willing reader." [...] Thus, [...] "some young readers may have found [...] activities more interesting than the spiritual struggles of the little heroes, reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation." [...] Such religious allegory, although not always so overt, continued to be a favorite literary device [...] of Sherwood's.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the first}} two seasons, it was found out that {{constructing}} a perfectly flat underwater gravel berm at every drilling location was very time-consuming. In August 1986, before being deployed in the American part of the Beaufort Sea, SSDC was mated with a submersible barge named MAT built by Hitachi Zosen. This removed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> the seafloor for drilling operations and made the unit capable of operating year-round in water depths between [...] and {{in a wide variety}} of soil conditions. Upon deployment, high density polyurethane foam was injected beneath the artificial steel berm to ensure an even contact with the seafloor. SSDC and MAT have not been separated since.|$|E
2500|$|The Philippine–American War {{began on}} February 4, 1899, with the {{culmination}} of the Battle of Manila. Later, on February 10, Filipino forces regrouped in Caloocan and fought again with the American forces at the first Battle of Caloocan. The Americans won both engagements, but then Elwell S. Otis had Arthur MacArthur, Jr. wait before attacking Malolos. [...] Noticing that the Americans had halted their offensive to reorganize, the Filipino forces, now under the command of General Antonio Luna, began finalizing their plans to counterattack. Apolinario Mabini, the political philosopher, highlighted the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> thoroughly to ensure the success of the operation, stating that the battle's outcome would determine the fate of the Philippine Republic.|$|E
2500|$|The motives behind Whitney's {{acceptance}} of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in debt. His New Haven cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The French Revolution had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States. The new American government, realizing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for war, began to rearm. The War Department issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time. [...] Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, Oliver Wolcott, Jr., sent him a [...] "foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques," [...] possibly one of Honoré Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability.|$|E

Keighley jumped in and asked [...] "What {{do you want to do}} with Silent Hill?" [...] Kojima responded: [...] "A guy [...] that is such a chicken and is so easily scared – making a scary game – I'm very confident that something horrifying would come out from that. But on the other hand I would have to prepare myself to have nightmares every single day. Hopefully sometime in the future I'm able to work on this, but I would really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> to have daily nightmares." [...] In August 2014, P.T. was released on the PlayStation Store revealed that a new game in the Silent Hill franchise titled Silent Hills was being directed by Kojima for the PlayStation 4, alongside Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro. In April 2015, the playable trailer was removed and the game was officially cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{standing}} {{threatened by}} the New Look, the Army questioned the wisdom of reliance on [...] "massive retaliation" [...] and strategic air power {{to the neglect of}} other force elements. Secretary Wilson reportedly observed that the United States [...] "can't afford to fight limited wars. We can only afford to fight a big war, and if there is one, that is the kind it will be." [...] But by 1955 the Army, and later in the decade the Navy, departed from their emphasis on preparation for total war by urging the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for limited war, non-global conflicts restricted in geographical area, force size, and weapons (although tactical nuclear weapons were not ruled out). Generals Ridgway and Taylor stressed the need to have a variety of forces available and equipped to fight different kinds of war from a local non-nuclear war to a global strategic nuclear conflict. They rejected the notion that limited wars would occur only in less developed areas and argued that such conflicts might occur in the NATO region as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Army {{received}} indirect {{support from}} such critics of massive retaliation as Bernard Brodie, William W. Kaufmann, and Henry A. Kissinger, who {{noted that the}} United States and the Soviet Union had or were acquiring the power to destroy each other with strategic nuclear weapons, thus precluding their rational use {{in response to a}} limited attack. Taylor, concluding that the Soviet Union and the United States had achieved mutual nuclear deterrence, believed that limited-war forces would play an active role in future conflicts and that atomic retaliatory forces would play a passive role. The Army did move into missile and space programs in an effort to preserve for itself a part in planning for and fighting a nuclear war, but in the late 1950s it continued to push for adoption of a new national security policy acknowledging the primacy of limited war. While the Eisenhower administration did not adopt the Army's position, by the time Wilson left office it did accept both the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for limited war and the idea that deterrence of a direct attack on U.S. interests required [...] "sufficient" [...] rather than [...] "superior" [...] retaliatory capability.|$|E
