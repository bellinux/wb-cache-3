5|$|The reevaluation {{of dinosaurs}} spurred public interest, {{with the new}} {{generation}} of paleoartists quick to respond. Artists such as Mark Hallett, Doug Henderson, John Gurche, Gregory S. Paul, William Stout, and Bob Walters illustrated the <b>new</b> <b>findings</b> in response to the demand.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the <b>new</b> <b>findings,</b> the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion {{and concluded that the}} cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have disagreed with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain. Against this, the historian Paolo Squatriti, reviewing Watson's paper 40 years on, noted that it had proven useful to many different historical agendas, and had held up surprisingly well {{in the face of}} <b>new</b> <b>findings</b> in archaeology and archaeobotany.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's {{apartment}} {{and she tells}} him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his <b>new</b> <b>findings</b> to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E
5|$|Paleoptera and Neoptera are {{the winged}} orders of insects {{differentiated}} {{by the presence}} of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based (Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant <b>new</b> <b>findings</b> calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera {{have turned out to be}} more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia. Mantodea, Blattodea, and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera.|$|E
5|$|Various {{evolutionary}} ideas {{had already}} been proposed to explain <b>new</b> <b>findings</b> in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but {{during the first half}} of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.|$|E

5|$|The {{term was}} first used in a {{scientific}} context by Charles Lyell in the third edition (1851) of his book Elements of Geology in relation to missing parts of the geological column, but it was popularized in its present meaning by its appearance on page xi of his book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man of 1863. By {{that time it was}} generally thought {{that the end of the}} last glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on <b>new</b> <b>findings</b> in his Antiquity of Man to put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged. Lyell's vivid writing fired the public imagination, inspiring Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Louis Figuier's 1867 second edition of La Terre avant le déluge ("Earth before the Flood"), which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of Eden shown in the 1863 edition.|$|E

5000|$|To avoid {{assimilation}} {{effects in}} science communication Tim Caulfield has suggested to [...] "preface any <b>new</b> <b>finding</b> {{with what the}} literature says, on balance, about the topic in question; readers might then understand that any marked aberration {{is less likely to}} be true." ...|$|R

25|$|Increasing archaeological {{fieldwork}} in northern Finland has cast some doubts {{on the idea}} of Kvenland having almost no sedentary settlements.
