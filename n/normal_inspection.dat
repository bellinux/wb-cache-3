Based on the optical properties off the SiN and ITTO, ultra-short pulse lasers inn picosecond and femtosecond regime with standard infrared (IR) wavelength as well as lasers with new a wavelength (22 μm regime) are tested for this purpose. To determine a process window for a specific laser a fixed methodology is adopted.

40|$|An {{integral}} part of the MIL-STD- 105 D scheme for sampling inspection by attributes is the transfer from <b>normal</b> <b>inspection</b> to reduced or tightened inspection when the historical record of inspected lots suggests unusually good or bad quality. The switching rules in MIL-STD- 105 D have been criticized, especially by Japanese manufacturers, as being too severe when what is defined as acceptable quality material is submitted. This paper examines the long range fraction of lots rejected for several MIL-STD- 105 D sampling plans by using the MIL-STD- 105 D switching rules, using a modification suggested by the Japanese Standards Association, and by using a second modification developed by the authors. The Japanese Standards Association switching rules are more complex than those in MIL-STD- 105 D. It is demonstrated that they lead to improved long-range properties for Normal-Tightened-Reduced schemes, but to poorer properties for Normal-Tightened schemes. A simplified set of switching rules is suggested, wherein the “limit numbers” in MIL-STD- 105 D are eliminated. In comparison to MIL-STD- 105 D, the simpler rules lead to a lower probability of rejection for good lots and a comparable probability of rejection for bad lots...|$|E

However, it is still a complex task for the BMI users to control the process of objects grasping and lifting with the robotic arm. It is hard to achieve high efficiency and accuracy even after extensive trainings. One important reason is lacking of sufficient feedback information for the user to perform the closed-loop control. In this study, we proposed a method of augmented reality (AR) guiding assistance to provide the enhanced visual feedback to the user for a closed-loop control with a hybrid Gaze-BMI, which combines the electroencephalography (EEG) signals based BMI and the eye tracking for an intuitive and effective control of the robotic arm. Experiments for the objects manipulation tasks while avoiding the obstacle in the workspace are designed to evaluate the performance of our method for controlling the robotic arm. According to the experimental results obtained from eight subjects, the advantages of the proposed closed-loop system (with AR feedback) over the open-loop system (with visual inspection only) have been verified. The number of trigger commands used for controlling the robotic arm to grasp and lift the objects with AR feedback has reduced significantly and the height gaps of the gripper in the lifting process have decreased more than 50 % compared to those trials with <b>normal</b> visual <b>inspection</b> only.

40|$|Introduction The {{quality of}} a sprayed metal deposit {{is known to be}} related to the nature of the {{prepared}} surface of the base metal. Grit blasting is a common method of surface preparation, and the actual profile or surface contour of the prepared surface can be varied considerably by variation in blasting conditions. The exact requirements of an acceptable surface have never been accurately stated, although a degree of undercut is. considered essential. The object of the present work is to develop a non-destructive method for the assessment of blasted mild steel surfaces in terms of suitability for metal spraying. Such a method needs to combine simplicity and speed, so that it can be used by <b>normal</b> <b>inspection</b> personnel without delaying production. Preferably the method should incorporate a 'failsafe! mechanism [...] A number of possible assessment methods have been considered, but attention has been largely concentrated on measurement of the diffuse reflectivity of blasted surfaces. In reality, of course, this is simply an attempt to replace the eye in visual inspection with an instrument, and so remove the human element. Results have been reasonably encouraging, but it is obvious that many more samples need to be examined before a true judgement can be made. Some difficulty has been encountered in deciding the requirements for an acceptable surface. For this reason, a part of the experimental effort has been devoted to the examination of blasted surfaces, and to the measurement of bond strength after metal spraying. A brief review of literature has also been included...|$|E

40|$|Manufactured parts {{containing}} {{composite materials}} can present challenging ultrasonic inspection problems.

40|$|During a <b>normal</b> <b>inspection</b> of {{the main}} {{propulsion}} system at Kennedy Space Center, small cracks were noticed near a slotted region of a gimbal joint flowliner located just upstream {{from one of the}} Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME). These small cracks sparked an investigation of the entire Space Shuttle fleet main propulsion feedlines. The investigation was initiated to determine the cause of the small cracks and a repair method that would be needed to return the Shuttle fleet back to operation safely. The cracks were found to be initiated by structural resonance caused by flow fluctuations from the SSME low pressure fuel turbopump interacting with the flowliner. The pump induced backward traveling wakes that excited the liner and duct acoustics which also caused the liner to vibrate in complex mode shapes. The investigation involved an extensive effort by a team of engineers from the NASA civil servant and contractor workforce with the goal to characterize the root cause of the cracking behavior of the fuel side gimbal joint flowliners. In addition to working to identify the root cause, a parallel path was taken to characterize the material properties and fatigue capabilities of the liner material such that the life of the liners could be ascertained. As the characterization of the material and the most probable cause matured, the combination of the two with pump speed restrictions provided a means to return the Shuttle to flight in a safe manner. This paper traces the flowliner investigation results with respect to the structural dynamics analysis, component level testing and hot-fire flow testing on a static testbed.

Screening involves selecting items whose performance is within specifications based on observing one or more correlated surrogate (screening) variables {{in lieu of the}} performance variable directly. In double screening, two screening variables, which are correlated to a performance variable, are observed sequentially, rather than simultaneously as in a single screening plan (SSP); namely, (l) one screening variable is used first to make one of three decisions [...] -accept, reject, or undecided [...] -according to the magnitude of the individual nonconforming probability (equivalent to the IME for an accepted item); (2) after this first screening, the second screening variable is employed to screen the undecided items.

The impact of the intercorrelation between two screening variables on the sequencing of a DSP and the performance between an SSP versus DSP are examined.

Thus, the normal alignment between vision camera and inspection table needs to be verified in order for the risk of unreliable results to be reduced. In this thesis, the unique verification method which checks the required normal alignment is explored and implemented. The normality is verified using the image of a standard reference square collected by the to-be-verified vision camera. The image of a square is a parallelogram if and only if the vision camera is <b>normal</b> to the <b>inspection</b> table. Hence, the parallelism hypotheses are tested to verify the normal alignment. Sensitivity analysis discloses the desirable experimental settings. In addition, field experiments are also carried out. In addition to the normal alignment, the scale factor, the conversion ratio of the scanned image to the acquired image, is needed for mensuration. Once the normal alignment is verified, the scale factor can be identified accurately at negligible cost using the scale calibration method explored in this thesis. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{strength}} of an adhesive bond between two metal sheets, {{it is necessary to}} measure the physical state of the adhesive layer that mechanically joins the two pieces of metal. This requires rapidly performing a detailed analysis of the ultrasonic echoes reflected from the entire structure when it is immersed in a water bath for a <b>normal</b> ultrasonic pulse-echo <b>inspection.</b> To achieve this result, computer-operated ultrasonic inspection systems have been assembled and equipped with special signal processing routines so that particular features of the ultrasonic echo in both the time domain and the frequency domain can be extracted in a time short enough to meet the requirements of a production inspection system. Such features as the relative amplitude of the signals reflected from {{the top and bottom of}} the adhesive layer and the frequencies for which standing waves are excited in the adhesive and in the metal adherends are of particular interest for making the strength predictions. It is also important that the interrogating ultrasonic pulse be of very short time duration so that the echoes from the various interfaces in the sandwich-like joint can be resolved in the time domain display. This requires the use of special high frequency pulse generators coupled to broad band transducers and amplifiers. Special procedures are also needed to insure the accuracy of the analog-to-digital conversion at the input to the computer and the subsequent transformations to and from the frequency domain...|$|R
