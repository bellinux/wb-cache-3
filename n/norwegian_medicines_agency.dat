40|$|LUA Directive was {{introduced}} {{for first time}} in Norway in 2003 to provide better availability and lower prices for non-prescription pharmaceuticals. The main idea behind implementing such a directive was to increase the competition in the non-pharmaceutical market by letting other retail outlets than the pharmacies to provide non-prescription pharmaceuticals.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Historically in Norway, {{pharmaceutical}} {{prices have}} been particularly high for originator drugs, which are produced by originator companies that have a monopoly through the patent system. However, once the patent expires, generic drugs are able to enter the market and cause a considerable decline in price. The <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicine</b> <b>Agency</b> (NoMA) is responsible for issuing market authorization (MA) and inclusion in the reimbursement scheme, for any new drugs in Norway. NoMA must evaluate the cost-effectiveness analysis of the originator drug provided by the pharmaceutical company. In order to predict cost- effectiveness, {{it is important to}} estimate how long the originator drug will stay in the market before generic competition is established. Objectives: Investigate how long it takes for a generic drug to enter the market after applying for MA, and what are the potential reasons for the time span used. Methodology: A combination of qualitative and quantitative study design. Empirically based and a single-case study. There were in-depth interviews conducted with executive officers at NoMA and representatives from generic and originator firms. The quantitative data was collected from the NoMA´s databases, namely Athene and P 360. The data was divided into four phases and a statistical description of each phase was created. Furthermore each phase was divided into two periods 2005 - 08 and 2009 - 12 for the purpose of running a Man Whitney U test in order to reveal the time differences between the two periods. Results: For quantitative analysis the following was found: (1) For a generic medicine to obtain MA it takes 357 days according to median. (2) A generic drug used 131 days (median) to enter the market after MA approval. (3) Additionally in the second period 2009 - 12 it took longer time to obtain MA and enter the market compared to the first period of 2005 - 08. For qualitative analysis the following was discovered: (1) Various obstacles which affect the MA process. (2) Patent obstacles and complications which affect the overall time span. (3) Norway is a relatively small market and therefore less attractive for some generic companies. (4) Production issues and challenges faced by generic firms. (5) In some cases, the substitution list and reimbursement scheme processes can cause delays to the overall time span. (6) Once the original drug patent expires, the original firms can choose to enter the stepped price system and create competition for generic firms, which causes a delay in entering the market...|$|R
40|$|Background Drugs {{predominantly}} prescribed {{in general}} practice should ideally {{be tested in}} that setting; however, {{little is known about}} drug trials in general practice. Our aim was to describe drug trials in Norwegian general practice over the period of a decade. Methods The present work concerns a 10 -year retrospective study of protocols submitted to the <b>Norwegian</b> national <b>medicines</b> <b>agency</b> (1998 to 2007) identifying all studies involving general practitioners (GPs) as clinical investigator(s). We analyzed the number of trials, drug company involvement, patients, participating doctors, payment, medications tested and main diagnostic criteria for inclusion. We also analyzed one trial in greater detail. Results Out of 2, 054 clinical drug trials, 196 (9. 5 %) were undertaken in general practice; 93 % were multinational, 96 % were industry funded and 77 % included patients both from general practice and specialist care. The trials were planned to be completed in the period 1998 to 2012. A total of 23, 000 patients in Norway and 340, 000 patients internationally were planned {{to be included in the}} 196 trials. A median of 5 GPs participated in each trial (range 1 to 402). Only 0. 7 % of 831 GP investigators had general practice university affiliations. Median payment for participating investigators was € 1, 900 (range € 0 to 13, 500) per patient completing the trial. A total of 30 pharmaceutical companies were involved. The drugs most commonly studied were antidiabetics (21 %), obstructive airway disease medications (12 %), agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (10 %), and lipid modifying agents (10 %). One trial, presented in more detail, had several characteristics of a seeding or marketing trial. Conclusions Only one in four drug trials involving general practice were solely general practice trials and almost all were industry initiated without input from academic general practice. There was a large variation in the number of patients, participating doctors, and economic compensation for trial investigators, with some investigators receiving substantial payments...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) is a {{major problem}} in patients with a spinal cord injury (SCI) who have lost control over their bladder function. UTI is a common cause of sepsis in these patients, which leads to high mortality and morbidity rates. There is an urgent need of effective prophylaxis in this group of patients, especially non-antibiotic prophylaxis, that does not give rise to resistance against antibiotics. Vitamin C is commonly used, but {{there is a lack of}} documentation of efficiency. GOAL: To design, get approval, and to describe the development of a randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) that can determine if vitamin C is an efficient prophylaxis for UTI in patients with SCI. This paper should also be used as an example of how to design a RCT, through comments of the process concerning the decisions and the applications. RESULTS: The study is approved and started. CONCLUSION: To design a study demands a great deal of knowledge before it will be approved by the Regional ethical committee, the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>medicines</b> <b>agency</b> and by the Data protection commissioner in the responsible hospital. The study also has to be registered in a database over clinical studies. When all the plans are ready, what remains as the main challenge is the recruitment of patients...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the role of national medicines agencies on the innovative scope and productivity of national pharmaceutical {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) through comparative case study of Norway and Sweden. Institutional theory and resource based view are used {{to investigate}} the influence of institutional forces and strategic resources on shaping the roles of the agencies. The findings indicate that both factors have influenced the roles of Swedish medical products agency (MPA) and <b>Norwegian</b> <b>medicines</b> <b>agency</b> (NOMA). MPA seems to have an innovation facilitation role whereas NOMA does not. However, the Norwegian SMEs within drug discovery and development seem to perform better regarding innovative scope. The innovative productivity among Norwegian biopharmaceutical SMEs also appears to be on the rise. It is suggested that control variables, such as governmental initiatives on funding and tax benefits, have stronger influence on innovative scope and productivity compared {{to the role of the}} national medicines agency. Norwegian SMEs regularly seek guidance at medicines agencies in other countries. It is discussed that NOMA can contribute to an even higher performance of Norwegian SMEs if the agency changes its role towards more innovation-orientation and acts as a supporting organization. The practical implications of this research for NOMA have been elaborated...|$|E
40|$|Summary–main findings. Legal {{framework}} A new framework {{consisting of}} regulations and guidelines for opioid substitution treatment of heroin addicts, as {{laid down in}} the Act relating to specialist health services, entered into force on 1 February 2010. The new framework is intended to contribute to equal provision of opioid substi- tution treatment throughout the country, and to help to integrate such treatment {{with the rest of}} the health service. The age limit no longer ap- plies, but before someone is offered opioid sub- stitution treatment, an assessment must always be carried out of whether the patient will benefit from treatment without such medication. The Health Personnel Act and the Act relating to specialist health services were amended with effect from 2010. The amendments, which concern the follow-up of children as family members, have strengthened children’s legal status and ensured that minor children of parents with mental illness, drug/alcohol dependency, serious somatic illnesses or injuries receive better follow-up when their parents receive medical help. In 2010, the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> has added eleven new drugs to the list of narcotic substances, cf. the Regulations relating to narcotics. These are: GBL, 1, 4 –butandiol, fenazepam, Bentazepam, Bk-MBDB, Bromo-Dragonfly, 4 -fluoride amphetamine, mCPP, MBDB, mephedrone and PMMA. With the exception of mCPP, all the drugs were previously covered by the derivative rule in the same regulation...|$|E

40|$|Prescription {{practise}} {{of sleep}} medication among ADHD-medicated children Background Use of medicines {{for the treatment}} of ADHD in Norwegian children has increased considerably the last ten years. In parallel, the use of hypnotics and sedatives in children has increased. With the use of prescription data, we wanted to investigate if there is a connection between the increased uses of these drugs. We also wanted to see if sleep disturbances are reported as adverse events. Aim of the study Using prescription data from the Norwegian Prescription Database and adverse event reports for the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency,</b> we wanted to investigate if sleep disturbances is a symptom of ADHD or adverse events caused by the treatment. Data from the Prescription Database on the number and sequence of prescriptions were used to evaluate if prescription of ADHD-medicines were followed by prescription of sedatives or hypnotics. Adverse event data were evaluated to se if sleep disturbances are reported. Results: We found that 26 % (n= 830) of Norwegian children medicated for ADHD in 2006 also get a prescription for a sleep medication, primary melatonin. Of all new stimulant-treated users (n= 215) in 2006, 86 % (n= 185) got the sleep medication prescript after the stimulant-prescription. Reports on adverse events were so scarce (n= 2) that we could suspect that sleep disturbances are an underreported side effect of stimulant use. Conclusion: The common use of Melatonin as sleep medication among Norwegian children less than 11 years old medicated for ADHD, suggest that sleep problems is an underreported side-effect of stimulant use in this group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In 2006, the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> {{mandated}} {{a switch}} from desloratadine, ebastine, or fexofenadine to cetirizine or loratadine {{in patients with}} allergic rhinitis (AR) or chronic urticaria (CU). In an online survey, patients whose medication was switched assessed the impact on efficacy, fatigue, and work productivity/attendance. Methods Allergy patients in Norway completed a 25 -item online survey. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with AR or CU who were switched to cetirizine or loratadine from desloratadine, ebastine, or fexofenadine were included. Participants rated post-switch efficacy, fatigue, and effect on work productivity/attendance compared with their pre-switch medication. Patients also reported post-switch change in number of doctor visits required, total treatment cost, and whether they had switched or wanted to switch back to their previous medications. Results Of 1920 patients invited, 493 responded and 409 of these were eligible. Previous antihistamines were desloratadine (78. 4 % of respondents), ebastine (16. 0 %), and fexofenadine (5. 6 %). Post-switch, 64. 7 % received cetirizine and 35. 3 % loratadine. Compared with previous therapy, cetirizine and loratadine were rated less effective by 46. 3 % of respondents; 28. 7 % reported increased fatigue; and 31. 6 % reported decreased work productivity with the generic agents. At {{the time of the}} survey, 26 % of respondents had switched back to their previous medication. Conclusions This is the first survey to assess the impact on patient-reported outcomes of a mandated switch from prescription to generic antihistamines in Norway. The findings suggest that patient response to different antihistamines will vary and that treatment decisions should be individualized for optimal results. </p...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in this study}} is to describe adverse drug events for elderly patients &# 8805; 70 years, as they are registered in the national database of adverse drug events at the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> in 2010. In Norway, a relevance-validated list of drugs, drug dosages and drug combinations to be avoided in elderly (&# 8805; 70 years) patients has been developed; the so-called Norwegian General Practice (NORGEP) criteria. As a secondary objective, I wanted to investigate the frequency of registered adverse drug events matching these criteria. 280 adverse drug events were registered for elderly &# 8805; 70 years in the national database during 2010. 63 % were regarded as serious adverse drug events, and 16 % had resulted in death. Warfarin is the drug registered with most adverse drug events, most of them described as cerebral bleedings. Regarding the NORGEP criteria, I only found 6 hits in the database. The spontaneous reporting system is believed to be hampered by a major underreporting. The results presented in the current study are therefore probably not representative of real-life medical practice, but comprise just a tip of the iceberg. I suspect that the system used is more likely to detect acute traumatic events such as cerebral bleedings, but that it fails to identify minor, less serious and more prolonged adverse drug events. I believe that better knowledge among health personnel, more focus and better time during the work day to handle adverse drug events would increase the degree of reporting and give us more knowledge on how to reduce adverse drug events in the elderly...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Previously, we {{identified}} a 10 -year cohort of protocols from applications to the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> 1998 – 2007, consisting of 196 drug trials in general practice. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine whether trial results were published and whether trial funding and conflicts of interest were reported. Design Cohort study of trials with systematic searches for published results. Setting Clinical drug trials in Norwegian general practice. Methods We performed systematic literature searches of MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL to identify publications originating from each trial using characteristics such as test drug, comparator and patient groups as search terms. When no publication was identified, we contacted trial sponsors for information regarding trial completion and reference to any publications. Main outcome measures We determined the frequency of publication of trial results and trial characteristics associated with publication of results. Results Of the 196 trials, 5 were never started. Of the remaining 191 trials, 71 % had results published in a journal, 11 % had results publicly available elsewhere and 18 % of trials had no results available. Publication was more common among trials with an active comparator drug (χ 2 test, p= 0. 040), with a larger number of patients (total sample size≥median, p= 0. 010) and with a longer trial period (duration≥median, p= 0. 025). Trial funding was reported in 85 % of publications and increased over time, as did reporting of conflicts of interest among authors. Among the 134 main journal articles from the trials, 60 % presented statistically significant results for the investigational drug, and the conclusion of the article was favourable towards the test drug in 78 % of papers. Conclusions We did not identify any journal publication of results for 29 % of the general practice drug trials.

40|$|Background: Alteplase is {{the only}} {{approved}} thrombolytic agent for acute ischaemic stroke. The overall benefit from alteplase is substantial, but some evidence indicates that alteplase also has negative effects on the ischaemic brain. Tenecteplase {{may be more effective}} and less harmfull than alteplase, but large randomised controlled phase 3 trials are lacking. The Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial (NOR-TEST) aims to compare efficacy and safety of tenecteplase vs. alteplase. Methods/Design: NOR-TEST is a multi-centre PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint) trial designed to establish superiority of tenecteplase 0. 4 mg/kg (single bolus) as compared with alteplase 0. 9 mg/kg (10 % bolus + 90 % infusion/ 60 minutes) for consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke eligible for thrombolytic therapy, i. e. patients a) admitted < 4 &frac 12; hours after symptoms onset; b) admitted < 4 &frac 12; hours after awakening with stroke symptoms c) receiving bridging therapy before embolectomy. Randomisation tenecteplase:alteplase is 1 : 1. The primary study endpoint is favourable functional outcome defined as modified Rankin Scale 0 – 1 at 90 days. Secondary study endpoints are: 1) haemorrhagic transformation (haemorrhagic infarct/haematoma); 2) symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage on CT 24 – 48 hours; 3) major neurological improvement at 24 hours; 4) recanalisation at 24 – 36 hours; 5) death. Discussion: NOR-TEST may establish a novel approach to acute ischaemic stroke treatment. A positive result will lead to a more effective, safer and easier treatment for all acute ischaemic stroke pasients. NOR-TEST is reviewed and approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (2011 / 2435), and The <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> (12 / 01402).

40|$|Background: Economic {{evaluations}} {{are increasingly}} being used to inform decision makers regarding the allocation of scarce health care resources. In reimbursement applications to the Norwegian Drug Reimbursement Scheme the cost-utility analysis (CUA) is a common feature, expressing the cost-effectiveness of a treatment. <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> (NoMA),which administers the scheme, is interested in supplementing the existing dossier with measurements of the conditions severity level. During their work on revising the pharmacoeconomic guidelines they identified a lack of empirical studies concerning severity measures (NoMA, 2011 b). Objective: To {{find out how to}} operationalize severity measurements in a Norwegian context and investigate the implications of the included severity measures; providing a contribution to the discussion of severity level in Norway. Method: An explorative approach with a systematic literature review to identify different severity measures. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) based on Scandinavian data is developed to establish a reference class for the included conditions. The data material is reimbursement applications received by NoMA in the period 2009 - 2011, including 20 cases in the analysis. Results: Two severity measures, Absolute shortfall (AS) and Proportional shortfall (PS), are included and operationalized. They both make use of Quality-adjusted lifeyar (QALY) utility values, but have a fundamental difference in how the age of the patient is handled. None of them stands out as being clearly superior regarding existing policy and studies concerning the public opinion. Conclusions: NoMA and other governmental agencies could get useful information to utilize in resource allocation if doing a more consistent evaluation of medical conditions’ severity levels. AS favored younger individuals, but the age component was reduced by including discounting in the procedure. PS was more sensitive to conditions with an expected death in near future independent of patient’s age. The thesis identifies various components that have to be addressed to developers of pharmacoeconomic models to achieve valid measurements. This type of methodology are not widespread and {{it would be interesting to}} see more research done on applying severity measures to real-life data to develop new and refine existing principles...|$|E

40|$|Background Current {{guidelines}} for opioid dependence recommend daily maintenance of physical dependence with methadone or buprenorphine, and discourage abstinence {{due to the}} high risk of relapse and overdose. Extended-release formulations of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) block heroin and other opioid agonists competitively for around 4 weeks per administration. XR-NTX thus enables opioid users to experience abstinence from opioid agonists with greatly reduced risk of overdose compared to medication-free abstinence. While XR-NTX has shown promise compared to placebo and daily naltrexone tablets, there is limited information on long-term safety and its performance compared to daily maintenance treatment. Methods/Design In this five-hospital RCT with long-term follow-up, we aim to recruit n[*]=[*] 180 patients in treatment for opioid dependence and allocate them in an open, randomized manner (1 : 1) to receive either 4 -week XR-NTX or daily buprenorphine-naloxone (BP-NLX) {{for the duration of}} 12  weeks. Allocation is open-label due to the risk of overdose during attempts to self-unmask allocation using heroin. Urine drug tests are scheduled every week with follow-up visits & assessment every 4 weeks. Primary outcomes are abstinence from illicit opioids in urine drug tests and self-report, as well as retention in treatment. Secondary outcomes include other substance use, injecting behavior, drug craving, mental health, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, abstinence motivation, opioid agonist effect rating, insomnia, and pain. Observation is continued for another 36  weeks in order to assess longer-term safety, adherence and effectiveness.

40|$|Background When {{reading a}} report of a {{clinical}} trial, {{it should be possible}} to judge whether the results are relevant for your patients. Issues affecting the external validity or generalizability of a trial should therefore be reported. Our aim was to determine whether articles with published results from a complete cohort of drug trials conducted entirely or partly in general practice reported sufficient information about the trials to consider the external validity. Methods A cohort of 196 drug trials in Norwegian general practice was previously identified from the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> archive with year of application for approval 1998 – 2007. After comprehensive literature searches, 134 journal articles reporting results published from 2000 to 2015 were identified. In these articles, we considered the reporting of the following issues relevant for external validity: reporting of the clinical setting; selection of patients before inclusion in a trial; reporting of patients’ co-morbidity, co-medication or ethnicity; choice of primary outcome; and reporting of adverse events. Results Of these 134 articles, only 30 (22 %) reported the clinical setting of the trial. The number of patients screened before enrolment was reported in 61 articles (46 %). The primary outcome of the trial was a surrogate outcome for 60 trials (45 %), a clinical outcome for 39 (29 %) and a patient-reported outcome for 25 (19 %). Clinical details of adverse events were reported in 124 (93 %) articles. Co-morbidity of included participants was reported in 54 trials (40 %), co-medication in 27 (20 %) and race/ethnicity in 78 (58 %). Conclusions The clinical setting of the trials, the selection of patients before enrolment, and co-morbidity or co-medication of participants was most commonly not reported, limiting the possibility to consider the generalizability of a trial. It may therefore be difficult for readers to judge whether drug trial results are applicable to clinical decision-making in general practice or when developing clinical guidelines...|$|E
40|$|Background: Using {{medicines}} {{safe and}} effective {{is an essential part}} of the medicine safety agenda. An extensive and growing body of literature on the use of unlicensed medicines shows that the use of unlicensed medicines is related to increased incidence of adverse drug reactions. The use of these has not been reduced in spite of new regulatory approaches for medicine, and instructions from professional organizations. In December 2014, the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> introduced a regulatory change that entailed a medical justification when health personnel prescribe unlicensed medicine in Norway. The intention behind this was to prevent improper use and to emphasize the personal and legal responsibility of prescribing unlicensed medicines to patients. Objective: To analyze trends in price and consumption of unlicensed medicines in Norway before and after the regulatory change in December 2014. Methods: A linear time-series regression model with ordinary least square application was used to analyze the effect of the regulatory change, trends for all sales values and ATC codes. A data analysis was conducted to map how many units and daily defined doses there were of unlicensed medicines in the 1 st level of ATC codes from 2012 to 2016. It was also used to examine whether sales per unit (per package) was decreasing per month. Results: The regression analysis reported a statistically insignificant effect on total sales, indicating that the regulatory change had no effect on sales. Moreover, it indicated that there was a significant effect on five out of fourteen ATC codes. It is however, difficult to say that the regulatory change was the sole reason for this. Causal inference from the method is limited because it is not possible to dismiss other explanations for the observed changes in time-series. Furthermore, there was an overall increase in sales, units and daily defined doses. Conclusion: There is no significant effect of the regulatory change on sales and consumption. Further research is necessary to understand how unlicensed medicines are used. Without a full comprehension of this, it is difficult to suggest policies and processes to ensure that unlicensed medicines are used correctly...|$|E

40|$|Background Intramuscular {{injections}} of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) {{have been a}} cornerstone {{in the treatment of}} spasticity for the last 20 years. In Norway, the treatment is now offered to two out of three children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). However, despite its common use, the evidence for its functional effects is limited and inconclusive. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine whether BoNT-A makes walking easier in children with CP. We hypothesize that injections with BoNT-A in the calf muscles will reduce energy cost during walking, improve walking capacity, increase habitual physical activity, reduce pain and improve self-perceived performance and satisfaction. Methods/design This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial is conducted in a clinical setting involving three health regions in Norway. Ninety-six children with spastic CP, referred for single-level injections with BoNT-A in the calf muscles, will be invited to participate. Those who are enrolled will be randomized to receive either injections with BoNT-A (Botox®) or 0. 9 % saline in the calf muscles. Stratification according to age and study center will be made. The allocation ratio will be 1 : 1. Main inclusion criteria are (1) age 4 [*]−[*] 17. 5 years, (2) Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II, (3) no BoNT-A injections in the lower limbs during the past 6 months and (4) no orthopedic surgery to the lower limbs during the past 2 years. The outcome measures will be made at baseline and 4, 12 (primary endpoint) and 24 weeks after injections. Primary outcome is change in energy cost during walking. Secondary outcomes are change in walking capacity, change in activity, perceived change in performance and satisfaction in mobility tasks, and pain. The primary analysis will use a linear mixed model to test for difference in change in the outcome measures between the groups. The study is approved by the Regional Ethical Committee and The <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency.</b> Recruitment started in September 2015.

40|$|Background: A {{patient who}} {{developed}} a surgical site infection (SSI) after hip arthroplasty {{was likely to}} having an extended length of stay and incurring additional costs in terms of bed-days, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, etc. It would be important to identify any patient-, surgical- and hospital-related factors that could be modified before surgery to control and decrease the risk of post-operative infection. Aim: To identify the risk factors for SSI after primary hip arthroplasty, {{as well as to}} estimate the hospital cost of SSI in Norway. Method: Risk factor analysis was a register based retrospective cohort study at the national level in Norway including patients undergoing hip arthroplasty between September 2012 and December 2014. Binary logistic regression models were constructed for assessing relationships between the outcome variable (SSI) and a series of explanatory variables. For cost analysis, a bottom-up approach was adopted. Health care resources utilized for SSI treatment and the quantities of these resources were derived from an expert survey. Unit costs for the resources were obtained from various sources, including Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) price list, the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency</b> database, etc. Total cost of SSI was then calculated by multiplying the quantities of resource use (q) by the unit costs (p) of the resources. Result: During the study period, 17, 762 total hip arthroplasty operations and 7, 334 hemiarthroplasty procedures were registered in the NOIS. The incidence of SSI after THA was 2. 2 % (390 of 17, 762) and that after HA was 3. 6 % (264 of 7, 334). According to the multivariate regression model, the risk factors for SSI after THA were age, male sex, ASA score ≥ 3, surgery lasting more than 120 minutes, elective surgery, cement-less fixation and post-operative hospital stay. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and specialty hospital were associated with lower risk of SSI. For HA, the risk factors were fewer, including male sex, cement-less fixation and post-operative hospital stay. The average cost of a SSI after primary hip arthroplasty for hospital was NOK 198, 121. The main cost drivers were readmission stay (56 %), followed by reoperation (28 %) and additional LOS (11 %). Conclusion: Of all the risk factors detected in this study, cemented prosthesis and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis are the modifiable ones and therefore recommended to orthopedic surgeon and infection control personnel for controlling and reducing SSIs following THA. Surgical site infection following primary hip arthroplasty causes significant economic burden for Norwegian hospitals, mainly due to substantial increase in hospital stay and the resource demanding nature of its revision procedures. The high cost of SSI implies that substantial cost savings can be achieved by reducing the number of SSIs, and in turn, highlights the importance of detecting modifiable risk factors for SSI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This master {{thesis is}} a part of the project initialised by the Ministry of Health and Care Services in order to {{evaluate}} the effects of the transfer of financial responsibility to the Regional Health Authorities. The scope and the main topic for the project were sat by Stortingsproposisjon nr. 1 (2008 - 2009) (St. prp. nr. 1 2008 - 2009, kap. 732, postene 72 - 75). This paper concentrates on evaluation of the reform s effects on price and competition in the market for TNF-α inhibitors and other biological anti-inflammatory medicines (six biopharmaceuticals all together). TNF-α inhibitors and other biological anti-inflammatory medicines, belonging to the group of antineoplastic and immunomodulating medicines, have had a quite expansive sales growth during the past decade. In the specific period of time from 2003 until 2008 the total sales increased from 300 mills NOK to almost 1, 24 billion NOK. This expansion triggered for the strict cost containment governmental efforts and the financing reform of 2006. Before 01. 06. 2006 the use of these medicines was financed asymmetrically, both by the National Insurance Scheme (Folketrygden) and the Regional Health Authorities (RHF). After the funding reform (from 01. 06. 2006) all the treatment with TNF-α inhibitors and other biological anti-inflammatory biopharmaceuticals is financed through the hospitals budgets. One can assume that transfer of the financing responsibility for these medicines is followed by increased price competition and lower prices. Also as a result of tendering competitions accomplished by Norwegian Drug Procurement Co-operation. The main hypotheses to test were: Due to the financing reform of 2006 and introduction of tendering competition as a result of that, the pharmacy retail prices on TNF-α inhibitors have been decreased over the years. Due to increased number of competitors (therapeutically equal bio- and pharmaceuticals), the pharmacy retail prices have been decreased over the years. The panel data of 637 observations on 15 biopharmaceuticals in the time period of 01. 2003 - 04. 2008 was included to verify the hypotheses. Because of difference in time points of market entrance not all of the biopharmaceuticals are from start to end, which makes the panel data unbalanced. These are data from both primary and secondary sources. The first hypothesis, that pharmacy retail prices on TNF-α inhibitors have been decreased over the years due to the financing reform of 2006 and introduction of tendering competition is confirmed. Analyses of price effects were done in two ways and were similar to the methods mentioned in the temporary report (Bjarkum et al 2008). The first one was to analyse the retail pharmacy prices from the Norwegian Pharmacy Association in comparison to the maximum pharmacy prices from the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Medicines</b> <b>Agency.</b> The second method was to analyse the prices by using fixed effects linear regression. Analysis of the effects of the financing reform on competition was done by using static OLS linear regression, log-log model and by calculating Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The main results approve the hypotheses. The achieved effects of the reform of 2006 seem to be in the range of approximately 40 60 millions NOK per year (after 01. 2007) ...|$|E
