40|$|Seed {{predation}} {{and seed}} dispersal can have strong effects on early life history stages of plants. These processes {{have often been}} studied as individual effects, but {{the degree to which}} their relative importance co-varies with seed predator abundance and how this influences seed germination rates is poorly understood. Therefore, we used a combination of observations and field experiments to determine the degree to which germination rates of the palm Astrocaryum mexicanum varied with abundance of a small mammal seed predator/disperser, Heteromys desmarestianus, in a lowland tropical forest. Patterns of abundance of the two species were strongly related; density of H. desmarestianus was low in sites with low density of A. mexicanum and vice versa. Rates of predation and dispersal of A. mexicanum seeds depended on abundance of H. desmarestianus; sites with high densities of H. desmarestianus had the highest rates of seed predation and lowest rates of seed germination, but a greater total number of seeds were dispersed and there was greater density of seedlings, saplings, and adults of A. mexicanum in these sites. When abundance of H. desmarestianus was experimentally reduced, rates of seed predation decreased, but so did dispersal of A. mexicanum seeds. Critically, rates of germination of dispersed seeds were 5  times greater than undispersed seeds. The results suggest that the relationship between A. mexicanum and H. desmarestianus is a conditional mutualism that results in a strong local effect on the abundance of each species. However, the magnitude and direction of these effects are determined by the relative strength of opposing, but related, mechanisms. A. mexicanum <b>nuts</b> provide <b>H.</b> desmarestianus with a critical food resource, and while seed predation on A. mexicanum <b>nuts</b> by <b>H.</b> desmarestianus is very intense, A. mexicanum ultimately benefits because of the relatively high germination rates of its seeds that are dispersed by H. desmarestianus...|$|R

The methods applied were (a) ozone: O 3, (b) carbon dioxide: CO 2, and (c) O 2 absorber pads with and without vacuum. From all modified atmospheres evaluated, the best performance was obtained with O 3, either with or without vacuum. It was the only nut treatment that was able to degrade aflatoxins. None of the spiked (AFLs: 15 [*]μg·kg− 1) nut samples O 3 - treated had aflatoxins detected up to the LC-MS/MS method LOQ (0. 36 [*]μg·kg− 1 for total AFLs), thus producing safer nuts. Also it kept the fatty acid oxidation indicator—malondialdehyde stable and improved the sensory attributes for consumer acceptance.

The resulting relationship between torque – tension for the bolt – nut – washer assembly is used to explain its behavior as the length and location of treatment surface are varied. Tests were performed upon one hundred sixty four bolts; eighty A 325 of three inches in length, fifty-two A 325 of six inches in length, twenty A 490 of three inches in length, and twelve A 490 of six inches in length. One hundred sixty four nuts and washers were tested, one hundred <b>nuts</b> type 2 <b>H,</b> and fifty six nuts type C and eight nuts type D to determine the effect of the variables (nut type, bolt length, bolt type and Control Fluid) on the torque-tension relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assembly. Hundreds of experiments using replicate samples for statistical reli-ability were conducted to establish the effect of the variables on the tension-torque relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assemblage. The principal relationship in turn-of-nut installation is that between elongation and bolt pretension, the tension-torque relationship is the factor that reflects the bolt pretension in an installation to be expected in a properly tightened connection. Control Fluid was found to decrease the coefficient of friction on coated parts and to control the tension obtained with a given torque upon assembly...|$|R

None of the N-terminal segments, including the complete precursor containing all propeptides, was able to direct the invertase to the vacuoles. However, a short C-terminal segment comprising the last 20 amino acids of the precursor was sufficient for efficient targeting of yeast invertase to the vacuoles of the transformed tobacco plants. Further analyses showed that peptides of 16 and 13 amino acids of the C-terminal segment were still sufficient, although they had slightly lower efficiency. When segments of 9 amino acids or shorter were analyzed, a decrease to approximately 30 % was observed. These segments included the C-terminal propeptide of four amino acids (Ile-Ala-Gly-Phe). When the 2 S albumin was expressed in tobacco, it was also localized to the vacuoles of mesophyll cells. If the C-terminal propeptide was deleted from the 2 S albumin precursor, all of this truncated 2 S albumin was secreted from the tobacco cells. These {{results indicate that the}} C-terminal propeptide is necessary but not sufficient for vacuolar targeting.

The O 3 treatment affected Brazil nuts mycoflora growth, reduced their moisture content (mc) and degraded AFLs. From the three O 3 concentrations applied, 31 mg/l (5 hours exposition) {{was able to}} successfully destroy fungi contamination (initial : 4. 83 logcfu/g to ng-no grow), including the Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus species, since Day One after application.

Despite of the O 3 concentrations applied, AFLs were not detected in all nut samples O 3 treated since Day One of application up to the method LOQ of 1. 34 µg/kg except for 10 mg/kg).

40|$|Background: Component-based {{diagnosis}} on multiplex platforms {{is widely}} used in food allergy but its clinical performance has not been evaluated in nut allergy. Objective: To assess the diagnostic performance of a commercial protein microarray in the determination of specific IgE (sIgE) in peanut, hazelnut, and walnut allergy. Methods: sIgE was measured in 36 peanut-allergic, 36 hazelnut-allergic, and 44 walnut-allergic patients by ISAC 112, and subsequently, sIgE against available components was determined by ImmunoCAP in patients with negative ISAC results. ImmunoCAP was also used to measure sIgE to Ara h 9, Cor a 8, and Jug r 3 in a subgroup of lipid transfer protein (LTP) -sensitized nut-allergic patients (positive skin prick test to LTP-enriched extract). sIgE levels by ImmunoCAP were compared with ISAC ranges. Results: Most peanut-, hazelnut-, and walnut-allergic patients were sensitized to the corresponding <b>nut</b> LTP (Ara <b>h</b> 9, 66. 7 %; Cor a 8, 80. 5 %; Jug r 3, 84 % respectively). However, ISAC did not detect sIgE in 33. 3 % of peanut-allergic patients, 13. 9 % of hazelnut-allergic patients, or 13. 6 % of walnut-allergic patients. sIgE determination by ImmunoCAP detected sensitization to Ara h 9, Cor a 8, and Jug r 3 in, respectively, 61. 5 % of peanut-allergic patients, 60 % of hazelnut-allergic patients, and 88. 3 % of walnut-allergic patients with negative ISAC results.

Despite high values of production and export of Brazil Nuts, and the extreme importance it has in the economy, studies show that excessive collection in forests jeopardizes the future of the species. It is through the genetic diversity that species are maintained over time, allowing the evolutionary adaptation of the species as a result of environmental changes. The objective of this work was to study the genetic diversity among and within populations of Brazil nuts by AFLP markers. One hundred and fifty subjects were evaluated, two populations from Aruan?

In analyzes, we used four primer combinations (E + ATC / M + CCA + E AGC / M + CAT, E + AGC / M + CCA E + ACA / M + CAC) that generated 306 polymorphic bands (93. 3 %). Genetic differentiation within and among populations was tested by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), using the Genes software (Cruz, 2006 a).
