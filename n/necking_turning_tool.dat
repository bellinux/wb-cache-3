Currently, most of {{the diamond}} <b>turning</b> <b>tools</b> used for {{precision}} machining are still manually manufactured, the profile accuracy of the diamond cutting edge depends on the operator’s experience and skill, so that the process need to be automated. Therefore in this research, an automated grinding system has been developed for the diamond <b>turning</b> <b>tools,</b> controlled by a vision system. The profile of the diamond <b>turning</b> <b>tools</b> is captured in real time via CCD camera. The deviation from an ideal circle is calculated and feedback to the controller, the grinding system then removes cutting edge of <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> selectively to achieve high quality and high productivity...|$|R

Using the Mathcad software, we have solved the time-varying differential equations analytically and {{have studied the}} deflection changing of work piece with the position of <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> and given the distribution characteristic for the time-varying deflection of each section. The results indicate that (1) the deflection of an arbitrary section is time-varying due to the time-varying position of the <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> and the time-varying inertia moment; (2) for the shaft with thimble constraint, {{the position of the}} maximal deflection is not at the section with turning tool; (3) for the shaft without thimble constraint, when the <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> is at the free end, the deflection at each section of the work-piece is the maximal compared with the other positions of <b>turning</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|R

50|$|During {{the first}} year after hatching, the {{underside}} is white and the molt cycles are too rapid to easily define definitive colors per molt. Molting starts at around 10 weeks, as the juvenile undergoes six molts before reaching the definitive basic plumage which is then slightly altered during the breeding season. At around three to five years of age, the upperparts become gray to grayish-brown, the abdomen becomes blackish-brown, and the remaining underside is marked with black and silver stripes. During molting, the adult can adopt up to three appearances. During the post-breeding season, the head turns pale yellow and the <b>neck</b> <b>turns</b> white, and immediately before breeding, the head turns yellow and the <b>neck</b> <b>turns</b> dark brown. During the nesting period, the head becomes white, with dark feathers placed randomly. The plumage in the male and the female are similar, except that the female is likely to molt at 34 to 36 months while the male molts at 36 to 40 months of age.|$|R
