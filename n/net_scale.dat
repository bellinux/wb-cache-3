5000|$|The log scaler is an {{occupation}} in the timber industry. The Log Scaler measures the cut trees {{to determine the}} scale (volume) and quality (grade) of the wood {{to be used for}} manufacturing. When logs are sold, {{in order to determine the}} basis for a sale price in a standard way, the logs are [...] "scaled" [...] which means they are measured, identified as to species, and deductions for defects assigned to produce a net volume of merchantable wood. There are several different scales or rules that are used to determine the volume of wood. Scribner Decimal C rule is based on diagrams of circles that show the amount of boards that will be utilized from diameters of logs. Cubic rule, often called Metric in Canada, determines the cubic volume of the log material. The logs are recorded as gross scale (actual log measurements, length and diameter) and <b>net</b> <b>scale</b> (volume after deductions for defects are taken out). This occupation is usually performed by a third party organization qualified to [...] "scale" [...] government timber. Since internal defects are determined by external indications, scaling is not an exact science and is subject to interpretation of log scaling rules. The log scaler is subject to random [...] "check scales" [...] in which another scaler rescales exactly the same logs and the results are compared. The log scaler must be within + or - 1% of the gross scale and + or - 2% of the <b>net</b> <b>scale</b> to keep their certification to scale. The scale is used for payment, quality control and inventory purposes.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of mass and normalized elution time (NET) of a peptide identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurements {{can serve as}} a unique signature for that peptide. However, the specificity of an LC-MS measurement depends upon the complexity of the proteome (i. e., the number of possible peptides) and the accuracy of the LC-MS measurements. In this work, theoretical tryptic digests of all predicted proteins from the genomes of three organisms of varying complexity were evaluated for specificity. Accuracy of the LC-MS measurement of mass-NET pairs (on a 0 to 1. 0 <b>NET</b> <b>scale)</b> was described by bivariate normal sampling distributions centered on the peptide signatures. Measurement accuracy (i. e., mass and NET standard deviations of ± 0. 1, 1, 5, and 10 ppm, and ± 0. 01 and 0. 05, respectively) was varied to evaluate improvements in process quality. The spatially localized confidence score, a conditional probability of peptide uniqueness, formed the basis for the peptide identification. Application of this approach to organisms with comparatively small proteomes, such as Deinococcus radiodurans, shows that modest mass and elution time accuracies are generally adequate for confidently identifying most peptides. For more complex proteomes, more accurate measurements are required. However, the study suggests that the majority of proteins for even the human proteome should be identifiable with reasonable confidence by using LC-MS measurements with mass accuracies within ± 1 ppm and high efficiency separations having elution time measurements within ± 0. 01 NET...|$|E

Sixteen boys (9. 7 ± 0. 5 years) had {{to perform a}} 30 -min match in four different conditions, where court-size and/or <b>net</b> height were <b>scaled</b> by using a scaling ratio based on the differences in temporal demands between {{the children and the}} adult game. These 30 -min matches were analysed using Tennis Analyst (FairPlay Ltd., Jindalee, QLD, Australia) software to determine typical tennis match performance characteristics. Children hit more winners, more forced errors, played more volleys, struck more shots from a comfortable height and played in a more forward court position when the <b>net</b> was <b>scaled.</b> Scaling both the court and net lead to a faster children’s game, more closely approximating what is typical of the adult game. The differences between the typical tennis performance variables recorded suggested that <b>scaling</b> the <b>net</b> led to a more aggressive way of playing. Further, children enjoyed playing on the standard court–scaled net condition more than standard adult conditions. It is suggested that optimising the <b>scaling</b> of <b>net</b> height may be as critical as other task constraints, such as racquet length or court-size, as it leads to a more engaging learning environment for experienced children...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Most machine {{learning}} algorithms are sensitive to class imbalances of the training data and tend to behave inaccurately on classes represented by only a few examples. The case of neural nets applied to speech recognition is no exception, but this situation is unusual {{in the sense that}} the neural nets here act as posterior probability estimators and not as classifiers. Most remedies designed to handle the class imbalance problem in classification invalidate the proof that justifies the use of neural nets as posterior probability models. In this paper we examine one of these, the training scheme called probabilistic sampling, and show that it is fortunately still applicable. First, we argue that theoretically it makes the <b>net</b> estimate <b>scaled</b> class-conditionals instead of class posteriors, but for the hidden Markov model speech recognition framework it causes no problems, and in fact fits it even better. Second, we will carry out experiments to show the feasibility of this training scheme. In the experiments we create and examine a transition between the conventional and the class-based sampling, knowing that in practice the conditions of the mathematical proofs are unrealistic. The results show that the optimal performance can indeed be attained somewhere in between, and is slightly better than the scores obtained in the traditional way. ...|$|R

Z. noltei seasonal growth and leaf morphometry followed a unimodal pattern with a peak in late summer and a minimum in winter; the interannual biomass assessment showed a steadiness at spatial and temporal <b>scales.</b> <b>Net</b> primary production simulated by the mathematical model resulted lower than that obtained by the leaf-marking and biomass method.

The ten innovators presented here are as follows: Cayuga Sustainable Hospitality, which has developed a sustainable management platform, starting in Costa Rica; Chic 2 ̆ 6 Basic, which has developed hostels in Spain that feature hip design and unusual amenities; Jet Blue, which has adapted the <b>net</b> promoter <b>scale,</b> a customer measure, to its employees; Jumeirah Essex House, which hired a curator to work with the New York arts community to create an Artist in Residence program; The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, which has built an upgraded training program using its core company values; Runtriz, which has used a wifi-enabled touch screen application to allow guests to efficiently acquire upscale hotel services, Boston’s Seaport Hotel, which has parlayed its harbor side location into a full-blown sustainability program; Thayer Lodging, which has implemented Pure Air guest rooms and meeting rooms, not only for guest comfort but for improved meeting results; Trip Television, which has wedded internet video technology with guest-focused information applications; and Xsense Experiential Design Consulting, which helps improve new properties by helping developers connect with the culture and history of their site...|$|R
40|$|We study weak amenability for locally compact quantum {{groups in}} the sense of Kustermans and Vaes. In particular, we focus on non-discrete examples. We prove that a co{{amenable}} quantum group is weakly amenable if there exists a <b>net</b> of positive, <b>scaling</b> invariant elements in the Fourier algebra A(G) whose representing multipliers form an approximate identity in C_ 0 (G) that is bounded in the M_ 0 A(G) norm; the bound being an upper estimate for the associated Cowling-Haagerup constant. As an application, we find the appropriate approximation properties of the extended quantum SU(1, 1) group and its dual. That is, we prove that it is weakly amenable and coamenable. Furthermore, it has the Haagerup property in the quantum group sense, introduced by Daws, Fima, Skalski and White. Comment: Essential improvements thanks to the referee's report. To appear in Comm. Math. Phy...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} new open-framework silicogermanate SU- 61 {{containing}} 26 -ring channels {{with a low}} framework density. It {{can be seen as}} a crystalline analogue to the mesoporous silica MCM- 41. The structure is built from the assembly of (Ge,Si) 10 (O,OH) 28 clusters. It is the first time that silicon has been successfully introduced in the Ge 10 cluster in significant amounts (approximately 21 % of the tetrahedral sites). Five- and six-coordinated Ge 10 clusters have previously been observed in other germanate compounds leading to either dense or open structures. In SU- 61, the seven-coordinated clusters fall onto yet another underlying net, the osf net. SU- 61, along with other Ge 10 based frameworks, shows the versatility of the germanate system to adopt defined topologies playing on the connectivity of the clusters following the principles of <b>net</b> decoration and <b>scale</b> chemistry...|$|R
