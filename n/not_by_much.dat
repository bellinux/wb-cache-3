5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much),</b> and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows a contrast to that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Bruckner's symphonies are scored for {{a fairly}} {{standard}} orchestra of woodwinds in pairs, four horns, {{two or three}} trumpets, three trombones, tuba (from the second version of the Fourth), timpani and strings. The later symphonies increase this complement, but <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> Notable {{is the use of}} Wagner tubas in his last three symphonies. Only the Eighth has harp, and percussion besides timpani (though legend has it the Seventh is supposed to have a cymbal crash at the exact moment Wagner died). Bruckner's style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the pipe organ, i.e., alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another.|$|E
25|$|By 1858, {{the turnpike}} had {{basically}} begun to fold, with tolls only being charged at one gate {{for several years}} as most traffic had moved to rails rather than road. That year however, there were some upgrades made to the road, but <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> In 1867, the competitor Camden and Amboy Railroad merged with the United New Jersey Railroad {{to create a new}} company. In December 1871, that company then became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, {{which was one of the}} major railroads at that point. The railroad also took over jurisdiction of the turnpike. In 1899, people from Trenton and nearby Penns Neck approached the railroad to help reconstruct the old turnpike road, but no full proposal ever came forward. By 1903, the 1804 charter had expired, and the roadway was placed under public control, but was still in a derelict condition.|$|E

500|$|The episode's storyline, {{including}} Helen's death, {{was meant}} to be in the first series finale. However, by then, the second episode was not yet written, and series producer Kudos were due to deliver the story to the BBC in one month. As a result, the episode was brought forward to the second slot. Since the first episode began Spooks [...] "with a bang", series creator and writer David Wolstencroft, was under pressure to top the efforts of the first episode with the second, but <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> During the writing stage, he introduced a story arc involving Danny Hunter and his obsession with money and spending, apparently mirroring the writer; the arc was created for the temptations that the officers may have. In the original screenplay, Danny was to spend on his mother.|$|E

[...] This is the net remuneration for a life of 64 years devoted to the most exacting, intellectually arduous of skilled labor, profound scholarship. [...] What Prof. Pattengill's estate might have been had he devoted the intellect, force, persistence and energy that he abundantly demonstrated in his career to those professions or activities whose ideal if flatly the accumulation of wealth makes interesting speculation. ... Prof. Pattengill was much more than senior professor of Greek. [...] He was a classicist and an educator of national reputation. ... Does the spectacle of such a reward as this induce the student deliberately to choose the career of scholar with its dignified penury in these days of great salaries and satisfying dividends? ... Pray what other highly skilled specialists of such elaborate training and rare intellectual gifts are given such niggardly return? [...] The faculty {{of the university of}} Michigan is a little more grievously underpaid than other institutions, but <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much.</b> [...] It is the tendency of the times to overlook the modest needs of the scholar in the rush after ideals that are overtaken by daring." ...|$|E

60|$|Since the Invention (and {{perfecting}} in some measure) of Telescopes, it {{has been}} observ'd by several, that the Sun and Moon neer the Horizon, are disfigur'd (losing that exactly-smooth terminating circular limb, which they are observ'd to have when situated neerer the Zenith) and are bounded with an edge every way (especially upon {{the right and left}} sides) ragged and indented like a Saw: which inequality of their limbs, I have further observ'd, not to remain always the same, but to be continually chang'd by a kind of fluctuating motion, not unlike that of the waves of the Sea, so as that part of the limb, which was but even now nick'd or indented in, is now protuberant, and will presently be sinking again; neither is this all but the whole body of the Luminaries, do in the Telescope, seem to be depress'd and slatted, the upper, and more especially the under side appearing neerer to the middle then really they are, and the right and left appearing more remote: whence the whole Area seems to be terminated by a kind of Oval. It is further observ'd, that the body, for the most part, appears red, or of some colour approaching neer unto it, as some kind of yellow; and this I have always mark'd, that the more the limb is slatted or ovalled, the more red does the body appear, though not always the contrary. It is further observable, that both fix'd Stars and Planets, the neerer they appear to the Horizon, the more red and dull they look, and the more they are observ'd to twinkle; in so much, that I have seen the Dog-starr to vibrate so strong and bright a radiation of light, as almost to dazle my eyes, and presently, almost to disappear. It is also observable, that those bright scintillations neer the Horizon, are <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>much</b> so quick and sudden in their consecutions of one another, as the nimbler twinklings of Stars neerer the Zenith. This is also notable, that the Starrs neer the Horizon, are twinkled with several colours; so as sometimes to appear red, sometimes more yellow, and sometimes blue, and this when the Starr is a pretty way elevated above the Horizon. I have further, very often seen some of the small Starrs of the fifth or sixth magnitude, at certain times to disappear for a small moment of time, and again appear more conspicuous, and with a greater luster. I have several times, with my naked eye, seen many smaller Starrs, such as may be call'd of the seventh or eighth magnitude to appear for a short space, and then vanish, which, by directing a small Telescope towards that part they appear'd and disappear'd in; I could presently find to be indeed small Starrs so situate, as I had seen them with my naked eye, and to appear twinkling like the ordinary visible Stars; nay, in examining some very notable parts of the Heaven, with a three foot Tube, me thought I now and then, in several parts of the constellation, could perceive little twinklings of Starrs, making a very short kind of apparition, and presently vanishing, but noting diligently the places where they thus seem'd to play at boe-peep, I made use of a very good twelve foot Tube, and with that it was not uneasie to see those, and several other degrees of smaller Starrs, and some smaller yet, that seem'd again to appear and disappear, and these also by giving the same Object-glass a much bigger aperture, I could plainly and constantly see appear in their former places; so that I have observ'd some twelve several magnitudes of Starrs less then those of the six magnitudes commonly recounted in the Globes.|$|E
