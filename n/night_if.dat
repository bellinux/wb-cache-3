5|$|The fight {{continued}} into the evening, and after dark the 1st Battalion disengaged and withdrew through the 2nd Battalion immediately behind it.

5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at <b>night.</b> <b>If</b> a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The bee-eaters are diurnal (active by day), {{although}} a few species may migrate during the <b>night</b> <b>if</b> the terrain en route is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often so close that they touch (an individual distance of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.|$|E

5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} <b>night?</b> <b>If</b> there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E

25|$|People {{with normal}} {{circadian}} systems can generally fall asleep quickly at <b>night</b> <b>if</b> they slept too little the night before.

Sleep deprivation does not reset the circadian clock of DSPD patients, as it does with normal people.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the Japanese had a {{naval base}} at Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands and several bases in Hokkaido. The Sea of Japan was patrolled by the Imperial Japanese Navy day and <b>night.</b> <b>If</b> {{there was any}} Soviet Navy {{presence}} on those waters, the Japanese would {{have been aware of}} it. Since Japan and the Soviet Union were neutral up until the Soviets' declaration of war on Japan in August 1945, the Port of Vladivostok and other seaports in the Soviet Union were constantly watched by Japanese observers based in their own held territories in Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} CSP {{is the ability}} to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5hours of thermal storage. With current technology, storage of heat is much cheaper and more efficient than storage of electricity. In this way, the CSP plant can produce electricity day and <b>night.</b> <b>If</b> the CSP site has predictable solar radiation, then the CSP plant becomes a reliable power plant. Reliability can further be improved by installing a back-up combustion system. The back-up system can use most of the CSP plant, which decreases the cost of the back-up system.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Jawbone {{announced}} the UP24 and a software update. With similar dimensions to the UP, UP24 features {{the ability to}} sync wirelessly via Bluetooth to the updated app. UP24 has as a 7-day battery life (depending on use) and the previous 3.5mm connector {{was replaced by a}} 2.5mm connector. The software provided more real-time information to help motivate users. The app also suggests goals based on user's habits. Live notifications are provided on the UP24 so users will get push notifications when they get close to their goals. A new activity log gives a snapshot of a user's day and when the UP24 last synced. The 3.0 app also will automatically analyze sleep data from the previous <b>night</b> <b>if</b> users forget to press the button for sleep mode, and lets users edit sleep/wake times.|$|E

25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} either excessive cortisol-like medication such as prednisone or a tumor that either produces or results {{in the production of}} excessive cortisol by the adrenal glands. Cases due to a pituitary adenoma are known as Cushing's disease. It is the second most common cause of Cushing's syndrome after medication. A number of other tumors may also cause Cushing's. Some of these are associated with inherited disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Carney complex. Diagnosis requires a number of steps. The first step is to check the medications a person takes. The second step is to measure levels of cortisol in the urine, saliva or in the blood after taking dexamethasone. If this test is abnormal, the cortisol may be measured late at <b>night.</b> <b>If</b> the cortisol remains high, a blood test for ACTH may be done to determine if the pituitary is involved.|$|E
25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at <b>night.</b> <b>If</b> a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E
25|$|Another campus {{focal point}} is the main plaza, around {{which can be found}} Lory Student Center and Morgan Library, as well as several {{academic}} buildings. The Lory Student Center, named for former CSU president Charles Lory, houses Student Media, numerous organization offices, Student Government, and spaces to eat, drink and study. The Morgan Library was originally constructed in 1965 and named for former CSU president William E. Morgan. Following the flood of '97, this facility went through an extensive improvement project that included an addition to the main building and a renovation of the existing structure, with works completed in 1998. Current holdings include more than 2 million books, bound journals, and government documents. Morgan Library just finished a 13,000 square-foot addition called the Study Cube that will seat 80 additional patrons and is designed for 24-hour access. With a university issued ID card, students and staff will be able to access the Cube after hours. To accommodate, the Loan and Reserve desk will check out laptops and other accessories over <b>night</b> <b>if</b> checked out less than six hours prior to closing.|$|E

25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an extra day of rest due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, {{was supposed to take}} the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout enabled him to get a third day of rest and thus be ready to go for the decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that <b>night</b> <b>if</b> he was needed.|$|E
25|$|Operation Thao La {{was planned}} to take {{advantage}} of improved flying weather during the nascent dry season in Laos. Its objective was Binh Tram 37, 30 kilometers east of Communist-held Thateng, Laos. U.S. Air Force (USAF) tactical air power was arranged, with 18 daily sorties allotted for the first two days, then 24 sorties daily for a fortnight. The dark hours would be covered by two gunship sorties per <b>night.</b> <b>If</b> Thao La was successful in smashing Binh Tram 37, it would both restrict supplies to Communist forces in South Vietnam and starve the Communists off the Bolaven Plateau. Like the preceding Operation Sayasila, Operation Thao La was aimed at regaining control of the Plateau for the Royal Lao Government (RLG). The towns of Thateng and Ban Phone were to be captured from the PAVN in a three column multi-battalion offensive. As a preliminary move, the gains of Operation Sayasila needed to be protected. On 8 November, Bataillon Infanterie 9 (BI 9) joined Bataillon Volontaire 46 (BV 46) and Bataillon Volontaire 48 (BV 48) in garrisoning Paksong. Four battalions from MR 3 returned to their base at Savannakhet.|$|E
