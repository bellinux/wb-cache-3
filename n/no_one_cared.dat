For {{the first time the}} band also upgraded to a full-fledged tour bus and added backup musicians and singers. Longtime friend, Keith [...] "Tree" [...] Barry was added to play horns and backup singers Kristen Vigard and Vicki Calhoun (who appeared in the video for [...] "Knock Me Down") also joined the tour.

The stage-divers started rushing the stage from the moment the band walked on. Once on stage, it was an issue of luck and chutzpah." [...] Todd Caudle of the Colorado Springs newspaper The Gazette said the Chili Peppers' performance at the Colorado Indoor Sports Complex was [...] "the kind of place where kids could be kids, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cared</b> if soft drinks stuck to the floor and the rafters shook with a stunning barrage of decibels.
