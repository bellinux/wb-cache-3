40|$|The {{management}} and specification of access control rules that enforce a given {{policy is a}} non-trivial, complex, and time consuming task. In this paper we aim at simplifying this task both at specification and verification levels. For that, we propose a formal model of <b>Net</b> <b>filter,</b> a firewall system integrated in the Linux kernel. We define an abstraction of the concepts of chains, rules, and packets existent in <b>Net</b> <b>filter</b> configurations, and give a semantics that mimics packet filtering and address translation. We then introduce a simple but powerful language that permits to specify firewall configurations that are unaffected by the relative ordering of rules, {{and that does not}} depend on the underlying <b>Net</b> <b>filter</b> chains. We give a semantics for this language and show that it can be translated into our <b>Net</b> <b>filter</b> abstraction. We then present Mignis, a publicly available tool that translates abstract firewall specifications into real <b>Net</b> <b>filter</b> configurations.

The acoustic echo channel is physically formed by a non-linear distortion system concatenated with a linear faded echo path. Motivated by this physical reality, a cascaded neural <b>net</b> <b>filter</b> is used as the filter structure in a non-linear AEC. It consists of a feedforward neural <b>net</b> <b>filter,</b> in series with a linear FIR filter. Different adaptive algorithms are used to estimate the linear and non-linear parts of the filter.

Sieves present some advantages in relation to conventional membranes such as high homogeneity in the pore sizes, smooth surfaces, straight-through pores, etc. In this paper we compare the selectivity in the exclusion of particles by size of sieves with circular and slit pores with the same porosity. The selectivity was investigated by filtering a mixture of rutin in water in a cross-flow filtration system. The particle-size distribution of the rutin solution was measured before and after microfiltration. The results showed a high efficiency in the size exclusion of particles for microsieves with circular pores.

40|$|The Hough {{transform}} is {{a useful}} technique in the detection of straight lines and curves in an image. Due to the mathematical similarity of the Hough transform and the forward Radon transform, the Hough transform can be computed using the Radon transform which, in turn, can be evaluated using the central slice theorem. This involves a two-dimensional Fourier transform, an x-y to r-¿ mapping and a ID Fourier transform. This can be implemented in specialized hardware {{to take advantage of}} the computational savings of the fast Fourier transform. In this paper, we outline a fast and efficient method for the computation of the Hough transform using Fourier methods. The maxima points generated in the Radon space, corresponding to the parametrisation of straight lines, can be enhanced with a post transform convolutional filter. This can be applied as a ID filtering operation on the resampled data whilst in the Fourier space, so further speeding the computation. Additionally, any edge enhancement or smoothing operations on the input function can be combined into the filter and applied as a <b>net</b> <b>filter</b> function...|$|E

40|$|Managing radio {{spectrum}} resources {{is a crucial}} issue. The frequency assignment problem (FAP) basically aims to allocate, in an efficient manner, limited number of frequencies to communication links. Geographically close links, however, cause interference, which complicates the assignment, imposing frequency separation constraints. The FAP {{is closely related to}} the graph-coloring problem and it is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the randomization into greedy and fast heuristics. As far as being implemented, the proposed algorithms are very straight forward and are without system parameters that need tuned. The proposed algorithms significantly improve, quickly and effectively, the solutions obtained by greedy algorithms {{in terms of the number}} of assigned frequencies and the range. The enhanced versions of proposed algorithms perform close to the lower bounds while running for a reasonable duration. Another novelty of our study is its consideration of the <b>net</b> <b>filter</b> discrimination effects in the communication model. Performance analysis is done by synthetic and measured data, where the measurement data includes the effect of the real 3 -dimensional (3 D) geographical features in the Daejeon region in Korea.

40|$|Biomimetic nanopores {{based on}} membrane-spanning single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have been designed}} to include selectivity filters based on combinations of anionic and cationic groups mimicking those present in bacterial porins and in voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. The ion permeation and selectivity properties of these nanopores when embedded in a phospholipid bilayer have been explored by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy profile calculations. The interactions of the nanopores with sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ions have been explored {{as a function of the}} number of anionic and cationic groups within the selectivity filter. Unbiased molecular dynamics simulations show that the overall selectivity is largely determined by the net charge of the filter. Analysis of distribution functions reveals considerable structuring of the distribution of ions and water within the nanopores. The distributions of ions along the pore axis reveal local selectivity for cations around filter, even in those nanopores (C 0) where the <b>net</b> <b>filter</b> charge is zero. Single ion free energy profiles also reveal clear evidence for cation selectivity, even in the C 0 nanopores. Detailed analysis of the interactions of the C 0 nanopore with Ca 2 + ions reveals that local interactions with the anionic (carboxylate) groups of the selectivity filter lead to (partial) replacement of solvating water as the ion passes through the pore. These studies suggest that a computational biomimetic approach can be used to evaluate our understanding of the design principles of nanopores and channels...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-classic approach to narrow field astrometry {{that offers a}} significant improvement over conventional techniques due to enhanced reduction of atmospheric image motion. The method is based on two key elements: apodization of the entrance pupil and the enhanced virtual symmetry of reference stars. Symmetrization is implemented by setting special weights to each reference star. Thus a reference field itself forms a virtual <b>net</b> <b>filter</b> that effectively attenuates the image motion spectrum. Atmospheric positional error was found to follow a power dependency R^K μ / 2 D^-K/ 2 + 1 / 3 on angular field size R and aperture D; here K is some optional even integer 2 <=K<=sqrt 8 N+ 1 - 1 limited by a number N of reference stars, and μ <= 1 is a term dependent on K and the magnitude and sky star distribution in the field. As compared to conventional techniques for which K= 2, the improvement in accuracy increases by some orders. Limitations to astrometric performance of monopupil large ground-based telescopes are estimated. The total atmospheric and photon noise for at a 10 m telescope at good 0. 4 " seeing was found to be, depending on sky star density, 10 to 60 microarcsec per 10 min exposure in R band. For a 100 m telescope and FWHM= 0. 1 " (low-order adaptive optics corrections) the potential accuracy is 0. 2 to 2 microarcsec. Comment: 18 pages, 17 figure...|$|E

Among the 14 penaeids, P. semisulcatus, M. ensis and M. palmensis {{were found to be}} the dominant species within each genus. There are seven existing fishing gears for shrimping in the Batan Bay and Tigbauan-Guimbal waters: fish corrals, lift <b>net,</b> <b>filter</b> net, gill net, skimming net, baby trawler and commercial trawler. In general, female penaeids are larger than males. The largest P. monodon female measured was 81 mm in carapace length with 23 g in body weight. The largest male measuring 59 mm in carapace length with 119 g of body weight was caught in Batan Bay. Judging from spermatozoa occurrence on both sexes of P. monodon, the biological minimum size for male is 37 mm in carapace length and 49 mm for female. A total of 133 Penaeus postlarvae obtained from the offshore were identified by comparison with those reared in the laboratory. The postlarvae of P. japonicus-latisulcatus complex were quite dominant (60. 2 %), followed by P. semisulcatus (18. 0 %), and P. merguiensis-indicus complex (17. 3 %). The number of P. monodon postlarvae was relatively small (4. 5 %). The modal carapace length of P. monodon postlarvae from the offshore was 1. 3 mm with three or four dorsal and no ventral spines on the rostrum, while P. monodon fry from the shoreline had 2. 3 mm with five or six dorsal and one or two ventral spines...|$|E
