40|$|Abstract. <b>Natural</b> <b>disasters</b> are harmful events {{resulting}} from natural {{processes of the}} Earth. Examples of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> include tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, droughts, and other geologic pro-cesses. If they affect populated areas, <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> can cause eco-nomic damage, injuries, or even losses of lives. It is thus desirable that <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> be detected {{as early as possible}} and potentially affected persons be notified via emergency alerts. By their pure nature, <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> are global phenomena that people refer to by different names, for example, the 2014 typhoon Rammasun 1 is known as typhoon Glenda in the Philippines. In this paper, we present our ongoing early-stage research on a realtime Wikipedia-based monitoring system for the de-tection of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> around the globe. The long-term objective is to make data about <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> detected by this system available through public alerts following the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) ...|$|R

30|$|Do <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> have {{effects on}} {{economic}} growth? Much {{has been published}} in the field of growth theories as well as about the impacts of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters.</b> However, some studies have analyzed the effects of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> on economic growth. <b>Natural</b> <b>disasters</b> receive little attention in growth literature.

Given this scenario, this article reviews the existing literature related to growth theories that contributes towards explaining the causal relationship between <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> and economic growth and identifies both positive and negative consequences of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> on economic growth through scientific empirical investigation.|$|R
