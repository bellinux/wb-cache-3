5|$|In 2007, {{the film}} was {{released}} by Thanhouser Company Film Preservation on a three-disc DVD set along with eleven other surviving Thanhouser films. The surviving print {{was obtained from the}} British Film Institute and featured a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher. According to Silent Era, the archive holds the 35mm nitrate positive, the more stable 35mm safety <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> a 35mm reference positive.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{people make}} {{a wide range}} of uses of insects, both {{practical}} and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often <b>negative,</b> <b>and</b> extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of insecticides has failed to exterminate any insect pest, but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.|$|E
5|$|Some Iranian {{newspapers}} avoided {{mentioning the}} character, presumably to avoid offending Iran's clerical rulers. On March 2009, Javad Shamaqdari, cultural adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, demanded an apology from {{a delegation of}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences actors and producers visiting Iran for what he characterized as <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> unfair portrayals of the Islamic republic in The Wrestler and other Hollywood films.|$|E

5|$|Tacitus' {{narrative}} emphasizes {{both political}} and psychological motivation. The characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly <b>negative,</b> <b>and</b> gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point {{with the death of}} his son Drusus in 23 AD.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect {{in the moment of}} mystic illumination. He {{goes on to say that}} the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were {{completed}} by seven special effects studios, including Double <b>Negative</b> <b>and</b> Luma Pictures. Blur Studio {{was the lead}} studio behind the film's prologue sequence taking place 5,000 years {{before the start of}} the film, on the Dark Elves homeworld of Svartalfheim. The sequence consisted mostly of computer graphics with live-action shots interwoven throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.|$|E

5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those cases was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were <b>negative,</b> <b>and</b> the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} nation's {{official}} censors ordered scenes {{cut from the}} film. According to Xinhua, the state news agency of the People's Republic of China, ten minutes of footage containing Chow Yun-fat's portrayal of Singaporean pirate Sao Feng were trimmed from versions of the film which may be shown in China. Chow is onscreen for twenty minutes in the uncensored theatrical release of the film. No official reason for the censorship was given, but unofficial sources within China have indicated that the character gave a <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> stereotypical portrayal of Chinese people.|$|E

5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{days after}} his OHL return, Hodgson {{suffered}} another injury, breaking a toe on his right foot while blocking a shot against the Sudbury Wolves. Initial X-rays came up <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> he continued playing for nine more games before a second X-ray revealed a hairline fracture {{in one of his}} right metatarsal bones. Missing the Battalion's final five regular season games, he finished the campaign with eight goals and 20 points over 13 contests. Despite missing the majority of the season, he was voted as the smartest player in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year in the OHL coaches poll.|$|E
5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and engine breakdowns were recurring and appeared across the entire class. These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> the box-office was poor. In 1985, she {{presented}} a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E
5|$|In July 1892, Curtis sent a {{photograph}} of the Lotto painting to Leech, who consulted with Barber and replied that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward. So that Barber could depict Columbus in profile, Curtis arranged for a little-known Washington, D.C. sculptor, Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, to create a bust based on the painting at the Company's expense; when complete it was forwarded to Barber in Philadelphia. Barber prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15, and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston (Leech was on vacation), who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago. Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition, and to the press. The artistic reaction was <b>negative,</b> <b>and</b> the newspapers suggested that the sketches resembled more a long-haired professor than the celebrated mariner. This controversy, coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus, caused Ellsworth to refuse permission for his painting to be used.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, where it had been beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally <b>negative,</b> <b>and</b> additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a criminal record. The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also {{a major factor in the}} pre-recording of series 2.|$|E

5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily <b>negative</b> <b>and,</b> thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Kesler {{played his}} {{first game of the}} season on February 15 against the Dallas Stars. The game was also witness to a piece of Canucks history as Henrik Sedin {{recorded}} two assists to pass Markus Naslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer, with 757 points. After recording the record setting point, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes the play stopped, and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a commercial break, the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Naslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. As for Kesler, he registered an assist and blocked three shots in over 17 minutes of ice time of the 4–3 loss. After experiencing some discomfort in his right foot, Kesler had X-rays taken. The X-rays were <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> he continued to play.|$|E
