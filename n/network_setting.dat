50|$|Blockland is a {{non-linear}} {{game with}} no set goals, giving players {{the freedom to}} design and construct elaborate structures. Styled as a tiny minifigure, players build inside of the virtual world using bricks reminiscent of toy blocks. These structures can be built in either a single-player or multiplayer (either online or through a local area <b>network)</b> <b>setting.</b> Any player who buys the game is able to host a standard server, able to hold up to 100 players, however that depends on internet connectivity. There {{have been a few}} instances of servers with over 100 players.Using tools included in the game, a player can change the properties of individual bricks, having the ability to adjust their lighting, particle emitters, specularity, color, and spawned items. Blockland also features destructible vehicles, player controlled NPCs, a selection of weapons, saving and loading of player creations, semi-automated construction through macros, and a mini-game system. The minigame system enables users to create configurable and self-contained gameplay modes. These can range from a simple deathmatch to a custom-modded zombie survival game. Implemented in Blockland is a trigger and event-based system to create basic interactive objects. Players can apply input and output operators to bricks to accomplish different things in-game such as operable light switches, missile launchers, collapsing brick structures, or arcade-like games such as Pong or Breakout. In version 11, a new physics feature was included in an attempt to bring a more realistic aspect to the game. This can be seen when a brick structure is blown up using weapons or events. The physics quality can be lowered to work smoother on slower machines or can be turned off entirely.|$|E

Their localization {{capability is}} challenged by wireless propagation conditions, {{which can be}} mitigated by employing diversity techniques. We introduce subset diversity (SSD) radars that exploit diverse spatial and temporal propagation conditions for the selected sensors measurements. A framework for analysis and design of SSD sensor radars is developed, jointly considering (i) <b>network</b> <b>setting,</b> (ii) propagation environment, (iii) sensor measurements, and (iv) localization techniques. As a case study, we consider ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) sensor radars with subset diversity in a typical indoor environment.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} stochastic processing networks. Assume that the networks satisfy a complete resource pooling condition. We prove that each maximum pressure policy asymptotically minimizes the workload process in a stochastic processing net-work in heavy traffic. When {{the objective is to}} minimize a linear holding cost, for any ε> 0, we identify a set of maximum pressure policies and prove that they are asymp-totically ε-optimal. A key to the optimality proof is to prove a state space collapse result and a heavy traffic limit theorem for the network processes under a maximum pressure policy. We extend a framework of Bramson (1998) and Williams (1998 b) from the multiclass queueing <b>network</b> <b>setting</b> to the stochastic processing <b>network</b> <b>setting</b> to prove the state space collapse result and the heavy traffic limit theorem. The extension can be adapted to other studies of stochastic processing networks...|$|E

40|$|Low cost {{devices such}} as RFIDs, sensor network nodes, and smartcards are crucial for {{building}} the next generation pervasive and ubiquitous networks. The inherent power and footprint limitations of such networks, prevent us from employing standard cryptographic techniques for authentication which were originally designed to secure high end systems with abundant power. Furthermore, the sharp increase in the number, diversity and strength of physical attacks which directly target the implementation may have devastating consequences in a <b>network</b> <b>setting</b> creating a single point of failure. A compromised node may leak a master key, or may give the attacker an opportunity for injecting faulty messages. In this paper we present a lightweight challenge response authentication scheme based on noisy physical unclonable functions (PUF) that allows for extremely efficient implementations. Furthermore, the inherent properties of PUFs provide cryptographically strong tamper resilience. In a <b>network</b> <b>setting</b> this means that a tampered device will no longer authenticate {{and in a sense}} will be isolated from the network. ...|$|E
