5|$|Neurolinguistics {{research}} investigates several topics, including where {{language information}} is processed, how language processing unfolds over time, how brain structures {{are related to}} language acquisition and learning, and how <b>neurophysiology</b> can contribute to speech and language pathology.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{assessing}} nerve conduction {{of electrical}} impulses can exclude other causes of acute muscle weakness, {{as well as}} distinguish {{the different types of}} Guillain–Barré syndrome. Needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies may be performed. In the first two weeks, these investigations may not show any abnormality. <b>Neurophysiology</b> studies are not required for the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying <b>neurophysiology.</b> The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Peter Milner, in {{a review}} in the Canadian Journal of Psychology, noted the book was short on {{concrete}} details on implementing the TOTE strategy. He also critically viewed the book as {{not being able to}} tie its model to details from <b>neurophysiology</b> at a molecular level. Per him, the book covered only the brain at the gross level of lesion studies, showing that some of its regions could possibly implement some TOTE strategies, without giving a reader an indication as to how the region could implement the strategy.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and <b>neurophysiology</b> are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Session {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Lina Stern, Ivan Beritashvili, and Leon Orbeli. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions. In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison. The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and <b>neurophysiology</b> were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel. The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come. Pseudo-science took control.|$|E
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development {{of the nervous system}}, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of <b>Neurophysiology</b> and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938. Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the field}} of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are {{concerned}} with the relations between mental and physical states and processes: Sensory <b>neurophysiology</b> investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation. Cognitive neuroscience studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes. Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain. Lastly, evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages. Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the gene-based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in <b>neurophysiology.</b>|$|E

25|$|Deficiency or {{excess of}} {{essential}} minerals (e.g. iron, zinc, copper, and magnesium) can disrupt brain development and <b>neurophysiology</b> to affect behavior. Furthermore, minerals have {{been implicated in}} the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's dementia.|$|E
25|$|Radulovacki {{graduated}} from the University of Belgrade School of Medicine in 1959. He decided to pursue an academic career in basic sciences {{and went on to}} obtain a PhD in <b>Neurophysiology.</b> The topic of his PhD thesis was: ”Sleep in Split-Brain Cats,” partly done at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to the University of Chicago in 1928 where {{he worked in the}} Department of Physiology until 1952. For two years he was professor of <b>neurophysiology</b> and physiology in the College of Medicine, at the University of Illinois. During the Second World War he was seconded to do classified research at the Edgewood Arsenal.|$|E
25|$|A further {{subdivision}} is {{the diagnostic}} versus therapeutic specialties. While the diagnostic process {{is of great}} importance in all specialties, some specialists perform mainly or only diagnostic examinations, such as pathology, clinical <b>neurophysiology,</b> and radiology. This line is becoming somewhat blurred with interventional radiology, an evolving field that uses image expertise to perform minimally invasive procedures.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} various {{scientific}} research in evolutionary biology, comparative neuroanatomy and <b>neurophysiology,</b> have explained the phylogeny of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species. From {{the point of}} view of biological evolution, the pineal gland represents a kind of atrophied photoreceptor. In the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles, it is linked to a light-sensing organ, known as the parietal eye, which is also called the pineal eye or third eye.|$|E
25|$|In 1667 Willis {{published}} Pathologicae cerebri, et nervosi generis specimen, {{an important}} {{work on the}} pathology and <b>neurophysiology</b> of the brain. In it he developed a new theory of the cause of epilepsy and other convulsive diseases, {{and contributed to the}} development of psychiatry. In 1672 he published the earliest English work on medical psychology, Two Discourses concerning the Soul of Brutes, which is that of the Vital and Sensitive of Man.|$|E
25|$|Clinical <b>neurophysiology</b> is {{concerned}} with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests {{can be divided into}} recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.|$|E
25|$|The Chronobiology Laboratory {{studies the}} {{biological}} rhythms of insects. It {{was established in}} 1987, when researcher-in-charge Mirian David Marques finished her internship in chronobiology at the University of Minnesota. Research methods used in the laboratory include automated (or visual) records of insect behavior. When rhythms are detected the neuroanatomy and <b>neurophysiology</b> of specimens are studied, searching for rhythm-generating centers using histology, histochemistry and molecular biology. Groups studied include springtails (Isotomidae), mosquitoes (Culicidae), crickets (Phalangopsinae), ants (Formicidae) and bees (Apidae).|$|E
25|$|Ovshinsky {{opened the}} {{scientific}} field of amorphous and disordered {{materials in the}} course of his research in the 1940s and 50s in <b>neurophysiology,</b> neural disease, the nature of intelligence in mammals and machines, and cybernetics. Amorphous silicon semiconductors have become the basis of many technologies and industries. Ovshinsky is also distinguished in being self-taught, without formal college or graduate training. Throughout his life, his love for science and his social convictions were the primary engines for his inventive work.|$|E
25|$|It is popularly {{assumed that}} emotion {{disrupts}} cognition. However, <b>neurophysiology</b> and Ommaya's TBI research emphasize its fundamental inseparability. Ommaya defined four {{steps in the}} evolution of consciousness. 1) reflex and avoidance reactions; 2) sensory inputs merged with multisensory neurons in the mesencephalon; 3) interactions formed between sensory and limbic systems and memory; and 4) reinforcement of thalamic neural centers which relays information between sensory and motor centers. Ommaya discussed how the limbic system and emotion motivates action and focuses attention.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 Sassenrath {{graduated}} from the University of California, Davis with a B.S. in EECS (electrical engineering and computer science). During his studies he became interested in operating systems, parallel processing, programming languages, and <b>neurophysiology.</b> He was a teaching assistant for graduate computer language courses and a research assistant in neuroscience and behavioral biology. His uncle, Dr. Julius Sassenrath, headed the educational psychology department at UC Davis, and his aunt, Dr. Ethel Sassenrath, {{was one of the}} original researchers of THC at the California National Primate Research Center.|$|E
25|$|Ioannis Tsoukalas of Stockholm University has {{hypothesized}} that REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, {{also known as}} animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as {{the last line of}} defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal so that it appears dead. Tsoukalas argues that the <b>neurophysiology</b> and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep; for example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hypocampal theta rhythm, and thermoregulatory changes.|$|E
25|$|Later {{experiments}} by Nicolelis using rhesus monkeys {{succeeded in}} closing the feedback loop and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. With their deeply cleft and furrowed brains, rhesus monkeys {{are considered to}} be better models for human <b>neurophysiology</b> than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden. The monkeys were later shown the robot directly and learned to control it by viewing its movements. The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted handgripping force. In 2011 O'Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with rhesus monkeys. The monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct intracortical stimulation (ICMS) in the arm representation area of the sensory cortex.|$|E
25|$|Neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, psychosurgery, {{anesthesiology}} {{and pain}} medicine, neuropathology, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, clinical <b>neurophysiology,</b> addiction medicine, and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the {{diseases of the}} nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these diseases. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke, and their medical treatment. Psychiatry focuses on affective, behavioral, cognitive, and perceptual disorders. Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain, and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness. Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience. Brain imaging also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.|$|E
25|$|Stuttering {{can also}} have its roots in development. Many {{toddlers}} and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable {{when a child is}} excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by <b>neurophysiology.</b> Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.|$|E
500|$|Cumulative {{effects of}} concussions are poorly understood, with this being even more true in children. The {{severity}} of concussions and their symptoms may worsen with successive injuries, {{even if a}} subsequent injury occurs months or years after an initial one. [...] Symptoms may be more severe and changes in <b>neurophysiology</b> can occur with the third and subsequent concussions. Studies have had conflicting findings on whether athletes have longer recovery times after repeat concussions and whether cumulative effects such as impairment in cognition and memory occur.|$|E
500|$|Findings since 1999 have {{advanced}} TS {{science in the}} areas of genetics, neuroimaging, <b>neurophysiology,</b> and neuropathology. [...] Questions remain regarding how best to classify Tourette syndrome, and how closely Tourette's is related to other movement disorders or psychiatric disorders. Good epidemiologic data is still lacking, and available treatments are not risk free and not always well tolerated. High-profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy, such as deep brain stimulation, and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents.|$|E
500|$|Similar to Gould's {{beliefs about}} adaptionist views and that [...] "females grow nipples as adaptations for suckling, and males grow smaller unused nipples as a {{spandrel}} {{based upon the}} value of single development channels", Elisabeth Lloyd {{suggests that there is}} little evidence to support an adaptionist account of female orgasm. [...] "Lloyd views female orgasm as an ontogenetic leftover; women have orgasms because the urogenital <b>neurophysiology</b> for orgasm is so strongly selected for in males that this developmental blueprint gets expressed in females without affecting fitness" [...] and this is similar to [...] "males hav nipples that serve no fitness-related function," [...] stated Meredith L.
