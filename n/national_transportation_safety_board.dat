50|$|In 2013, ABI {{announced}} {{its opposition to}} the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> proposal to persuade states to lower the blood alcohol limit, citing the fact that lowering the limit is not among the most effective ways to stop drunken drivers.|$|R
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|<b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) and Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft.

25|$|Denver {{was killed}} on October 12, 1997 when his {{experimental}} Long-EZ plane, aircraft registration number N555JD, crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> (NTSB) accident ID is LAX98FA008. Denver was the only occupant of the aircraft. Identification was not possible using dental records; only his fingerprints confirmed that the pilot was Denver.|$|R
50|$|The train {{should have}} been slowing to {{approach}} the curve with a reduced speed limit of 80 mph in its approach and 50 mph within it, but instead, it had accelerated into the curve and was traveling at 106 mph when its engineer applied the emergency brake, and 102 mph when it derailed, according to Robert L. Sumwalt, the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> lead investigator, who cited the onboard event recorder recovered from the wreckage. Investigators are working to determine why the train entered the curve at such a high speed. The windshield of the locomotive may have {{been hit by a}} projectile shortly before the derailment.|$|R
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's improper execution of an instrument approach, combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{same week}} as the {{memorial}} dedication, the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> held hearings related to another fatal incident in the Metro system, one which happened earlier in 2015; the juxtaposition of the two events was noted by some commentators.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error.

25|$|On June 22, 2015, news {{services}} reported that Horner was presumed {{to have died}} when his Short Tucano turboprop aircraft, registration number N206PZ, crashed into the Los Padres National Forest near Ventucopa, California. The following day, his representatives at the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency posted a message on their website stating that Horner, the only person aboard the aircraft, was killed. His attorney confirmed Horner was in the airplane when it took off after fueling at Camarillo Airport. On June 25, the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed Horner's death and ruled the crash an accident. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> accident ID is WPR15FA195. He {{is survived by his}} wife, Sara Elizabeth Horner (née Nelson), and two daughters.|$|R

40|$|Utilizing publically-available {{information}} gathered from government resources, {{a case study}} analysis of runway incursion data endeavored to determine {{the correlation between the}} reported incursions that occurred at American airports between fiscal years 2009 and 2011 and the meteorological conditions, times of day, and presence of an air traffic control tower. With runway incursions long-plaguing the safety of United States aviators, their passengers, and aviation personnel, continued research aimed at refining the body of knowledge underpinning incursions coupled with ongoing prevention efforts aspire to diminish the annual incidence of incursions, increase safety, and save lives. In accordance with this mission, mining the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board’s</b> (NTSB) and <b>National</b> Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) runway incursion databases and analyzing the resulting data with the Pearson correlation indicated a higher likelihood of incursions amid clear weather, during the daylight hours, and at airports with an air traffic control tower...|$|R
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who {{was the only one}} on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E
5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Collisions at sea have {{and continue to}} be one of the most misunderstood phenomena of our modem transportation era. This thesis is a case analysis of the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69) collision. Budding on data from the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> and the U. S. Navy Judge Advocate General Corps' investigations, it attempts to resolve inconsistencies between these governmental sources and interviews from four of the six principal officers involved in the mishap. The findings reveal that numerous causal factors were not sufficiently explored by the investigative bodies. Of greatest significance was the neglect of the EISENHOWER bridge organization, which was in disarray in the moments prior to the collision. This disorganization was the result of a six-month deployment in which specific Officers of the Deck focused their watch routines on the whims of the ship's Navigator. This dependence resulted in a poor decision process, and ultimately the inability to act appropriately in situations requiring prompt action. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Brazilian Air Force Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) and the U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB). The NTSB, {{in accordance with the}} provisions of ICAO Annex 13, participated in the investigation representing the state of manufacture of the Boeing, state of registry and operator of the Embraer, and state of manufacture of the Honeywell avionics equipment installed in both planes.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E
40|$|Human error” {{is often}} implicated as a causal factor in {{accident}} investigation yet {{very little is}} done to understand ‘why’ such errors occur in the first place. This paper uses the principles of Schema Theory and the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) to further explore {{the circumstances surrounding the}} fatal Tesla crash in May 2016 in which the driver was fatally injured using team-PCM representations. The preliminary National Highway Traffic Safety Administration accident investigation concluded that the driver of the Tesla Model S was at fault. However, the analysis presented in this paper argues that rather than “driver error”, the underlying cause of this tragic incident could be in fact more akin to a “designer error” implicating the design of the Autopilot feature itself. This is in line with the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Boards</b> more recent announcement that suggests systems design {{may have contributed to the}} crash. It would therefore appear that the drivers expectation of system functionality may not have matched the real life capabilities of the system. This is likely to be a product of inappropriate mental models relating to system function...|$|R

2500|$|On March 31, 2017 the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> and <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{released}} Accident Brief [...] which {{concluded that}} “the most likely sinking scenario involved gradual flooding in the aft void, which caused the aft deck to submerge and the vessel {{to enter a}} lolling condition, resulting in a sudden list to starboard. In this state, water would then have likely entered other spaces through downflooding points, causing progressing flooding and sinking by the stern without capsizing.” ...|$|R
5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system.|$|E
5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of December 9, 2016, Sherman died when his Zenair CH 601 Zodiac crashed outside of Marengo, Illinois. He was 63. He was flying {{from his home in}} Poplar Grove to Schaumburg Regional Airport to attend a holiday party. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{determined}} that Sherman's plane lost control soon after taking off, and that it crashed around 6:19 p.m. on December 9. Federal Aviation Administration records also showed that Sherman had a sport pilot certificate, meaning that by flying at night, he was violating the restrictions on his license.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{accident}} investigation {{is to identify}} and organize {{a description of the}} process through which interacting elements and conditions result in an unfortunate event. Unfortunately, if accident investigators lack a cohesive definition of human factors issues, the investigation into human performance may be unsystematic, incomplete, or leave significant points unresolved. This may, in turn, hinder scientific analysis of the data from which future principles or procedural rules can be revealed. Case in point is the classification of Crew Resource Management (CRM) accidents in aviation. We analyzed the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board’s</b> (NTSB) aviation accident data from 1990 - 2000 for CRM failure, based in part on James Reason’s theory of system disasters. We identified 95 human performance accidents involving flightcrews in large air carrier operations (FAR Part 121). Examination of the NTSB-assigned sequence of events revealed that 27 % of accidents involved a CRM-related latent error; however, an additional 16 % involved active errors committed by the flightcrew, not additionally coded as a latent crew failure. Without consistent and systematic classification of error from the initial investigation, the final analysis of CRM-related failures may ultimately be underrepresented, and thus the concept of CRM may remain ill-defined...|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} accident data {{recorded by the}} <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> and <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSR) for 1964 - 1979 were analyzed to determine what problems exist in the general aviation (GA) single pilot instrument flight rule (SPIFR) environment. A previous study conducted in 1978 for the years 1964 - 1975 provided a basis for comparison. This effort was generally limited to SPIFR pilot error landing phase accidents but includes some SPIFR takeoff and enroute accident analysis {{as well as some}} dual pilot IFR accident analysis for comparison.

40|$|Jet fuel [...] its {{liquid and}} vapor [...] was {{characterized}} {{as part of}} the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> (NTSB's) investigation into the cause of the TWA Flight 800 accident (DCA 96 MA 070; the crash of a 747 - 131, N 93119). For the vapor, headspace gas chromatography was used to measure component partial pressures and total vapor pressures for ten jet fuel samples (Jet-A) provided by the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO). These characteristics derived from the fuel vapor were also derived from analysis of the neat liquid for eight of these fuel samples, and the results of the two analytical approaches were compared. Three of the fuel samples were taken from fuel used in the quarter-scale tests # 42, 46, and 51 designed to simulate possible fuel tank conditions {{at the time of the}} accident. Seven of the ARCO samples had been reformulated to alter the flash point. Two additional samples (giving a total of twelve) were taken from the center wing tank of a 747 aircraft involved in ground tests in Marana, AZ. Measurements of all of the fuel vapor samples were made at 40 ºC, 50 ºC, and 60 ºC and at vapor volume-toliquid volume (V/L) ratios of 274 (nearly empty tank; ~ 3 kg/m 3) and 1. 2 (half-filled tank; ~ 400 kg/m 3). Characterization of the liquid fuels was done by simple injections of the neat liquids onto a temperature-programmed gas chromatograph. ii Acknowledgment...|$|R
