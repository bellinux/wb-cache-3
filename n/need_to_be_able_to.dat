5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops {{incubating}} the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> scent-detect and identify the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E

5|$|Design 1047, {{also known}} as Project 1047, {{was a series of}} plans for a class of Dutch battlecruisers prior to the Second World War. The ships were {{intended}} to counter a perceived threat posed by Imperial Japanese aggression to the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Dutch intelligence believed that the Imperial Japanese Navy would deploy its capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) against their counterparts of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, leaving heavy and light cruisers, along with seaplane carriers, as the largest ships available for an advance into the East Indies. As such, the 1047s were shaped by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fight their way through a fleet composed of these ships and smaller destroyers. It was hoped that this capability would allow the battlecruisers to act as a fleet in being.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is {{the most commonly used}} method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E

5|$|Although Rappe did not {{completely}} {{rule out the}} possibility of a German or British attack on southern Sweden if the opportunity arose, he felt that Russia was the most realistic threat. There were only two plausible scenarios for war with Russia: either Sweden would become involved in a war between Germany and Russia which would feature southern and central Sweden as the battlegroundand Rappe made no attempt to hide which country the General Staff wanted Sweden to side with in that caseor Russia would make a limited attack on Norrbotten to reach northern Norway and the Atlantic, an attack that Rappe earlier said was not very likely. Rappe had played down the strategic importance of the Ofoten and Iron Ore Lines and played up the importance of the main railway line to Boden, which was under discussion at that time, to speed up its completion. The railway to Boden was nearly finished by 1892, negating the need for Rappe to play that political game any longer. A railway line to Boden was of utmost <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> bring up troops to Lule Riverthe main line of defenceand a future fortress there.|$|E
5|$|Witton {{elaborated}} in 2012 and 2013 on {{the idea}} that Istiodactylus was a scavenger. Scavenging birds have a mosaic of strong and weak elements in their skulls; {{they do not have to}} struggle with their prey, but <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tear and pull morsels from cadavers. These birds also have relatively small eyes compared to predatory birds, as they do not need to search for hiding animals, or to make carefully judged attacks on their prey. Istiodactylus appears to have had large jaw muscles, and therefore a strong bite, and the skull was deep, which would have helped resist bending when pulling flesh. Individual bones of the skull were instead slender and shallow, and the toothrows were short, which indicates Istiodactylus did not have the necessary reinforcements for predation, and did not have to subdue struggling prey. Together, these features indicate Istiodactylus fed on large prey that necessitated strong jaws for processing, yet was also motionless enough so that strain on the jaws and skull could be controlled during feeding. The eyes of Istiodactylus also seem to have been proportionally small, compared to pterosaurs that are presumed to have been predatory (such as ornithocheirids). Witton concluded that among pterosaurs, Istiodactylus appears to have been the best-adapted for a scavenging lifestyle. He envisioned that istiodactylids would have to step back from a carcass if more powerful carnivores were attracted to it, but would return to finish the remains when those animals were satiated.|$|E

40|$|For {{a system}} to {{understand}} natural language, it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take natural language text and answer questions given in natural language with respect to that text; it also <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> follow instructions given in natural language.

Thus it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> translate natural language text into a formal language. We discuss our approach to do this, where the translation is achieved by composing the meaning of words in a sentence. Our initial approach uses an inverse lambda method that we developed (and other methods) to learn meaning of words from meaning of sentences and an initial lexicon. We then present an improved method where the initial lexicon is also learned by analyzing the training sentence and meaning pairs. We evaluate our methods and compare them with other existing methods on a corpora of database querying and robot command and control...|$|R

An AC circuit experiences 100% voltage reversal, while underdamped DC circuits experience less than 100%. Reversal creates excess electric fields in the dielectric, causes excess heating of both the dielectric and the conductors, and can dramatically shorten the life expectancy of the capacitor. Reversal ratings often affect the design considerations for the capacitor, from the choice of dielectric materials and voltage ratings to the types of internal connections used.|$|E
