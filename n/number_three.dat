5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with <b>Number</b> <b>Three.</b> While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. <b>Number</b> <b>Three</b> offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that <b>Number</b> <b>Three</b> will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who <b>Number</b> <b>Three</b> intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As <b>Number</b> <b>Three</b> goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When <b>Number</b> <b>Three</b> attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for <b>Number</b> <b>Three</b> to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
