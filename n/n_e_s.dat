50|$|The four {{cardinal}} directions or {{cardinal points}} are the directions north, east, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials, <b>N,</b> <b>E,</b> <b>S,</b> W. East and west are {{at right angles}} to north and south, with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east. Points between the cardinal directions form the points of the compass. The intermediate (intercardinal or ordinal) directions are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW).

50|$|When the sun {{is located}} at the zenith, the band of maximal {{polarization}} wraps around the horizon. Light from the sky is polarized horizontally along the horizon. During twilight at either the Vernal or Autumnal equinox, the band of maximal polarization is defined by the North-Zenith-South plane, or meridian. In particular, the polarization is vertical at the horizon in the North and South, where the meridian meets the horizon. The polarization at twilight at an equinox is represented by the figure to the right. The red band represents the circle in the North-Zenith-South plane where the sky is highly polarized.

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1250, the English {{scholastic}} Matthew Paris, in his Liber Accidentalist, attempted {{to reconcile the}} classical 12 winds he was taught with the [...] "new" [...] Mediterranean wind rose. In one effort, Matthew Paris assigned the 12 classical names to <b>N,</b> <b>E,</b> <b>S,</b> W and the half-winds (NNE, ENE, ESE, etc.), leaving the principal diagonals NE, SE, SW and NW vacant. Thus Septentrio to N, Aquilo to NNE, Vulturnus to ENE, Subsolanus to E, Eurus to ESE, Euroauster to SSE, Auster to S, and so on. (Indeed, this assignment is frequently used by many authors (but not this article) to explain the classical 12-wind system in modern terms). In a second effort, he decided to conjure up 16 classical-sounding names for all 16 winds of the mariner's rose. In his construction (noted on a scribbled corner), he seemed to contemplate the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|In the English compass, all wind {{names are}} {{constructed}} {{on the basis}} of the cardinal four names (<b>N,</b> <b>E,</b> <b>S,</b> W). In the traditional compass, one needs to memorize eight basic names - one for each of the eight principal winds (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.) While there are more names to memorize, the payoff is that the name construction rules for the 32-wind compass are more straightforward. The half-winds are just a combination of the two principal winds it bisects, with the shortest name usually coming first (e.g. NNE is [...] "Greco-Tramontana", ENE is [...] "Greco-Levante", SSE is [...] "Ostro-Scirocco", etc.). The quarter winds are expressed with an Italian phrase, [...] "Quarto di X verso Y" [...] (one quarter from X towards Y, [...] ) or [...] "X al Y" [...] (X to Y) or [...] "X per Y" [...] (X by Y). There are no irregularities to trip over: the nearest principal wind always comes first, the more distant one second, e.g. North-by-east is [...] "Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco", northeast-by-north [...] "Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana". The names are perfectly symmetric.|$|E

40|$|Master of EducationA {{national}} Australia wide {{mail survey}} was conducted of 400 systematically selected, practising speech pathologists {{who were members of}} the Australian Association of Speech and Hearing. The aim of the survey was to describe the occurrence and nature of speech pathology services provided for the non-native speaker of English (N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.)</b> during the period January 1 to December 31, 1986. A modified version of the Total Design of Method (Dillman, 1984) was followed. The Total Design Method involved implementation of a set of procedures consisting of one initial contact for all questionnaire participants and up to two follow-up contacts for non-respondents. Using these procedures, an 87 percent response rate was achieved. The findings indicated that: 1. Sixty-nine (68. 9) percent of the sample population of speech pathologists had seen one to two different N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.</b> clients in their clinics. 2. The speech pathologists (31. 2 percent) who had not seen N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.</b> reported overwhelmingly that there had been no referrals of N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.</b> to their clinic. 3. The incidence of referral of N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.</b> clients for each state was related to the number of practising speech pathologists in the state and not to the proportion of N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.</b> in that state. 4. N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.</b> clients were represented predominantly by the age groups 0 - 9 and 55 and over. 5. The languages spoken most often by N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S</b> clients were Italian, Greek and Chinese languages (Cantonese and Mandarin). 6. Interpreters were used by 36 percent of speech pathologists. 7. One in every three speech pathologists who provided services to N. <b>N.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>S.</b> clients spoke a second language. However, these second languages were used infrequently by the speech pathologist in the clinical setting. 8. Sixty-four (64. 2) percent of speech pathologists were supportive of the notion that a greater amount of information should be included in undergraduate and continuing education programs in all aspects relating to bilingual/bicultural issues.
