40|$|Abstract. Over {{the past}} few decades, a {{combination}} of physiology, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, and genetics {{has given us a}} basic understanding of some of the key transport processes at work in <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>legume</b> nodules, especially those involved in nutrient exchange between infected plant cells and their endosymbiotic rhizobia. However, our knowledge in this area remains patchy and dispersed over numerous legume species. Recent progress in the areas of genomics and functional genomics of the two model legumes, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus is rapidly filling the gap in knowledge about which plant transporter genes are expressed constitutively in nodules and other organs, and which are induced or expressed specifically in nodules. The latter class in particular is the focus of current efforts to understand specialised, nodule-specific roles of transporters. This article briefly reviews past work on the biochemistry and molecular biology of plant transporters in nodules, before describing recent work in the areas of transcriptomics and bioinformatics. Finally, we consider where functional genomics together with more classical approaches are likely to lead us in this area of research in the future...|$|E
40|$|Astragalus jaegerianus, the Lane Mountain milkvetch, a {{perennial}} herbaceous legume, {{is a rare}} and very narrow endemic of the central Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California, and currently proposed to be listed as an endangered species. This herb grows in the protection of low shrubs. Anatomical observations revealed that leaflets are amphistomatic and have isolateral mesophyll, typical of full-sun desert leaves, and the green stem is an important photosynthetic organ, having abundant stomata and a cylinder of cortical chlore nchyma. Ecophysiological studies showed that this species requires high PFD (1400 - 1500 μmol m- 2 s- 1) to achieve maximum photosynthetic rates and, therefore, is probably not utilizing the nurse shrub for shade but, instead, as a trellis for upper shoots to intercept high PFD. A study of δ 15 N indicated that this legume is a nitrogen fixer, with higher tissue nitrogen content than other associated species (3. 1 % versus 1. 8 %). The herb-shrub association is speculated to be mutualistic, in that the shrub may benefit from higher soil nitrogen when it grows with a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>legume,</b> and A. jaegerianus likely uses the nurse shrub for protection from herbivores...|$|E

50|$|Dr. Whatley is {{best known}} for his {{regenerative}} farming system, in combination with the direct marketing concept of Pick-Your-Own (PYO), a customer harvesting operation managed by farmers and growers. Dr. Whatley also popularized the concept of subscription buyer's club for small farmers either as a separate business from a PYO operation or in conjunction with it. Today, PYO (or U-Pick) farms are a worldwide phenomenon. Whatley believed that the regenerative agriculture for small farmers made greater use of the internal resources that a farm produced and, therefore, when properly managed would provide a more sustainable livelihood. Regenerative agriculture has a long history and can be traced to the agricultural extension work of Dr. George Washington Carver at Tuskegee University in the early part of the 20th century, as well as Carver's scientific contributions regarding the nitrogen cycle and the biological regeneration of soils in the southern United States where he introduced crop rotation methods in combination with the planting of <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>legumes,</b> such as peanuts, peas, and soybeans.|$|R

40|$|A common pattern {{emerging}} from {{studies on the}} relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning is that productivity increases with diversity. Most of these studies have been carried out in perennial grasslands, but many lasted only two growing seasons or reported data from a single year. Especially for perennial plant communities, however, the long-term effects of diversity are important. The question whether interactions between few species or among many species lead to increased productivity remained largely unanswered. So far, the main mechanism addressed is the increased input of nitrogen by <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>legumes.</b> We report that other mechanisms can also generate strong increases of productivity with diversity. Results from 4 consecutive years of a plant diversity experiment without legumes show that a positive relationship between plant species richness and productivity emerged in the second year and strengthened with time. We show that increased nutrient use efficiency at high species richness is an important underlying mechanism. This mechanism had not been discussed in earlier studies.
