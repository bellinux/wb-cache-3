5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{nationalism}} {{was based on}} the idea of a [...] "people" [...] who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each [...] "people" [...] had a right to its own state. Thus, much of European history {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of [...] "one people, one state". Many interior conflicts were a result of more or less pressurising citizens of alternative ethnicities and/or other <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> <b>to</b> assimilate to the ethnicity dominant in the state. Switzerland was the bright exception showing that patriotism only needs civic pride and legal equality, not a common <b>native</b> <b>language.</b>|$|R
