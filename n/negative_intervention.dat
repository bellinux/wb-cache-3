40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to analyze the role of short polymorphism of serotonin transporter (5 -HTTLPR) in response to psy-chosocial stress mediated by cortisol, having found inconsistent results. In order to synthesize and analyze available information about the role of short polymorphisms of 5 -HTTLPR gen in the stress response, this meta-analysis has been carried out. A meta-analysis of studies published until November 2011 without language restrictions, which analyzed the effect of the short polymorphisms of 5 -HTTLPR in the cortisol response during a stress-inducing protocol was conducted. Published F or p genotype values were collected as estimators of the difference between groups as well as the sign of this difference for analysis. The global meta-analysis showed no significant association between the presence of the short allele and a different response to psychosocial stress. After comparing the subgroups of studies where participants underwent an emotionally neutral intervention versus an emotionally <b>negative</b> <b>intervention,</b> significant differences were found. The subgroup of studies where patients underwent an emotionally <b>negative</b> <b>intervention</b> showed a significantly greater cortisol release by those individuals carrying the short allele.

In January 2011, dance mat systems were introduced in secondary schools in two districts in England {{with the aim of}} promoting an innovative opportunity for physical activity. The aim of this natural experiment was to examine the effect of introducing the dance mat exergaming systems on physical activity and health-related outcomes in 11 – 13 year old students using a non-randomised controlled design and mixed methods. Methods Participants were recruited from five schools in intervention districts (n[*]=[*] 280) and two schools in neighbouring control districts (n[*]=[*] 217). Data on physical activity (accelerometer), anthropometrics (weight, BMI and percentage of body fat), aerobic fitness (20 -m multistage shuttle run test), health-related quality of life (Kidscreen questionnaire), self-efficacy (children’s physical activity self-efficacy survey), school attendance, focus groups with children and interviews with teachers were collected at baseline and approximately 12 months follow-up.

40|$|Teratology is {{the science}} that studies the causes, mechanisms, and {{patterns}} of abnormal development. The authors present an updated overview {{of the most important}} milestones and stages of the development of modern teratology. Development of knowl-edge and society led to the recognition that causes of congenital developmental disorders (CDDs) might be caused by various mechanical effects, foetal diseases, and retarded or arrested development of the embryo and foetus. Based on the analysis of the historical development of hypotheses and theories representing a decisive contribution to this field, we present a survey of the six Wilson´s fundamental principles of teratology. The aim of observing these principles is to get insight into developmental relations and to understand mechanisms of action on the level of cell populations (elementary morphogenetic processes), tissues and organs. It is important to realise that any <b>negative</b> <b>intervention</b> into the normal course of these processes, either on genetic or non-genetic basis, inevitably leads to a sequence of subsequent changes resulting in CDDs. Moreover, the classical toxicologic monotonic dose-response paradigm recently has been challenged by the so-called “low dose-hypothesis”, particularly in the case of endocrine active substances. These include some pesticides, dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), and bisphenol A. Despite modern approaches of molecular biology and genetics, along with top diagnostic techniques, we are still not able to identify the actual cause in more than 65 to 70 % of all congenital defects classified as having an unknown etiology.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{sought to}} explore {{the effect of the}} family {{involvement}} in care (FIC) intervention on family and staff well-being over a nine-month period in a long-term care (LTC) facility providing dementia care. Method: A quasi-experimental design with randomised allocation of two LTC sites but not the participants was employed. Family caregivers (n?=? 57) of residents with dementia and staff (n?=? 59) from two LTC facilities in Queensland, Australia, were recruited. Participants were assessed once pre-intervention and three times post-intervention for knowledge, stress and satisfaction outcomes. Between-group and within-group effects were analysed using ANOVAs at < 0. 05 level of significance. Pre- and post-intervention interviews from a purposive sample of family caregivers were also conducted to enhance understanding of FIC benefits. Results: Beneficial intervention effects associated with family caregivers' knowledge of dementia were found (p?<? 0. 001). <b>Negative</b> <b>intervention</b> effects were also found for family satisfaction outcomes in relation to staff consideration of their relatives and management effectiveness (p?<? 0. 05). In addition, staff well-being and job satisfaction were found to be negatively affected by their perceived inappropriate behaviour of residents with dementia (p?<? 0. 05). Conclusion: Participation in the FIC intervention improved family caregiver knowledge. The major barrier {{to the success of the}} partnership intervention in achieving beneficial long-term psychosocial effects for family and staff caregivers was lack of resources and leadership required to support collaboration between family and staff, mainly due to environment and structural changes.

40|$|Abstract. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has {{exhibited}} efficacy at preventing {{the progression of}} pulmonary hypertension (PH); however, the exact mechanism is not completely clear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess whether this protective effect was mediated by the upregulation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) via the nitric oxide (NO) system. PH was induced in male Sprague‑Dawley (SD) rats by the administration of a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (MCT). The rats were treated with recombinant human G‑CSF (rhG‑CSF, 50 µg/kg/day) by subcutaneous injection from day five to day seven subsequent to the injection of MCT. Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 4 mg/kg/day) was intragastrically administered in addition to rhG‑CSF as a <b>negative</b> <b>intervention.</b> The changes in hemodynamics and histology, the number and function of circulating EPCs and the concentration of plasma NO were evaluated. With the occurrence of PH in the rat model, the number and function of circulating EPCs were demonstrated to be markedly downregulated. Moreover, a reduced plasma concentration of NO was observed, which was positively corre-lated with the number of circulating EPCs. Administration of rhG‑CSF elevated the plasma level of NO, upregulated the number and function of circulating EPCs and effectively improved pulmonary hemodynamics and vascular reconstruc-tion. Furthermore, the positive correlation between the levels of plasma NO and circulating EPCs was also observed in the rhG‑CSF treatment group. However, the protective effect of rhG‑CSF in PH was attenuated by L‑NAME, which mediated the downregulation of NO and the EPCs. Thus, the present study suggests that G‑CSF may attenuate the progression of MCT‑induced PH by improving vascular injury repair mecha-nisms via the NO‑mediated upregulation of EPCs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Particulate air {{pollution}} in lung epithelial cells induces pathogenic endpoints like proliferation, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory reactions. The activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key event responsible for signalling events involving mitogen activated protein kinases specific for these endpoints. The molecular events leading to receptor activation however are not well understood. These events are relevant for the toxicological evaluation of inhalable particles {{as well as for}} potential preventive strategies in situations when particulate {{air pollution}} cannot be avoided. The current study therefore had the objective to elucidate membrane-coupled events leading to EGFR activation and the subsequent signalling cascade in lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the molecular target of ectoine, a biophysical active substance which we described to prevent carbon nanoparticle-induced lung inflammation. Methods Membrane signalling events were investigated in isolated lipid rafts from lung epithelial cells with regard to lipid and protein content of the signalling platforms. Using positive and <b>negative</b> <b>intervention</b> approaches, lipid raft changes, subsequent signalling events, and lung inflammation were investigated in vitro in lung epithelial cells (RLE- 6 TN) and in vivo in exposed animals. Results Carbon nanoparticle treatment specifically led to an accumulation of ceramides in lipid rafts. Detailed analyses demonstrated a causal link of ceramides and subsequent EGFR activation coupled with a loss of the receptor in the lipid raft fractions. In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate the relevance of these events for carbon nanoparticle-induced lung inflammation. Moreover, the compatible solute ectoine was able to prevent ceramide-mediated EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent signalling as well as lung inflammation in vivo. Conclusion The data identify a so far unknown event in pro-inflammatory signalling and contribute to the understanding of particle cell interaction and therefore to risk identification and risk assessment of inhalable xenobiotics. Moreover, as this cellular reaction can be prevented by the well tolerated substance ectoine, a molecular preventive strategy for susceptible persons against airway inflammation is proposed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{study is}} based in post-apartheid South Africa {{and looks at the}} health and well being of {{households}} in the rural northeast. Temporary migration remains important in South Africa because it functions as a mainstay for income and even survival of rural communities. The economic base of rural South Africans is surprisingly low because there is high inequity at a national level, within and between racial groups. There has now been a democratic system in place for 15 years and there is no longer restriction of mobility, but there remain high levels of poverty in rural areas and rising mortality rates. Migration patterns did not change after apartheid in the manner expected. We need to examine consequences of migration and learn how to offset negative impacts with targeted policies. Aims: To determine a relevant typology of migration in a typical rural sending community, namely the Agincourt sub-district of Mpumalanga, South Africa, and relate it to the urban transition at a national level – Paper (I). To evaluate the dynamics of socio-economic status in this rural community and examine the relationship with migration – Paper (II). To explore, using longitudinal methods, the impact of migration on key dimensions of health, including adult and child mortality, and sexual partnerships, over a period of an emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic – Papers (III), (IV) and (V). Methods: The health and socio-demographic surveillance system (HDSS) is a large open cohort where the migration dynamics are monitored as they unfold. They are recorded as temporary or permanent migration. Settled refugees are captured using nationality on entry into the HDSS. Longitudinal methods, namely a household panel and two discrete time event history analyses, are used to examine consequences of migration. Results: Migration features prominently and different types have different age and sex profiles. Temporary migration impacts the most on socio-economic status (SES) and health, but permanent migration and the settlement of former refugees are also important. Remittances from migrants make a significant difference to SES. For the poorest households the key factors improving SES are government grants and female temporary migration, while for less poor it is male temporary migration and local employment. Migration has been associated with HIV. Migrants that return more frequently may be less exposed to outside partners and therefore less implicated in the HIV epidemic. There are links between migration and mortality including a higher risk of dying for returnee migrants compared to permanent residents. A mother’s migration can impact on child survival after accounting for other factors. There remains a higher mortality risk for children of Mozambican former refugee parents. Interpretation: Migration changes the risks and resources for health with positive and negative implications. Measures such as improved transportation and roads should be seen as a positive, not a <b>negative</b> <b>intervention,</b> even though it will create more migration. Health services need to adapt to a reality of high levels of circular migration ranging from budget allocation to referral systems. Data should be enhanced at a national level by accounting for temporary migration in national censuses and surveys. At individual level we can offset negative consequences by treating migrants as persons striving against adversity, instead of unwelcome visitors in our better-off communities. ...|$|E
40|$|Cash-based {{interventions}} (CBIs), {{offer an}} interesting opportunity to prevent increases in wasting in humanitarian aid settings. However, questions remain {{as to the}} impact of CBIs on nutritional status and, therefore, how to incorporate them into emergency programmes to maximise their success in terms of improved nutritional outcomes. This study evaluated the effects of three different CBI modalities on nutritional outcomes in children under 5 y of age at 6 mo and at 1 y. We conducted a four-arm parallel longitudinal cluster randomised controlled trial in 114 villages in Dadu District, Pakistan. The study included poor and very poor households (n = 2, 496) with one or more children aged 6 - 48 mo (n = 3, 584) at baseline. All four arms had equal access to an Action Against Hunger-supported programme. The three intervention arms were as follows: standard cash (SC), a cash transfer of 1, 500 Pakistani rupees (PKR) (approximately US$ 14; 1 PKR = US$ 0. 009543); double cash (DC), a cash transfer of 3, 000 PKR; or a fresh food voucher (FFV) of 1, 500 PKR; the cash or voucher amount was given every month over six consecutive months. The control group (CG) received no specific cash-related interventions. The median total household income for the study sample was 8, 075 PKR (approximately US$ 77) at baseline. We hypothesized that, compared to the CG in each case, FFVs would be more effective than SC, and that DC would be more effective than SC-both at 6 mo and at 1 y-for reducing the risk of child wasting. Primary outcomes of interest were prevalence of being wasted (weight-for-height z-score [WHZ] < - 2) and mean WHZ at 6 mo and at 1 y. The odds of a child being wasted were significantly lower in the DC arm after 6 mo (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 52; 95 % CI 0. 29, 0. 92; p = 0. 02) compared to the CG. Mean WHZ significantly improved in both the FFV and DC arms at 6 mo (FFV: z-score = 0. 16; 95 % CI 0. 05, 0. 26; p = 0. 004; DC: z-score = 0. 11; 95 % CI 0. 00, 0. 21; p = 0. 05) compared to the CG. Significant differences on the primary outcome were seen only at 6 mo. All three intervention groups showed similar significantly lower odds of being stunted (height-for-age z-score [HAZ] < - 2) at 6 mo (DC: OR = 0. 39; 95 % CI 0. 24, 0. 64; p < 0. 001; FFV: OR = 0. 41; 95 % CI 0. 25, 0. 67; p < 0. 001; SC: OR = 0. 36; 95 % CI 0. 22, 0. 59; p < 0. 001) and at 1 y (DC: OR = 0. 53; 95 % CI 0. 35, 0. 82; p = 0. 004; FFV: OR = 0. 48; 95 % CI 0. 31, 0. 73; p = 0. 001; SC: OR = 0. 54; 95 % CI 0. 36, 0. 81; p = 0. 003) compared to the CG. Significant improvements in height-for-age outcomes were also seen for severe stunting (HAZ < - 3) and mean HAZ. An unintended outcome was observed in the FFV arm: a <b>negative</b> <b>intervention</b> effect on mean haemoglobin (Hb) status (- 2. 6 g/l; 95 % CI - 4. 5, - 0. 8; p = 0. 005). Limitations of this study included the inability to mask participants or data collectors to the different interventions, the potentially restrictive nature of the FFVs, not being able to measure a threshold effect for the two different cash amounts or compare the different quantities of food consumed, and data collection challenges given the difficult environment in which this study was set. In this setting, the amount of cash given was important. The larger cash transfer had the greatest effect on wasting, but only at 6 mo. Impacts at both 6 mo and at 1 y were seen for height-based growth variables regardless of the intervention modality, indicating a trend toward nutrition resilience. Purchasing restrictions applied to food-based voucher transfers could have unintended effects, and their use needs to be carefully planned to avoid this. ISRCTN registry ISRCTN 10761532...|$|E

Intensive use of the previous scale resulted in three criticisms: (i) excessive time required to perform evaluations, (ii) the low occurrence of some items, and (iii) the scale’s low capacity to capture some patient–therapist interactions in fine detail. In this study, we aimed to describe the scale revision process and evaluate interrater reliability and scale validity by comparing sessions of patients with and without personality disorders (PDs).

On March 1, 2015, a new <b>negative</b> reinforcement <b>intervention</b> involving “service fees” for a visit without appointment was implemented at King Abdullah University Hospital in Jordan. To evaluate {{the effect of this}} intervention in improving patient adherence to medical appointment, a retrospective preintervention and postintervention analysis was used, including all patients (n = 65 [*] 535) who had scheduled appointments at 39 outpatient clinics. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was first performed. Then, a multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors that might predict individuals who are likely to attend or miss their appointments and those who have a greater tendency to visit the hospital with or without appointments. Although the average percentage of appointments attended was more than missed preintervention and postintervention, the decrease in percentage of missed appointments was more pronounced postintervention. Also, the average percentage of visits without appointments was less than visits with appointments in both times, but the decrease in the percentage of visits without appointments was more prominent after. The regression analysis revealed that younger, married and male patients were more likely to miss their appointment before and after the intervention. Also, younger patients had a tendency to attend without appointments. Conversely, patients with the lower copayment rate had a tendency to adhere to appointment times. In conclusion, <b>negative</b> reinforcement <b>interventions</b> could improve patient appointment adherence rates.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of therapeutic alliance ruptures greatly vary {{in relation to}} patient pathology.

Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that patients with PDs, characterized by inflexible patterns of emotional and interpersonal difficulties that could lead to dramatic in-session fluctuations of mental states, invariably pose great challenges to psychotherapists, especially with regard to the negotiation of the therapeutic alliance (Benjamin & Karpiak, 2002; Levy, Beeney, Wasserman, & Clarkin, 2010). The aims {{of the study was to}} describe the scale-revision process, to evaluate interrater reliability and scale validity comparing sessions of patients with and without personality disorders (PDs).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between vulnerability to depression and smoking behavior in college students in 1214 college students (54 % female), and evaluated gender and expectancies of negative affect reduction as moderators or mediators of this relationship. Depression vulnerability predicted smoking in females, but not males. The relationship between depression vulnerability and smoking status was mediated by expectancies of negative affect reduction in females only. Female college students who are vulnerable to depression may smoke because they expect smoking to relieve <b>negative</b> affect. Smoking <b>interventions</b> for college females may increase in effectiveness by targeting depression and emphasizing mood regulation...|$|R
40|$|The work {{of group}} care workers in {{residential}} youth care {{is often described}} as professional parenting. Pedagogical interventions of group care workers influence the quality of care for looked-after children. The aim of the current study was to observe the pedagogical interventions of group care workers within residential youth care and their associations with child behaviors. Group care worker interventions and child behaviors were videotaped during structured observations. Participants included 95 children (64 % boys, M (age) = 9. 19) and 53 group care workers (74 % female, M (age) = 33. 79 years). A coding system was developed to code pedagogical interventions and child behaviors. It showed that group care workers mainly used positive pedagogical interventions (warmth/support and positive control) and seldom used <b>negative</b> pedagogical <b>interventions</b> (permissiveness and <b>negative</b> control). Frustration and anger of children was associated with positive controlling interventions and permissiveness of group care workers. The hypothesis that child anxiety and nervousness is associated with warm and supportive interventions could not be confirmed. Pedagogical interventions should be part of education, training, and supervision of group care workers...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effect}} of {{time-varying}} employment risks on the fluctuations of aggregate consumption in a dynamic general equilibrium with incomplete markets. A government's redistribution policy through provision of unemployment insurance can cause {{a positive correlation between}} aggregate consumption and government's payments due to precautionary savings effects. The underlying mechanism is that a reduction of unemployment risk increases expected lifetime income substantially across a wide range of asset-holding groups when the risk reduction is sufficiently persistent. By contrast, the correlation between consumption and government becomes <b>negative</b> when government <b>intervention</b> hampers supply of goods. Time-varying idiosyncratic risk, employment risk, precautionary savings, regime-switching fiscal policy...|$|R

The Sprint study (Study to Prospectively Evaluate Reamed Intramedullary Nails in Patients with Tibial Fractures) found that there was in increased risk of <b>negative</b> events (unplanned <b>intervention</b> of hardware failure) in patients that suffered the injury due to high energy trauma [OR] =  1.57; 95  % confidence interval [CI], 1.05 – 2.35) and a fracture gap (OR =  2.40; 95  % CI, 1.47 – 3.94), and full weight-bearing status after surgery (OR =  1.63; 95  % CI, 1.00 – 2.64). This study mirrored our findings in regards to smoking and the use of NSAIDs postoperatively. There was no increased risk with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or smoking status [21].|$|R

Participants were 127 residents with a diagnosis of dementia or enduring mental health problems in three specialist nursing homes in the UK. A repeated measures within-subjects design was employed, collecting quantitative and qualitative data at three points over a twelve-month period in each facility with follow-up 7 to 14 months later. Two-way ANOVAs revealed a statistically significant increase in levels of observed well-being and in diversity of activity following the intervention. There was a statistically significant {{increase in the number of}} positive staff interventions but no change in the number of <b>negative</b> staff <b>interventions</b> overall. There was a significant reduction in levels of depression. No significant changes in anxiety, health status, hospitalisations, or psychotropic medication usage were observed. The Enriched Opportunities Programme demonstrated a positive impact on the lives of people with dementia in nursing homes already offering a relatively good standard of care, in a short period of time. The refined programme requires further evaluation to establish its portability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Alaskan salmon {{stocks have}} {{exhibited}} enormous fluctuations in production during the 20 th century. In this paper, we investigate our hypothesis that large-scale salmon-production variability {{is driven by}} climatic processes in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Using a time-series analytical technique known as intervention analysis, we demonstrate that Alaskan salmonids alternate {{between high and low}} production regimes. The transition from a high(low) regime to a low(high) regime is called an intervention. To test for interventions, we first fitted the salmon time series to univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. On the basis of tentatively identified climatic regime shifts, potential interventions were then identified and incorporated into the models, and the resulting fit was compared with the non-intervention models. A highly significant positive step intervention in the late 1970 s and a significant <b>negative</b> step <b>intervention</b> in the late 1940 s were identified in the four major Alaska salmon stocks analyzed. We review the evidence for synchronous climatic regime shifts in the late 1940 s and late 1970 s that coincide with the shifts in salmon production. Potential mechanisms linking North Pacific climatic processes to salmon production are identified. ...|$|R

40|$|Research {{on child}} sexual abuse has focused on adult revictimization and outcomes. This article {{examines}} the rate of child maltreatment revictimization among male and female children reported to child protective services for {{child sexual abuse}} and whether revictimization impacts outcomes. Using longitudinal administrative data, Cox regressions were used to examine relationships between initial report of child sexual abuse, maltreatment revictimization, and adolescent outcomes among children from poor and nonpoor families. Despite {{no significant differences in}} child sexual abuse rates between poor and nonpoor families, poor child sexual abuse victims {{were significantly more likely to}} have re-reports for maltreatment.
