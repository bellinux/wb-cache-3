5|$|The Outer Space Treaty {{provides}} the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by <b>nation</b> <b>states,</b> and includes in its definition of outer space the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> {{to explore and}} {{is not subject to}} claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2008 the treaty has been ratified by 98 states and signed by an additional 27 states.|$|E

5|$|Strong, royalty-based <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, {{particularly in}} England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, {{and the rate of}} taxation often increased. The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study aims {{to present}} a {{thorough}} understanding of the process of globalization and analyze the current effects and changes of globalization on <b>nation</b> <b>state.</b> In accordance with this viewpoint, the concept and the development of globalization, its dimensions, various aspects and actors are addressed, and the relations between globalization and <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> are demonstrated. The second part of the study explains how <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> is affected by the process of globalization, and how the functions of <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> shrink in political and economic sense. This part also reveals the roles of international capital and institutions (as the primary actors of the process of globalization) on the changing functions of <b>nation</b> <b>state.</b> In this part, light is shed on how <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> delegates authority to supra-national and sub-national units, and how independent monetary, fiscal, foreign trade and employment policies face challenges in application due to the weakening of the sovereignty of <b>nation</b> <b>state.</b> The last part handles the effect of the process of globalization on Turkey, and present the fact that Turkey, as a <b>nation</b> <b>state,</b> is influenced by this process {{in a way that it}} even threatens Turkey’s power of sovereignty. The last part also shows how Turkey should follow a path in order to avoid any harm caused by the global order and make use of any opportunity appearing under present circumstances. Keywords.

40|$|The {{environmental}} <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> is not {{a formal}} category but a substantive one. The current set of national environmental state institutions originated in the late 1960 s/ 1970 s but has since changed in character. Many scholars note that since the new millennium, the environmental <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> in OECD countries is losing power and authority and is thus in decline, in line with wider concerns about the positions of states versus markets under conditions of (neo-liberal) globalisation. Assessing the decline of environmental <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> authority, three conclusions are drawn. States do not lose power in all sectors vis-à-vis markets. Hence, environmental <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> decline does not follow a general tendency. Second, the decline of environmental <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> powers cannot be equated with less effective or lower levels of environmental protection, as other environmental authorities have stepped in, and {{the jury is still}} out on their environmental effectiveness. Third, declining powers of environmental <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> institutions increasingly become a self-fulfilling prophecy of environmental policymakers, but non-state environmental authorities cannot take over all environmental state functions. </p...|$|R
5|$|Genoa was {{important}} {{in the politics of}} 12th-century Europe. The Genoese were a nation of merchants, and such was their wealth that they frequently fulfilled a role as bankers to the other <b>nation</b> <b>states.</b> However, the Genoese became divided following the rift caused when the Emperor Frederick II challenged the power of Pope Innocent IV. Two distinct camps formed: the Guelphs who supported the pope and the Ghibellines who were loyal to the imperial crown. Siding with the Guelphs were one of the patrician families of Genoa—the Grimaldi. Throughout the 13th century these two groups fought. Finally {{at the end of the}} century the Ghibellines were victorious and banished their opponents, including the Grimaldi, from Genoa. The Grimaldi settled in the area today known as the French Riviera. Several castles in the area are still known as Chateau Grimaldi, and testify to the strong presence of various branches of the family in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{government}} was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, {{the evolution of}} the Roman {{government was}} heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> and international organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Forgotten Realms setting is the {{continent}} of Faerûn, part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, {{the world of the}} Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> has {{a deposit}} {{insurance}} scheme, foreign investors (aka non-resident bank depositors) {{are more likely}} to passively deposit larger amounts of money in the banks of said <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> (that has a bank deposit insurance scheme).|$|R
40|$|Borders define {{jurisdiction}}s. To uphold borders is {{to claim}} jurisdiction; {{to claim the}} right to decide on the law. The <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> makes such a claim. It seeks jurisdiction over a particular territory. By implication, the <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> also acknowledges that other jurisdictions may apply beyond that territory. Borders work two-ways, and while they grant the <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> exclusive jurisdiction, they also limit the <b>nation</b> <b>state’s</b> claims to the designated territory. Supranationalism and multiculturalism undermine the idea of exclusive territorial jurisdiction. Supranationalism grants institutions the power to break through national borders and to overrule the <b>nation</b> <b>state’s</b> territorial arrangements. In this way, borders become increasingly porous. Multiculturalism, meanwhile, not only deligitimizes the <b>nation</b> <b>state’s</b> borders by weakening the collective identity of the people living behind them; it also encourages religious sub-groups to invoke rules from beyond the <b>nation</b> <b>state’s</b> borders, thereby undermining the very idea of territorial jurisdiction. ‘God’s heart has no borders’, to put it bluntly. Supranationalism and multiculturalism are thus antithetical to national sovereignty and to the borders therein implied. Supranationalism dilutes sovereignty, and so brings about the gradual dismantling of borders from the outside; multiculturalism weakens nationality, thus delegitimizing their existence altogether from the inside. !e idea of political organization that fundamentally opposes supranationalism and multiculturalism – the idea of the <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> – has been declared ‘outdated’ and ‘irrelevant’ by an overwhelming number of commentators. Yet while supranationalism and multiculturalism have dominated politics and academia over the last several decades, their popularity is questionable and debates about national identity divide most European countries at present.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, the United States {{sought to}} take {{advantage}} of the Ottoman Empire's retreat from the Balkans by establishing diplomatic relations with the region's newly emerged <b>nation</b> <b>states,</b> among which was Serbia. The two countries were allies during World War I. After the war, Serbia united with Montenegro and territories previously held by Austria-Hungary to a create a unified South Slavic state that would come to be known as Yugoslavia. The country had diplomatic relations with the United States up to the start of World War II. During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States supported the Serbian royalist Chetniks over their rivals, the communist Partisans. The Chetniks ultimately lost out to the Partisans and Yugoslavia became a single-party communist state with Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito at its head. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Yugoslavia and the United States had little diplomatic relations. The end of the war also resulted in the mass emigration of refugees from Yugoslavia, many of whom were Serbs that ended up moving to the United States. This helped create the first major Serbian diaspora in the United States. Some of the Serbian refugees who settled in the United States after World War II were anti-communist exiles who attempted to undermine Tito during the Cold War, using the United States as a venue for their anti-communist aims.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, {{nationalism}} {{had been}} largely absent in officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, but this changed during the war, {{and by the end}} of the war, the propaganda of the Entente had combined with wider aspirations to encourage nationalist sentiment. In some cases, this resulted in mutiny among units of the Austro-Hungarian Army in the last months of the war. The states that would succeed Austria-Hungary were approved by the Allies on 28 October 1918, and the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was dissolved three days later. Many new <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> emerged in the territory formerly belonging to the realm, as nationalist movements called for greater autonomy or full independence. The Duchy of Styria was divided between the new states of German-Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the exact line of the new border was unclear. In November 1918, Mikl had returned to his hometown of Radkersburg, an important railway junction point, which was of economic importance to both sides. The Slovenes occupied the city on 1 December 1918. In 1919, Mikl served as adjutant in the 1st Battalion of the Volkswehr militia, which used arms provided by the provincial government of Carinthia to make an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Radkersburg from forces of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to ensure it remained part of German-Austria. The provincial government of Styria, which had not supported these actions, subsequently issued a warrant ordering Mikl's arrest for treason. Despite his failure, his actions were very important in demonstrating to those negotiating the final border that towns along the northern bank of the Mura river were German. When the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed later in 1919, Radkersburg was retained within what became the First Austrian Republic.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised <b>nation</b> <b>states,</b> reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
