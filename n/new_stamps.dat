5|$|Between 1982 and 1988 {{a series}} based on Irish {{architecture}} {{through the ages}} was released, with line drawings by Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish cultural heritage followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish birds feature in the 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency {{to the introduction of}} the Euro. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. On 9 September 2004 <b>new</b> <b>stamps,</b> featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland, become available. These were replaced in September 2010 by a seventh series featuring animals and marine life using photographic images.|$|E
5|$|From 1948, H.R. Holmes {{had been}} the curator but in the late 1950s had wished to {{relinquish}} the post. A replacement curator was not easily found and {{the care of the}} Collections was managed on a part-time basis. A security crisis in 1959 developed after it was discovered that the contents of one of the frames in the Tapling Collection was missing. In 1961 James A. Mackay was recruited as a research assistant {{to take care of the}} Collections. In 1971 the police arrested Mackay (promoted to Assistant Keeper in 1965) and charged him with stealing items from the British Museum Philatelic Collections on loan from the Crown Agents. The stolen progressive proofs (test prints of stamp designs) should have been returned to the Crown Agents for destruction and were valued at £7,600. Mackay had exchanged the proofs for Winston Churchill stamps worth £400. He was fined £1,000 and dismissed from the Museum. As a result of the thefts, security was improved by recruiting Bob Schoolley-West, one of the investigating police officers. The Crown Agents withdrew their agreement for lending <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> for display in the King's Library.|$|E
50|$|The first {{breast cancer}} {{awareness}} stamp in the U.S., featuring a pink ribbon, was issued 1996. As {{it did not}} sell well, a <b>new</b> <b>stamp</b> {{with an emphasis on}} research was designed. The <b>new</b> <b>stamp</b> does not feature the pink ribbon.|$|R

25|$|After stamps were {{introduced}} in 1856, some post offices created new cancellation marks, while others used their existing handstamps bearing {{the name of the}} town for years to cancel the <b>new</b> <b>stamps,</b> so that very old handstamps can be found on stamped covers.|$|E

Israel stamps have distinctive tabs, {{on the margins of}} printed sheets, with inscriptions in Hebrew and usually English or French. The design of national and local postmarks is also popular.|$|E

25|$|Although the stamps {{were not}} officially issued for sale until 6 May 1840, some offices {{such as those}} in Bath sold the stamps unofficially before that date. There are covers postmarked 2 May, and a single example is known on cover dated 1 May 1840. All London post offices {{received}} official supplies of the <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> but other offices throughout the United Kingdom did not, continuing to accept payments for postage in cash for a period.|$|E
25|$|But at {{the onset}} of the American Civil War, Lincoln's {{postmaster}} general, Montgomery Blair faced a federal postal system regionally disabled by seceding states and disloyal postmasters. To prevent possible fraud potentially amounting to $270,000 in postage and stamped envelopes held in the South, the existing stamps were withdrawn and demonetized, and a new series of stamps was hurriedly issued. With the previous contract ending June 10, 1861, the Post Office Department signed a contract with the National Bank Note Company of New York City. Loyal postmasters in seceded states returned stamps to the Department. The <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> were in use across the Union by mid-August 1861 with the same denominations and honoring the same persons as the previous issue, but all of the designs had changed.|$|E
25|$|In June 1847 {{the mine}} captain, John Spargo, {{proposed}} {{a number of}} improvements, including the installation of a 50ft (15m) waterwheel and <b>new</b> <b>stamps,</b> and the sinking of new shafts, the whole costing a total of nearly £1,000. Much of this work was undertaken, but by October the same year, the first signs that all was not well appeared in The Mining Journal. The shares had not been well taken up {{and the lack of}} money was causing problems. By the following March it was reported that the mine could not continue in operation and a final call of £1 per share was being made to clear the debts of the company. It was clear that no tin had been sold.|$|E

25|$|The stamps {{were printed}} by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing which had only {{six weeks to}} design, print and {{distribute}} the issues to customers for use on mail to Germany {{in time for the}} departing flight. However U.S. the Post Office would only receive a small profit of 6.5% of the stamp’s denomination for letters that would actually be carried aboard the Graf Zeppelin. The German Zeppelin Airship Works would receive most of the profit for those stamps that were actually used to pay postage and were carried by their airship. The U.S. Post Office still agreed to issue the stamps anticipating that most of the stamps sold would be to stamp collectors eager to add the <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> to their stamp collections, and consequently would be retaining all of the revenue generated.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half year of its {{inception}} the Parcel Post service with its new series of special stamps proved to be very successful, resulting with the mailing of more than 300 million parcels during this short period. But after much confusion among and pressure from postal workers, the Post Office Department acquiesced and the Postmaster General authorized the use of ordinary postage stamps to pay the postage on 4th class parcels, beginning on July 1, 1913, ending mandatory use of the <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> after precisely six months. In turn Parcel Post stamps were allowed for use to pay the postage for all classes of mail until the supply finally ran out. This is the only series of stamps issued by the Post Office that have ever been allowed dual usage. The last printing of Parcel Post stamps, a run of the 10-cent value, occurred on June 24, 1913, but stamps still in stock continued to be shipped to post offices for quite some time, particularly of higher values, with the final delivery—a supply of 75-cent stamps—made as late as 1921. Although the stamps were discontinued, one new denomination of the series—20 cents—was deemed too useful to discard, and a 20 cent value was accordingly added to the existing definitive Washington-Franklin series.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1872, it was {{announced}} that <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> would soon be issued. [...] When they were not ready on time, a number of the Full Faced Hidalgo stamps which had been demonetized and returned to Mexico City were re-issued overprinted with the word [...] "Anotado", meaning [...] "accounted for." [...] These stamps were only used briefly until the <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> were available.|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{deliveries}} went to {{post offices}} on Monday, May 13. Aware {{of the potential}} for inverts, a number of collectors went to their local post offices to buy the <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> and {{keep an eye out for}} errors. Collector William T. Robey was one of those; he had written to a friend on May 10 mentioning that [...] "it would pay to be on the lookout for inverts". On May 14, Robey went to the post office to buy the <b>new</b> <b>stamps,</b> and as he wrote later, when the clerk brought out a sheet of inverts, [...] "my heart stood still". He paid for the sheet, and asked to see more, but the remainder of the sheets were normal.|$|E
2500|$|Stamp {{collecting}} is the collecting of {{postage stamps}} and related objects. It {{is related to}} philately which {{is the study of}} stamps. It {{has been one of the}} world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service. [...] Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} famous [...] "errors" [...] during the 1960s. The 1961 {{definitive}} was initially released {{with the name}} of the country wrongly spelt in Bengali i.e. [...] "Shakistan" [...] instead of Pakistan. The error was corrected and <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> released. In 1968, the government printed stamps commemorating the Bengali poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. However, the birth year was out by a hundred years: 1989 instead of 1889. Although these stamps were not issued, a few of them did find their way into the market.|$|E

50|$|In 1913, a <b>new</b> <b>stamp</b> was {{prepared}} {{with the same}} design but with the inscription altered reflecting {{the fact that the}} stamp was also valid for fiscal (revenue) use. This was printed by De La Rue with a Multiple Crown CA watermark, and was ready by 1919. Since supplies of the 1899 stamp remained in stock, only 1530 copies were ordered (51 sheets of 30). It had been intended that the release of the <b>new</b> <b>stamp</b> should be delayed until supplies of the older one were exhausted. However, an oversight at the Valletta post office resulted in it being put on public sale on 6 March 1919. Due to the few copies printed, the stamps sold out within a couple of days.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 February 1837, Sir Rowland Hill {{proposed}} {{to a government}} enquiry both {{the idea of a}} pre-paid stamp and a pre-paid envelope, a separate sheet folded to form an enclosure for carrying letters. Hill was given a two-year contract to run the new system, and together with Henry Cole he announced a competition to design the <b>new</b> <b>stamps.</b> There were some 2,600 entries, but none was considered suitable; instead a rough design endorsed by Hill was chosen, featuring an easily recognisable profile of the former Princess Victoria. [...] Hill believed this would be difficult to forge. An envelope bearing a reproduction of a design created by the artist William Mulready was also issued.|$|E
2500|$|In 1901, a {{new series}} of {{definitive}} stamps was issued, replacing the small Hermes heads and the overprints of 1900. The <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> depicted Giovanni da Bologna's statue of Hermes/Mercury (c. 1564). The series included fourteen denominations in three different designs: 1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3 and 5 drachmae. The high values of this series are notable for being printed in metallic colors; bronze (2d), silver (3d), and gold (5d). The stamps were printed on two qualities of paper (thick and thin) with watermark [...] "ET" [...] and crown. The sheets were delivered with perforation 13½ for the low values and 11½ for the high values, although small quantities were delivered with different perforations.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 191213 {{were the}} first such stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office Department and {{consisted}} of twelve denominations to pay the postage on parcels weighing 16 ounces and more, with each denomination printed in the same color of [...] "carmine-rose". Their border design was similar while each denomination of stamp bore its own distinctive image in the vignette. Unlike regular postage items, whose rates were determined by weight in ounces, Parcel Post rates were determined and measured by increments in pounds. The <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> were soon widely used by industry, farmers and others who lived in rural areas. Partly owing to some confusion involving their usage, their exclusive use as Parcel Post stamps proved short lived, as regular postage stamps were soon allowed {{to be used to}} pay parcel postage rates.|$|E
