Their 5–7 final record, while <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> qualify for a bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E
5|$|Excluding a few {{controversial}} claims, scientists {{agree that}} all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record {{has been interpreted}} to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity {{during the last few}} million years of the Cretaceous, {{and it may be that}} the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> permit researchers to distinguish between the options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.|$|E

Middlesex won that game comfortably and therefore gained promotion to Division 1 for the 2008 Season. There was less success in the two knockout cups where Middlesex failed to progress beyond the group stages of either tournament. In the Friends Provident Trophy they finished 7th of the ten teams in the Southern Division.

25|$|Brady {{attended}} Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, {{where he}} graduated in 1995; the ceremony was held at St. Mary's Cathedral. He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady's football career started as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> start on the 0–8 JV team that had not scored a touchdown all year. However, when the starting quarterback went down with an injury, he ascended to the starting position. He became the varsity starter his junior year and held the position until he graduated. By Brady's senior year, he struggled getting on the radar of college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them out to schools he would consider attending. This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation.|$|E
25|$|In Lightfoot's final season, the Vandals {{finished}} with an 18–10 (9–5 conference) record. For {{the third consecutive}} season he led the team in scoring, {{this time with a}} 25.4 points per game average. On December 21, he scored a still-standing school record 50points against Gonzaga, including a career-high 8-for-11 shooting performance on three-point field goals. He had been in foul trouble early in the game and was forced to sit out for 10minutes in the first half, so his 50points came in only 30minutes of playing time. In addition, his teammates only scored a combined 19points, and the Vandals lost the game 76 to 69. Lightfoot then repeated as the conference player of the year, joining Montana's Larry Krystkowiak at the only two players to achieve the feat at least twice up until that point. Although the team achieved moderate success that season, they were <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> play in any postseason tournaments. Lightfoot's individual success during the year, and {{over the course of his}} career at the school, saw him graduate in 1994 as the most decorated player in the university's history and one of the Big Sky Conference's greatest players of all time.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the book chronicles James Bond's {{starting}} attendance at Eton College, {{which is one of the}} best schools in England. There he meets Pritpal, the son of an Indian Maharajah. The two become good friends and live together in the dorms along with another of his friends, a Chinese boy named Tommy Chong. Bond also comes into contact with George Hellebore, an American bully three years older than James. George's father, Lord Randolph Hellebore is an armament dealer who sold weapons to various countries after World War I. It is later revealed that Lord Hellebore knew Bond's father, Andrew Bond, who also sold arms while working for Vickers after the war. Lord Hellebore arrives at Eton to direct and host a tournament cup ("Hellebore Cup") for the boys. The competition is divided into three events: shooting, swimming, and running, It is rumoured that George Hellebore is supposed to win, but an unexpected rival named Andrew Carlton manages to beat him. Bond places seventh in shooting, fourth in his heat in swimming (which was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the final race), and first in cross country running. During the running sequence Lord Hellebore attempts to help his son cheat so that he could win the tournament; however, Bond after seeing George take a shortcut a first time decides to follow George the next time, and being the superior runner then passes him to win the race. George tries to trip James with his leg but loses his balance and falls into a mud puddle. Because Bond won first in running, Andrew Carlton is the winner and George Hellebore came in third place in the cup overall, which was unacceptable by his father's standard.|$|E
