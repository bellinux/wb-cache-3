5000|$|... 1985-2001: {{straight}} <b>non-driven</b> {{front axle}} for two-wheel drive only ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{forces on}} a <b>non-driven</b> wheel are braking and turning forces.|$|E
50|$|The K-44 was 27% more {{expensive}} than the corresponding Sisu K-34 6×2 with a <b>non-driven</b> front axle and same capacity.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] Detail. The {{final drive}} {{is outside the}} {{internally}} mounted wheel sets on one side. Here can be seen the <b>non-driven</b> side.|$|E
50|$|The {{foremost}} axle on the {{tandem axle}} is powered. When fully loaded, the K-44 carries approximately 62% {{of the weight}} lying on the tandem axle. The rear, <b>non-driven</b> axle, {{is linked to the}} driven axle through a simple sub-assembly consisting of 3.5 in wide and 1500 mm long leaf springs and rocker arms. When the torque delivered to the rear axle is increased, the mechanism automatically shifts vehicle weight away from the <b>non-driven</b> axle to the driven axle, improving traction when most needed. Additionally, more of the weight can be moved to the driven axle manually using an electro hydraulic system. In order to reduce fuel consumption and tyre wear the <b>non-driven</b> rear axle can also be raised completely off the road/surface, if a third load-bearing axle is not needed because the vehicle is running empty: running on just two axles also reduces the K-44's turning circle.|$|E
50|$|Other driving schemes use diodes {{to isolate}} <b>non-driven</b> solenoids, which allows only the discs whose state need {{changing}} to be flipped. This uses less power, {{and may be}} more robust.|$|E
5000|$|One leading idle (<b>non-driven)</b> axle {{mounted in}} a bogie, four driven axles {{mounted in the}} frame and {{connected}} by driving rods or gears, followed one trailing idle axle mounted in a bogie (Whyte notation: 2-8-2).|$|E
50|$|Sisu Axles' core {{business}} are planetary reduction axles but also <b>non-driven</b> steering axles are produced. Both {{the front and}} rear axles are for single and multi axle applications. The main segments are heavy-duty trucks for on- and off-road use and also industrial and military applications.|$|E
5000|$|The wheel size is 7.5-20" [...] {{and each}} wheel {{is held in}} place with ten nuts. Both axles on the bogie are fitted with double wheels as {{standard}} other than on the K-44ST, which made do with single wheels on the <b>non-driven</b> rearmost axle.|$|E
50|$|The 4-6-4 {{arrangement}} was {{seen on the}} PRR only on electric locomotives. As a steam locomotive arrangement, it was poorly suited to the PRR's mountainous terrain, wasting much potential adhesive weight on <b>non-driven</b> wheels. That it was so widely used by the rival New York Central would also likely have factored against PRR adoption.|$|E
50|$|The {{driven axles}} for the {{container}} handling equipment are with planetary reduction. The single non-steering axle capacity is 30-32 tonnes; the tandem applications are rated to 26-41 tonnes. The driven steering axles are with 12-18 tonnes capacity and the <b>non-driven</b> option is only available with 10 tonnes capacity. S-cam and disc brakes are applied on both steering and non-steering axles, the heavier steering driven option being fitted with wedge brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The Class ED62 {{locomotives}} {{were created}} between 1974 and 1979 by modifying the 18 earlier JNR Class ED61 Bo-Bo electric locomotives {{with the addition}} of a centre <b>non-driven</b> axle. Rebuilding was carried out at JNR's Nagano Works. The primary aim of rebuilding was to reduce the axle load (from 15 t to 13 t) for use on the Iida Line, where the class displaced vintage [...] (English Electric) and JNR Class ED19 (Westinghouse) locomotives, and later JNR Class EF10 locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The Sisu K-44 was {{expressly}} {{designed for}} good rough-terrain capability. The vehicle's ability to grip on {{many types of}} terrain and retain traction on steep slopes is further enhanced by a mechanism whereby the <b>non-driven</b> rear axle could be raised, thus maximising the proportion of vehicle weight available to push down on the driven axle {{at the front of}} the tandem axle. On a surface with friction coefficient of μ=0.65 its maximum gradeability is 86%. A corresponding 6×4-model has a 55% and a 6×2-model just a 29% gradeability.|$|E
50|$|The driven truck axles {{are with}} {{planetary}} reduction, single axle capacity being 10-14 tonnes for steering and 10-20.5 tonnes for non-steering axles; the tandem configurations for the steering axles are rated to 20-28 tonnes and non-steering 20-41 tonnes. The non-steering axles {{are also available}} as tridem configurations with 39-61.5 tonnes. The capacities of steering, non driven axles are between 8 and 12 tonnes. Some <b>non-driven,</b> non-steering axles with a capacity of 13 tonnes {{are also in the}} selection. The non-steering axles are with S-cam drum brakes, whereas some of the steering axles are equipped with disc or wedge brakes.|$|E
5000|$|... "Applied torque" [...] {{may either}} be driving torque applied by a motor (often through a transmission) or a braking torque applied by brakes(including {{regenerative}} braking). Such torques results in energy dissipation (above {{that due to}} the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, <b>non-driven,</b> non-braked wheel). This additional loss is {{in part due to}} the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.|$|E
50|$|Tom {{must build}} a {{locomotive}} engine {{to compete with}} the best engines of the time, an engine under the patent of Jandel. The result is the Hercules 0001, an electric locomotive measuring 90 feet long, 14 feet tall and weighing almost 275 tons. The engine is powered by a pantograph connection to dual overhead catenary lines providing 3,000 volts DC. The engine is laid out with two <b>non-driven</b> trucks of four wheels on either end, and 12 driving wheels of 70-inch diameter. The layout of the driving wheels is never explicitly mentioned, but the configuration would be either 4-12-4 or 4-6-0+0-6-4 (see Whyte notation). Each axle is independently powered. The output of the engine is estimated at 4400 horsepower.|$|E
5000|$|Sesspir - In 1984-85 the CSIR {{developed}} a prototype Casspir with six wheels. An additional <b>non-driven</b> axle was fitted {{in front of}} the front drive axle, this to be sacrificed {{in the event of a}} landmine detonation. It steered along with the regular driven front wheels and was equipped with winch cables to hoist either side of the axle clear off the ground in the event of the loss of a wheel. The theory being the vehicle would remain mobile. The idea was shelved as one of numerous problems was simply a lack of power from the engine to push the undriven axle along through bush and soft sand. Only one prototype was built.|$|E
50|$|By {{this point}} the POP had {{demonstrated}} a number of problems, and the engineers {{took the opportunity to}} start a major overhaul of the design. The main problem was the design of the <b>non-driven</b> bogies, which were not stable and could not be used for high speed runs. One power car was retained at the lab while the other and the two passenger cars were sent to the nearby Derby Works for modification. The main changes were to stiffen the power cars and replace the suspect bogies with a version of the powered bogie with the motors removed. Other changes included the removal of the ceramic recuperators from the turbines for reliability reasons, although this dramatically increased fuel use, and the addition of a small seating area to the passenger car for VIP use.|$|E
50|$|Single axle {{semi-trailers}} were {{commonly used}} for log transportation in Finland in the 1960s. The maximum axle load of the existing 4×4 Sisu K-40 was often exceeded in logging work. The solution was a truck incorporating {{the addition of a}} <b>non-driven</b> third axle at the back, paired in a tandem axle with the rear driven axle. The new model, the Sisu K-44, was introduced in 1959, with a choice of engine sizes for both the middle-weight ("Kontio") and the heavy ("Jyry") classes. The K-44's driven front axle and transfer case were borrowed from the existing K-40, while the bogie, of which only the first axle was driven, came from the K-34. This drivetrain layout, called 4×4+2, is seldom seen outside Finland. However, Vanajan Autotehdas, SAT's main domestic competitor, had already introduced a similarly configured vehicle a year earlier.|$|E
50|$|A {{revolving}} center, {{also known}} as a live center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the <b>non-driven</b> or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|E
5000|$|The Navigator had address {{geocoding}} (the {{ability to}} convert a street address to a latitude/longitude point). It worked {{by using a}} digital compass mounted somewhere in the car (typically inside the headliner) and two wheel sensors mounted on the <b>non-driven</b> wheels (with magnetic strips installed on the wheel rims themselves). The system used map-matching augmented dead reckoning. [...] The user entered {{the location of the}} car where it was first installed, and took it on a short calibration drive. From then on, the system self-corrected: error accumulated through dead reckoning could usually be reduced by checking to see if the current location and direction of movement corresponded to a street in the map data. These and other techniques developed by Etak would perhaps now be viewed as very high-end features for a car navigation system. At the time, however, because there was no GPS to provide an approximate absolute location, they were critically important.|$|E
50|$|Park (P): This {{selection}} mechanically {{locks the}} output shaft of transmission, restricting the vehicle from moving in any direction. A parking pawl prevents the transmission from rotating, {{and therefore the}} vehicle from moving. However, the vehicle's <b>non-driven</b> wheels are still free to rotate, and the driven wheels may still rotate individually (because of the differential). For this reason, it is recommended to use the hand brake (parking brake) because this actually locks (in most cases) the wheels and prevents them from moving. It is typical of front-wheel-drive vehicles for the parking brake to lock the rear (non-driving) wheels, so use of both the parking brake and the transmission park lock provides the greatest security against unintended movement on slopes. This also increases {{the life of the}} transmission and the park pin mechanism, because parking on an incline with the transmission in park without the parking brake engaged will cause undue stress on the parking pin, and may even prevent the pin from releasing. A hand brake should also prevent the car from moving if a worn selector accidentally drops into reverse gear while idling.|$|E
40|$|This book {{comprehensively}} {{and systematically}} introduces readers to the theories, structures, performance and applications of <b>non-driven</b> mechanical and <b>non-driven</b> micromechanical gyroscopes. The book {{is divided into}} three parts, the first of which mainly addresses mathematic models, precision, performance and operating error in <b>non-driven</b> mechanical gyroscopes. The second part focuses on the operating theory, error, phase shift and performance experiments involving <b>non-driven</b> micromechanical gyroscopes in rotating flight carriers, while the third part shares insights into the application of <b>non-driven</b> micromechanical gyroscopes in control systems for rotating flight carriers. The book offers a unique resource for all researchers and engineers who are interested in the use of inertial devices and automatic control systems for rotating flight carriers.   It can also serve as a reference book for undergraduates, graduates and instructors in related fields at colleges and universities...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well-known}} that the classical Mullins-Sekerka problem exhibits kinetic scaling such that R(t)[*]∝[*]t 1 / 3 (Lifshitz & Slyozov, 1961; Rahaman, 2003; Mullins & Sekerka, 1963; Niethammer, 2000; Dai et al., 2010). Lifshitz and Slyozov {{were the first}} to show that a collection of second phase particles follows such cubic growth kinetics (Lifshitz & Slyozov, 1961). The connection between the phase field model B (Cahn-Hilliard equation) and the diffusion-controlled LSW theory was discussed before by Bray (1994). However, only weakly driven systems can be considered to behave asymptotically as <b>non-driven</b> systems. In general, such kinetic scaling laws will not hold for driven systems since the supersaturation is not decaying with time as in <b>non-driven</b> systems.|$|E
30|$|To {{validate}} the effects described in Section Boundary Layer Control, a {{wind tunnel test}} was conducted for the belt-driven wing and the <b>non-driven</b> wing, both of which had the same airfoil shape. The measuring ranges of angle of attack are until stall angles.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the behaviour of two non-linearly coupled flexural modes of a doubly clamped suspended beam (nanomechanical resonator). One of the modes is externally driven. We demonstrate that classically, {{the behavior of}} the <b>non-driven</b> mode is reminiscent of that of a parametrically driven linear oscillator: it exhibits a threshold behavior, with the amplitude of this mode below the threshold being exactly zero. Quantum-mechanically, we were able to access the dynamics of this mode below the classical parametric threshold. We show that whereas the mean displacement of this mode is still zero, the mean squared displacement is finite and at the threshold corresponds to the occupation number of 1 / 2. This finite displacement of the <b>non-driven</b> mode can serve as an experimentally verifiable quantum signature of quantum motion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{works have}} {{demonstrated}} that the Floquet-Bloch bands of periodically-driven systems feature a richer topological structure than their <b>non-driven</b> counterparts. The additional structure in the driven case arises from the periodicity of quasienergy, the energy-like quantity that defines the spectrum of a periodically-driven system. Here we develop a new paradigm for the topological classification of Floquet-Bloch bands, based on the time-dependent spectrum of the driven system's evolution operator throughout one driving period. Specifically, we show that this spectrum may host topologically-protected degeneracies at intermediate times, which control the topology of the Floquet bands of the full driving cycle. This approach provides a natural framework for incorporating the role of symmetries, enabling a unified and complete classification of Floquet-Bloch bands and yielding new insight into the topological features that distinguish driven and <b>non-driven</b> systems.

30|$|With the {{airspeed}} of {{the wind}} tunnel fixed at 10  m/s, two different belt speeds (10 and 20  m/s) were tested. The lift and drag were compared for the belt-driven and <b>non-driven</b> wings under these conditions. The measuring ranges of angle of attack are until stall angles. Under these conditions, the Reynolds number was 1.1 [*]×[*] 105.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of GeographyMelinda DanielsGeomorphic {{properties}} of streams {{are linked to}} ecosystem function through processes related to storage, transport, and other drivers regulating biogeochemical conditions. Disturbances altering the physical template of a stream are associated with cascading impacts on ecosystem function. However, few disturbances are studied at long time scales and so the legacy of such events and the implications for ecosystem structure and function are not well understood. This research investigates the role of historic tie-driving, a channel disturbance legacy, in shaping present-day stream channel conditions in the Rocky Mountain region and the associated implications for organic matter dynamics. Using a combination of geomorphic and riparian surveys, organic matter and vegetation sampling, and modeling, I show that components of mountain stream ecosystems have recovered from tie-driving at varying rates. First, I addressed how tie-driving has altered channel morphology and wood loading. Tie-driven streams are narrower, shallower, less rough, and have less wood than <b>non-driven</b> reference reaches. In a second study, I focused on differences in carbon storage within the stream and riparian area between tie-driven and <b>non-driven</b> streams. Carbon stored on the landscape represents a long-term component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and some, but not all, components have been impacted by tie-driving. Large instream wood, coarse downed wood, and fine downed wood were identified as carbon storage components that were significantly smaller in tie-driven stream-riparian corridors. Finally, I modeled whole stream ecosystem metabolism and tested whether abiotic drivers influenced variations in rates of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Results from this work suggest that rates of GPP were significantly different between tie-driven and <b>non-driven</b> streams and were partially explained by variations in light related to canopy structure. However, variations in ER and NEP {{were not significantly different}} between tie-driven and <b>non-driven</b> sites. Taken as a whole, this work shows that ecosystems bear the imprint of historic disturbances but individual ecosystem components recover at differing rates. Additionally, integrating stream hydro-geomorphic and ecological dynamics is an effective approach to understanding the impact of channel disturbances in shaping ecosystem function at a variety of spatial and temporal scales...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{active safety}} control methods for cars, i. e., the {{antilock}} braking system (ABS), the traction control system (TCS), and electronic stability control (ESC), govern the wheel slip control based on the wheel slip ratio, which relies on the information from <b>non-driven</b> wheels. However, these methods are not applicable in the cases without <b>non-driven</b> wheels, e. g., a four-wheel decentralized electric vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes a new wheel slip control approach based on a novel data fusion method to ensure good traction performance in any driving condition. Firstly, with the proposed data fusion algorithm, the acceleration estimator makes use of the data measured by the sensor installed near the vehicle center of mass (CM) to calculate the reference acceleration of each wheel center. Then, the wheel slip is constrained by controlling the acceleration deviation between the actual wheel and the reference wheel center. By comparison with non-control and model following control (MFC) cases in double lane change tests, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control method has significant anti-slip effectiveness and stabilizing control performance...|$|E
40|$|Using {{electrical}} {{machine in}} conventional vehicles, also called hybrid vehicles, {{has become a}} promising control scheme that enables some manners for fuel economy and driver assist for better stability. In this paper, vehicle stability control, fuel economy and Driving/Regeneration braking for a 4 WD hybrid vehicle is investigated by using an electrical machine on each <b>non-driven</b> wheels. Fourteen degree of freedom vehicle body modeling and ADVISOR power-train/electrical components model {{will be used for}} modeling. Driving/Regeneration and stability enhancement are important in low and high speed respectively. The unequaled independent torques applied to the <b>non-driven</b> wheels provides the ability of vehicle dynamic control to assist the driver with path correction, thus enhancing cornering and straight-line stability and providing enhanced safety. So power managing between engine and electrical machines will be provided the fuel economy and regeneration in braking condition. For these goals, power management and Yaw moment control will be down in low and high speed respectively by proper fuzzy controller. Finally, a series of MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation will carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed structure...|$|E

When {{one of the}} two coupled beams is driven at elevated amplitudes, the excitation of dominant and recessive modes is observed in the driven and <b>non-driven</b> beams respectively. This anomalous nature of auto-parametric excitation has been unexplored by both theory and experiments and falls outside the scope of the conventional description of parametric resonance.

It was demonstrated that a micro-machined pendulum installed in rotating carrier, using the spinning of rotating carrier instead of traditional gyroscope's driving force produced by its structure form a <b>non-driven</b> micro- machined gyroscope. The new micro-machined gyroscope can output pitching, yawing and rolling angular velocity of the rotating carrier, which is equivalent to three traditional gyroscopes...|$|E
40|$|As a {{proof of}} principle, we show how a {{classical}} nonlinear Hamiltonian {{system can be}} driven resonantly over reasonably long times by appropriately shaped pulses. To keep the parameter space reasonably small, we limit ourselves to a driving force which consists of periodic pulses additionally modulated by a sinusoidal function. The main observables are the average increase of kinetic energy and of the action variable (of the <b>non-driven</b> system) with time. Applications of our scheme aim for driving high frequencies of a nonlinear system with a fixed modulation signal...|$|E
