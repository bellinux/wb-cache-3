An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.|$|E

Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played.|$|E

5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

He assembles a large marching band composed of various Bikini Bottom residents.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, a basin {{was built}} above Framilode lock, so that vessels could wait {{there until the}} tide in the Severn was at a {{suitable}} level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built, and the canal was {{the only part of}} the waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames that did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>one.</b> It was completed in August 1827. The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other. The new company paid for its construction.> After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to Sharpness in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.|$|E

5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E

However, the youth within al-Fatat founded the Arab Independence Party ("al-Istiqlal") in February 1919. Its goal was to achieve unity and complete Arab independence. Prominent members included Izzat Darwaza and Shukri al-Quwatli. Centered in Damascus with branches in various cities throughout the Levant, al-Istiqlal received political and financial support from Faysal, but relied on the inner circle of al-Fatat to survive.|$|E

25|$|During {{the middle}} {{portion of the}} 20th century, there were a {{substantial}} number of synagogues which considered themselves Orthodox but did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>one.</b> However, the Orthodox Union (OU), the main body of Modern Orthodox synagogues in the United States, adopted a policy of not accepting synagogues without mechitzot as new members, and strongly encouraging existing synagogues to adopt them. Men and women are generally not separated in most Conservative synagogues, although it is a permissible option within Conservative Judaism; some Conservative synagogues, particularly in Canada, have one or have separate seating for men and women without a physical partition. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, consistent with their view that traditional religious law is not mandatory in modern times and a more liberal interpretation of gender roles, do not use mechitzot in their synagogues.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to HTTP proxies {{is to use}} {{one of a number of}} add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs, which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink.
