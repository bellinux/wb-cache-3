The explanation the scientists agreed on was empathy. Most married couples that have been together for 25 years (or longer) can identify with the other person's feelings. A lot of human emotions and feelings are expressed through the face, and when two people make similar facial expressions for 25 years, it could result in similar wrinkle patterns.|$|E

There was also a significant positive correlation between the FSIQ and educational achievement score that represented by college Grade Point Average (GPA, n = 51). The four indexes of the WAIS-IV-ID had a significant positive correlation with the SPM, CFIT, and WBIS, except for Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI). We found significant correlations between full-scale IQ with GPA. For the index score, we found significant correlations between Processing Speed Index (PSI) with GPA but not with other indexes. We conclude that the WAIS-IV-ID is valid externally. Future direction for validation is examining the diagnostic utility of WAIS-IV with special groups...|$|R

According to Oku (1998), argument ellipsis is permitted in languages like Japanese but not in languages like English. To account for this cross-linguistic difference, he proposes that the parameter of a verb's θ-feature strength governs both the type of ellipsis {{and the availability of}} scrambling. Based on this parameter, it is assumed that the input of scrambling in a target language serves as a trigger for parameter resetting. If so, L 2 learners with the knowledge of ellipsis also have the knowledge of scrambling, but the converse is not true. 21 adult L 2 learners who were never taught the ellipsis in their target language were tested. They were asked to judge the elliptical sentences and scrambled sentences in each target language through the picture judgment task and acceptability task, respectively. The results show that while all the participants who passed in the ellipsis condition also passed in the scrambling condition, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> who passed in the scrambling condition passed in the ellipsis condition.

Besides, the purpose is to find out if their beliefs when giving a lesson are strong enough to coincide with other teachers’ practices based on different approaches of second language instruction. The analyzed corpus consists of 5 ESL Chilean teachers; 2 females and 3 males, all around the age of thirty years old. They all currently live and work in Chilean cities and have more than 5 years of teaching experience in different educational contexts. The eliciting technique was a structured survey, where the informants were asked to answer open ended questions, to face a lesson taught through three different teaching methods (Grammar translation, Audio-lingual and the Communicative approaches), to finally mark preferences in a Likert scale. The results confirm the importance of having clear and strong beliefs, and how these determine the way we think, act and make decisions when giving an ESL lesson; which is consistent with the reviewed literature about teaching beliefs. Also, even though <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were consistent in their responses, most of them showed coincidences between what they declare as their own teaching practices and what they believe about other teachers’ instruction. The study will benefit different actors belonging to the teaching context.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis to so solve a {{limitation}} in the switchover mechanism of a Mobile IP (MIP) client device where it fails to change the active Mobile IP leg in a scenario where the current used path is just marginally good. The MIP client is a Cisco 819 router that provides internet connectivity to end users via an internal radio interface to a public Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and an external modem connected via an Ethernet port. When Mobile IP fails to properly select the active leg, the end user’s experience detriments and is unable to continue normal operation, this is why a mechanism is needed to probe the available networks and to select the best one for the end user. This work studies different vertical handover mechanisms {{that could be used}} in this type of environments where not only, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> of the handover selection are radio interfaces; as in this case one interface is an external device, but also where most of the physical information of an interface is not available to use as part of a handover algorithm. This thesis proposes three different mechanisms to choose the best available network at any given time to complement the Mobile IP operation. The first mechanism is based on Round-Trip-Time (RTT), the next mechanism uses immediate throughput as the metric for the network selection and the final proposal is a muti-attribute algorithm where very poor networks will be filtered by their larger RTT values first and only then will the immediate available throughput will be measured. The results show that the three mechanisms provided a decrease in the downtime experienced by the end user where the RTT-based algorithm had the lowest increase in performance and the immediate-throughput-based proposal had the highest increase. The multi-attribute mechanism; while not top performing in terms of less downtime, significantly reduced the amount of time it took to select the new network and thus provides better end user experience...|$|E

The theoretical part of the thesis is aimed at explanation of considerable difference between freetekno and commercial techno scene as postmodern subcultures, which are often perceived as a whole, where even the visitors themselves often do not know the difference between both the subcultures or the origin of their symbols. In the second, research part of the thesis I identify which drugs are preferred at freetekno parties and which at the commercial techno scene and what the reasons for using different types of drugs at the described scenes are, from what age, how often and with whom the participants visit the parties, motivation to visiting such events, whether they take psychotropic substances at the party and distribution of drugs at the parties.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyse the role that country-of-origin (COO) clusters have on the transnationalization of firms. We adopt the view of the COO cluster as location mode in distant markets like China. To this end, the empirical research framework seeks to address the following research question: 1. Which challenges are the subsidiaries facing in China {{as a result of the}} business environment and practices there? Do they differ among subsidiaries? This question takes a macro level point of view where the general environment where the subsidiaries are doing business is analysed. This part of the research provides information about the business liabilities in China. To answer this question related to the IB approach, there is a perspective that complement that of IB, i. e. the economic geography (EG) view, which analyses the territories, its organizational models and its participants. We may think that FDI agglomeration can act as a mechanism to reduce those challenges. In this sense, we propose the second research question: 2. Which externalities do COO FDI agglomerations provide? Do they differ among subsidiaries? This research question analyses the reasons why firms locate in FDI cluster and the advantages they obtain from this kind of geographical agglomerations. For that it analyses the perceptions that the subsidiary managers have about their localization and the positive value that this location mode provides (as a mean to access market, resources or others. Country-of-origin clusters provide a net effect on the but not much is known about the conditions in which that net effect is positive. This is linked to the strategic asset that emerges from the actors of the cluster and their relationships, i. e., the social capital. There is a heterogeneity and internal diversity among the participants. That is, although companies depart from the same place (country and region or origin) and come together and establish themselves in the same city in China, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> follow the same model of co-location, neither those who follow the same model perceive the reality in the same way. We thus propose the following third research question: 3. How is the role that geographic expatriates´ communities of practice have in COO clusters? How do they develop and build the social capital of the subsidiary network? Given the scarcity of theory in this area, addressing these questions warrants an in-depth qualitative study that allows to analyse how subsidiary managers build and exploit social capital internationally. This research question aims to understand how the international social capital of expatriates in a COO cluster is constructed, used and distributed among the members and how this configuration help the members in their internationalization process. This research combines qualitative and quantitative methodologies and is composed of 7 chapters. The context of the research is Kunshan, Jiangsu province, China. The sample used for the analysis of the first two research questions consists of 24 subsidiaries: 12 subsidiaries in Mondragón Kunshan Industrial Park- MKIP, 4 subsidiaries in Kunshan German Industrial Park- KGIP, 3 subsidiaries that planned to enter MKIP in 2013 and 5 isolated Basque subsidiaries (but located in Kunshan). For the research question related to social capital, the case study of Mondragon industrial park (MKIP) is analyzed. In general, networks and, in particular, country-of-origin clusters are an appropriate entry and location strategy that facilitate transnationalization of the firms and their landing in distant markets by generating knowledge advantages and reducing their liabilities abroad. Our work contributes to the agglomeration and network theories on IB by evidencing the potential that internationalization through geographical networks has. From this perspective, it also contributes to explain the formation of communities of practice and social capital at the host country level. Another theoretical implication is the linkage of the literature in Economic Geography and IB, which contributes to disentangle the space and the place of MNEs. From a practical point of view this research help companies take better localization decisions as there is an heterogeneity on the challenges faced, externalities gained and use of social capital from different location modes. At a political level, the research can enlighten the design and implementation of strategies that support enterprises in the internationalization process. Institutions should consider and promote these platforms as a viable tool that facilitates the internationalization process of the firms...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Title: How Diversity Influences the Work Process in Cooperation Projects Author: Sofia M Westerberg Supervisors: Marie Aurell, Marie Hemming Department: School of Management, Blekinge Institute of Technology Course: Master’s thesis in Business Administration, 10 credits Background: Cooperation beyond {{organizational}} boundaries {{becomes more}} necessary {{because of the}} changing nature of the business environment. The project as a form of organization is very well suited to carry out difficult tasks, not only within organizations but also between them. This means that the traditional view of looking at projects needs rethinking; there is a growing spectrum of projects with wider objectives and a broader scope, which leads to a higher degree of complexity and uncertainty. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to get {{a better understanding of how}} diversity influences the work process in a cooperation project. Because the cooperation project is becoming a more common phenomenon, it is interesting to learn more about how diversity has an impact on its work processes and characteristics. Hopefully this study can be one input to managers in making decisions about if a task shall be carried out in a cooperation project group or not, and if that should be the case, what implications this can have on the project and its outcomes. The research question is: How can diversity influence the work process in a cooperation project? Method: The thesis focuses on the development of the work process in a cooperation project, where the participants come from different organizations, and where there is a high degree of diversity. This is done through a literature review, observations and interviews. Theory: The theories are about cooperation projects, negotiation in small groups, uncertainty and complexity in projects and factors of diversity that influence the process; interests, conflicting interest, objectives, motivational orientation and trust. The FIRO-theory of group development (Fundamental Interpersonal Relationship Motivational orientation, Schutz 1989) is also used. Analysis: First a literature study was carried out and then methodologies were chosen. The analysis was made from observations and interviews and carried out on three levels; the individual level, the group level and the organizational level. First I looked at each individual’s own role and behaviour in the group, secondly and thirdly, the organizations´ own interests, objectives as well as the group’s interests, etc, were considered. The factors of diversity (interests, objectives, orientation and trust) were systemized and analyzed in relation to the three levels of analysis and then discussed in connection to the literature. The findings were combined with the work process and development phases of groups to see how this is influenced by the diversity. Conclusion: The diversity which exists in a cooperation project influences the work process in a number of ways. The findings in this study point to a number of issues. The diversity makes the group development phases more complex than in a traditional project. The two first phases of group development in the work process will probably take longer time. The work process is also more sensitive and steps back in development phases are more common than in a traditional project. Either development of trust takes longer time or only so called “swift trust” will develop. There are more environmental factors that influence the project. Because of the diversity, the formal positions of the representatives in the group become more important. Possible ways of handling the diversity are a general group assignment instead of a concrete objective and a delegated responsibility from the management to the project group. Two new forms of motivational orientation of group members were observed during this study. One form I have called “Changing motivational orientation”. The other form of motivational orientation I have named “More than cooperative”. In “Changing motivational orientation”, some of the members in the group turned from one motivational orientation to another one during the scope of the project. In being “More than cooperative” the members see the group’s assignment as the most important task. The study also shows that the so called “claiming-creation dilemma” (Schei and Rognes, 2005) is not always applicable. <b>Not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> saw the balancing between the interests and objectives of their own organization on the one hand and the assignment of the project group on the other. Some of them looked only at their organizations interests and some of them focused totally on the group assignment. The study also shows that the FIRO-model for group development is relevant also for cooperation projects, but with some adjustments, because the development phases takes longer time due to the issue of diversity...|$|E

Fifty-five Hong Kong Chinese (22 men and 33 women) aged 18 to 55 (M = 39. 50, SD = 10. 21) participated- 20 without physical disabilities (control group), 20 with visible physical disabilities, and 15 with physical disabilities that were <b>not</b> visible. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> responded to <b>the</b> Self-concept Questionnaire for Hong Kong Chinese With Physical Disabilities (SCQPD; S. F. Tam & D. Watkins, 1997). The group with visible disabilities scored significantly lower in self-concept {{than did the}} control group and the group with disabilities that were not visible. There were also significant differences between specific facets of self-concept for people with visible and not visible disabilities. It was interesting to find {{that there was no}} significant difference in self-concept levels between the not visible group and the control group. The implications for rehabilitation and social services for these various groups are discussed. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|R
30|$|Further {{light is}} thrown these ideas, with {{specific}} reference to MOOCs, {{in a paper}} that has particularly influenced my own decision to take my video-based presence further (Adams et al. 2014). Adams and her colleagues made a phenomenological analysis of the lived experiences of successful MOOC completers and concluded “…videos may open an unexpectedly intimate tutorial sphere with the instructor” (p. 208). Participants used expressions about their teachers such as “speaking directly to me”. An interesting example was of an addition to a previously recorded lecture where the professor had later recorded an audio addendum for the MOOC saying “I made a mistake there.” One participant felt that this had been addressed <b>not</b> only to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> but also specifically to him/herself.|$|R
30|$|Participants were 14 {{individuals}} (10 males) aged 5 to 46  years: three {{adults with}} Down syndrome and 11 individuals (children and adults) with a previous diagnosis of autism. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> with autism {{were divided into}} two groups. The first group (EI) consisted of seven subjects, aged 5 to 17  years. All had a history of early behavioral intervention, based on the ABA principles, with individualized curriculums constructed from behavioral evaluation data (CARS, PEP-R). All these participants, except EI 7, attended regular schools. All used speech to communicate, although with varying levels of fluency. The second group of individuals with autism (NI) was comprised of four young people and adults, aged 16 to 39  years, who attended a special education institution but had no history of individualized intervention. In the institution, they attended group activities for the development of daily living skills (e.g., cooking, manual tasks, self-care) and to learn a basic repertoire of reading through a computer program, which included matching to sample tasks. Two of these <b>participants</b> did <b>not</b> speak. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> with Down syndrome (28 to 46  years of age) used speech to communicate and, due to being adults, attended the same special education institution as the NI group.|$|R
50|$|Again on 15 July {{the attempt}} was called {{off at the}} last minute, for reasons which are <b>not</b> known because <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> phone conversations {{which led to the}} {{postponement}} were dead {{by the end of the}} year. Stauffenberg, depressed and angry, returned to Berlin. On 18 July rumours reached him that the Gestapo had wind of the conspiracy and that he might be arrested at any time - this was apparently not true, but there was a sense that the net was closing in and that the next opportunity to kill Hitler must be taken because there might not be another. At 10:00 hours on 20 July Stauffenberg flew back to the Wolfsschanze for another Hitler military conference, again with a bomb in his briefcase. It is remarkable in retrospect that despite Hitler’s mania for security, officers attending his conferences were not searched.|$|R
40|$|Medicine finds {{human blood}} {{infinitely}} useful. It {{is a source}} of important and sometimes controversial information about individuals, their relatives and the general public. Blood also has economic value, carries a heavy cultural freight, and can transmit dangerous diseases. Yet there is precious little sociological analysis of how these radically different applications, potentials and significations are managed in health care settings where, it is no exaggeration to claim, everyday a vast quantity of blood is produced by venepuncture. This paper focuses on blood produced in hospitals for tests. The data were derived from 19 focus groups of patients, health care professionals, and members of the public, held between 2002 and 2003, in and around the obstetrics and gynaecology department of a large London teaching hospital. <b>Not</b> surprisingly, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> had had a blood test at some time or other. Yet their responses suggest no template exists for talking about them. No-one [...] lay or professional [...] had a full picture of how blood produced for tests circulates around the hospital. Lay people tended to envisage it as remaining in a liquid form whereas health care professionals saw it as materially and substantially transformed. Participants deployed a variety of ritual and rhetorical devices that devalue blood produced for tests. Nonetheless, blood left over from tests emerged as a significant anomoly, simultaneously an excess (waste), a challenge (to use wisely), or a potential crime (illegitimate research).

30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} three phases. First, for each class section, an in-person session was conducted that briefly explained the study, goals, and conditions. In particular, it was communicated that some might see tutoring dialogs frequently while others might see them rarely or <b>not</b> at <b>all.</b> Neither <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> nor <b>the</b> instructor were told which condition any particular student was part of. Following this initial orientation, students present in class were {{given the opportunity to}} complete the BSDT. The pre-survey was provided to each student was a link for a point of extra credit, with up to two reminder emails sent during the first 2 weeks of class if it was not completed. During this period, as part of their normal classroom activities, ALEKS accounts were created and some students began to use the ALEKS system. Other students dropped or transferred out of the course (i.e., the early drops).|$|R
40|$|Throughout history, {{people have}} always felt the wish to meet, to talk and to interact. For getting in contact with a distant person, the {{telephone}} was the preferred medium for a long time. But hearing the word one person speaks makes up {{only a part of}} the message. Body language {{is an integral part of}} how humans communicate. As worldwide networking increases and more and more personal computers are equipped with multimedia capabilities, desktop videoconferencing systems have become more and more popular. In many cases these programs support the connection and interaction of only two participants. This report describes how the graphical user interface of an existing point-to-point videoconferencing application has been extended in order to support multiparty conferences. Designing a graphical user interface for point-to-point videoconferences is already a challenging task. In a multiparty scenario the problems of a two-party conference are sometimes exacerbated and sometimes new, specific problems appear. Multiparty conferences can take place in many different scenarios like moderated or non-moderated meetings, lectures, exams or presentations. Some of these scenarios allow <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> to start side conversations. Providing a sense for the group or establishing eye contact gets more difficult in a conference with more than two attendees. Furthermore we have to deal with the so-called visibility problem, i. e., probably <b>not</b> <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> can be displayed at the same time due to the limited screen size. Additionally, a developer of graphical user interfaces has to keep the usability aspects in mind...|$|R
