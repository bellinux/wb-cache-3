5|$|The {{longevity}} of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>overlooked</b> {{as a key}} factor in its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the {{longevity of}} Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.|$|E

25|$|The kanto singers of {{the period}} were also composers. Set to {{extraordinarily}} simple melodies which were the fashion of the day, the lyrics relied heavily of tensions {{between men and women}} as well as reflecting topical events. The compositions were in such fundamental makams as Rast, Hüzzam, Hicaz, Hüseyni and Nihavent. Kanto songs are remembered both by the names of their interpreters and by their creators, artists such as Peruz, Shamran, Kamelya, Eleni. Küçük and Büyük Amelya, Mari Ferha and Virjin.

A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [...] recovered so much ground in so short a time was in itself an achievement." [...] However, looking back across Home's career, The Times considered that his reputation rested not on his brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: [...] "He brought to the office... his capacity for straight talking, for toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted {{as a lack of}} sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia. But he brought something else as well: an unusual degree of international respect." ...|$|E
500|$|Montagu {{considered}} {{that there would}} be a possible [...] "Roman Catholic prejudice against tampering with corpses", which could miss the documents stored in the corpse's pockets, so they added them to an official briefcase that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>overlooked.</b> To justify carrying documents in a briefcase, Major Martin was given two proof copies of the official pamphlet on combined operations written by the author Hilary Saunders – then on Mountbatten's staff – and a letter from Mountbatten to Eisenhower, asking him to write a brief foreword for the pamphlet's US edition. The planning team first thought of having the handle clutched in the corpse's hand, held in place by rigor mortis, but the rigor would probably wear off and the briefcase would drift away. They therefore equipped Martin with a leather-covered chain, such as was used by bank and jewellery couriers to secure their cases against snatching. The chain unobtrusively runs down a sleeve to the case. To Montagu it seemed unlikely that the major would keep the bag secured to his wrist during the long flight from Britain, so the chain was looped around the belt of his trench coat.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 May 1562, {{however, the}} Cardinal was cited {{to appear before}} the Roman Inquisition, and, having failed to appear, the {{sentence}} against him was published in Beauvais on 29 September 1562. [...] When the Constable de Montmorency himself wrote to the Pope in favor of the Cardinal, a second summons was issued, on 17 November, which was published in Beauvais on 10 January 1563. [...] The Royal Council then attempted to intervene, {{on the grounds that the}} summons was a violation of the royal prerogative. But the apostasy of a cardinal could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>overlooked</b> by the Papacy. This intervention failed and brought about the Cardinal de Châtillon's excommunication and deposition on 31 March 1563.

2500|$|By 1818, Bellini had {{independently}} completed several additional orchestral pieces. He {{was ready}} for further study. For well-off students, this would include moving to Naples.

They encouraged the young man to petition the city fathers for a stipend to support his musical studies. This was successfully achieved in May 1819 with unanimous agreement for a four-year pension {{to allow him to}} study at the Real Collegio di Musica di San Sebastiano in Naples. Thus, he left Catania in July carrying letters of introduction to several powerful individuals, including Giovanni Carafa who was the intendente of the Real Collegio as well as being in charge of the city's royal theatres. The young Bellini was to live in Naples for the following eight years.|$|E

2500|$|As cities {{struggle}} {{to comply with}} air quality standards, the ways that trees can help to clean the air should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>overlooked.</b> The most serious pollutants in the urban atmosphere are ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfuric oxides (SOx) and particulate pollution. Ground-level ozone, or smog, is created by chemical reactions between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) {{in the presence of}} sunlight. High temperatures increase the rate of this reaction. Vehicle emissions (especially diesel), and emissions from industrial facilities are the major sources of NOx. [...] Vehicle emissions, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, trees and other plants are the major sources of VOCs. Particulate pollution, or particulate matter (PM10 and PM25), is made up of microscopic solids or liquid droplets that can be inhaled and retained in lung tissue causing serious health problems. Most particulate pollution begins as smoke or diesel soot and can cause serious health risk to people with heart and lung diseases and irritation to healthy citizens. Trees are an important, cost-effective solution to reducing pollution and improving air quality.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variation}} of the dowel method for reinforcement {{is the use of}} a Miller dowel in place of the usual straight cylindrical dowel. The Miller dowel is a stepped dowel and is drilled with a special stepped drill bit. [...] It is drilled from the outside face of the frame piece to be joined and therefore generally leaves an exposed dowel protruding after glue dries, and the excess dowell head is thus usually flush cut. [...] The advantages of the special dowel are documented in various media promoting the method, but one advantage that should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>overlooked</b> is speed of assembly. [...] The butt joint can often be joined temporarily and sometimes more accurately with simply glue, allowing faster set up than the usual tedious alignment procedures mentioned above. [...] After the glue dries one or more Miller dowels are then used to reinforce the joint. [...] Dowel trimming and sanding of the surface, followed by normal finishing then proceed in the usual manner. [...] The blind alignment problems of floating dowels are virtually eliminated by the use of the Miller dowel. [...] Not all projects are appropriate for the stepped dowel method if an exposed dowel end is not visually acceptable, however.|$|E
2500|$|Among a {{large crowd}} of {{unfamiliar}} politicians in the Estates General, Mirabeau was one figure who stood out.

[...] His great capacity for work and extensive knowledge were easily seen, but the scandals of his private life with women, time in prison, and extensive debt could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>overlooked.</b> At every important crisis his voice was heard, though his advice was not always followed. He possessed both logical acuity and passionate enthusiasm. [...] From the beginning, he recognized that government should exist to allow the population to pursue its daily work in peace, and that for a government to be successful it must be strong. At the same time, he thoroughly understood that for a government to be strong, it must be in harmony with the wishes {{of the majority of the}} people. He had studied the British system of government, and he hoped to establish in France a system similar in principle, yet still distinct. In the first stages of the meetings of the Estates-General, Mirabeau, he was soon recognized as a leader, because he always knew his own mind and was prompt in emergencies. He is attributed with the successful consolidation of the National Assembly out of the membership of the Estates-General.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{exposition}} of the felicific calculus, Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, {{by which we}} might test the [...] "happiness factor" [...] of any action. Nonetheless, it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>overlooked</b> that Bentham's [...] "hedonistic" [...] theory (a term from J.J.C. Smart), unlike Mill's, is often criticized for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of justice. In Bentham and the Common Law Tradition, Gerald J. Postema states: [...] "No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion..." [...] Thus, some critics object, it would be acceptable to torture one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law, Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences. According to Kelly, for Bentham the law [...] "provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being". It provides security, a precondition {{for the formation of}} expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows [...] "expectation utilities" [...] to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many.|$|E
