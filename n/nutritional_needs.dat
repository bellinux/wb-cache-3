Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1982, {{the program has been}} providing low-income families living in Puerto Rico with cash benefits used for food purchases. It is a collaborative effort between the USDA and the island's government, where the former provides annual federal appropriations for the Puerto Rican government to distribute individually among eligible participants. Although the methods of providing such benefits have changed over the years, the program's basic objective of helping low-income families meet their <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs</b> has remained constant.|$|E

40|$|Parasitized nestlings {{might be}} {{expected}} to increase begging effort to obtain additional resources to compensate for those sequestered by their parasites. However, begging is costly and chicks harbouring parasites may find it more difficult to attain high begging levels. Consequently, we predicted that, for the same level of <b>nutritional</b> <b>need,</b> nestlings that are parasitized will invest less in begging than those that are not parasitized. We tested this prediction by measuring begging in Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca nestlings parasitized with haematophagous mites Dermanyssus gallinoides and Dermanyssus gallinae and blowfly larvae Protocalliphora azurea, and subjected to different levels of food deprivation in order to control for short-term <b>nutritional</b> <b>need.</b> Nestlings from nests with ectoparasites spent less time begging than those from nests without parasites, especially when very hungry, although there was no association with latency to beg or begging intensity. Our results suggest that time invested in begging may indicate not only the level of need, but also nestling parasitism status. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

It is the Puerto Rico government's responsibility to establish the eligibility requirements and benefit levels for participation in the program.

5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long taproot extends {{down to the}} water table, securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are adequate for the plant's <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Imerina was governed through {{a mixture of}} traditional practices and innovative measures. While all land technically belonged to the sovereign, its administration {{was carried out by}} andriana who were assigned a menakely (subdivision of land) to govern. These administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers. The land was cultivated by commoners, who were given a parcel to farm based {{on the size of the}} family it was meant to feed, and each family paid taxes to the king in return. Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from the butcher that had not been sold by the day's end, and allowing the poor to eat cassava from others' fields, provided they took only what they could cook and consume on the spot. In this way, the basic <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs</b> of most citizens were met.|$|E
5|$|Upper Paleolithic people {{specialized}} in organized, group hunting of large mammals; they sometimes pursued and drove entire herds into traps. Their <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs</b> were met largely by meat consumption, as the vegetation {{was limited to}} tundra and steppe and the land was covered by ice and snow (Vistula final glaciation) for long periods. More sophisticated tool making methods resulted {{in the production of}} long (some over two feet), narrow and sharp flintstone splits. In a cave near Nowy Targ (East-Gravettian culture), a 30,000-year-old boomerang, the world's oldest, was found. It is a crescent-shaped 70cm long object with a fine finish, made of mammoth tusk. Mammoths were hunted in the Kraków area during 25,000-20,000 BCE. Also 30,000 years old are the so-called Mladeč-type blades of the Aurignacian culture, made of bone, found in Wierzchowie, Kraków County.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs.</b> Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch {{after about}} three weeks and the young are {{attended}} by both parents. Males are present around the nest {{for most of the}} day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades. During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality. For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings {{as a result of the}} parents' inability to meet its greater <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs.</b> However, in the case of the American white ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger, the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.|$|E
25|$|These {{high rates}} of food {{insecurity}} and the accompanying effects are even more prevalent in rural populations compared to urban ones, as access to health services in rural areas is much more limited and awareness and education of children's <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs</b> is lower.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{dairy farms}} divide the animals into {{different}} management units {{depending on their}} age, <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs,</b> reproductive status, and milk production status.

On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different <b>nutritional</b> <b>needs.</b> The segment of the adult herd that are in the resting period before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because they are not being milked.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy about the soundness and relevance of so-called "megavitamin " therapy for various illnesses.

The adaptation to agro-pastoralism and reduced dependence on food purchase is also an indication of wealth status.
