Fibers are spun and then directly dispersed into a web by deflectors or can be directed with air streams. This technique leads to faster belt speeds, and cheaper costs. Several variants of this concept are available, such as the REICOFIL machinery.

40|$|ABSTRACT: PTT (polytrimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) based {{meltblown}} and spunbonded webs {{have been}} produced by using Reicofil Bi-Component Meltblown Line at TANDEC at the University of Tennessee and Reicofil 3 Spunbonding system at Reifenhauser, Germany. The processability of meltblown and spunbond-ing {{in a wide range}} of operating windows was extensively investigated. The produced webs were characterized to optimize this process. It was found that the PTT grade studied is quite suitable for the meltblown and spunbonding process. The PTT/PP based bico meltblown webs showed enhanced barrier properties and heat resistance and the PTT <b>spunbonded</b> <b>nonwovens</b> showed advanced drapability and elastic recovery. Staple PTT fibers were also made into nonwovens using hydroentangling, thermobonding and needlepunching. Properties of these nonwovens were studied.

Visualising the outcome of these simulations, large sets of thin randomly oriented fibres, {{has not yet been}} scientifically covered. We apply a set of visualisation techniques for the analysis of the simulation data using established methods such as surface reconstruction, parallel coordinates, and colour coding of specific physical fibre properties. Furthermore, we propose a model for realistic rendering of nonwoven fabrics to create a virtual preview of the simulated nonwoven fabric. This is a topic that has not been addressed before.

40|$|Abstract In this study, the {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) <b>spunbonded</b> <b>nonwoven</b> materials {{were used as}} substrates for creating electro-optical functional nano-structures on the fiber surfaces. A magnetron sputter coating was used to deposit Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films onto the nonwovens. The influences of the deposition time on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of AZO films were investigated. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) {{was employed to examine}} the topography of the fibers. The AFM observation revealed {{a significant difference in the}} morphology of the fibers before and after the AZO sputter coating. The examination by UV–visible spectrophotometer analysis showed that the nonwovens deposited with transparent nanostructure AZO films had better UV absorption, and an average transmittance was approx-imately 50 % in the visible light wavelength region. The surface conductivity of the materials was analyzed using a four-probe meter, and it was found that electrical resistance was significantly decreased as the sputtering time increased...|$|R
30|$|Plasma {{treatments}} are gaining {{popularity in the}} textile industry due to their numerous advantages over conventional wet processing techniques. In this study, <b>nonwoven</b> fabrics <b>spunbond</b> polypropylene, polyester basis weight of 25  g/m 2 and microporous PTFE film were used to develop tri-laminate antiviral surgical gown. The outer layer of spunbond polypropylene was treated with plasma enhanced fluorocarbon. The plasma treated polypropylene was also treated with titanium nano dispersion finish in a single bath pad-dry-cure method. The pore sizes of nonwoven fabrics were characterized using tri-nocular microscope. The titanium nano finished polypropylene was characterized by scanning electron microscope. The tri-laminate surgical gown was developed with outer layer of plasma treated polypropylene, middle layer of PTFE and inner layer of polyester nonwoven. Liquid barrier properties of surgical performance were analyzed by viral penetration, antibacterial, spray impact penetration, hydrostatic resistance, tensile properties and moisture vapour permeability to estimate their suitability for antiviral surgical gown. It is observed that plasma treated gown shows 99.04 % bacterial reduction as compared to untreated, thus providing barrier against microbes. The plasma treatment does not alter the weight and tensile properties of surgical gown. The developed plasma enhanced flurocarbon treated tri-laminate surgical gown offer sufficient liquid barrier properties for level 4 protection as per Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation classification. Moisture vapour transfer rate of plasma treated tri-laminate gown decreased by 21 % in comparison with untreated nonwoven gown.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on {{all aspects of}} thermally point bonded nonwovens has led to considerable improvements {{in the understanding of}} material requirements for these nonwovens, the changes that occur during bonding and the resultant deterioration of the mechanical properties of the nonwoven materials. This paper addresses how one may use a bicomponent fiber technology to overcome the shortcomings of the thermal bonding and obtain high strength spunbond fabrics. In particular, we present the utility of islands-in-the-sea (I/S) bicomponent fibers for optimizing the strength of thermally bonded fabrics. To examine the role of various bonding temperatures on the fabric performance, pre-consolidated webs were formed and subsequently, thermally bonded. Thus, any influence introduced by potential variations in the structure was minimized. Point-bonded bicomponent samples made up of nylon- 6 (N 6) as the islands and low density polyethylene (PE) as the sea showed great promise with respect to their mechanical properties, suggesting that the use of bicomponent fibers can be beneficial for strength optimization of thermally bonded <b>spunbond</b> <b>nonwovens...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the {{polypropylene}} (PP) <b>spunbonded</b> <b>nonwoven</b> {{materials were}} used as substrates for depositing transparent nanostructures on the fiber surfaces. Magnetron sputter coating technique was used to deposit tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) films onto the nonwoven sub-strates. The structures and properties of the deposited ITO and AZO films were investigated and compared using atomic force microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and electrical and optical tests. The observations by atomic force microscopy revealed the formation of functional nanostructures on the fiber surfaces. EDX analyses confirmed the deposition of ITO and AZO functional films on the PP fibers. It was found that ITO had more compact structures on the fiber surface than AZO under the same sputtering conditions. The transmittance analysis revealed that the nonwoven substrates deposited with nanostructural AZO showed better ultraviolet shielding effect than those coated with ITO in the same thickness. The nonwoven materials coated with ITO had lower elec-trical resistance than those coated with AZO in the sam...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spunbond,</b> <b>nonwoven</b> fabrics {{consisting}} of polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, which meet food contact requirements, {{may be used}} as pouch materials for products containing food and/or flavor ingredients that are held in the mouth.

40|$|A {{microencapsulated}} {{flame retardant}} {{was used in}} order to produce a flame retardant nonwoven substrate. Melamine-formaldehyde polymer-shell microcapsules, containing Afflamit® PLF 280 (resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate)) as the core substance, were coated by an outer thermoplastic wall (polystyrene (PS) or poly(methyl methacrylate)), before being applied to a core/sheet-type bi-component PET/co-PET <b>spunbond</b> <b>nonwoven</b> substrate using impregnation. The outer wall of the microcapsules was heated to the softening temperature of the thermoplastic shell in order to be bonded onto the textile fibres. The thermal stability of the microcapsules was examined using thermogravimetric analysis. The textile samples were observed with a scanning electron microscope, and the flame retardancy performance was evaluated using the NF P 92 - 504 standard. The results show that the composition of the outer polymeric shell affected the thermal stability of the microcapsules, since the particles with a PS shell are more stable. Furthermore, the microcapsules were more located at the nonwoven surface without affecting the thickness of the samples. Based on the results of the NF P 92 - 504 test, the flame spread rate was relatively low for all of the tested formulations. Only the formulation with a low content of PS was classified M 2 while the others were M 3...|$|R
40|$|As {{problems}} of antibiotic resistance increase, a continuing need for effective bioactive wound dressings is anticipated {{for the treatment}} of infected chronic wounds. Naturally derived antibacterial agents, such as Manuka honey, consist of a mixture of compounds, more than one of which can influence antimicrobial potency. The non-peroxide bacteriostatic properties of Manuka honey have been previously linked to the presence of methylglyoxal (MGO). The incorporation of MGO as a functional antibacterial additive during fibre production was explored as a potential route for manufacturing wound dressing components. Synthetic MGO and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were fabricated into webs of sub-micron fibres by means of electrostatic spinning of an aqueous spinning solution. Composite fabrics were also produced by direct deposition of the PVA-MGO fibres onto a preformed <b>spunbonded</b> <b>nonwoven</b> substrate. Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR) spectroscopies confirmed the presence of MGO within the resulting fibre structure. The antibacterial activity of the fibres was studied using strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Strong antibacterial activity, as well as diffusion of MGO from the fibres was observed at a concentration of 1. 55 mg/ cm - 1.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} and functional performance of nonwoven fabric critically {{depends on the}} fibre architecture. The fibre laydown process {{plays a key role}} in controlling this architecture. The fibre dynamic behaviour during laydown is studied through a finite element model which describes the role of the parameters in defining the area covered by a single fibre when deposited on the conveyor belt. The path taken by a fibre is described in terms of the radius of gyration, which characterises the area covered by the fibre in the textile, and the spectrum of curvature, which describes the degree of fibre looping as a function of the arc length. Starting from deterministic and idealised fibre curvature spectra, stochastic Monte Carlo simulations are undertaken to generate full nonwoven web samples and reproduce the uniformity of fibre density. A novel image analysis technique that allows measurement of the uniformity of real <b>spunbonded</b> <b>nonwoven</b> samples from images of textiles is used to confirm the validity of the model. It is shown that the main parameter that governs the fibre density uniformity is the ratio of the fibre spinning velocity to the velocity of conveyor belt, while fibre oscillations prior to deposition play a secondary role.

40|$|In this research, {{polypropylene}} {{fibers and}} nonwoven samples were produced with the commercial samples of nanoclay additives in semi-commercial processing machinery. Influence {{of two different}} types of nanoclay additives, at different add on levels on processing, structure and morphology of nonwovens is studied. The WAXD and DSC data showed some change in crystallinity and melting behavior indicating changes in the fiber morphology towards improved mechanical properties. Presence and extent of exfoliation of nanoclay in the polymer was verified using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM image reveals intercalated and exfoliated morphology of nanocomposites. About 10 to 20 % increase in tensile strength and modulus in both machine and cross directions is observed. This increase in strength is not accompanied by a decrease in breaking elongation as is the case for most of the fibers. Similarly 10 to 25 % increase in web stiffness and 20 to 80 % increase in web burst strength was observed. Furthermore there is improvement in other performance properties of the <b>spunbond</b> <b>nonwovens.</b> SEM images showed improved thermal bonding in the presence of nanoclay additives. The main advantage of this process is that these fabrics can be produced without any need for change in the processing equipment. This study has shown that by using a suitable compounding method, nanoparticle reinforced fibers and fibrous products with improved performance properties can be produced using conventional production machinery...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{simulation}} {{is widely}} used in the industry for the optimisation of production processes. The computational simulation of the production of <b>spunbond</b> <b>nonwoven</b> fabrics is a new and emerging field of research. This thesis covers the development of analysis techniques for several aspects of simulated nonwoven fabrics, i. e. fabrics that are made of randomly oriented fibres. We propose a set of visualisation techniques including colour coding, parallel coordinates, tangent colour mapping, and surface reconstruction {{for the analysis of}} the simulation data. Furthermore, we propose a model for realistic rendering of nonwoven fabrics {{in order to create a}} virtual preview of the simulated nonwoven fabric. This is a topic that has not been addressed before. The rendering model is based based solely on the output of the simulation and relies on existing techniques for realistic rendering of fibrous materials - covering shading, self-shadowing, depth-sorting, and antialiasing. Both aspects, information visualisation and realistic rendering, are required to run at interactive framerates, thus they are accelerated by exploiting modern programmable graphics hardware. As a result, we have achieved major improvements over the previously used visualisation approaches, offering a unified solution for the interactive visualisation and exploration of simulated nonwoven fabrics. We had to apply our model for realistic rendering of nonwoven fabrics to artificial datasets due to restrictions of existing datasets. The results are promising, although our model for realistic rendering of nonwovens still has to prove itself on future simulation results...|$|R
40|$|This article gives {{information}} additional to {{the existing}} editions about drying and keeping herbarium between the spunbond sheets, the approach not mentioned in Kew’s «The herbarium handbook». The invention was patented: Patent no. 71212, Russian Federation, priority number 2007137443 of 09. 10. 2007. <b>Spunbond,</b> <b>nonwoven</b> polymeric fabric, allows to introduce technologies which might exclude paper and other moisture absorptive materials from the process of herbarium making. The idea of the new way of drying plants for the herbarium consists in creating thin air linen around the plant in the herbarium press {{with the use of}} spunbond. Thanks to the free air access, plants dry very quickly and stay flat at the same time. The plants are dried in the herbarium press with the use of black spunbond, with the density from 60 grams per square meter to 150 grams per square meter, instead of usual newspapers. In 2009 - 2011 Multi-purpose Herbarium Press was tried out in Central Russia, In the Northern Ural, Northern Africa and France. In all these parts of the world scientists were absolutely satisfied with the results. Spunbond can also be used for keeping the herbarium. It lasts longer and is cheaper than paper. It doesn’t break into small pieces, doesn’t absorb moister from the outside, doesn’t deteriorate because of the sun, and cannot be damaged by insects. The use of spunbond when making herbarium allows to avoid using wood (shelves and cupboards) and paper in the rooms where herbariums are kept, because they are kept on metal shelves. This will help to avoid a big number of pests, which is especially a big problem for tropical herbariums...|$|R
