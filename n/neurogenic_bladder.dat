25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, {{and other diseases}} of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, urethral calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. <b>Neurogenic</b> <b>bladder</b> can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms {{similar to those of}} BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation. Notable causes of <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladder</b> include disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcohol-induced nerve damage. Individuals affected by heart failure often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.|$|E
40|$|Children with <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders</b> {{have usually}} not been {{considered}} for renal transplantation {{because of the}} potential complications caused by chronic infections of the urinary tract. Two girls with occult <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders</b> who were practising intermittent self catheterisation were given renal transplants. Both took prophylactic antibacterial agents after transplantation, and both experienced infections at some stage, but none of these infections produced a deterioration in renal function. In one patient creatinine clearance fell and signs of obstruction appeared, but this was because the patient had been catheterising herself only {{two or three times a}} week. When she resumed catheterisation four times a day creatinine clearance rose and the urographic and renographic appearances returned to normal. These results suggest that, with adequate catheterisation and urinary chemoprophylaxis, infection is not a particular problem in children with bladder dysfunction who undergo renal transplantation...|$|R

25|$|Once the {{diagnosis}} of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention. In post void residual, a catheter is inserted into the urinary tract immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50â€“100nbsp&ml suggests <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladder</b> dysfunction. A kidney ultrasound will demonstrate hydronephrosis if present. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis. However, in AKI, the use of IV contrast is contraindicated as the contrast agent used is nephrotoxic.|$|E
25|$|During spinal shock, {{the bladder}} is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, a spinally {{mediated}} voiding reflex ensues, {{although there is}} no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers. Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs, provoking a mild mass reflex. In some instances, the voiding reflex becomes hyperactive. Bladder capacity is reduced and the wall becomes hypertrophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladder.</b> The reflex hyperactivity is made worse, and may be caused, by infection in the bladder wall.|$|E

25|$|Frequent {{urination}} can be due {{to excessive}} urine production, small bladder capacity, irritability or incomplete emptying. Males with an enlarged prostate urinate more frequently. One definition of an overactive bladder is when a person urinates more than eight times per day. An overactive bladder can often cause urinary incontinence. Though both urinary frequency and volumes {{have been shown to}} have a circadian rhythm, meaning day and night cycles, it is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive bladder. Urodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms. An underactive bladder is the condition where there is a difficulty in passing urine and is the main symptom of a <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladder.</b> Frequent urination at night may indicate the presence of bladder stones.|$|E
500|$|Bladder: Symptomatology of the {{urinary tract}} {{is common in}} MS. Treatments for bladder {{problems}} {{vary depending on the}} origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are desmopressin for nocturia and anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non-pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; [...] and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladder.</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Autonomous {{activity}} in isolated bladders {{has been demonstrated}} in normal rat and guinea pig. To search for differences between the autonomous {{activity in}} normal and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders</b> we investigated two groups of isolated rat bladders. MATERIAL & METHODS: Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of the KU Leuven. Two groups of rat bladders were investigated: a normal (n= 7) and a neurogenic group (n= 8), all derived from female Wistar rats, 250 - 350 g. Rats were spinalised at the vertebral level T 8 -T 9 and sacrified at D 21; bladders from the control group were investigated in the same period. Bladders were incubated in a constantly gassed Kreb?s solution, at 37 degrees Celcius. Intravesical pressure was measured after a prefilling of 200 - 400 Âµl (volume found after sacrifying). Pressures were measured during 45 min, with 15 min of resting status, 15 min of filling status {{at a rate of}} 20 Âµl/min and 15 min of resting status after filling phase. Pressures were measured with BD transducers (Becton-DickinsonÂ®); these were calibrated before every experiment and replaced every five measurements. Recordings were done with Dataq software and hardware (DataqÂ® instruments) Quantification and qualification of the activity pattern was done by dividing pressures changes in groups: - Macrocontractions were defined as pressure changes of minimal 0. 500 cmH 20, lasting between 5 and 20 sec and ending when the pressure level has fallen to 25 % of its original height. - Spikes were defined as pressure changes of minimal 0. 100 cmH 2 O, lasting between 0 and 3 sec and ending when the pressure level has fallen with a minimal amount of 0. 100 cmH 2 O Statistics were performed on the analysed pressure changes 5 min before and 5 min after the filling phase. A Mann-Whitney U test was used. RESULTS: The amount of spikes 5 min before the filling phase was significant higher in the neurogenic group (p 0. 0079); after the filling phase the amount was not significantly different (p 0. 2222) The amount of macrocontractions 5 min before the filling phase was not significantly different (p 0. 0555), the amount 5 min after the filling phase was significantly higher in the control group (p 0. 0317). The amount of spikes/macrocontraction 5 min before and 5 min after the filling phase was significantly higher in the neurogenic group (p 0. 0079 before, p 0. 0079 after). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first model to demonstrate preliminary that the pattern of autonomous activity in <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders,</b> derived from paraplegic rats, is mainly significantly different from the autonomous activity in normal bladders. We demonstrated a global overactivity in isolated <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders,</b> which was consistent after a constant filling phase. If this can be confirmed in larger series, this model can offer exciting new possibilities in the search for novel strategies in the treatment of bladder overactivity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{effectiveness of}} oral administration of ONO- 995 tablets was determined in 16 patients with areflexic <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders,</b> {{by means of}} assessing the improvement of their subjective symptoms, amount of residual urine and cystometric findings. An improvement in subjective symptoms was seen in 7 of the 16 patients, and more than 30 % decrease in residual urine in the other 9 patients. An increase in pressure amplitude {{as evidenced by the}} difference between the maximum voiding pressure and maximum resting pressure on cystometry was observed in 9 patients. A slight increase in the maximum urethral pressure was observed in 8 of the 13 patients selected for the urethral pressure profile study. These results suggest that ONO- 995 increases both urethral resistance and detrusor contraction.

40|$|AIMS: Resiniferatoxin (RTX), a vanilloid {{compound}} and agonist of the transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPV 1), {{is known for}} its beneficial effects on neurogenic detrusor overactivity. The mainstream rationale for its use is the desensitization of TRPV 1 on sensory bladder afferents. However, recent findings showed that TRPV 1 is present in other cell types in the bladder. To eliminate the effects of RTX on spinal and central neural circuits, we investigated autonomous contractility in normal and <b>neurogenic</b> rat <b>bladders</b> after treatment with RTX. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were made paraplegic at vertebral level T 8 -T 9. Animals were intravesically pre-treated with vehicle (ethanol 5 %) or RTX (100 nM) and sacrificed after 72 hr. Each bladder was excised and placed in a heated organ bath, where intravesical pressures were measured. Effects on contractile parameters of intravesical volume load, the non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (CA) and electrical stimulation (ES) of nerves were studied in both groups. RESULTS: In RTX-treated normal bladders we found shorter contractions with higher amplitude than in control bladders (P < 0. 05). In RTX-treated <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders</b> the amplitude and duration of autonomous contractions were increased compared with controls (P < 0. 05). Furthermore RTX induced an increased response to CA and to ES (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: RTX significantly affected the properties of autonomous bladder contractile activity. This provides evidence for local effects of RTX on bladder contractile activity, which are not mediated by afferent neural pathways and which may contribute to the beneficial effects on detrusor overactivity.

40|$|Bladder {{disorders}} {{are not well}} recognized, but a range of conditions can damage or compromise bladder function, necessitating eventual organ replacement or repair. In children, the most common congenital abnormalities involve the genitourinary system, including bladder exstrophy, urinary tract defects (1 in 500 children) that damage the bladder and kidneys (e. g. obstructive uropathy), and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>bladders</b> due to myelomeningocele (1 in 800 children). These disorders {{can result in a}} high-pressure, low-compliant bladder that requires substitution. The traditional treatment strategy uses gastrointestinal segments for replacing bladder tissue. This approach can be problematic because gastrointestinal tissue absorbs solutes that urinary tissue excretes. Due to this difference in tissue function, several complications can arise, such as infection, metabolic disturbances, urolithiasis, perforation, and malignant disease [1]. Alternative methods and materials have been investigated, most notably tissue expansion [2] and free grafts made from natural (e. g. small intestinal submucosa, bladder submucosa) or synthetic (e. g. gelatin sponge, polyvinyl sponge) materials [3, 4]. However, these attempts have met with limited success due to biocompatibility, mechanical, structural, and functional problems. Thus, the use of gastrointestinal segments has remained the gold standard despit...|$|R
