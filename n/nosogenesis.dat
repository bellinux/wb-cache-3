40|$|Congenital ectopic lentis {{is defined}} as a kind of {{connective}} tissue disease with obvious genetic predisposition that lens dislocates caused by imbalance of the traction of lens as a result of zonular fiber defect or dysplasia. We get further understanding of the molecular etiology and <b>nosogenesis</b> of congenital ectopic lentis under guidance of scientific research in recent years. Main suspicious disease-causing genes will be reviewed in this paper to provide reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment...|$|E
40|$|Oncological {{diseases}} are the second {{leading cause of}} deaths. Immune system disorders and enzymatic imbalances undoubtedly {{play a role in}} the development of tumors. Despite the multifactorial nature of oncological pathology development, endogenous lysozyme deficiency is an important condition of a disease <b>nosogenesis.</b> The article provides a theoretical and experimental validation for the use of lysozyme and antioxidant agents as an alternative therapy for oncological diseases. Key words: oncological diseases, lycozyme, isoantigens, muramine, free radicals. (Pediatric Pharmacology. – 2010; 7 (4) : 37 - 39) </p...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{happened}} to encounter a discordant schizophrenic case {{in one of}} uniovular twins. This patient is still yong so that we intend to follow up this case in the future, but {{for the time being}} we present this case as a discordant schizophrenia. 1. By the ovular examination this case has been verified as a uniovular case. 2. In the character test, namely, in Rorschach test and Uchida Kraepelin test, we found abnormalities not only in the patient but also in her twin-sister. This finding is noteworthy, so that it will not only help the ovular diagnosis but also suggests a possible danger of future <b>nosogenesis.</b> 3. By judging environmental differences between the twins, we have studies how these differences were related to the <b>nosogenesis,</b> and obtained the following data: (a) Both twins weighed only 1. 5 Kg. at the birth, and the patient's entire body was paler than her twin-sister then. At the age of these both contrasted whooping-cough, but the patient was severer than her sister. It appears that from that time on the patient has the delicate constitution. (b) In the first year of her junior-high school days (13 years old) she received a trauma on the hiatus and she has been worrying ever since, believing she had her hymen broken. (c) As for the direct cause inducing the physiological and mental tension, cystitis which she suffered for one whole year when she was 15 years old may be pointed out. Cystitis seems to be an important factor in this case, because according to Henri Baruck in a cystitic case there are substances in Coli bacillus which are toxicant to the brain, and consequently there is a possibility of presenting a phenomenon like in schizophrenia reaction. These three factors seem to heve played an important role for the onset of schizophrenia in this case...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} risk factors for severe acute {{pancreatitis}} (SAP) complicated by pancreatic encephalopathy (PE). Methods: Clinical data from 255 patients with SAP from January 2005 to December 2006 were reviewed. Thirty-one SAP patients had PE, and 224 SAP patients did not. Clinical characteristics of SAP patients in both PE group and non-PE group were analyzed. 'Results: Ranson scale and the incidence rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia and hyperglycosemia in PE group were higher than those in non-PE group (P 0. 05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ARDS and hyperglycosemia were high risk factors. Cure rate in PE group was higher than that in non-PE group. Conclusion: <b>Nosogenesis</b> of PE {{is the result of}} multiple factors. ARDS and hyperglycosemia may be the high risk factors for PE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Goose {{parvovirus}} (GPV) is a Dependovirus {{associated with}} latent infection and mortality in geese. Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the <b>nosogenesis</b> of GPV in vivo. Results The detection limit of the assay was 2. 8 × 10 1 standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 3 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation. Conclusion The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and reproducibility of the GPV fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with a high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of GPV etiology-related applications. </p...|$|E
