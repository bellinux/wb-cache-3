Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes {{to be known as}} Chrono-Impairment, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. When 20-year-old Clare meets 28-year-old Henry at the Newberry Library in 1991 {{at the opening of the}} novel, he has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> before, although she has known him most of her life.|$|E

25|$|Returning to the US, {{the newlyweds}} shared Webster's {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park and McKinney's Tymor farm, in Dutchess County, New York. In November 1915, Dear Enemy, {{a sequel to}} Daddy-Long-Legs, was published, and it too {{proved to be a}} bestseller. Also epistolary in form, it chronicles the adventures of a college friend of Judy's who becomes the superintendent of the orphanage in which Judy was raised. Webster became pregnant and according to family tradition, was warned that her pregnancy might be dangerous. She suffered severely from morning sickness, but by February 1916 was feeling better and was able to return to her many activities: social events, prison visits, and meetings about orphanage reform and women's suffrage. She also began a book and play set in Sri Lanka. Her friends reported that they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> happier.|$|E

25|$|Sarada Devi {{received}} the highest reverence from the Ramakrishna Order and its devotees. Ramakrishna had bade her continue his mission {{after his death}} and wanted his disciples not to make any distinction between himself and her. According to her devotees and traditional biographers, the hospitality of Sarada Devi was unique and was characterised by motherly care and solicitude. Traditional accounts recount the mystical experiences of her devotees. Some dreamt {{of her as a}} goddess in human form though they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> picture before. Others reportedly {{received the}}ir initiation from her in their dream. One such example is of Girish Chandra Ghosh, the father of Bengali drama, who reportedly saw Sarada Devi in a dream when he was nineteen years old and received a mantra. When he met her many years later, to his astonishment she was the same person in the dream.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield {{was a major}} Hollywood {{sex symbol}} of the 1950s and early 1960s and 20th Century Fox's {{alternative}} to Marilyn Monroe. She {{came to be known}} as the [...] "Working Man's Monroe". She was one of Hollywood's original blonde bombshells, and, although many people have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> movies, Mansfield remains one of the most recognizable icons of 1950s celebrity culture.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{impact on}} him was {{likewise}} emphatic: [...] "I saw {{a cousin of}} mine dance to... 'Hound Dog' and I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, {{the power of the}} music. I started getting records immediately after that." [...] By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as [...] "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet." [...] After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School.|$|E

500|$|Jayne Mansfield was an actress, singer, playmate {{and stage}} show {{performer}} {{who had an}} enormous impact on popular culture of the late 1950s despite her limited success in Hollywood. She has remained a well-known subject in popular culture ever since. During a period between 1956 and 1957, there were about 122,000 lines of copy and 2,500 photographs that appeared in newspapers. In an article on her in the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture (1999), Dennis Russel said that [...] "Although many people have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> movies, Jayne Mansfield remains, long after her death, one of the most recognizable icons of 1950s celebrity culture." [...] In the 2004 novel Child of My Heart by Alice McDermott, a National Book Award winning writer, the 1950s is referred to as [...] "in those Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield days". R. L. Rutsky and Bill Osgerby has claimed that it was Mansfield along with Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot who made the bikini popular.|$|E
500|$|On March 1, 1959, Katsura {{appeared}} on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show {{was in the}} format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), {{or in the case}} of a famous [...] "mystery guest", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using Japanese characters on a chalk board, show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as [...] "Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)". Panelist Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she had read about her but said she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC's You Asked For It, going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on You Asked For It in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.|$|E
500|$|In The Psychology of Joss Whedon, two {{academic}} psychologists identify {{the source of}} Buffy's strength as her mother, paired with Giles' mentorship. Joyce did not know all along that Buffy was a Slayer and had difficulty accepting what her daughter was called to do. She was nonetheless always attentive and available when Buffy's confidence was shaken, and both Joyce's and Giles' devotion to her [...] "gave her the self-assurance to wield her power to its full potential". Joyce served as a parent figure to all of Buffy's friends, whose home lives were often unstable or unloving, thus making her death more poignant to all of them. Willow mentions her parents several times throughout the series, but her father is <b>never</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>Her</b> mother is portrayed only once in [...] "Gingerbread", at first as an academic so preoccupied with her career that she is unable to communicate with Willow, and then—with Joyce—under the spell of a demon and {{in the throes of}} moral panic, attempting to burn her own daughter at the stake for being involved in witchcraft. Xander's parents are described by him and those who have been to his house as alcoholic and verbally abusive. Even Anya, severely wanting in social graces, has lost someone she admires and trusts. Giles also grieves for the loss of a friend and—in one episode when the adults fall under a spell making them retreat into an adolescent state—a lover. Lorna Jowett in Sex and the Slayer writes that Joyce represents stability and normality. For the Scoobies, her death destroys the illusion that normal life is trouble-free; it is just as challenging as encountering supernatural forces.|$|E

2500|$|Soubirous, {{knowing the}} local area well, managed to visit the barricaded grotto under cover of darkness. There, on 25March, {{she said she was}} told: [...] "I am the Immaculate Conception" [...] ("que soy era immaculada concepciou"). On Easter Sunday, 7April, her {{examining}} doctor stated that Soubirous, in ecstasy, was observed to have held her hands over a lit candle without sustaining harm. On 16 July, Soubirous went for the last time to the Grotto. [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> so beautiful before," [...] she reported.|$|E
2500|$|According to Soubirous, her visions {{occurred}} at the grotto of Massabielle, just outside Lourdes. On 16 July 1858, Soubirous visited the grotto {{for the last time}} and said: [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> so beautiful before." [...] On 18 January 1860, the local bishop declared: [...] "The Virgin Mary did appear indeed to Bernadette Soubirous." [...] In 1958, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Le pèlerinage de Lourdes ("The pilgrimage to Lourdes") on the 100th anniversary of the apparitions. Pope John Paul II visited Lourdes three times; Pope Benedict XVI visited Lourdes on 15 September 2008 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the apparitions.|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of [...] "he thought {{her to be a}} harlot; for she had covered her face," [...] the Gemara {{questioned}} how that could be so, for the Rabbis considered covering one's face an act of modesty. Rabbi Eleazar explained that Tamar had covered her face in her father-in-law's house (and thus Judah had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> face and did not recognize her), for Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that every daughter-in-law who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and prophets should issue from her. In support of that proposition, the Gemara noted that kings descended from Tamar through David. And prophets descended from Tamar, as [...] says, [...] "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz," [...] and Rabbi Levi taught that there is a tradition that Amoz was the brother of Amaziah the King of Judah, and thus a descendant of David and thus of Tamar..|$|E
2500|$|Osbourne had {{a troubled}} {{life with her}} father, Don Arden, who had robbed her, once tried to kill her, and who once told Ozzy that Osbourne tried to seduce Don {{in an effort to}} turn Ozzy against her. Osbourne {{revealed}} she was surrounded by violence during her childhood and that it was a normal occurrence to see her father threatening someone, or brandishing a firearm. In an interview in 2001, she commented that her father has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> children and that [...] "he never will". Osbourne had told her children that their grandfather was dead, but they unknowingly saw {{him for the first time}} when Osbourne was shouting abuse at him on a street in Los Angeles. When asked who she was shouting at, she replied Tony Curtis. They were reunited in 2001 and he then had a role in their reality show The Osbournes. In August 2004 Osbourne stated her father had Alzheimer's disease and she paid for his care in the last years of his life.|$|E
