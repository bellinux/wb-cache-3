40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a runway allocation planning tool that seeks to maximize the permissible number of flight operations into and out of an airport within a given annual <b>noise</b> <b>budget.</b> Although the model that underlies the planning tool is generic in nature, the tool has been customized for application to a specific airport, viz. Amsterdam airport Schiphol in the Netherlands. The <b>noise</b> <b>budget</b> regulations applicable at Schiphol stipulate limits on the annual cumulative noise loads at a large number of enforcement points arranged around the airport. To ensure an equitable distribution of the cumulative noise load at the enforcement points, an efficient allocation and distribution of the annual flight movements over available runways and routes is required that takes weather induced restrictions into account. To this end, a Linear Programming (LP) optimization formulation has been developed that implements a minimax performance criterion that aims to minimize the maximum cumulative noise load value occurring at any of the enforcement points. The numerical results obtained for the operational year 2005 clearly demonstrate the potential of the tool to maximize the yearly number of flight movements within the assigned <b>noise</b> <b>budget.</b> Control & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Decoupling {{capacitor}} (decap) {{has been}} widely used to effectively reduce dynamic power supply <b>noise.</b> Traditional decap <b>budgeting</b> algorithms usually explore the sensitivity-based nonlinear optimizations or conjugate gradient (CG) methods, which can be prohibitively expensive for large-scale decap budgeting problems and cannot be easily parallelized. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cross-entropy based optimization technique which is more efficient and parallel-friendly. Cross-entropy (CE) is an advanced optimization framework which explores the power of rare event probability theory and importance sampling. To achieve the high efficiency, a sensitivity-guided cross-entropy (SCE) algorithm is introduced which integrates CE with a partitioning-based sampling strategy to effectively reduce the solution space in solving the large-scale decap budgeting problems. Compared to improved CG method and conventional CE method, SCE with Latin hypercube sampling method (SCE-LHS) can provide 2 × speedups, while achieving up to 25 % improvement on power supply noise. To further improve decap optimization solution quality, SCE with sequential importance sampling (SCE-SIS) method is also studied and implemented. Compared to SCE-LHS, in similar runtime, SCE-SIS can lead to 16. 8 % further reduction on the total power supply noise.

40|$|International audienceThe {{response}} of a soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum model to incoming radiation forcing is investigated {{in order to}} gain insights into the coupling of soil and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) states and fluxes. The response is characterized through amplitude and phase propagation of the harmonics in order to differentiate between the {{response of}} the system to forcing at different frequencies (daily to hourly to near instantaneous). Stochastic noise is added to the surface energy balance. The amplitude of the noise is maximum at midday when the incoming radiative forcing is also at its peak. The temperatures and turbulent heat fluxes are shown to act as low-pass filters of the incoming radiation or energy <b>budget</b> <b>noise</b> variability at the surface. Conversely, soil heat flux is shown to act as a high-pass filter because of the strong contrast in the soil and air heat capacities and thermal conductivities. As a consequence, heat diffusion formulations that numerically dampen such forcing are potentially incapable of representing rapid fluctuations in soil heat flux (= 30 min) and therefore introduce errors in the land-surface energy partitioning. The soil-vegetation-ABL continuum model and an electrical analogy for it are used to explain the frequency-dependent differences in the relative effectiveness of turbulent heat fluxes versus ground heat flux in dissipating noise in radiative forcing.
