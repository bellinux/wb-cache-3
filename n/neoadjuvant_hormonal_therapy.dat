40|$|Abstract Background The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} preimplant factors affecting postimplant prostate volume {{and the increase in}} prostate volume after transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy with 125 I free seeds. Methods We reviewed the records of 180 patients who underwent prostate brachytherapy with 125 I free seeds for clinical T 1 /T 2 prostate cancer. Eighty-one (45 %) of the 180 patients underwent <b>neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> No patient received supplemental external beam radiotherapy. Postimplant computed tomography was undertaken, and postimplant dosimetric analysis was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed {{to identify}} preimplant factors affecting postimplant prostate volume by computed tomography and the increase in prostate volume after implantation. Results Preimplant prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound, serum prostate-specific antigen, number of needles, and number of seeds implanted were significantly correlated with postimplant prostate volume by computed tomography. The increase in prostate volume after implantation was significantly higher in patients with <b>neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> than in those without. Preimplant prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound, number of needles, and number of seeds implanted were significantly correlated with the increase in prostate volume after implantation. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that preimplant prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound and <b>neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> were significant independent factors affecting both postimplant prostate volume by computed tomography and the increase in prostate volume after implantation.

40|$|Recently, novel anti-{{androgen}}s and inhibitors of androgen biosynthesis {{have been}} developed through the elucidation of mechanisms of castration resistance of prostate cancer. We believe that these new developments will improve <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> On the other hand, {{there has been an}} increase in criticism of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy,</b> because <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> is supposed to induce adverse effects such as cardiovascular disease. In this review, we have introduced the Japanese experience of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy,</b> because we believe that there may be ethnic differences between Caucasians and Asian people in the efficacy and adverse effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> First, we showed that primary <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> can achieve long-term control of localized prostate cancer in some cases and that quality of life of patients receiving <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> is rather better than previously thought. <b>Neoadjuvant</b> and adjuvant <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> in cases undergoing radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy are very useful for high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer. Further clinical trials are required to confirm the efficacy of <b>neoadjuvant</b> or adjuvant <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> We showed that the death from cardiovascular diseases in Japanese patients receiving <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> was not higher than that in the general population. However, efforts should be made to decrease the adverse effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy,</b> because life-style change may increase the susceptibility to adverse effects by <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> even in Japan.

30|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} {{recommended}} for most women with HR-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), acts as an antagonist of the oestrogen receptor (ER) in breast tissue and as agonist in the uterine endometrium [3]. Recently, another class of hormonal agents, called aromatase inhibitors (AIs), has shown superior efficacy to tamoxifen in the metastatic, neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in postmenopausal women. Anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane are the three most widely used of these drugs. These agents work by reducing the aromatization of peripheral androgens into oestrogen [4]. <b>Neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> has shown an equivalent to superior response compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HR-positive breast cancer. Studies have demonstrated greater rates of breast-conserving surgery in postmenopausal oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients on <b>neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy [5]. Furthermore, higher rates of breast-conserving surgery have been demonstrated in patients treated with AIs versus tamoxifen [6]. Endocrine therapy has a better toxicity profile and is preferred when chemotherapy cannot be tolerated. Another anti-oestrogen agent, fulvestrant, is an ER antagonist, and unlike tamoxifen, has no agonist effects. Fulvestrant was approved for second-line use in postmenopausal women with HR-positive metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following treatment with an anti-oestrogen [7]. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (goserelin, leuprolide), progestins (megestrol acetate), androgens (fluoxymesterone) and high-dose oestrogen (ethinyl estradiol) are other hormonal therapies used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting in breast cancer [1].|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) {{is limited by}} uncertainties {{in the assessment of}} tumor extent. These uncertainties may result in too wide treatment volumes leading to undesirable cosmetic results, or too narrow treatment volumes leading to higher probabilities of local recurrence. The aim {{of this study is to}} quantify the reproducibility of the assessment of tumor extent in the breast at preoperative diagnostic imaging with multiple imaging modalities and at pathology, applied to (1) determining minimum surgical safety margins to reduce the probability of underestimating the tumor extent due to uncertainty in the radiological assessment, and (2) defining the minimum difference between two measurements of tumor size that indicates a significant reduction of tumor extent in response to <b>neoadjuvant</b> chemotherapy or <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> Measurements of the largest tumor diameter in mammography, ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and at pathology were retrieved, retrospectively, for 105 patients eligible for BCT. An analysis of variance technique is employed to separate uncertainty at preoperative diagnostic imaging from uncertainty at pathology. The random variations are thus calculated independently of the systematic deviations, avoiding the necessity to choose a gold standard. Moreover, the technique does not require repeat measurements of tumor extent, thus allowing the use of data that is obtained in daily clinical practice, while avoiding bias due to recollection. The magnitude of the random variations is used to determine minimum surgical safety margins and to define the minimum significant difference between two measurements of tumor size. The overall random variations in the assessment of tumor extent are on the order of 3 mm (1 s. d.) with only little differences of about 0. 3 mm between the four techniques. The dependence of the random variations on tumor size was found significant (p < 0. 05) for mammography (2. 7 mm vs 4. 2 mm, 1 s. d.) and ultrasonography (2. 5 mm vs 3. 8 mm, 1 s. d.) for tumors up to 17 mm compared to those that are larger. A minimum surgical safety margin on the order of 5 mm for tumors up to 17 mm and 7 mm for larger tumors takes the uncertainty in radiological assessment of the tumor extent into account effectively in 95 % of the performed surgical procedures. A minimum difference in largest tumor diameter of 7 mm for tumors up to 17 mm and 9 mm for those that are larger indicates a significant (p < 0. 05) reduction of tumor extent in response to <b>neoadjuvant</b> chemotherapy or <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> The reproducibility of the assessment of tumor extent at preoperative diagnostic imaging is of comparable magnitude to the reproducibility at pathology. The uncertainty in the preoperative assessment of tumor extent constitutes a large portion (5 - 7 mm) of the current safety margin in breast-conserving surgery (10 mm). In monitoring response to <b>neoadjuvant</b> chemotherapy or <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> using repeat imaging before and after treatment, the current clinical guidelines may produce approximately 10 % false-positive responses for tumors between 20 and 30 m...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We studied whether <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy,</b> (neo) {{adjuvant}} to radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, {{is related}} {{to an increase in}} depression and whether this is caused by the <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> itself or by the relatively poor prognosis of patients who get (neo) adjuvant <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 288 patients, irradiated for prostate cancer (T 1 - 3 N 0 M 0), were studied prospectively in two clinics. In one clinic almost all patients received (neo) adjuvant androgen deprivation (Bicalutamide+Gosereline). In a second clinic <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> was prescribed mainly for high risk patients. This allowed us to separate the effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> and the patient's prognosis.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> on large arterial properties. Background. Arterial stiffness is an emerging risk marker for coronary heart disease and is potentially modifiable. Postmenopausal use of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is associated with a}} lower risk of coronary heart disease. Methods. Total systemic arterial compliance (SAC) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were determined in 26 premenopausal and 52 postmenopausal women, 26 of whom were taking <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> Results. Arterial compliance was greater in the premenopausal group (mean ± SEM 0. 57 ± 0. 04 arbitrary compliance units [ACU]) than in the postmenopausal group not taking <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> (0. 26 ± 0. 02 ACU, p = 0. 001). Postmenopausal women taking <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> had a significantly increased total SAC compared with women not taking <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> (0. 43 ± 0. 02 vs. 0. 26 ± 0. 02 ACU, p = 0. 001). PWV in the aortofemoral region in the premenopausal women was 6. 0 ± 0. 2 vs. 8. 9 ± 0. 3 m/s (p < 0. 001) in untreated postmenopausal women.

40|$|Background: Infantile spasms {{constitutes}} a severe infantile epilepsy syndrome {{that is difficult}} to treat and has a high morbidity. <b>Hormonal</b> <b>therapies</b> or vigabatrin are the most commonly used treatments. We aimed to assess whether combining the treatments would be more effective than <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> alone. Methods: In this multicentre, open-label randomised trial, 102 hospitals (Australia [three], Germany [11], New Zealand [two], Switzerland [three], and the UK [83]) enrolled infants who had a clinical diagnosis of infantile spasms and a hypsarrhythmic (or similar) EEG no more than 7 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (1 : 1) by a secure website to receive <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> with vigabatrin or <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> alone. If parents consented, there was an additional randomisation (1 : 1) of type of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> used (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot). Block randomisation was stratified for hormonal treatment and risk of developmental impairment. Parents and clinicians were not masked to therapy, but investigators assessing electro-clinical outcome were masked to treatment allocation. Minimum doses were prednisolone 10 mg four times a day or intramuscular tetracosactide depot 0 · 5 mg (40 IU) on alternate days with or without vigabatrin 100 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome was cessation of spasms, which was defined as no witnessed spasms on and between day 14 and day 42 from trial entry, as recorded by parents and carers in a seizure diary. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with The International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN), number 54363174, and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EUDRACT), number 2006 - 000788 - 27. Findings: Between March 7, 2007, and May 22, 2014, 766 infants were screened and, of those, 377 were randomly assigned to <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> with vigabatrin (186) or <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> alone (191). All 377 infants were assessed for the primary outcome. Between days 14 and 42 inclusive no spasms were witnessed in 133 (72 %) of 186 patients on <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> with vigabatrin compared with 108 (57 %) of 191 patients on <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> alone (difference 15 · 0 %, 95 % CI 5 · 1 – 24 · 9, p= 0 · 002). Serious adverse reactions necessitating hospitalisation occurred in 33 infants (16 on <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> alone and 17 on <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> with vigabatrin). The most common serious adverse reaction was infection occurring in five infants on <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> alone and four on <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> with vigabatrin. There were no deaths attributable to treatment. Interpretation: <b>Hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> with vigabatrin is significantly more effective at stopping infantile spasms than <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> alone. The 4 week period of spasm cessation required to achieve a primary clinical response to treatment suggests that the effect seen might be sustained, but this needs to be confirmed at the 18 month follow-up.

40|$|Objectives. Tumor {{heterogeneity}} can {{be measured}} by quantifying variance of nuclear characteristics by image analysis. Heterogeneity of cell nuclear features correlated with increased local progression in prostate cancer. In the present study, the influence of tumor heterogeneity on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recur rence after radical retropubic prostatectomy was analyzed and tumor heterogeneity was compared in pa tients with and without <b>neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy.</b> Methods. Retrospectively, radical prostatectomy material of 44 patients without and 12 patients with neoad juvant hormonal treatment with a postoperative follow-up of at least 4 years was studied. Each prostatectomy specimen was systematically embedded in paraffin, and each tumor area within the prostate was marked and analyzed by an image analysis system for 32 nuclear features comprising nuclear shape, size, DNA content, and chromatin pattern. Several clinical features were available: preoperative serum PSA, hemoglo bin concentration, Karnofsky score, tumor stage, and Gleason score. Results. Increased tumor heterogeneity, as expressed by differences in karyometric values between tumor areas in nuclear shape and chromatin pattern within the tumor, was significantly correlated with earlier PSA recurrence rate. As compared with nonpretreated patients, hormonally pretreated specimens showe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (F/T-PSA) ratio {{can be used}} to differentiate between stage pT 2 and pT 3 prostate cancer. Material and Methods: A total of 176 consecutive patients from the Goteborg Screening Study (median T-PSA 4. 2 ng/ml) who underwent radical prostatectomy (without <b>neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy)</b> were included in the study. The pT stage was correlated with classical risk factors such as T-PSA and Gleason sum and the impact of the F/T-PSA ratio was evaluated. Results: A total of 42 / 176 patients (23. 9 %) had stage pT 3 prostate cancer. Patients with an F/T-PSA ratio in the lowest quartile (10. 7 % (p = 0. 0002). Patients with high-risk features (T-PSA > 10 ng/ml or Gleason sum {{greater than or equal to}} 7) had a high risk (54 - 60 %) for stage pT 3 prostate cancer. In low-risk patients, the subgroup with an F/T-PSA ratio 10. 7 % (p = 0. 0092). Conclusions: In patients with low-risk early-stage prostate cancer, the F/T-PSA ratio provides statistically significant, independent and clinically relevant preoperative information about the risk of extracapsular tumor growth...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne {{in eight}} women are {{affected}} by breast cancer. Most of them receive hormonal therapy. <b>Neoadjuvant</b> <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is a form of}} hormonal therapy given before surgery. Treatment for 6 months causes tumours to shrink, after which residual tumour is removed by surgery. Unfortunately, in some cases, the tumour cells are resistant to hormonal therapy and the patients relapse. This can be caused by intra-tumour heterogeneity: hormonal therapy eliminates drug-sensitive clones, leaving behind resistant clones. Understanding why some clones are resistant and what their characteristics are may lead to the development of alternative therapies. We compare DNA copy number profiles before and after treatment in the case of ER+ breast cancers. Very low depth sequencing was performed (Illumina GAIIx technology) on biopsies from breast tumours, before and after treatment. Reads were aligned to the human genome hg 19 (bwa). CNAnorm was used to partition reference genome in intervals G = (i 1, [...] .,i n) of non-overlapping sliding windows. Number of reads was converted to a count vector C = (c 1, [...] .,c n) and then to a ratio vector with respect to a pool of normal female DNA...|$|E

40|$|The {{strategy}} for treating prostate cancer patients {{depends on the}} assessment of disease extent, assessment {{of the risk of}} disease relapse, assessment of life expectancy, comorbidities, affinities and life-style. Since the activity and survival of prostate cancer cells is at least initially dependent on androgen stimulation, <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> is one of the several standard treatment modalities. <b>Hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> is aimed at decreasing this androgen stimulation either by lowering androgen production or by blocking receptor binding. <b>Hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> is in fact androgen-suppressive therapy (AST) or androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). If effective, it results in the lack of cancer cell stimulation, thus causing their apoptosis and consequently decline in tumor growth and size. <b>Hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> is used as a first-line treatment modality for metastatic disease. In addition to this indication, <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> is also used as an adjunct to radiotherapy with curative intent for patients with non-metastic disease but having an intermediate and high risk of disease relapse. In combination with radiotherapy, <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> can be applied before, concomitantly and after radiotherapy for the duration of 6 months or 2 to 3 years depending on the risk estimation. Regarding <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy,</b> it can be applied in combination with other treatments, in several ways, and sometimes there might be several options available. This possible lack of a specific recommendation is a consequence {{of the fact that there}} is a limited number of adequate clinical studies which, moreover, may have yielded inconsistent results sometimes simply due to the patients' heterogeneity. Moreover, thanks to the newer and better diagnostic methods enabling the discovery of prostate cancer in earlier disease stages, as well as to the more effective treatments, there is also a prolongation of relapse-free survival and possibly of overall survival in patients having metastic disease. Consequently, the results of earlier clinical studies might no longer be applicable to the new "generations" of upcoming patients. As regards this improved survival, issues of patient's quality of life and possible side-effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy</b> are also becoming increasingly relevant because hormonal adverse events are time-dependant and tend to increase in severity with prolongation of hormonal manipulation. Therefore, this paper aims to give an overview of the more recent findings, indications and observations regarding <b>hormonal</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|R
