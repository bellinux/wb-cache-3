25|$|An Act {{for making}} and {{maintaining}} a <b>navigable</b> <b>Canal</b> from the Oxford Canal Navigation at Braunston, in the county of Northampton, to join the River Thames at or near Brentford, in the county of Middlesex; and also certain collateral Cuts from the said intended Canal.|$|E
25|$|Rooms {{sheathed}} in dazzling polished white marble were given richly varied floor plans, shaped with niches and exedras that concentrated or dispersed the daylight. There were pools in the floors and fountains splashing in the corridors. Nero took {{great interest in}} {{every detail of the}} project, according to Tacitus' Annals, and oversaw the engineer-architects, Celer and Severus, who were also responsible for the attempted <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> with which Nero hoped to link Misenum with Lake Avernus.|$|E
25|$|In 1792 the {{promoters}} sought an Act of Parliament urgently, as proposals by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{to alter their}} route would have affected the profitability of the southern section. It received the Royal Assent on 11 June 1792, and was entitled An Act for making and maintaining a <b>navigable</b> <b>canal,</b> from Kirkby Kendal in the county of Westmorland, to West Houghton in the county palatine of Lancaster, and also a navigable branch from the said intended canal at or near Barwick, to or near Warton Cragg, and also another navigable branch, from, at or near, Galemoss, by Chorley, to or near Duxbury in the said county palatine of Lancaster.|$|E

50|$|Canals {{first saw}} {{use during the}} Roman {{occupation}} of the south of Great Britain, and were used mainly for irrigation. The Romans also created several <b>navigable</b> <b>canals,</b> such as Foss Dyke, to link rivers, enabling increased transport inland by water.|$|R
25|$|Another {{major feature}} is the Harecastle Tunnel, near Kidsgrove {{in the city of}} Stoke-on-Trent, north Staffordshire. There are {{actually}} two tunnels; the first was built by Brindley and was 2880 yards (2633 m) long, and boats were 'legged' through by men lying on their backs and pushing against the roof with their feet. This was a physically demanding and slow process and created major delays, so leading civil engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to provide a second, wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath. This 2926 yard (2676 m) long tunnel was opened in 1827. In the 1900s, the Brindley tunnel was closed due to severe subsidence, but the Telford Tunnel - although also prone to the same problems - remains in use, and is the fourth-longest <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> tunnel in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The Tennant Canal {{presents}} {{few problems}} {{beyond that of}} the aqueduct below Aberdulais basin, which is a scheduled ancient monument, and rebuilding of the lock below that. Resolution of these issues would create around [...] of <b>navigable</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
500|$|The watchmaker and {{engineer}} François Zacharie {{proposed to}} connect the Loire to the Rhone by a <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> [...] long that would mount the Gier and its tributary the Janon, cross the watershed at Saint-Etienne and descend the Furan to exit on the Loire near Andrézieux. He filed his proposal early in 1758, and had to wait in Paris until 28 July 1760 for a favorable report from the Conseil du Roi.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{connected}} to the <b>navigable</b> <b>canals</b> system, and has a prohibition {{against the use of}} motorised boats; these two factors contribute towards a good water quality and abundance of wildlife. A public slipway is available for non-motorised pleasure and fishing craft.|$|R
25|$|Using {{his wide}} {{international}} experience and personal contacts, {{he was a}} leading proponent of the building of navigation canals and river navigation systems in Hungary.

There are [...] of shoreline in the City, including [...] of Atlantic Ocean beach, [...] of Banana River shoreline, and [...] of shoreline fronting <b>navigable</b> <b>canals</b> connected to the Banana River.|$|R
500|$|The canal was {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament entitled [...] "An Act {{for making}} {{and maintaining a}} <b>navigable</b> <b>Canal,</b> with certain Railways and Stone Roads, from several Collieries in the county of Somerset, {{to communicate with the}} intended Kennet and Avon Canal, in the parish of Bradford, in the county of Wilts" [...] of 1794, and further detailed surveys were carried out by Robert Whitworth and John Sutcliffe, who was then appointed as chief engineer.|$|E
500|$|The Stainforth and Keadby Canal is a <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, England. [...] It {{connects the}} River Don Navigation at Bramwith to the River Trent at Keadby, {{by way of}} Stainforth, Thorne and Ealand, near Crowle. It opened in 1802, passed into {{the control of the}} River Don Navigation in 1849, and within a year was {{controlled}} by the first of several railway companies. It became part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, an attempt to remove several canals from railway control, in 1895. There were plans to upgrade it to take larger barges and to improve the port facilities at Keadby, but the completion of the New Junction Canal in 1905 made this unnecessary, as Goole could easily be reached and was already a thriving port.|$|E
500|$|From 1974 to 1990 {{the canal}} benefited from job {{creation}} schemes run by the Manpower Services Commission and Youth Training Scheme {{to work on the}} northern section from Resolven to Ysgwrfa. By 1990 there was [...] of <b>navigable</b> <b>canal,</b> including 7 restored locks and a slipway at Resolven basin. It received a 1998 Europa Nostra award for the quality of the work, and a Civic Trust Award in 1992. The £4million project was jointly funded by the Welsh Office and the Prince of Wales Trust. The Rheola aqueduct {{in the middle of this}} section was refurbished by the Canals Society in 1990. The stream that is now carried under the canal had previously been carried over it in a cast iron trough, but was diverted through a channel cut across the canal bed after high flows overtopped the trough. This required the construction of a new aqueduct, and once completed, the Canals Society launched their trip boat, named Thomas Dadford, on 12 July 1990, to provide canal trips for the public. The Enfys also provided boat trips for the Enfys Trust from the Tŷ Banc former lock-keepers cottage at Resolven, until 2008.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>navigable</b> <b>canals</b> {{reached into}} {{isolated}} areas {{and brought them}} {{in touch with the}} world beyond. By 1825 the Erie Canal, 363 mi long with 82 locks, opened up a connection from the populated northeast to the fertile Great Plains. During the 19th century, the length of canals grew from 100 mi to over 4000 mi, with a complex network in conjunction with Canada making the Great Lakes <b>navigable,</b> although some <b>canals</b> were later drained and used as railroad rights-of-way.|$|R
50|$|The Coventry <b>Canal</b> is a <b>navigable</b> narrow <b>canal</b> in the Midlands of England.|$|R
5000|$|A {{distinction}} is {{made between the}} German terms Seenland ("lake district") and Seenkette ("chain of lakes"). The [...] "Lusatian Lake Chain" [...] (Lausitzer Seenkette) refers to those lakes that are linked by <b>navigable</b> <b>canals.</b> They {{are located in the}} centre of Lusatia between Senftenberg and Hoyerswerda, and include Lake Senftenberg which has developed since 1973 into an important recreational and tourist centre.|$|R
500|$|To {{extend the}} canal {{further to the}} north-east, a £1.6million project {{was funded by the}} European Union Objective 1 project, the Welsh Assembly and Neath Port Talbot Council. This {{included}} complete replacement of the Ynysbwllog aqueduct, part of which had been washed away in a flood in 1979. The commercial role of the canal at that time was to provide water to industries near Swansea, so the water flow had been maintained by replacing the missing arch with pipes. 20 years later a steel footbridge was built to reinstate the towpath. Finally, the canal itself was taken over a new aqueduct, completed in March 2008. The [...] plate girder aqueduct {{is believed to be the}} longest single span aqueduct in the UK. It is [...] wide, and includes a footpath on both sides of the navigation channel. A new car park and slipway were provided from the B4242, and the Clun locks were renovated, to give [...] of <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> from central Neath to Abergarwen. Following improvements, the towpath between Briton Ferry and Tonna has become a cycle route, in conjunction with Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity.|$|E
2500|$|The Huddersfield Broad Canal or Sir John Ramsden's Canal, is a wide-locked <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> in West Yorkshire in {{northern}} England. The waterway is 3.75 miles (6km) long and has 9 wide locks. [...] It follows {{the valley of}} the River Colne and connects the Calder and Hebble Navigation at Cooper Bridge junction with the Huddersfield Narrow Canal near Aspley Basin in Huddersfield.|$|E
2500|$|The canal was {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament (14 George III. Cap. 13) {{obtained on}} 9 March 1774, which enabled [...] "Sir John Ramsden, Baronet, {{to make and}} maintain a <b>navigable</b> <b>Canal</b> from the River Calder, between a Bridge called Cooper's Bridge, and the Mouth of the River Colne to the King's Mill, {{near the town of}} Huddersfleld, in the West Riding of the county of York".|$|E
50|$|The canal is Sydney's first inbound waterway. It {{stretches}} 4 km {{from the}} inner Sydney suburb of Alexandria, flowing through the suburbs of St Peters and Mascot, past Sydney's Sydney Airport to the Cooks River at Tempe, which eventually discharges into Botany Bay. The canal is 60 m wide, increasing to 80 m at its mouth. {{and is one of}} only two <b>navigable</b> <b>canals</b> constructed in New South Wales.|$|R
50|$|Bangladesh is crisscrossed by {{hundreds}} of rivers in addition to 300 large <b>navigable</b> <b>canals.</b> The river transport is important because of the poor state of the road network, especially during the monsoon, when the whole country turns into a morass of mud and many areas are only reachable only through water transport. The movement and logistics of Pakistan army largely depended on their control of the inland waterways, and of the Sea ports.|$|R
50|$|Alexandra Canal is a {{tributary}} of the Cooks River, in southern Sydney, which was constructed along a 4 km route from the inner Sydney suburb of Alexandria, through the St Peters and Mascot, past Sydney's Sydney Airport to the Cooks River at Tempe, eventually discharging into Botany Bay.

2500|$|Lichfield Canal was {{historically}} {{part of the}} Wyrley and Essington Canal and ran {{south of}} the city from 1797 until it was abandoned in 1955. Starting in the 1990s a works programme started to restore the canal along much of its original route and make it navigable by 2025. As of 2011, none of the [...] stretch of canal is navigable. The nearest <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> to Lichfield is the Coventry Canal which runs through Streethay.|$|E
2500|$|By the 8th century, a <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> {{existed between}} Old Cairo and the Red Sea, but {{accounts}} vary {{as to who}} ordered its construction—either Trajan or 'Amr ibn al-'As, or Omar the Great. This canal was reportedly linked to the River Nile at Old Cairo and ended near modern Suez. A geography treatise by Dicuil reports a conversation with an English monk, Fidelis, who had sailed on the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land {{in the first half}} of the 8th century ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sangarius Bridge or Bridge of Justinian (Turkish: Justinianos Köprüsü or Beşköprü) is a late Roman {{bridge over}} the river Sakarya ( [...] , Greek Σαγγάριος) in Anatolia, in modern-day Turkey. It was built by the East Roman Emperor Justinian I (527-565AD) to improve {{communications}} between the capital Constantinople and the eastern provinces of his empire.

5000|$|Restoration {{projects}} by volunteer-led groups continue. There is now {{a substantial}} network of interconnecting, fully <b>navigable</b> <b>canals</b> across the country. In places, serious plans are in progress by the Environment Agency and British Waterways Board, later the Canal & River Trust, for building new canals to expand the network, link isolated sections, and create new leisure opportunities for navigating [...] "canal rings", for example the Fens Waterways Link and the Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century, Livorno {{underwent}} a period of great urban planning and expansion. Near the defensive pile of the Old Fortress, a new fortress was built, together with the town walls and the system of <b>navigable</b> <b>canals</b> through neighborhoods. After the port of Pisa silted up in XIII° century, its distance from the sea was increased and it lost its dominance in trade. Livorno took over as the main port in Tuscany.|$|R
50|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{the city}} has a total area of 26.3 km2, of which 22.5 km2 is land and 3.9 km2 (14.62%) is water.

2500|$|Joseph Stalin's 1935 Moscow Reconstruction Plan {{called for}} the {{creation}} of an inner ring of navigable waterways in northern Moscow. The proposed Northern Shipping Canal (...) connectingKhimki Reservoir with the Yauza would have made the latter navigable up to Sviblovo; the Yauza valley north from Sviblovo would have been flooded into a broad reservoir. A system of four sets of locks would gradually reduce the water level; the river itself was to be deepened and widened into a <b>navigable</b> <b>canal</b> with granite embankments and broad, riverside highways. Further industrialization of the Yauza was prohibited; the embankments of the Moskva and the Yauza were zoned for high-profile public and residential buildings.|$|E
50|$|Tortuguero, Costa Rica, {{which can}} be {{translated}} as Land of Turtles, is a village on the Northern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica in the Limón Province.
