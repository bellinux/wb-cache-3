[...] The strip's title character, The Baron, was an impoverished English nobleman, a tramp inspired by Charles Dickens and Charlie Chaplin. [...] He and his valet Grimes would plot ways to get by. [...] Herriman later introduced the main characters' wives, and after a run as a domestic strip, with occasional appearances of characters from Krazy Kat's world, it ended in January 1919. [...] It was replaced the next day by <b>Now</b> <b>Listen</b> Mabel, which was about a young man courting a young woman; he would be caught in a compromising situation, which he would try to explain away with [...] "Now listen Mabel..." [...] The strip lasted until that December.|$|E

This is the flag of France, it is the flag of our victorious armies, it is the flag of our triumphs that must be addressed before Europe. France and the tricolor is the same thought, the same prestige, even terror, if necessary, for our enemies! Consider how much blood you would have to make for another flag fame! ...|$|E

Pâle et blonde, dort sous l'onde profonde – [...] "And <b>now</b> <b>listen</b> to my song. Pale and fair, sleeping under the deep waves"). (The Ballade replaces Shakespeare's [...] "Tomorrow is St. Valentine's Day", the bawdy words of which were probably considered inappropriate at the Opéra.) It includes a quantity of coloratura singing, and, {{in the words of}} Matthew Gurewitsch, is [...] "interwoven with a wordless wisp of a refrain, spun out over the nervous pulse of a drum, like birdsong from some undiscovered country." [...] The Ballade concludes with a coloratura passage that finishes with a run up to a high E (E6) and a fortissimo trill on A sharp (A5 sharp) leading to the final high B (B5).|$|E
