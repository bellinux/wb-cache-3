5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. <b>Noise</b> <b>mitigation</b> options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths.

Located in the densely built-up Kowloon City District with a single runway extending into Kowloon Bay, Kai Tak had only limited room for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic. By the 1990s, Kai Tak had become one of the world's busiest airports – it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities, and {{one out of every three}} flights experienced delays, largely due to lack of space for aircraft, gates, and a second runway. In addition, <b>noise</b> <b>mitigation</b> measures restricted nighttime flights, as severe noise pollution (exceeding 105dB(A) in Kowloon City) adversely affected an estimated total of at least 340,000 people.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a detailed design and modeling approach for power planes with integrated high-impedance elec-tromagnetic surfaces (HIS). These novel power planes, which were introduced recently, have the unique ability of providing effective broadband simultaneous switching <b>noise</b> (SSN) <b>mitigation.</b> Full-wave electromagnetic simulation {{is used to}} study {{the impact of the}} geometry on the performance of these novel power planes. It is demonstrated that power planes using inductance-enhanced HIS can be designed for broadband mitigation of the SSN from the upper hundred megahertz to the gigahertz frequencies. Physics-based compact models for the unit cell of power planes with in-tegrated HIS are developed and several of them connected in a two-dimensional array to build full models for large and mul-tilayer power planes. The compact model offers fast analysis of power planes. As an example, we show that the full-wave simula-tion time of a 10 × 10 cm power plane with integrated HIS can be dramatically reduced from 24 to 48 h using a commercially avail-able three-dimensional full-wave solver to less than 1 min when using the compact circuit model developed here.

40|$|Detecting and {{responding}} to climate change are two interrelated aspects of an important activity that Bert Bolin strongly promoted: the communication between scientists, the public and policy makers. The demonstration of a statistically significant anthropogenic contribution to the observed global warming greatly increased the public acceptance {{of the reality of}} climate change However, the separation between humaninduced climate change and natural climate variability on the regional scales of greatest relevance for human living conditions remains a more difficult task. This applies to the prediction of both the anthropogenic signal and the natural variability <b>noise.</b> Climate <b>mitigation</b> and adaptation policies must therefore necessarily be designed as the response to uncertain risks. Unfortunately, the political response to climate change has stagnated in recent years through the preoccupation with the global financial crisis.
