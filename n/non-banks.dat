40|$|During {{the past}} decade <b>non-bank</b> {{institutional}} investors are increasingly taking larger roles in the corporate lending than they historically have played. These <b>non-bank</b> institutional lenders typically have higher required rates of return than banks, but invest in the same loan facilities. In a sample of 20, 031 leveraged loan facilities originated between 1997 and 2007, facilities including a <b>non-bank</b> institution in their syndicates have higher spreads than otherwise identical bank-only facilities. Contrary to risk-based explanations of this finding, <b>non-bank</b> facilities are priced with premia relative to bank-only facilities in the same loan package. These <b>non-bank</b> premia are substantially larger when a hedge or private equity fund {{is one of the}} syndicate members.

40|$|This thesis, {{entitled}} “An {{analysis of}} bank risk management and its relevance for the <b>non-bank</b> corporate sector”, investigates {{the extent to}} which financial risk management by the banking sector {{can be applied to the}} <b>non-bank</b> corporate sector. As banks’ risk management techniques are more sophisticated than those of the <b>non-bank</b> corporate sector we have endeavoured to ascertain the applicability of these established risk management methods to the <b>non-bank</b> corporate sector. The main objectives of this study were to analyse the banking sectors’ risks and management thereof, and compare them to the risks faced by the nonbank corporate sector. This analysis was then used to present a theoretical financial risk management model for the corporate sector. This analysis was conducted using qualitative research. The thesis engaged in an in-depth investigation of financial risk management through a documentary, literature and media analysis. It was elucidated that not all companies face the same financial risks and therefore each company requires its own unique financial risk management model. Furthermore, it was established that there are several risks that both banks and <b>non-bank</b> corporates are subjected to. However, the management of these risks is not necessarily the same for these two types of institutes. This thesis concludes by putting forward a financial risk management model which presents all the possible financial risks that <b>non-bank</b> corporates may face. ...|$|R
