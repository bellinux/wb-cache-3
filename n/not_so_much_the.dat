25|$|The main {{contribution}} of Alpha to the microprocessor industry, {{and the main}} reason for its performance, was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> architecture but rather its implementation. At that time (as it is now), the microchip industry was dominated by automated design and layout tools. The chip designers at Digital continued pursuing sophisticated manual circuit design {{in order to deal with}} the overly complex VAX architecture. The Alpha chips showed that manual circuit design applied to a simpler, cleaner architecture allowed for much higher operating frequencies than those that were possible with the more automated design systems. These chips caused a renaissance of custom circuit design within the microprocessor design community.|$|E

25|$|The {{procession}} of Holy Wednesday and Good Friday features close to forty pasos de misterios or carrozas and draws a huge crowd as spectators and participants as heirlooms images and newly commissioned ones are brought out. What sets it {{apart from other}} Semana Santa processions in the province is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> number of carrozas, but the solemnity and decorum on how it is done. The Hermandad de la Sagrada Pasion {{is the first in}} the province to have initiated the narration of the passion in dramatized form as the pasos are brought out to the streets. This is a rite that was eventually copied {{by the rest of the}} towns in Bulacan.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Philosophy (Faculty of Liberal Arts in the {{traditional}} sense) was established {{three years after the}} Olomouc College got University rights. Englishman George Warr professed the first lecture on logics on 3 October 1576. From the beginning it was teaching the liberal arts, the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics) which led to the Baccalaureus degree, and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy) which led to the Magister degree. Sharing the fate of Theological faculty in years 1618–1621, it saw a great revival with <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> field of philosophy, but the fields of science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, cartography and finally also genetics being pursued by notable persons connected to the Faculty (however these fields are today read at the Faculty of Science). Following the Olomouc University students' participation in 1848 revolution the Faculty of Philosophy {{was the first one to}} be suppressed by the Habsurgs in 1851. It was reestablished in 1946. With 1953 establishment of the School of Education of Olomouc the Palacký University Faculty of Philosophy was dissolved until being reopened in 1958.|$|E

500|$|When {{deciding}} if a gift has failed, {{attention is}} first {{turned to the}} wording of the trust instrument. The terms of such documents are taken literally; if a particular organisation or purpose is given, the settlor's intention is considered to be no wider or narrower than this. A different approach is used when dealing with cases like Re Faraker, which dealt with a situation where the charity named in the gift had been amalgamated with others. The Court of Appeal held that the amalgamated charities were entitled to the gift, since the charity named effectively continued as part of the amalgamated one. Farwell LJ wrote that, [...] "In all these cases one has to consider <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> means to the end as the charitable end which is in view, and so long as the charitable end is well established the means are only machinery, and no alteration of the machinery can destroy the charitable trust for the benefit of which the machinery is provided." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{years of}} development, {{a feature film}} {{adaptation}} of The Green Hornet was handled by Rogen and Goldberg, with a theatrical release in January 2011. Rogen chose to do a re-imagining of the title character. He was {{executive producer of the}} movie and also cast himself as the main character. Rogen later admitted to having been overwhelmed by handling its $120million budget. [...] "It's insane. But it's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> specific amount of money that's stressful, it's all the things that go along with making a movie of that size." [...] The actor also went on a strict weight-loss diet to play the slim crime fighter. The Green Hornet was a critical disappointment; Adam Graham of the Detroit News called it [...] "a big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie" [...] and the Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz found its story to have fallen apart. Nonetheless it still opened at number one at the box office, making $33million in its opening weekend before going on to gross more than $225million.|$|E

[...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs."

Michelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation in 2013, praised the chemistry between Stewart and Janssen but called it [...] "a terrible episode, an enormous setback in terms of how Next Gen presents women in the 24th century, and the fact that I appreciate several of the performances doesn't mean I don't wish it had never been produced." [...] She questioned that if Kamala's gender was switched about whether the arguments presented in the episode would have remained, and felt it was a missed opportunity to tackle social issues. Keith DeCandido hated the episode in his review for Tor.com in 2012, giving it a score of 2 out of 10, and said that when he first watched it, the episode had left him [...] "seething". He explained that he would [...] "expect a storyline rooted in tiresomely traditional gender roles from a show airing in the late 1960s. <b>Not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s." [...] He said that Janssen was [...] "flat", and did not have any chemistry with Stewart. DeCandido also criticized the Ferengi [...] "at their absolute worst" [...] and the absence of Deanna Troi from the episode.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the verdict}} of a {{successful}} D-Day for the 3rd CID, the failure of Canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than {{the reasons for their}} success. Terry Copp places the blame on Keller, who committed the entirety of the 9th Brigade reserve to land on the narrower beaches of the 8th Brigade—which was itself still fighting to clear the seaside towns—after receiving reports of poor progress by the 7th Brigade. Dutch historian Dan Van der Vat notes that [...] "the planned breakout of the 9th Brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles". Wilmot also places the blame with logistical difficulties of the landing, saying that [...] "on the whole it was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> opposition in front as the congestion behind—on the beaches and in Bernières—that prevented the Canadians from reaching their final D-Day objective". Stacey offers a different view, suggesting that it was not impossible for the 3rd CID to reach its D-Day objectives, and that the failure to do so rests in the fact that [...] "British and Canadian forces were usually better at deceiving the enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved. Perhaps they were rather too easily satisfied". Copp disagrees with Stacey's assessment, suggesting that such caution was not the result of poor planning but of the fact that [...] "the British and Canadians fought the way they had been trained, moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in {{at the first sign of}} a counterattack". He also disputes whether the capture of the final objectives would have been strategically intelligent, observing that [...] "if 9th Brigade had reached Carpiquet and dug in, with artillery in position to offer support, the commander of the 26th Panzer Grenadiers might have followed orders and waited until a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized. Such an attack might well have done far more damage to the Allied beachhead than the hastily improvised operation actually carried out [...] ".|$|E
