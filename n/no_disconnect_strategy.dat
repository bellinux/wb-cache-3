40|$|The set of all permutations, {{ordered by}} pattern containment, forms a poset. This {{extended}} abstract presents the first explicit major {{results on the}} topology of intervals in this poset. We show that almost all (open) intervals in this poset have a disconnected subinterval and are thus not shellable. Nevertheless, {{there seem to be}} large classes of intervals that are shellable and thus have the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres. We prove this to be the case for all intervals of layered permutations that have <b>no</b> <b>disconnected</b> subintervals of rank 3 or more. We also characterize in a simple way those intervals of layered permutations that are disconnected. These results carry over to the poset of generalized subword order when the ordering on the underlying alphabet is a rooted forest. We conjecture that the same applies to intervals of separable permutations, that is, that such an interval is shellable if and only if it has <b>no</b> <b>disconnected</b> subinterval of rank 3 or more. We also present a simplified version of the recursive formula for the Möbius function of decomposable permutations given by Burstein et al...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePaper-based folders {{have been}} widely used to {{coordinate}} cares in medical-social networks, but they introduce some burning issues (e. g. privacy protection, remote access to the folder).

To solve these problems, this paper proposes an experimental platform which combines an EHR system with medical-social folders embedded in a new hardware portable device.

Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|R

30|$|With {{the changes}} of data transfers’ round, the {{variation}} of network connectivity ratio {{is depicted in}} Fig.  9. In every round, the eNB only sends a data package with a fixed length to every receiving UE. In this simulation, besides the number of UEs is fixed to 1200, other parameters {{are the same as}} Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 9, the network connectivity ratio of two schemes reaches 100 % before the rounds of 100, which means there is <b>no</b> <b>disconnected</b> path in two schemes. From the rounds of 100 to 560, the network connectivity ratio of DTO-MROD is higher than that of LIKE-DORE, the main reason refers to the explanation of Fig. 6. But from the rounds of 560 to 700, the network connectivity ratio of DTO-MROD is lower than that of LIKE-DORE, the main reason is that some communication paths with two relays appear in DTO-MROD, but it does not appear in LIKE-DORE, and with a large amount of energy consumed, the paths with two relays {{are more likely to be}} disconnected. Hence, the network connectivity ratio of DTO-MROD decreases significantly in this scope of rounds. After the rounds of 700, the difference between two schemes is getting smaller and smaller with the disappearance of all three-hop (i.e., two relays) communication paths.|$|R
40|$|Canonical {{formalism}} of the rank-three tensor {{model has}} recently been proposed, in which "local" time is consistently incorporated {{by a set of}} first class constraints. By brute-force analysis, this paper shows that there exist only two forms of a Hamiltonian constraint which satisfies the following assumptions: (i) A Hamiltonian constraint has one index. (ii) The kinematical symmetry is given by an orthogonal group. (iii) A consistent first class constraint algebra is formed by a Hamiltonian constraint and the generators of the kinematical symmetry. (iv) A Hamiltonian constraint is invariant under time reversal transformation. (v) A Hamiltonian constraint is an at most cubic polynomial function of canonical variables. (vi) There are <b>no</b> <b>disconnected</b> terms in a constraint algebra. The two forms are the same except for a slight difference in index contractions. The Hamiltonian constraint which was obtained in the previous paper and behaved oddly under time reversal symmetry can actually be transformed to one of them by a canonical change of variables. The two-fold uniqueness is shown up to the potential ambiguity of adding terms which vanish in the limit of pure gravitational physics. Comment: 21 pages, 12 figures. The final result unchanged.

40|$|Advances in {{wastewater}} treatment have greatly improved {{the quality of}} municipal wastewater effluents {{in many parts of}} the world, but despite this, treated wastewaters can still pose a risk to the environment. Licensing plays a crucial role in the regulation of municipal wastewater effluents by setting standards or limits designed to protect the economic, environmental and societal values of waterbodies. Traditionally these standards have focused on physical and chemical water quality parameters within the discharge itself, however these approaches do not adequately account for emerging contaminants, potential effects of chemical mixtures, or variations in the sensitivity and resilience of receiving environments. In this review we focus on a number of industrialised countries and their approach to licensing. We consider how we can ensure licensing is effective, particularly when considering the rapid changes in our understanding of the impacts of discharges, the technical advances in our ability to detect chemicals at low concentrations and the progress in {{wastewater treatment}} technology. In order to meet the challenges required to protect the values of our waterways, licensing of effluents will need to ensure that there is <b>no</b> <b>disconnect</b> between the core values to be protected and the monitoring system designed to scrutinise performance of the WWTP. In many cases this may mean an expansion in the monitoring approaches used for both the effluent itself and the receiving waterbody. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|Materials and {{manufacturing}} processes {{are an integral}} part of the design of a product. The need to combine materials {{and manufacturing}} processes selection during the early stages of the design has previously been realized. The work that generally attracts the most attention is by M. F. Ashby. This methodology, like others, concentrates on materials and manufacturing processes selection after the conceptual design is completed and before moving into embodiment design. The disadvantage of waiting until the conceptual design is completed to address materials and manufacturing processes is that the designer cannot search for conceptual solutions when dealing with issues relating to the materials and manufacturing processes domains. By not considering these issues early on in the design process, the scope for innovation is reduced and this results in the designer being fixated on the configuration at hand. It is well recognized that this is not the best way to address a design challenge and an even worse approach to innovation. The basic framework for which enhancements and improvements are suggested is the design methodology practiced and taught by the members of the Institute for Innovation and Design in Engineering (IIDE) at Texas A&M University. Conceptual design is very much a part of the IIDE design process; but the current format concentrates on functional parameters and how to search for conceptual solutions for these, and does not highlight materials and manufacturing issues in the preliminary design stages where it could be most helpful. The work documented in this thesis is an attempt to ensure that there is <b>no</b> <b>disconnect</b> between function oriented design and the materials and manufacturing processes that are applicable to that design. The core of the thesis is to incorporate a thought process which will help the designer during conceptual design phase to: 1. Consciously question if there materials and manufacturing issues; 2. Identify critical parameters in both of these domains; and 3. Search for conceptual solutions to these identified critical parameters...|$|R
