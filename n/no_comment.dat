5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five {{bodies were found}} to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.|$|E

5|$|Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of LÃ¤rm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, <b>No</b> <b>Comment,</b> Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|E
5|$|This working {{definition}} {{has since}} been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals. Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. It {{does not address the}} dispute over the lower mass limit, and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector AM Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated {{much of what}} Chintanda {{had said}} {{regarding}} Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and {{had told him to}} have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma said that he would not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he had suggested if the Company wished. He made <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E

5|$|The British people {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July. Attlee and his Secretary of State for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered {{a review of}} the Indian situation. Jinnah had <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E
5|$|Retribution is {{the second}} of the two {{authorized}} add-on packs released for StarCraft. The add-on was developed by Stardock and published by WizardWorks. It was released for the PC in late 1998. The game is set during the second campaign in StarCraft, revolving around the acquisition of a crystal of immense power connected to the Xel'Naga. Divided into three campaigns, the player assumes the roles of a Protoss fleet executor, the commander of a Dominion task force and a Zerg cerebrate, all tasked with retrieving the crystal from a Dominion colony and getting it off the planet as quickly as possible. As with its predecessor, Retribution does not include any new gameplay features beyond its single player campaigns and an abundance of multiplayer levels. The add-on was not well received by reviewers, and instead was regarded as average but at least challenging. Retribution is not widely available, and Blizzard Entertainment offers <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> regarding support or the availability of Retribution despite authorizing the add-on.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{focused on}} three role-playing games created for Nintendo's Wii home video game console {{during the last}} years of its life: Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story and Pandora's Tower. Xenoblade Chronicles, developed by Monolith Soft, was an entry in the Xeno series, initially announced as an original project dubbed Monado: Beginning of the World. It was announced under this title at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), but its title was changed to honor earlier Xeno titles created by the game's writer Tetsuya Takahashi. The Last Story was developed by Mistwalker, a company created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and intended to be a game that ran contrary to typical elements of the genre based on feedback from the company's previous titles Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey. Pandora's Tower was developed by Ganbarion, who had previously worked primarily on licensed titles and pitched the concept to Nintendo after favorably impressing them with their work on Jump Ultimate Stars. Despite hopes from fans and journalists that the titles would be released overseas, Nintendo gave <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> on the matter. The only explanation for the lack of localization was related to The Last Story: Nintendo stated that due to their work on Kirby's Epic Yarn and titles for the new Nintendo 3DS, The Last Story was too much effort. Nintendo of Europe did want to feature Xenoblade Chronicles at E3 2011, but Nintendo's American branch prevented it without explanation. In response to this and continued silence on both The Last Story and Pandora's Tower, Operation Rainfall was born.|$|E

25|$|Gillard {{announced}} that the first 200 U.S. Marines had arrived in Darwin from Hawaii on late 3 April 2012.

The agreement between the two governments remains hidden from public scrutiny. Marine numbers based in Darwin have increased to more than 1150 troops by 2014.|$|E
25|$|July 2004 saw the {{introduction}} of several in-character blogs. The main characters all began writing (using Blogger) to speak to their audience.

As of October 2010, the character blogs have not been updated in over a year, with <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> from Onstad on whether he plans to continue them.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 1997, Nintendo {{issued a}} press conference announcing the first in what would become a series of the product's launch delays, saying it had been rescheduled to March 1998, with <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> on an American release schedule. At that time, the delays were {{reportedly}} attributed to the protracted development of both the disks and the drive technologies. On June 9, 1997, Nintendo and Alps Electric announced their manufacturing partnership for the still tentatively titled 64DD.|$|E

25|$|It must {{be remembered}} that the DTM is only a model and cannot {{necessarily}} predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates may be for an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size.

It is not applicable for high levels of development, {{as it has been}} shown that after a HDI of 0.9 the fertility increases again.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{unsubstantiated}} {{story that}} during {{his meeting with}} Hitler, Mannerheim lit a cigar. Mannerheim supposed that Hitler would ask Finland for help against the Soviet Union, which Mannerheim was unwilling to give. When Mannerheim lit up, all in attendance gasped, for Hitler's aversion to smoking was well known. Yet Hitler continued the conversation calmly, with <b>no</b> <b>comment.</b> In this way, Mannerheim could judge if Hitler was speaking {{from a position of}} strength or weakness. He was able to refuse Hitler, knowing that Hitler was in a weak position, and could not dictate to him.|$|E
25|$|Electronic body music {{combines}} {{elements of}} industrial music and electronic dance music. It {{first came to}} prominence in Belgium. The name was coined by Ralf HÃ¼tter of Kraftwerk in 1978 to explain the more physical sound of their album The Man-Machine. The term was later used in its current sense by Belgian group Front 242 in 1984 to describe their EP <b>No</b> <b>Comment,</b> released in the same year. It denotes {{a certain type of}} danceable electronic music, a mixture of electropunk and industrial music.
