Surface plasmon resonance is used by biochemists to study the mechanisms and kinetics of ligands binding to receptors (i.e. a substrate binding to an enzyme).

50|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which may form {{a thin layer}} with a different composition from the bulk. For example, {{a thin layer of}} silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure. This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates. Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2-20 Å). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si3N3, is about 10 Å thick, but for special boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero. Complexion can be grouped in 6 categories, according to their thickness: monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, <b>nanolayer</b> (with equilibrium thickness between 1 and 2 nm) and wetting. In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.|$|E

It was found that the as-deposited <b>nanolayer</b> WN/TiN coating showed relatively high nano hardness and wear resistance as compared with the single layer TiN.

40|$|Metallic <b>nanolayers</b> have {{attracted}} increasing attention as they provide {{unique opportunity to}} investigate the influence of layer interfaces on mechanical properties of metallic nanocomposites. High strength is often achieved at small (several nm) individual layer thickness (h). Recently, we discovered high-density stacking faults in FCC Co in highly (100) textured Cu/Co multilayers. In contrast in (111) textured Cu/Co <b>nanolayers,</b> Co remained its stable HCP structure at large h. The two Cu/Co systems have very different size dependent strengthening behavior. HCP Cu/Co has much greater peak strength than FCC Cu/Co. The large discrepancy in their strengthening mechanisms is discussed and compared to those of highly textured Cu/Ni multilayer systems. In another highly textured <b>nanolayers</b> system, Ag/Al, epitaxial interfaces were observed across various h (1 ‑ 200 nm). High-density nanotwins and stacking faults appear in both Ag and Al layers, and stacking fault density in Al increases sharply with decreasing h. At smaller h, hardness of Ag/Al <b>nanolayers</b> increases monotonically and no softening was observed. These studies allow us to investigate the influence of layer interfaces, stacking faults and nanotwins on strengthening mechanisms of metallic <b>nanolayers.</b> This research is funded by DOE–OBES...|$|R
40|$|FePt-Ag {{nanocomposite}} {{films with}} large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have been fabricated by alternate-atomic-layer {{electron beam evaporation}} onto MgO(100) substrates at the low temperature of 300 °C. Their magnetization behavior and microstructure have been studied. The surface topography was observed and varied from continuous to nanogranular microstructures with insertion of Ag <b>nanolayers</b> into Fe/Pt bilayer films. The measurement of angular-dependent coercivity showed a tendency of the domain-wall motion as a typical peak behavior shift toward more like a coherent Stoner-Wohlfarth rotation type with the insertion of Ag <b>nanolayers</b> into the FePt films. On the other hand, the inter-grain interaction was determined from a Kelly-Henkel plot. The FePt film without insertion of Ag <b>nanolayers</b> has a positive δM, indicating strong exchange coupling between neighboring grains, whereas the FePt film with insertion of Ag <b>nanolayers</b> has a negative δM, indicating that inter-grain exchange coupling is weaker, thus leading {{to the presence of}} dipole interaction in the FePt–Ag nanogranular films. The magnetic characteristic measurements confirmed that the perpendicular magnetization reversal behavior and related surface morphology of low-temperature-ordered FePt(001) nanogranular films can be systematically controlled by the insertion of Ag <b>nanolayers</b> into the FePt system for next generation magnetic storage medium applications...|$|R

Atomic force microscopy determined a homogeneous roughness. Scanning electron microscopy evinced a porous microstructure that can stimulate the growth of the bone tissue into pores.

30|$|The large {{difference}} between the predictions of Equations  5 and 1 is from {{the result of the}} <b>nanolayer</b> effect on the SHC. This could be better understood by looking at the third term in the numerator of Equation  4. Since the weight of nanolayers (Wlayer’) increases as particle concentration increases, it results in a further reduced SHC, provided that the <b>nanolayer</b> has a lower SHC than that of molten salt. Furthermore, the increase of SHC with increasing particle size is also a result of the <b>nanolayer</b> effect. For a given NP concentration, the <b>nanolayer</b> effect increases as particle size reduces since the number of particle increases with reducing particle size. Thus, one observes a decreased SHC as particle size reduces, and particle concentration increases because of the augmentation of the <b>nanolayer</b> effect.|$|E

The microstructure and elemental and phase composition of the HP-coated Ti substrates were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry. The photophysical properties of the photofunctional <b>nanolayer</b> coatings were confirmed using reflectance ultraviolet-visible absorption and emission spectrophotometry. The singlet oxygen generation efficiency of the photofunctional <b>nanolayer</b> coatings was determined using the decomposition reaction of 1, 3 -diphenylisobenzofuran.

UV–VIS spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance analysis showed {{that the amount of}} MB loaded increased with the distance from the first layer, suggesting that the MB was able to diffuse into the κ-carrageenan/chitosan <b>nanolayered</b> coating and not only adhered {{to the surface of the}} layer immediately below it. For most of the tested conditions, the MB release from the κ-carrageenan/chitosan <b>nanolayered</b> coatings was successfully described by the linear superimposition model, which allowed concluding that MB transport is due to both concentration gradient and the polymer relaxation of the <b>nanolayers.</b> However, depending on temperature and pH of the medium and on the position of MB incorporated on the <b>nanolayered</b> coatings, different mechanisms prevail.

40|$|Following the "adhesion-decalcification" concept, {{specific}} functional monomers {{possess the}} capacity to primary chemically interact with hydroxyapatite (HAp). Such ionic bonding with synthetic HAp has been demonstrated for 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP), manifest as self-assembled "nanolayering". In continuation of that basic research this study aimed to explore whether <b>nanolayering</b> also occurs on enamel and dentin when a 10 -MDP primer is applied following a common clinical application protocol. Therefore, the interaction of an experimental 10 -MDP primer and a control, commercially available, 10 -MDP-based primer (Clearfil SE Bond primer (C-SE), Kuraray) with enamel and dentin was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), complemented with transmission electron microscopy interfacial ultrastructural data upon their reaction with enamel and dentin. In addition, XRD was used to study {{the effect of the}} concentration of 10 -MDP on <b>nanolayering</b> on dentin. Finally, the stability of the <b>nanolayers</b> was determined by measuring the bond strength to enamel and dentin when a photoinitiator was added to the experimental primer or when interfacial polymerization depended solely on the photoinitiator supplied with the subsequently applied adhesive resin. XRD confirmed <b>nanolayering</b> on enamel and dentin, which was significantly greater on dentin than on enamel, and also when the surface was actively rubbed with the primer. <b>Nanolayering</b> was also proportional to the concentration of 10 -MDP in the primer. Finally, the experimental primer needed the photoinitiator to obtain a tensile bond strength to dentin comparable with that of the control C-SE primer (which also contains a photoinitiator), but not when bonded to enamel. It is concluded that self-assembled <b>nanolayering</b> occurs on enamel and dentin, even when following a clinically used application protocol. The lower bonding effectiveness of mild self-etch adhesives to enamel should be ascribed in part to a lower chemical reactivity (<b>nanolayering)</b> with enamel HAp. status: publishe...|$|R

This 2 D shape index is determined bystatistical analysis of the CoMoS <b>nanolayers</b> identified after principal component analysis processing of HR HAADF-STEM images. It is shown that this shape index, reflecting the isotropic/anisotropic degree of the nanolayers' morphology, is directly linked to the nature of active M- and S-edges exposed by the CoMoS <b>nanolayers,</b> as proposed by DFTcalculations. This 2 D shape index may thus serve as a key descriptor for the selectivity of the CoMoS <b>nanolayers.</b> The correlation isrationalized by a simple kinetic modeling where hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrogenation (HYD) rate constants are parametrized {{as a function of the}} S-edge/M-edge sites by using DFT-calculated descriptors.
