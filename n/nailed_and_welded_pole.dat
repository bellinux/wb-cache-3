Do you know how the metal pieces of your car have been <b>welded?</b> <b>Nails</b> <b>and</b> rivets are long gone! Today we use lasers to join multiple pieces of metal with different types of surfaces - curved or straight. Using lasers to cut <b>and</b> <b>weld</b> is cheaper, safer and faster than older techniques and lasers can be easily controlled by robots for high accuracy and high throughput. New powerful lasers {{can also be used to}} cut different materials such as plastics, ceramics and metals. The emergence of new types of lasers made it possible. All thanks to the progress in Photonics...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} were oriented on {{the analysis}} of the mechanical performance at local (knit lines <b>and</b> <b>welds)</b> <b>and</b> bulk (molded part) areas, with the influence of molding <b>and</b> <b>welding</b> conditions. It has been found that for non-reinforced and reinforced nylon, the mechanical performance in the knit planes <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> areas are approximately equal to the mechanical performance of a base resin (matrix). The observations on similarities and differences in the formation of knit <b>and</b> <b>weld</b> lines are presented in Part I of this paper. Analysis of mechanical performance at weld at knit lines of various nylons is discussed in Part II...|$|R
