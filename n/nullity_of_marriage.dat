5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> his <b>marriage</b> to Catherine <b>of</b> Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|R
5000|$|Members of the Catholic Church are {{required}} to marry {{in front of a}} priest (or deacon), and normally with at least one other witness, which can be a layperson. The priest or deacon is not the minister of the sacrament; the man and wife are the ministers by exchanging vows, though the cleric presides over the exchange of the vows and any Mass or nuptial liturgical celebration (CCC 1630). If one of the parties is Catholic, but there is a serious reason why the marriage should be celebrated in front of a civil servant or a non-Catholic minister, a dispensation can be granted. If no dispensation was granted and the couple did not observe this law, the marriage is considered invalid. Because the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> is clear from the circumstances {{there is no need for}} a canonical process to issue a Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Nullity.</b> The correction <b>of</b> this invalidity requires the couple to exchange their consent according to canonical form (commonly called [...] "convalidation").|$|R

5000|$|The {{favor of}} {{dispensation}} from a marriage ratum sed non consumatum is an inherently administrative procedure, while {{the process for}} obtaining a Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Nullity</b> (often misleadingly termed [...] "annulment") is an inherently judicial one. In a ratum the valid marriage bond is dispensed from, while in a Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Nullity</b> a <b>marriage</b> is declared to have been null from its beginning. A ratum ends, for a just reason, a marriage that truly is (although never irrevocably and sacramentally [...] "sealed" [...] by consummation) while a Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Nullity</b> juridically declares that a marriage never truly was {{in the eyes of}} Catholic theology and matrimonial law.|$|R
50|$|His {{fortunes}} {{were linked}} {{with those of}} Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's Vicar General.

Early in 1543, he was knighted, appointed Secretary of State in Wriothesley's place and placed on various commissions to inquire into causes of supposed heresy. In 1544, Henry made William a Privy Councillor, and on 9 July 1544, one of his two Principal Secretaries selected to assist Queen Catherine in carrying on the Regency in the small 'Regency Council' during Henry's absence, and to raise supplies for the King's expedition to Boulogne. In 1545, he was sent abroad as ambassador to the great Emperor Charles V, {{but at the end of}} the year was summoned back to the Privy Council.|$|R
50|$|In the {{situation}} that a marriage is void or voidable, any legitimately interested party (usually {{one of the parties}} to the marriage) can seek a declarator of <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> from the Court of Session, which will acknowledge that their marriage is void and, in effect, never existed.

5000|$|He must be {{summoned to}} any trial {{in which there}} is question, before a {{competent}} judge, of the validity or <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> a <b>marriage,</b> and any proceeding will be null if he is not duly cited. He must have the opportunity to examine the witnesses, and, orally or in writing, to bring forward whatever arguments may favour the validity <b>of</b> the <b>marriage.</b> He must be cited even though the party interested in the defence <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> be present, and all the acts of the court are always to be accessible to him, and at any time he has a right to bring forward new documents or witnesses favourable to the marriage. On assuming his office he must take an oath to fulfill his duties and he is expected to renew the oath in each case. If the judge decides in favour <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> the defender takes no further action unless its opponent appeals to a higher court. Here a defender undertakes anew the defence of its validity. If the judge of the first instance decides against the validity <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> and no one else appeals, the defender <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> has the right to appeal to the higher court. If he feels it his duty to appeal, a new marriage may not be contracted until his plea is heard.|$|R
50|$|The Rota's main {{function}} {{is that of}} an appellate tribunal, ordinarily reviewing decisions of lower courts if the initial court (first instance) and the first appellate court (second instance) do not agree {{on the outcome of}} a case; however, any party to an initial decision before a court of the Latin Church (and also some Eastern Churches) has the right to file a second-instance appeal directly to the Rota. Dominating its case load are petitions seeking the issuance of a decree <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> a <b>marriage,</b> although it has jurisdiction to hear any other type of judicial and non-administrative case in any area of canon law. The Rota serves as a tribunal of first instance (in Anglo-American common law what would be termed exclusive original jurisdiction) in certain cases such as any contentious case in which a Bishop of the Latin Church is a defendant. If the case can still be appealed after a Rotal decision, the appeal goes to a different turnus, or panel, of the Rota.|$|R
