50|$|With the {{manufacturing}} of new high power LEDs, came pulsed LED/triggered three CCD camera systems. Flashing the LED light source {{for a very}} short time span gives the full frame CCD camera a stop action of the film, allowing continuous film motion. With CCD video cameras that have a trigger input, the camera now can be electronically synced up to the film transport framing. There are now a number of retail and home made Pulsed LED/triggered camera systems. An array of high-power multiple red, green and blue LEDs is pulsed just as the film frame is positioned in front of the optical lens. The camera sends the single, <b>non-interlaced</b> <b>image</b> of the film frame to a digital frame store, where the electronic picture is clocked out at the selected TV frame rate for PAL or NTSC or other standard. More advanced systems replace the sprocket wheel with laser or camera based perf detection and image stabilization system.|$|E
25|$|The pixels {{within each}} line are not interlaced, but {{presented}} consecutively {{from left to}} right. As with <b>non-interlaced</b> <b>images,</b> there is no break between the data for one line and {{the data for the}} next. The indicator that an image is interlaced is a bit set in the image's header block.|$|R
50|$|Thumbnails is a {{separate}} folder for a document thumbnail. The thumbnail must be saved as “thumbnail.png”. A thumbnail representation of a document should be generated by default when the file is saved. It should be {{a representation of the}} first page, first sheet, etc. of the document. The required size for the thumbnails is 128x128 pixel. In order to conform to the Thumbnail Managing Standard (TMS) at www.freedesktop.org, thumbnails must be saved as 8bit, <b>non-interlaced</b> PNG <b>image</b> with full alpha transparency.|$|R
40|$|In {{the near}} future, Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) which {{is well known}} in the area of {{mammography}} might be used to support clinical experts in the diagnosis of images derived from imaging modalities such as endoscopy. In the recent past, a few first approaches for computer assisted endoscopy have been presented already. These systems use a video signal as an input that is provided by the endoscopes video processor. Despite the advent of high-definition systems most standard endoscopy systems today still provide only analog video signals. These signals consist of interlaced images that can not be used in a CAD approach without deinterlacing. Of course, there are many different deinterlacing approaches known today. But most of them are specializations of some basic approaches. In this paper we present four basic deinterlacing approaches. We have used a database of <b>non-interlaced</b> <b>images</b> which have been degraded by artificial interlacing and afterwards processed by these approaches. The database contains regions of interest (ROI) of clinical relevance for the diagnosis of abnormalities in the esophagus. We compared the classification rates on these ROIs on the original images and after the deinterlacing. The results show that the deinterlacing has an impact on the classification rates. The Bobbing approach and the Motion Compensation approach achieved the best classification results in most cases...|$|R
