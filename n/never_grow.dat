Howe, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, had been a captain with the Union Army in the Civil War and made an unsuccessful run for the Indiana State Senate as a Democrat before Louis' birth. Louis had two stepsisters, Maria and Cora, from his mother's previous marriage. Howe was sickly and fragile as a child, suffered from asthma, and was generally kept home by his parents; he would <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> to more than five feet tall. Fearing to expose Howe to public school, his parents instead enrolled him in an all-girls seminary.|$|E

500|$|During the summer, Reed left Cape Cod {{to cover}} the Progressive Party {{convention}} in Chicago, {{and at other times}} he retreated from the players to work on articles for Collier's and Metropolitan Magazine. During these absences, Bryant and O'Neill became lovers, not surprising in a group that professed and practiced free love. Reed, made aware of this new development, responded by inviting O'Neill to begin taking his meals with them. In a note to Field, Bryant said that her relationship with Reed was [...] "so beautiful and so free!...

Woodburne has revealed {{that there is no}} chance of Susan growing her long hair back. She said [...] "I could <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> it long again. I love the ease of having short hair. Back when it was long, I used to wash and dry my hair every morning at home before going into work. That added an extra half-hour to my day". She also added that the Neighbours bosses at the time believed that women should have long hair. In April 2012, Susan debuted [...] "a stylish new haircut" [...] representing her single status.|$|E
500|$|Giles' truth, {{according}} to Whedon, {{is that he}} realizes he must not [...] "fight my kid's battles or my kid will <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> up", which he sings in [...] "Standing" [...] while he throws knives at Buffy {{as part of her}} training. Whedon remarked that this touch [...] "is the kind of complete turnaround that is a staple of the Buffy universe". Tara's heartfelt love song also has an ironic subtext; although she appears to mean that she is fulfilled by her relationship with Willow, the lyrics include multiple allusions to Willow working her manipulative will over Tara, overlaid with Tara's euphoric singing about her pleasure in their union. In , Lorna Jowett calls the song between Willow and Tara the transformational event in their relationship, from Tara's subservient bearing towards Willow, into a relationship of equals. Two Buffy essayists note that Willow and Giles sing together {{at the start of the}} episode, but later Tara and Giles share a duet to express the diminished part each plays in their respective relationships.|$|E

He remarked in 2008 that he would <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> tired of Hell March, and was thankful it had resonated with so many fans. Around this time, he composed using Cubase, Kontakt, a MOTU 2408 audio interface, and several instruments. Collaborating with Video Games Live, Klepacki performed Hell March and its Red Alert 2 version in Las Vegas in 2008, and later performed Hell March 3 in the Netherlands with a choir and orchestra through the Games in Concert series; he wore a Soviet army conscript uniform for the song.

500|$|Several {{well-known}} {{directors have}} praised City Lights. Orson Welles {{said it was}} his favorite film. In a 1963 interview in the American magazine Cinema, Stanley Kubrick rated City Lights as fifth among his top ten films. In 1972, the renowned Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky placed City Lights as fifth among his top ten and said of Chaplin, [...] "He {{is the only person}} to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> old." [...] George Bernard Shaw called Chaplin [...] "the only genius {{to come out of the}} movie industry". Celebrated Italian director Federico Fellini often praised this film, and his Nights of Cabiria refers to it. In the 2003 documentary Charlie: The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin, Woody Allen said it was Chaplin's best picture. Allen is said to have based the final scene of his 1979 film Manhattan on its final scene. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has summarized all the best criticism and all the notable filmmakers who have singled out City Lights as their favorite Chaplin film throughout the decades in the Criterion Collection audio commentary track for the film. Vance has written that among all the praise afforded the film can be added that [...] "City Lights also holds the distinction of being Chaplin's own favorite of all his films." ...|$|E
500|$|As a filmmaker, Chaplin is {{considered}} a pioneer {{and one of the}} most influential figures of the early twentieth century. He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin [...] "changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar" [...] and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama. He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it. Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama A Woman of Paris (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film The Marriage Circle (1924) and thus played a part in the development of [...] "sophisticated comedy". According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were [...] "rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft." [...] Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called Chaplin [...] "a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended"), Jacques Tati ("Without him I would never have made a film"), René Clair ("He inspired practically every filmmaker"), Michael Powell, Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica, and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as [...] "the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> old." ...|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times {{reviewer}} Patrick Kevin Day {{stated that}} {{at this point in the}} series, he [...] "initially fretted that Fringe would <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> beyond a run-of-the-mill [...] "X-Files" [...] knock-off," [...] but now saw the creators' intentions. Sarah Stegall of SFScope called the episode an homage to X-Files episode [...] "D.P.O.", whose featured character has a similar premise to Meegar. Stegall admitted that [...] "this show is growing on me," [...] with the same atmosphere as The X-Files [...] "coupled with a slightly better grounding in actual science." [...] Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend reacted positively towards the episode, commending it as it [...] "bounced back so quickly from that lame silver cylinder episode or they would've lost me forever." [...] Dougherty also felt that the three protagonists, Olivia, Walter and Peter, [...] "are becoming much more believable characters." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B−, opining that the cold open was the series' best since the pilot, but added that [...] "despite the added [...] sympathy, 'Power Hungry' promptly peters out, because the level of oddity required for Walter and the Pattern Team to track the Freak down isn't especially high." [...] Murray added that the return of Scott and his scenes with Olivia [...] "serves to string along the home viewer, inviting us to question whether Olivia's playing for the right team in this whole Pattern game." [...] Television Without Pity meanwhile, graded the episode with an A−.|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} the Pawnee summer catalog, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly organizes a reunion between Ron (Nick Offerman) and his three predecessors. She anticipates a joyous {{occasion}} and plans {{to write a letter}} about it for the catalog. However, none of the four men get along with each other, and all of them are difficult to get along with. One of them (Dakin Matthews) litters repeatedly, treats everybody disrespectfully, and cheerfully says he never gave a damn about the Parks department and only took the job because it had an easy path to job security and a lucrative pension. Another one (Jack Wallace) exhibits a sexist attitude, and tells Leslie she should not be working there due to menstruation issues. The third (Michael Gross) constantly talks about his affinity for marijuana, {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I've planted marijuana in community gardens across this city," [...] and particularly clashes with Ron (who forced him out of the position years ago) who cheerfully confirms he screwed his predecessor over and otherwise is his usual detached self. Later, a frustrated Leslie decides she cannot write the catalog letter; she stops treating the former directors with any respect by telling the sexist to shut up and calling them [...] "turds" [...] when she briefly takes a throwaway picture and then walks away from without another word. Ron takes her out to dinner to apologize, and the two process their mutual respect for each other, and vow they will <b>never</b> <b>grow</b> to hate each other the way the four former directors do. Ron even tells Leslie that he wants her to take over his Parks Director position if he becomes Pawnee's City Manager. However, Ron cheerfully says in an interview that one of his first acts as City Manager would be to eliminate the Parks department, while Leslie gives an equally upbeat interview where she says one of her first acts as City Manager, were she to leapfrog Ron for the job, would be to double the department's size.|$|E
