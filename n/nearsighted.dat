5|$|Blythe, who is <b>nearsighted,</b> {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

25|$|Hamsters have poor eyesight; {{they are}} <b>nearsighted</b> and colorblind. Hamsters have scent glands on their flanks (and abdomens in Chinese and dwarf hamsters) which they rub against the substrate, leaving a scent trail. Hamsters also use {{their sense of}} smell to {{distinguish}} between the sexes, and to locate food. They are also particularly sensitive to high-pitched noises and can hear and communicate in the ultrasonic range.|$|E
25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very <b>nearsighted</b> and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|Spastic diplegia (the lower {{extremities}} {{are affected}} {{with little to}} no upper-body spasticity). The {{most common form of}} the spastic forms. Most people with spastic diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait. Flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common. Hip problems, dislocations, and in three-quarters of spastic diplegics, also strabismus (crossed eyes), can be present as well. In addition, these individuals are often <b>nearsighted.</b> The intelligence of a person with spastic diplegia is unaffected by the condition.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol can {{alleviate}} the drinker’s feelings of stress or anxiety. Alcohol myopia limits those {{under the influence}} of alcohol to see the world through a <b>nearsighted</b> lens; in other words, consumption of alcohol will lead individuals to temporarily forget about previous worries or problems, for these feelings lay outside of the restricted set of immediate cues that the drinker can respond to. By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol myopia can bring the drinker a sense of relief.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{amblyopia}} {{can be any}} condition that interferes with focusing during early childhood. This can occur from poor alignment of the eyes, an eye being irregularly shaped such that focusing is difficult, one eye being more <b>nearsighted</b> or farsighted than the other, or clouding of the lens of an eye. After the underlying cause is fixed, vision is not restored right away, as the mechanism also involves the brain. Amblyopia {{can be difficult to}} detect, so vision testing is recommended for all children around the ages of four to five.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{discovered}} {{at the crime}} scene suggested the victim's body had been placed {{in the back seat of}} a car, then driven to the disposal location, where her body was dragged out of the car and around the trunk of the vehicle, then rolled down the ravine. Furthermore, on November 21, a pair of Liberty brand glasses belonging to a <b>nearsighted</b> individual were found approximately 50 feet (18 m) from the location where the victim's body had been placed in the ravine, although it remains inconclusive whether these glasses are related to the case.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} Stickler {{syndrome}} are very <b>nearsighted</b> (described as having high myopia) {{because of the}} shape of the eye. People with eye involvement are prone to increased pressure within the eye (ocular hypertension) which could lead to glaucoma and tearing or detachment of the light-sensitive retina of the eye (retinal detachment). Cataract may also present as an ocular complication associated with Stickler's Syndrome. The jelly-like substance within the eye (the vitreous humour) has a distinctive appearance in the types of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes. As a result, regular appointments to a specialist ophthalmologist are advised. The type of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL11A2 gene does not affect the eye.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Berdella was intelligent, but {{a classic}} loner who rarely played outside his own home, and seldom had friends visit his home to socialize with him. He was also {{severely}} <b>nearsighted</b> (resulting in his {{being required to}} wear thick glasses {{from the age of}} five) and afflicted with a slight speech impediment. Furthermore, as a child, he would be diagnosed as suffering from a high blood pressure, for which he was prescribed several medications. In part because of this diagnosis, Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel (b. 1956), displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure on Berdella's part, and would often compare him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father would also become physically and emotionally abusive against his children, and is known to have beaten them with a leather strap.|$|E
25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} {{tend to have}} good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most {{sensitive}} to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are <b>nearsighted</b> because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects {{to the roof of}} the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson’s organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.|$|E
25|$|Ranma goes {{to school}} with Akane at , where he meets his {{recurring}} opponent Tatewaki Kuno, the conceited kendo team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also {{falls in love with}} Ranma's female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters knowing it). Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the <b>nearsighted</b> Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
500|$|Research has {{confirmed}} that when <b>nearsighted</b> subjects remove their corrective lenses, over {{time there is}} a limited improvement (termed [...] "blur adaptation") in their unaided visual resolution, even though refraction indicates no corresponding change in refractive error. This is believed to occur due to adjustments made in the visual system. One who has been practicing Bates' techniques and notices such improvement may not realize that simply leaving the glasses off {{would have had the}} same effect, which may be especially pronounced if the prescription was too strong to begin with.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) {{published}} {{a review of}} various research regarding [...] "visual training", which consisted of [...] "eye exercises, muscle relaxation techniques, biofeedback, eye patches, or eye massages", [...] "alone or in combinations". No evidence was found that such techniques could objectively benefit eyesight, though some studies noted changes, both positive and negative, in the visual acuity of <b>nearsighted</b> subjects as measured by a Snellen chart. In some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow-ups. However, these results were not seen as actual reversals of nearsightedness, and were attributed instead to factors such as [...] "improvements in interpreting blurred images, changes in mood or motivation, creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes, or a pinhole effect from miosis of the pupil." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Illinois were written, recorded, engineered, and {{produced}} by Stevens, {{with most of the}} material being recorded at The Buddy Project studio in Astoria, Queens, and in Stevens' Brooklyn apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations, with additional piano recorded in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn; strings and vocals performed in collaborators' apartments; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and vibraphone played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City. Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself: [...] "I was pretty <b>nearsighted</b> in the construction of Illinois. I {{spent a lot of time}} alone, a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio. I let things germinate and cultivate independently, without thinking about an audience or a live show at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, Vera Constantinova {{appeared}} small and dumpy with a fat, round face. She wore her hair very short, which gave her a masculine look. [...] Extremely <b>nearsighted,</b> she wore a pince-nez. She was considered rather eccentric, but she had {{a good sense of humor}} and her funny remarks were remembered by her nephews and nieces. She was well liked by her family.|$|E
2500|$|Birdo has {{appeared}} {{several times in}} promotional items, including figurines, plush toys, and other collectibles such as a chess set. [...] A mother Birdo was featured in the episode [...] "The Bird! The Bird!" [...] of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, kidnapping Toad due to being <b>nearsighted,</b> and believing Toad to be her lost son Cheepy. [...] "Birdo", the first track of Horse the Band's album The Mechanical Hand, heavily references the character.|$|E
2500|$|Pigmentary {{glaucoma}} (also, pigmentary dispersion syndrome) {{is caused}} by pigment cells sloughing off {{from the back of}} the iris and floating around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular meshwork. [...] It is a rare condition that occurs mostly among Caucasians, mostly males in their mid-20s to 40s, and most are <b>nearsighted.</b>|$|E
2500|$|His {{literary}} works {{belong to the}} fantastic and autobiographical genres. The best known are the novels Maitreyi ("La Nuit Bengali" [...] or [...] "Bengal Nights"), Noaptea de Sânziene ("The Forbidden Forest"), Isabel și apele diavolului ("Isabel and the Devil's Waters") and Romanul Adolescentului Miop ("Novel of the <b>Nearsighted</b> Adolescent"), the novellas Domnișoara Christina ("Miss Christina") and Tinerețe fără tinerețe ("Youth Without Youth"), and the short stories Secretul doctorului Honigberger ("The Secret of Dr. Honigberger") and La Țigănci ("With the Gypsy Girls").|$|E

He just could not see anymore.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{earliest}} novel, titled Novel of the <b>Nearsighted</b> Adolescent and {{written in the}} first person, Eliade depicts his experience through high school. It is proof of the influence exercised on him by the literature of Giovanni Papini, and in particular by Papini's story Un uomo finito. Each of its chapters reads like an independent novella, and, in all, the work experiments with the limits traced between novel and diary. Literary critic Eugen Simion called it [...] "the most valuable" [...] among Eliade's earliest literary attempts, but noted that, being [...] "ambitious", the book had failed to achieve [...] "an aesthetically satisfactory format". According to Simion, the innovative intent of the Novel... was provided by its technique, by its goal of providing authenticity in depicting experiences, and by its insight into adolescent psychology. The novel notably shows its narrator practicing self-flagellation.|$|E
2500|$|Lorde {{was born}} in New York City, to Caribbean {{immigrants}} from Barbados and Carriacou, Frederick Byron Lorde (known as Byron) and Linda Gertrude Belmar Lorde, who settled in Harlem. Lorde's mother was of mixed ancestry but could [...] "pass" [...] for white, which {{was a source of}} pride for her family. Lorde's father was darker than the Belmar family liked, and they only allowed the couple to marry because of Byron Lorde's charm, ambition, and persistence. <b>Nearsighted</b> {{to the point of being}} legally blind and the youngest of three daughters (her two older sisters were named Phyllis and Helen), Audre Lorde grew up hearing her mother's stories about the West Indies. At the age of four, she learned to talk while she learned to read, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in the eighth grade.|$|E
2500|$|Other unique {{themes are}} things like [...] "Garfield's Believe it or Don't", [...] "Garfield's Law", [...] "Garfield's History of Dogs", and [...] "Garfield's History of Cats", which show science, history, {{and the world}} from Garfield's point of view. Another {{particular}} theme is [...] "National Fat Week", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and [...] "kicking Odie into next week". Soon, Garfield realizes that [...] "Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food," [...] (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself). A {{few days after the}} storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a [...] "nagging feeling I'm forgetting something," [...] with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel. Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very <b>nearsighted)</b> old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is [...] "Splut Week", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia 'splut', hence the name.|$|E

60|$|Selwyn {{saw little}} change in her. But was it {{possible}} that the tall, handsome young lady with the sleek brown pompadour and a nose unmistakably and plebeianly Grant, who sat by the window doing something to a heap of lace and organdy in her lap, was the little curly-headed, sunburned sister of thirteen whom he remembered? The young man leaning against the sideboard must be Leo, of course; a fine-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow who made Selwyn think suddenly that he must be growing old. And there was the little, thin, grey father in the corner, peering at his newspaper with <b>nearsighted</b> eyes. Selwyn's heart gave a bound at the sight of him which not even his mother had caused. Dear old Dad! The years had been kind to him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} below the mouth of Webster Stream. When we arrived he was smoking his pipe, {{and said that he}} had passed a pretty {{comfortable}} night, though it was rather cold, on account of the dew. It appeared that when we stood together the previous evening, and I was shouting to the Indian across the river, he, being <b>nearsighted,</b> had not seen the Indian nor his canoe, and when I went back to the Indian's assistance, did not see which way I went, and supposed that we were below and not above him, and so, making haste to catch up, he ran away from us. Having reached this clearing, a mile or more below our camp, the night overtook him, and he made a fire in a little hollow, and lay down by it in his blanket, still thinking that we were ahead of him.|$|E

The applause of dancers and bystanders was instantaneous and hearty; her only contribution to it was a slight parting of her thin red lips in a half-incredulous smile. In the silence that followed the applause, as Enriquez walked pantingly away, I heard her saying, half to herself, [...] "Certainly a most extraordinary creature!" [...] In my indignation I could not help turning suddenly upon her and looking straight into her eyes. They were brown, with that peculiar velvet opacity common to the pupils of <b>nearsighted</b> persons, and seemed to defy internal scrutiny. She only repeated carelessly, [...] "Isn't he?" [...] and added: [...] "Please {{see if you can}} find Jocasta. I suppose we ought to be going now; and I dare say he won't be doing it again. Ah! there she is. Good gracious, child! what have you got there?" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{is perhaps}} the strangest book that has seen the light since Frankenstein. Indeed, it is a Frankenstein itself; a Frankenstein with the {{original}} infirmity supplemented by a new one; a Frankenstein with the reasoning faculty wanting. Yet it believes it can reason, and is always trying. It is not content to leave a mountain of fact standing in the clear sunshine, where the simplest reader can perceive its form, its details, {{and its relation to}} the rest of the landscape, but thinks it must help him examine it and understand it; so its drifting mind settles upon it with that intent, but always with one and the same result: there is a change of temperature and the mountain is hid in a fog. Every time it sets up a premise and starts to reason from it, there is a surprise in store for the reader. It is strangely <b>nearsighted,</b> cross-eyed, and purblind. Sometimes when a mastodon walks across the field of its vision it takes it for a rat; at other times it does not see it at all.|$|E
6000|$|The Indian {{showed some}} unwillingness to exert himself, {{complaining}} {{that he was}} very tired in consequence of his day's work, that it had strained him getting down so many rapids alone; but he went off calling somewhat like an owl. I remembered that my companion was <b>nearsighted,</b> and I feared that he had either fallen from the precipice, or fainted and sunk down amid the rocks beneath it. I shouted and searched above and below this precipice in the twilight till I could not see, expecting nothing less than to find his body beneath it. For half an hour I anticipated and believed only the worst. I thought what I should do the next day if I did not find him, and how his relatives would feel if I should return without him. I felt that if he were really lost away from the river there, it would be a desperate undertaking to find him; and where were they who could help you? What would it be to raise the country, where there were only two or three camps, twenty or thirty miles apart, and no road, and perhaps nobody at home? ...|$|E
60|$|The same mysterious {{dispensation}} of fate, {{which always}} awards tall wives to short men, decreed that {{a suit of}} the big miner's should be reserved for me. He stood six feet two inches--I stand five feet six inches. I put on his flannel shirt--it fell down to my toes, like a bedgown; his drawers--and they flowed in Turkish luxuriance over my feet. At his trousers I helplessly stopped short, lost in the voluminous recesses of each leg. The big miner, like a good Samaritan as he was, came to my assistance. He put the pocket button through the waist buttonhole, to keep the trousers {{up in the first}} instance; then, he pulled steadily at the braces until my waistband was under my armpits; and then he pronounced that I and my trousers fitted each other in great perfection. The cuffs of the jacket were next turned up to my elbows--the white night-cap was dragged over my ears--the round hat was jammed down over my eyes. When I add to all this, that I am so <b>nearsighted</b> as to be obliged to wear spectacles, and that I finished my toilet by putting my spectacles on (knowing that I should see little or nothing without them), nobody, I think, will be astonished to hear that my companion seized his sketch-book, and caricatured me on the spot; and that the grave miner, polite as he was, shook with internal laughter, when I took up my tallow-candles and reported myself ready for a descent into the mine.|$|E
6000|$|She rose superior, above all, on {{the happy}} {{fact that there}} were always gentlemen in town and that gentlemen were her {{greatest}} admirers; gentlemen from the City in especial--as to whom she was full of information about the passion and pride excited in such breasts by the elements of her charming commerce. The City men did in short go in for flowers. There was a certain type of awfully smart stockbroker--Lord Rye called them Jews and bounders, but she didn't care--whose extravagance, she more than once threw out, had really, if one had any conscience, to be forcibly restrained. It was not perhaps a pure love of beauty: {{it was a matter of}} vanity and a sign of business; they wished to crush their rivals, and that was one of their weapons. Mrs. Jordan's shrewdness was extreme; she knew in any case her customer--she dealt, as she said, with all sorts; and it was at the worst a race for her--a race even in the dull months--from one set of chambers to another. And then, after all, there were also still the ladies; the ladies of stockbroking circles were perpetually up and down. They were not quite perhaps Mrs. Bubb or Lady Ventnor; but you couldn't tell the difference unless you quarrelled with them, and then you knew it only by their making-up sooner. These ladies formed the branch of her subject on which she most swayed in the breeze; to that degree that her confidant had ended with an inference or two tending to banish regret for opportunities not embraced. There were indeed tea-gowns that Mrs. Jordan described--but tea-gowns were not the whole of respectability, and it was odd that a clergyman's widow should sometimes speak as if she almost thought so. She came back, it was true, unfailingly to Lord Rye, never, evidently, quite losing sight of him even on the longest excursions. That he was kindness itself had become in fact the very moral it all pointed--pointed in strange flashes of the poor woman's <b>nearsighted</b> eyes. She launched at her young friend portentous looks, solemn heralds of some extraordinary communication. The communication itself, from week to week, hung fire; but it was to the facts over which it hovered that she owed her power of going on. [...] "They are, in one way and another," [...] she often emphasised, [...] "a tower of strength"; and as the allusion was to the aristocracy the girl could quite wonder why, if they were so in [...] "one way," [...] they should require to be so in two. She thoroughly knew, however, how many ways Mrs. Jordan counted in. It all meant simply that her fate was pressing her close. If that fate was to be sealed at the matrimonial altar it was perhaps not remarkable that she shouldn't come all at once to the scratch of overwhelming a mere telegraphist. It would necessarily present to such a person a prospect of regretful sacrifice. Lord Rye--if it was Lord Rye--wouldn't be [...] "kind" [...] to a nonentity of that sort, even though people quite as good had been.|$|E
