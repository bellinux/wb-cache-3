Affordable treatment cost {{is a factor}} enfluencing health care coverage and it is usually measured in ability to pay (ATP). Ability to pay is amount of rupiahs that patients should pay for a treatment in primary health care. ATP is calculated equal to 5 % from <b>non</b> <b>foods</b> expenditure. In accordance with 2004 National Social Ekonomic Survey, <b>non</b> <b>foods</b> expenditure included expenditure for house, households, variety goods and usefulness, education cost, health cost, cloths, shoes and cover alurable goods head, tax and insurance,party and ritual ceremony. The prime objective {{of this study was}} to analyze drug cost, treatment cost and ability to pay in primary health care, so as to find the coverage of health care from cost aspect. This analysis was based on treatment cost data obtained from 2004 Household Survey and 2004 National Social Economic Survey. This were 2004 Household Survey and 2004 National Social Economic Survey studies on Indonesian residents in thirty provinces. The samples were 16, 021 household's members. lnclussion criterion were residents who were out patients one year ago or in patients five years ago in primary health care. Results show that: 1) 83. 3 % patients in primary health care pay for treatment cost on their own, 9 % patients used free card ("kartu miskin") and 4. 5 % patients used insurance (Askes). 2) Mean drug cost is 2, 348 rupiahs and maximum drug cost is 200, 000 rupiahs. And mean treatment cost for out patients (without transport fee) is 4, 325 rupiahs. 3) Mean treatment cost for in patients in primary health centre cost is 193, 308 rupiahs. 4) The Cost interval to get treatment for out patients varied widely for prescribers fee, drug cost, transport fee. From 0 rupiah (free) up to 400, 000 rupiahs for prescribers, 0 rupiah (free) up to 200, 000 rupiahs for drug cost, and 0 rupiah (free) up to 150, 000 rupiahs for transport a) if retribusion fee in primary health care (without transpor fee) is 4, 000 rupiahs, percentage of patients who could pay are about 91, 4 %.   Key words: ability to pay, treatment cost analysis, primary health care</p...|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{are getting}} more {{demanding}} and more price-conscious nowadays and this force the retailers {{to have a more}} responsive supply chain {{at the same time as}} keeping the costs as low as possible. Therefore, the logistics performance is getting increasingly important for a retail company that wants to be successful by responding to the consumers’ demands. Measuring the logistics performance internally within the company is commonly used but it could also be beneficial to do an external comparison such as a benchmarking. By performing a benchmarking it is possible to borrow ideas from other companies and adapt them to gain competitive advantage. One retail company that works with the improvement of their logistics performance is ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food.</b> ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> has continuously improved their logistics performance during the last years and strives to increase their performance and competitiveness even further. To succeed with this, ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> is thrived to discover potential areas of improvement by increasing their understanding of how good their logistics performance is compared to other retail companies. Therefore, the aim of the study is to increase ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food’s</b> understanding of their current logistics performance and by this making them aware of potential areas of improvement. This was done in two steps. The first step was to understand how ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> currently is measuring and following up their logistics performance compared to the literature in order to investigate if the company is covering the critical and most relevant KPIs and aspects when managing their logistics performance. The other step was to perform a benchmarking involving six leading retail companies, including ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food,</b> to understand how the logistics performance currently look like at ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> compared to the other benchmarked companies. Findings indicated that ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> does all in all manage their logistics performance in a good way and as the literature recommends. However, the company has some potential areas of improvement such as increasing the employees’ involvement in their logistics performance by making the logistics KPIs more accessible for them. The most important findings from the benchmarking process was that ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> is managing their inventories good since they has a competitive inventory turnover value compared to the other benchmarked companies. On the other hand, the company’s total logistics costs as a percentage of sales is higher than the majority of the benchmarked companies and this KPI is therefore not as competitive as the inventory turnover. From the findings it can be concluded that ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food’s</b> higher value on total logistics costs as percentage of sales compared to the majority of the other benchmarked companies, is not due to their inventory management since they performed well with their KPI inventory turnover. Instead the value could be high due to other factors such as high outbound transportation costs that they should try to reduce...|$|R

In the investigation of causality process, PC algorithm based on partial correlations and GES (Greedy Equivalent Search) based on Bayesian network model were used. The results revealed {{that there is no}} specific causality relation between chicken and beef consumption and their price indices. Thus it seems other variables and government interventions are effective factors in these markets. Therefore, this model is an instrument for forecasting changes of these variables. In these markets there are causality relations among price indices, quantities of consumption and other variables. Beef price index as endogenous variable, is under the effect of chicken price index, <b>non</b> meat <b>food</b> price index, <b>non</b> <b>food</b> price index, per capita expenditure and quantity of chicken consumption.

40|$|Abstract—Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} diesel fuel that can be produced from renewable feedstock such as vegetable oils, waste frying oils and animal fats. It is an oxygenated, nontoxic, sulphur-free, biodegradable and renewable fuel. The scarcity and increase in the crude oil prices have forced everyone to think {{on the use of}} biodiesel as {{an alternative}} fuel source. Also, it is important that unlike the traditional fuels which emit green house gases and particulate matter, the biodiesel is greener and hence less polluting. But the use of food grain based biodiesel may lead to increase in food prices. Therefore {{there is a need for}} finding availability and feasibility of non-food based biodiesel. In this work, evaluation of combination of <b>food</b> grain and <b>non</b> <b>food</b> grain biodiesel has been made by using these two different sources of biodiesel in various blends such as B 40 and B 60. These blends are tested for variety of physical and chemical characteristics of fuel.
