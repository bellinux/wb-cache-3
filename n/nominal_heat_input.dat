Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding of 304 L stainless steel with high ferrite containing 312 filler was carried out at a <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> of 0. 4 kJ/mm. Nitrogen was introduced in the argon shielding gas and was varied leading to variation from 0. 04 to 0. 13 wt% N in the welds.

40|$|High strength, cold rolled, {{corrosion}} resistant ZINCALUME™ (ZA) and ZINC-HIT EN™ (ZHT) G 550 sheet steels {{are widely used}} in the construction and automotive industries. The sheet steel is commonly joined by {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) because of its low cost and high productivity. However, two significant problems can occur: porosity in the weld bead and loss of strength in the heat affected zone (HAZ). As a result of the strength loss, the design strength is currently down-graded to the fully annealed yield strength (250 or 300 MPa). The full strength potential of the steels cannot be utilised unless the strength loss in the HAZ can be quantified. In this investigation the microstructures and mechanical properties of the weld and HAZ of gas metal arc welding and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) welded ZA and ZHT G 550 1. 0 mm sheet steels have been studied and the strength loss in the HAZ has been quantified. A major aim was to correlate the mechanical properties with HAZ microstructure and to correlate microstructure with the weld thermal cycle. The effect of welding process variables on the HAZ microstructure, the structure and composition of the weld metal and on the Zn alloy coating have been investigated. HAZ thermal simulations were used to elucidate the structure evolution in the actual weld HAZ. As expected, the reduction in HAZ mechanical properties is dependent on the heat input. After GMAW at the highest heat input of 130 J/mm the tensile strength of Zn-Al coated steel decreased to 460 MPa (with a yield strength of 400 Mpa) from a pre-weld minimum specified longitudinal tensile strength of 550 MPa. However, a lower decrease in tensile strength to about 520 MPa (with a yield strength of 505 MPa) occurred at the lowest heat input of 50 J/mm. All tensile pieces were fractured in the grain refined region closed to the grain coarsened region of the HAZ. Although the microstructure of the HAZ was successfully simulated, the simulated HAZ had a much lower tensile strength than the real welds at similar heat inputs due to the absence of the 2 ̆ 7 brazing effect 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 two phase aggregate effect 2 ̆ 7 present in the real welds. It was found that at the same <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> the strength of the welded joint is significantly affected by individual welding parameters, particularly, torch angle, shielding gas and welding consumable. At the same <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> FCAW generated welds with a lower tensile strength than GMAW. GMAW using perpendicular and forehand welding techniques tended to produce welds with a higher tensile strength than the backhand technique. A higher strength loss was also evident for GMAW with pure C 02 or a shielding gas containing helium. No obvious macro-defects or Zn penetration cracks were found in the weld bead or HAZ. However, gas pores and aluminum rich particles were observed in the weld metal. These features did not adversely affect the overall weldment tensile properties. A more globular weld bead with a higher surface tension, corresponding to a lower oxygen content in the weld metal, was found for GMA welds shielded by Argoshield 60 (98. 5...|$|E

The ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) system is designed for a <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> of 20 kW and a nominal net power output of 1. 8 kW. A total of 74 steady-state operating points are measured to evaluate the expander performance {{over a wide range}} of conditions. The operating parameters that are varied include the inlet pressure (from 9 to 12 bar), outlet pressure (from 1. 5 to 4 bar) and rotational speed (from 2000 to 3500 rpm). The maximum isentropic efficiency and shaft power are, respectively, 75. 7 % and 2. 1 kW. A maximum cycle efficiency of 8. 5 % is reached for evaporating and condensing temperatures of 97. 5 °C and 26. 6 °C respectively. For most of the tests, hot water is produced in the condenser and the system therefore behaves as a CHP (combined heat and power). Depending on the water temperature requirement, a power to heat ratio varying between 1. 9 % and 11. 8 % is obtained. Water over 50 °C can be produced with a power to heat ratio higher than 8 %.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} pollutants emitted from steady-state, steady-flow gasification and combustion of polyethylene (PE) in a two-stage furnace. The polymer, in pulverized form, was first pyrolyzed at 1000 degrees C, and subsequently, its gaseous pyrolyzates were burned, upon mixing with air at high temperatures (900 - 1100 degrees C). The motivation for this indirect type of burning PE was to attain nominally premixed combustion of the pyrolyzate gases with air, thereby achieving lower pollutant emissions than those emanating from the direct burning of the solid PE polymer. This work assessed the effluents of the two-stage furnace and {{examined the effects of}} the combustion temperature, as well as the polymer feed rate and the associated fuel/air equivalence ratio (0. 3 < phi < 1. 4). It was found that, whereas the yield of pyrolysis gas decreased with an increasing polymer feed rate, its composition was nearly independent of the feed rate. CO 2 emissions peaked at an equivalence ratio near unity, while the CO emissions increased with an increasing equivalence ratio. The total light volatile hydrocarbon and semivolatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions of combustion increased with an increasing equivalence ratio. The generated particulates were mostly submicrometer in size. Overall, PAH and soot emissions from this indirect burning of PE were an order of magnitude lower than corresponding emissions from the direct burning of the solid polymer, obtained previously in this laboratory using identical sampling and analytical techniques. Because pyrolysis of this polymer requires a <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> that amounts to only a diminutive fraction of the heat released during its combustion, implementation of this technique is deemed advantageous...|$|E

The thermal cycles used for simulation had peak temperatures of 1275 °C, 930 °C, 7650 C and 6500 C and corresponded to those experienced in the parent material during the submerged arc welding of 1. 5 in. thick plate using a <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> of 54 kJ. in and a preheat temperature of 120 °C. Double cycling utilized specific combinations of these thermal cycles. Half {{the total number of}} simulated specimens received post cycle heat treatment at 650 °C. Charpy V-notch impact transition curves and tensile and hardness data have been obtained for each condition studied and structural examination has employed the carbon extraction replica technique in the electron microscope. The results indicate that the properties of the weld heat affected zone in HY- 80 steel are superior to those obtained for QT- 35 steel but inferior to those of the HY- 80 parent material. The tempering bead technique has been shown to have, at best, only a limited tempering effect on the grain coarsened region of an edge bead heat affected zone and can also cause an increase in the susceptibility of this region to brittle fracture. Post weld heat treatment at 6500 C is recommended, wherever possible, for HY- 80 weldments. The calculation of weld heat affected zone thermal cycles, which correlate well with the practical situation, has been made possible by the development of a series of computer programs.

Processes like laser beam welding and electron beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in <b>heat</b> <b>input.</b> To calculate the <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> for arc welding procedures, the following formula is used: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> on tensile and fatigue properties of submerged arc welded American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) A 709 Grade 50 steel, which was supplied as plates with dimensions of 500 mm × 250 mm × 20 mm by Hitachi Canadian Industries (HCI) Ltd., Saskatoon. Identical <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> (2. 75 kJ/mm) was used to weld one side of the plates, while various <b>heat</b> <b>inputs</b> (single wire: 3. 03 kJ/mm and 3. 43 kJ/mm; tandem wires: 4. 11 kJ/mm and 4. 56 kJ/mm) were used for the second side. The weld properties were evaluated using visual inspection, ultrasonic inspection, hardness measurements, tensile and fatigue testing, weld bead geometry measurement, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results obtained showed that <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> affected the microstructure, hardness and weld bead geometry of ASTM A 709 Grade 50 steel welds appreciably, but had little effect on the tensile and yield strengths. Increase in <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> slightly reduced the amount of acicular ferrite within the weld metal zone, and resulted in coarser microstructures in the coarse-grained heat-affected zone. The hardness of the coarse-grained heat-affected zone and the weld metal zone increased with increasing <b>heat</b> <b>input.</b> The penetration depth, heat affected zone size, bead width, bead reinforcement, penetration area, and nugget area of the weld increased with increasing <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> for both single wire and tandem wire welding, but the contact angle decreased. Electrode melting efficiency increased with increasing <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> for single wire welding, but the plate melting efficiency only changed within 4 % between single wire and tandem wire welding. Percent dilution remained practically unchanged with increasing <b>heat</b> <b>input.</b> In general, the fatigue strength of the welds was slightly higher than that of the parent metal at room temperature. The fatigue strength of ASTM A 709 Grade 50 steel and its welds increased slightly at - 20 °C and - 30 °C compared to room temperature. At room temperature, the welds showed slightly higher fatigue strength than the parent metal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the effect of}} nanoparticle mass concentration and <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> based on the total thermal resistance (Rth) of loop heat pipe (LHP), employed for PC-CPU cooling. In this study, silica nanoparticles (SiO 2) in water with particle mass concentration ranged from 0 % (pure water) to 3 % is considered as the working fluid within the LHP. The experimental design and optimization is accomplished by the design of experimental tool, Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The {{results show that the}} nanoparticle mass concentration and the <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> have significant effect on the Rth of LHP. For a given <b>heat</b> <b>input,</b> the Rth is found to decrease with the increase of the nanoparticle mass concentration up to 0. 5 % and increased thereafter. It is also found that the Rth is decreased when the <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> is increased from 20 W to 60 W. The results are optimized with the objective of minimizing the Rth, using Design-Expert software, and the optimized nanoparticle mass concentration and <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> are 0. 48 % and 59. 97 W, respectively, the minimum Rth being 2. 66 (ºC/W). The existence of an optimum nanoparticle mass concentration and <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> are the predominant factors for the improvement in the thermal performance of nanofluid-charged LHP...|$|R

40|$|A {{multi-turn}} Closed Loop Pulsating Heat Pipe (CLPHP) made {{of copper}} (I. D. 1. 1 mm, O. D. 2 mm), filled with FC- 72 is experimentally investigated. The study focuses in particular on the combined {{effect of the}} inclination angle (gravity) and the filling ratio at different <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> levels on the device operation stability and the thermal performances. Results show that this CLPHP is very much sensitive to the gravity head and that the vertical operation is affected by unstable operation at high <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> levels. On the other hand the CLPHP in the horizontal position is less efficient, {{but it does not}} undergo any performance drop with respect to the <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> level until the maximum <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> level is reached. The repeatability analysis, performed for the horizontal and vertical operation only, reveals that the higher discrepancies occur when the PHP operates in vertical position at the start-up <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> levels while the instability occurring at high heat loads is repeatable and does not depend on the previous <b>heat</b> power <b>input</b> level. This behavior is confirmed at different filling ratios, and the optimal one is 0. 5...|$|R

50|$|The {{level of}} <b>heat</b> <b>input</b> also affects weld quality. Low <b>heat</b> <b>input,</b> caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} <b>heat</b> <b>input,</b> however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|R
