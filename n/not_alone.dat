The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.|$|E
5|$|Humans are <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; {{plants and animals}} are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species.

Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E

5|$|In the 12th century, French trouvère (troubadour) Chrétien de Troyes, adapted many of {{the myths}} recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses into Old French.

Geoffrey Chaucer recounted the story in his {{unfinished}} work The Legend of Good Women and briefly alluded to the myth in his Troilus and Criseyde. John Gower included the tale in his Confessio Amantis. References to Philomela are common in the motets of the ars nova, ars subtilior, and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|Gravel {{actively}} {{campaigned for}} the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in this effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.|$|E
5|$|Louis XIV was {{angered by}} Anna Maria Luisa's {{marriage}} to his sworn foe. Cosimo, after much coaxing, persuaded him otherwise. On 9 October 1691, France, England, Spain, and the United Provinces guaranteed the neutrality of the Tuscan port of Livorno. The Empire, meanwhile, {{was attempting to}} extract feudal dues from Cosimo, and ordering him to ally with Austria. The Grand Duke replied {{that if he did}} so France would send a naval fleet from Toulon to occupy his state; the Emperor reluctantly accepted this excuse. Tuscany was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in its feudal ties to the Empire: The rest of Italy was also bound to pay the Emperor, but at a much higher magnitude than Cosimo, who merely paid on his few undisputed Imperial fiefs.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Robinson M. Yost {{explains that}} Darwinism went into eclipse during the 1890s. At that time, most zoologists felt that natural selection {{could not be}} {{the main cause of}} biological adaptation, and sought alternative explanations. As a result, many zoologists rejected both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry. Beddard, writes Yost, explained some problems in the theory of mimicry including that, given how many insect species there are, resemblances between species could arise by chance, and that mimicry was sometimes either useless or actually harmful. In Yost's view, Beddard wanted more evidence that natural selection really was responsible. Yost cites the staunch Darwinist Poulton's hostile review of 1892, which asserts the pre-eminence of Darwin's theory. But, writes Yost, Beddard was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in being wary of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability {{lies at the}} core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, {{is more important than the}} sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E

5|$|Jones was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in {{his wish}} {{to get more}} screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character {{to be written into}} more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom brings Christine {{back down}} to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives, and he goes to rescue Christine. The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to {{convince}} the Phantom {{that she does not}} fear his ugliness, but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in the world. The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love {{for the first time in}} his life. Ashamed of his murderous actions, he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the Phantom smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E
