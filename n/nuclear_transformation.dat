5000|$|In May 2013 a non-peer-reviewed paper {{describing}} [...] "results {{obtained from}} {{evaluations of the}} operation of the E-Cat HT in two test runs" [...] was submitted to the arXiv digital archive. Although the authors of the paper wrote that they were not in control of all of the aspects of the process, they concluded that, even by the most conservative of measurements, the device produced excess heat with a resulting energy density that was at least one order of magnitude, and possibly several, higher than any other conventional energy source. The test was partly funded by the Swedish energy research consortium, Elforsk. Elforsk stated on their website that the results were very remarkable, but that it was highly questionable to speculate whether <b>nuclear</b> <b>transformation</b> had occurred when no access had been provided to the reactants. In a response to the original manuscript archived on arXiv, commentators criticized the testing as not truly independent, described the report as having [...] "characteristics more typically found in pseudo‐scientific texts", and stated that [...] "The authors seem to jump to conclusions fitting pre‐conceived ideas where alternative explanations are possible." [...] Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel commented at ScienceBlogs saying Rossi did not allow the reactants or products to be measured on this occasion. In the previous tests there were not enough [...] and [...] (the only two nickel isotopes which can fuse with hydrogen), at 3.6% and 0.9% respectively, in the reactants to explain the 10% copper output; these isotope levels are typical of natural copper, rather than of fusion by-product. According to Siegel, Rossi also refused to unplug the machine while it was operating despite it being an easy way to surreptitiously power the device. He also added that the supposedly independent testers had to rely on data supplied by Rossi.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a novel {{principle}} is proposed {{to increase the}} CO 2 concentration {{in the vicinity of}} Rubisco thereby suppressing photorespiration in C 3 plants. The pathway is derived from E. coli and converts the glycolate formed during photorespiration into glycerate. Three enzymatic activities are required: Glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), Glyoxylate carboligase (GCL), and Tratronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). In order to establish the pathway in the chloroplast of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), all necessary genes were cloned in both prokaryotic and plant expression vectors in N-terminal translational fusion to a His-tag. The genes were first expressed in bacteria and the enzymatic activity of the constructs was shown. Transgenic tobacco plants were created containing all genes necessary for the proposed pathway by plastdial as well as <b>nuclear</b> <b>transformation.</b> Plastidial transformation was done by constructing a single polycistronic operon with five open reading frames. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>transformation</b> was performed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of single or double constructs. Plastid transformants were checked by southern blot analysis. Many transgenic plants with a variable size of shortened transgenic sequences were detected. Moreover, many of the transgenic plants also displayed drastic chlorosis and stunted growth. However, few plants showed integration of the complete operon and the next generation of those plants is currently analysed. Initially, transgenic plants containing TSR and GCL were created by <b>nuclear</b> <b>transformation</b> {{due to the lack of}} a suitable glycolate oxidising enzyme. Variable amounts of foreign proteins were detected in Western blots. Enzymatic assays showed that the proteins are active in planta. However transgenic plants containing GCL protein again showed a chlorotic phenotype. A putative open reading frame was identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence with homology to glycolate-oxidizing enzymes. The open reading frame was cloned and expressed in bacteria. Enzymatic assays and complementation tests showed that the protein is indeed a glycolate dehydrogenase. The gene is preferentially expressed in illuminated leaves and the enzyme is located inside the mitochondria.

30|$|The Fukushima nuclear {{disaster}} {{is a special}} case: a major twin natural disaster (earthquake and tsunami) incited a large-scale technological disaster, {{which resulted in a}} serious nuclear accident. Because the various costs are so tremendous, this triple disaster has had a pervasive impact on all aspects of life in Japan. This article describes <b>nuclear</b> energy policy <b>transformation</b> {{in the aftermath of the}} Fukushim a disaster. The study draws on theoretical propositions of governance and disaster risk governance, and demonstrates that a vested interest perspective is important to understanding the results of Japan’s energy policy before Fukushima. Safety, democracy, and openness were the fundamental principles of Japan’s nuclear energy policy when the country decided to diversify its energy sources in the 1950 s. But these basic premises were undermined by the vested interests that controlled policy administration and implementation as the nuclear energy industry developed. Analysis of Japan’s recent <b>nuclear</b> energy policy <b>transformation</b> covers such dimensions as policy targets, policy issues such as safety, the fuel cycle, waste disposal, administrative structure, public awareness, and national and local policy considerations. The study identifies process deficiencies in Japan’s post-Fukushima <b>nuclear</b> energy policy <b>transformation</b> and evaluates possible ways to eliminate defects through administrative reorganization and independent safety oversight.|$|R
