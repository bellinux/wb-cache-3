5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue.

According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them.

5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry has {{a variety}} of causes. Radial {{symmetry}} suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs (cephalisation), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be).</b> More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.|$|E
