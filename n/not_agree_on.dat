5|$|On June 28, 2012, {{a divided}} Supreme Court {{held that the}} Stolen Valor Act's {{prohibition}} against making false statements of having been awarded a military medal violated the First Amendment. However, the six justices in the majority could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a single rationale for the decision.|$|E
5|$|Since Minnesota had divided governments {{for decades}} before 2010, {{a number of}} past budgets had brought the state close to a {{shutdown}}, {{and there had been}} one shutdown before in state history. After Governor Pawlenty and the Republican-majority House could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a budget with the DFL-majority Senate in 2005, the state government went through a nine-day shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish Grand Prix {{was removed}} from the {{calendar}} after Formula One Management and the event organisers could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a renewed contract. In August 2011, organisers of the race revealed that they were negotiating with Bernie Ecclestone to resume their place on the calendar. However, the race {{was removed from}} the calendar later that month.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} multiple possible {{reasons for the}} decline, but have <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> their relative importance. Wellings lays out the [...] "classical model" [...] of secularization, while noting {{that it has been}} challenged by some scholars.|$|R
5|$|A new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, {{arrived in}} July to replace Liniers, and the independentist group did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> how to react. Castelli {{proposed}} a resumption of Álzaga's idea {{of creating a}} governing Junta, but not headed by the Spanish. Belgrano insisted on the plan to appoint Charlotte as regent of a constitutional monarchy, and Rodriguez Peña proposed a military coup, with or without Liniers at the head. They finally accepted the perspective of Cornelio Saavedra, and delayed taking action until a better opportunity.|$|E
5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black Stone in the current place in {{the wall of the}} Kaaba. A story found in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah Rasul Allah tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E
5000|$|According to the American Heart Association in 1994, only total {{cholesterol}} levels below 160 mg/dL or 4.1 mmol/l {{are to be}} classified as [...] "hypocholesterolemia". However, this is <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> universally and some put the level lower.|$|R
50|$|July 24, 2006 - The Profliga {{announced}} that the Supercup match between Anderlecht and Zulte-Waregem will be replayed on 1 September. However, both teams confirmed that the match will be replayed, but that they have <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> the date yet.|$|R
5000|$|In the Prologue to his play, Nabbes {{writes of}} [...] "borrowing {{from a former}} play" [...] (line 190), but {{scholars}} have <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> any specific play to which he refers. Nabbes apparently intended to deny any debt to any previously produced drama.|$|R
5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed, with financial compensation {{to be paid to}} German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E
5|$|In the 1992–93 tournament, Derby County {{lost the}} final 3–1 to Cremonese. Brescia won the final in 1994 against Notts County, but Notts County reached the final again in 1995 and {{defeated}} Ascoli 2–1. The last instalment {{of the competition}} was held in 1995–96, and Genoa triumphed 5–2 over Port Vale in the final on 17 March 1996. The competition was abandoned in 1996 because the two leagues could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> dates for fixtures, and due to increasing violence at matches.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{grew up as}} a prince. According to {{the second}} chapter of the Śvētāmbara text Acharanga Sutra, both of his parents were {{followers}} and lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Jain traditions do <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> whether Mahavira ever married. According to the Digambara tradition, Mahavira's parents wanted him to marry Yashoda but Mahavira refused to marry. According to the Śvētāmbara tradition, {{he was married to}} Yashoda at a young age and had one daughter, Priyadarshana, also called Anojja.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> whether {{the site of}} Baalath-Beer can be identified. The {{existing}} evidence is ambiguous {{as to whether or}} not Baalath-beer is the same town as Ramath-negeb, and Baalath-beer may be the same as the location referred to elsewhere as Baal ...|$|R
50|$|Players {{with more}} than six years of service time and who are {{eligible}} for free agency can also be offered arbitration when their contracts are up, if they have been tendered a contract offer by their current team by the tender deadline, and have <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> a contract.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{proposals}} {{have been made}} by advocates of tort reform, although these proposals are <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> by all 'tort reformers' and are considered by many opponents a roll-back of the reforms of the twentieth century. [...] The collateral source rule, for example, dates back to 1854.|$|R
5|$|Tulsidas {{left his}} {{body at the}} Assi Ghat {{on the bank of}} the river Ganga in the Shraavan (July–August) month of the year Vikram 1680 (1623 CE). Like the year of his birth, {{traditional}} accounts and biographers do <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> the exact date of his death. Different sources give the date as the third day of the bright half, seventh day of the bright half, or the third day of the dark half.|$|E
5|$|A ten-man tag team {{match was}} {{supposed}} to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> who would be the team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a rationale for the holding.|$|E
5|$|Both {{houses of}} the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run-off system. Under the Constitution, should both houses <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a common candidate, then a joint {{committee}} is allowed to be established {{to agree on the}} matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess. However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet. Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Como died in {{his sleep}} on May 12, 2001, {{at his home in}} Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida, six days before his 89th birthday. He was {{reported}} to have suffered from symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Como's older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> their interpretations of Como's 1999 living will and it became a matter for the courts in the year before his death. His funeral Mass took place at St. Edward's Catholic Church in Palm Beach, Florida. Como and his wife, Roselle are buried at Riverside Memorial Park, Tequesta (Palm Beach County), Florida.|$|E

50|$|His magnum opus was the two-part Bharatbarshiya Upasak Sampraday (Vol.1, 1871, Vol.2, 1883). The {{brilliant}} introductions to the {{two volumes}} of this book evince his profound philosophical, linguistic and scientific learning and depth. Among others, Max Muller, Monier-Williams and Rajendralal Mitra were greatly impressed by his profound scholarship, though <b>not</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>on</b> all points.|$|R
5000|$|Officially, NUTS regions (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview) only {{exist for}} EU Member States. For EFTA, EU {{candidate}} and potential candidate countries, the European Commission {{agrees with the}} countries concerned on a nomenclature referred to as [...] "Statistical regions". The EU and Serbia have <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> such a nomenclature, because of issues arising from the status of Kosovo.|$|R
5|$|Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made {{personnel}} {{changes during}} the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, but could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> the terms with any team. They put Pipp on waivers, {{and he was}} acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 waiver price. The Reds, who {{had not had a}} strong starting first baseman since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead. Pipp again attempted to acquire a portion of the purchase price, but was rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, {{attempted}} an amalgamation. This was {{the third}} such attempt; the previous two had failed when the members could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> synagogue ritual. The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members; members would be refunded half the purchase price of the pews in their existing buildings. Mosche and the rabbi of Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi. Though this attempt also failed, {{in the following year}} the three congregations carried out combined activities, including a picnic and a celebration of the 100th birthday of Moses Montefiore. Membership at that time still hovered around 50.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} Council of Nicaea, new {{formulae}} of faith were composed, {{most of them}} variations of the Nicene Symbol, to counter new phases of Arianism. The Catholic Encyclopedia identifies at least four before the Council of Sardica (341), where a new form was presented and inserted in the Acts of the Council, though it was <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, an {{important}} contribution of presenting a vision, {{such as that of}} a safe and secure Finnish transport system in 2100, is that even if the envisioned future state is <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on,</b> it helps the decision-makers to focus on the long-term issues and to realize the importance and potential of participatory future oriented strategic planning.|$|R
