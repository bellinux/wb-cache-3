A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements.

25|$|Cylinders {{should be}} stored in an area {{segregated}} from oxidizers to avoid exacerbated reaction in case of fire/leakage. Acetylene cylinders should not {{be stored in}} confined spaces / enclosed vehicles / garages / buildings to avoid unintended leakage leading to explosive atmosphere. In the USA, <b>National</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Code</b> (NEC) requires consideration for hazardous areas including those where acetylene may be released during accidents or leaks. Consideration may include electrical classification and use of listed Group A electrical components in USA. Further information on determining the areas requiring special consideration is in NFPA 497.

40|$|Storm-related {{power outages}} cause {{approximately}} $ 270 {{million per year}} in repair costs in the United States. As a result of increasing sea surface temperatures caused by the changing climate, hurricane patterns (i. e., intensity/frequency) may change; however, there is much uncertainty as to how climate change may affect hurricane patterns. Implications of the changing hazard patterns on hurricane risk warrants an investigation to evaluate {{the potential impact of}} climate change on power distribution pole failure. This paper proposes a probabilistic framework to evaluate the vulnerability of power distribution poles to hurricanes under the potential impact of a changing climate. Two methods for the design of distribution poles in the United States, the <b>National</b> <b>Electric</b> Safety <b>Code</b> method and the ASCE method, are considered to investigate the difference of the vulnerability of a distribution pole subjected to hurricane hazard. The framework includes a reliability analysis of the designed power distribution poles using fragility analysis, the effects of degradation of timber poles, probabilistic wind models, and an assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on the annual failure probability of power distribution poles. This paper finds that climate change may {{have a significant effect on}} the structural failure probabilities of distribution poles. The age of the poles has a significant impact on the reliability of power distribution poles, which warrants the exploration of cost-effective methods to determine when a distribution pole should be replaced to ensure adequate strength to withstand wind loads...|$|R

50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Code</b> {{states that}} a safety/service {{disconnect}} must be installed {{within sight of}} serviceable equipment.

50|$|The allowed {{current in}} a {{conductor}} generally {{needs to be}} decreased (derated) when conductors are in a grouping or cable, enclosed in conduit, or an enclosure restricting heat dissipation. e.g. The United States <b>National</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Code,</b> Table 310.15(B)(16), specifies that up to three 8 AWG copper wires having a common insulating material (THWN) in a raceway, cable, or direct burial has an ampacity of 50 A when the ambient air is 30°C, the conductor surface temperature allowed to be 75°C. A single insulated conductor in free air has 70 A rating.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{ceiling fan}} weighs between 15 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many {{junction}} boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan in operation exerts many additional stresses—notably torsion—on the object {{from which it}} is hung; this can cause an improper junction box to fail. For this reason, in the United States the <b>National</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Code</b> (document NFPA 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an electrical junction box listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper junction box.|$|E
