40|$|The Diels-Alder {{reaction}} between diethyl 1 -phosphono- 1, 3 -butadiene and cyclic azo dienophiles, such as 4 -phenyl- and 4 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3, 5 - diones and phthalazine- 1, 4 -dione gave {{access to}} phosphonated bicyclic cycloadducts bearing a <b>N-N</b> <b>junction.</b> Various functionalizations (dihydroxylation, hydrogenation and phosphonic ester deprotection) {{have been performed}} with success. The selective N-N cleavage was not possible for the preparation of large heterocycles. The coordination properties of selected bicycles were tested by ESI-HRMS. © 2013 The Japan Institute of Heterocyclic Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Six new atropisomeric heteroarenes were {{synthesized}} {{by connecting}} two 2 -alkylbenzimidazole fragments via <b>N-N</b> <b>junction.</b> They differ by the substituent nature (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl) of the aliphatic function. The novel atropisomeric compounds {{were used as}} chiral probes to study the chromatographic behavior of the amylose tris(3, 5 -dimethylphenyl carbamate) (Chiralpak AD- 3) chiral stationary phase (CSP) under normal phase mode. The pivotal role of the length and flexibility of the 2, 2 '-alkyl groups on retention, enantioselectivity and enantiomer elution order was demonstrated by enantioselective HPLC analysis. Additional information on the chiral recognition mechanism {{was obtained from the}} evaluation of the correlated thermodynamic data...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} characteristics {{across the}} pulsed laser deposited Ni 0. 07 Zn 0. 93 O/Mg 0. 21 Zn 0. 79 O heterojunction exhibits p-n type semiconducting properties at 10 K while at 100 K, its characteristics become {{similar to that}} of an <b>n-n</b> <b>junction.</b> The reason for the same is attributed to the role of larger electronegativity of Ni as compared to Mg at 10 K and ionization of impurity states at 100 K. The above behavior is confirmed by performing the Hall measurements. Comment: Charge transport across NiZnO/MgZnO heterojunction at 10 K and 100 K is studied. Junction exhibits p-n type at 10 K and n-n behavior at 100 K. The behavior is confirmed by performing the Hall measurement...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the electronic transport properties of unbiased and biased bilayer graphene nanoribbon in n-p and <b>n-n</b> <b>junctions</b> {{subject to a}} perpendicular magnetic field. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function method and the Landauer-Büttiker formalism, the conductance is studied for the cases of clean, on-site, and edge disordered bilayer graphene. We show that the lowest Hall plateau remains unchanged {{in the presence of}} disorder, whereas asymmetry destroys both the plateaus and conductance quantization. In addition, we show that disorder induces an enhancement of the conductance in the n-p region in the presence of magnetic fields. Finally, we show that the equilibration of quantum Hall edge states between distinctively doped regions causes Hall plateaus to appear in the regime of complete mode mixing.

40|$|Advanced {{processing}} {{techniques for}} non-CZ silicon sheet material that might improve the cost effectiveness of photovoltaic module production were investigated. Specifically, the simultaneous diffusion of liquid boron and liquid phosphorus organometallic precursors into n-type dendritic silicon web was examined. The simultaneous junction formation method for solar cells was {{compared with the}} sequential junction formation method. The electrical resistivity of the <b>n-n</b> and p-n <b>junctions</b> was discussed. Further research activities for this program along with a program documentation schedule are given...|$|R
40|$|Quantum spin Hall insulator/metal {{interfaces}} {{are formed}} in graphene ribbons with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling by selectively doping two regions creating a potential step. For a clean graphene ribbon, {{the transmission of}} the topological edge states through a <b>n-n</b> or p-p <b>junction</b> is perfect irrespective of the ribbon termination, width, and potential step parameters due to the orthogonality of incoming and outgoing edge channels. This is shown numerically for an arbitrary crystallographic orientation of the ribbon and proven analytically for zigzag and metallic armchair boundary conditions. In disordered ribbons, the orthogonality between left- and right-movers is in general destroyed and backscattering sets in. However, transmission approaches one by increasing the ribbon's width, even {{in the presence of}} strong edge roughness. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures. Order of authors exchanged.

40|$|Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers are {{considered}} to be potential materials for atomically thin electronics due to their unique electronic and optical properties. However, large-area and uniform growth of TMDC monolayers with large grain sizes is still a considerable challenge. This report presents a simple but effective approach for large-scale and highly crystalline molybdenum disulfide monolayers using a solution-processed precursor deposition. The low supersaturation level, triggered by the evaporation of an extremely thin precursor layer, reduces the nucleation density dramatically under a thermodynamically stable environment, yielding uniform and clean monolayer films and large crystal sizes up to 500 µm. As a result, the photoluminescence exhibits only a small full-width-half-maximum of 48 meV, comparable to that of exfoliated and suspended monolayer crystals. It is confirmed that this growth procedure can be extended to the synthesis of other TMDC monolayers, and robust MoS 2 /WS 2 heterojunction devices are easily prepared using this synthetic procedure due to the large-sized crystals. The heterojunction device shows a fast response time (≈ 45 ms) and a significantly high photoresponsivity (≈ 40 AW− 1) because of the built-in potential and the majority-carrier transport at the <b>n–n</b> <b>junction.</b> These findings indicate an efficient pathway for the fabrication of high-performance 2 D optoelectronic devices...|$|E
