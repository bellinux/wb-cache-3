5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} two hours Mulholland, Van Norman and Harnischfeger {{inspected}} the dam and various leaks and seepages, finding <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> or of concern for a large dam. With both Mulholland and Van Norman convinced that the new leak was not dangerous and that the dam was safe, they returned to Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, Erickson had been under the {{influence}} of cocaine, Adderall, and alcohol. The following day, he had had no memory of what had transpired that Halloween night. At a later hearing, attorneys asked Erickson if he had noticed anything unusual the morning following the crime such as injuries or blood on his clothing. Erickson confirmed that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b>|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1934, {{organizations}} and individuals saw small-mintage commemoratives, struck at multiple mints {{over the course}} of years, as an opportunity for profit. [...] Congress authorized several issues in 1934, including the Texas Centennial half dollar, meant to honor the centennial of Texas Independence in 1936, but struck from 1934 to 1938, after 1934 at all three mints each year. [...] More new commemoratives followed in 1935, and over 20 in 1936. [...] These issues included the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, issued to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, although <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> is known to have taken place in that city's musical life in 1886.|$|E
500|$|Engels {{felt that}} the three largest {{influences}} on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series The Wild Wild West, Mayberry R.F.D. and The Fugitive—the inclusion of a one-armed character in Twin Peaks was a direct homage to the latter of these. Engels has {{also noted that the}} series would make use of normal, conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a [...] "familiar" [...] framework, allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop—he particularly cites this episode's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example, as it offers <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> other than the single domino which Jennings is playing with at all times, drawing attention to the item as it is the only thing which seems out of place.|$|E
500|$|After {{falling in}} love with Suzette, and finding out about her {{marriage}} in September 1993, Vela wrote down his feelings (which he had kept private) for her. The resulting song was titled [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and it was given to Selena to record for the album. When her brother asked her to do a fifth take she replied that she had enough of recording the song. She informed him that [...] "what you got there is what you got" [...] and left to go shopping. A.B. approached Pérez and asked if he would be interested in working with Vela on [...] "Ya No", a song he had written. The band was scheduled to record the album the following day. Pérez found his behavior <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> and worked on the song with Vela throughout the night [...] "coming up with drum sounds and programing the pattern for it," [...] finalizing its structure before sunrise. Despite A.B.'s assistance, Pérez was dumbfounded that he was given creative control over the track. He added electric guitar riffs and complemented it with his own musical style.|$|E
60|$|Newman Noggs made no reply, {{but went}} on shrugging his {{shoulders}} and cracking his finger-joints; smiling horribly all the time, and looking steadfastly at <b>nothing,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> his eyes, in a most ghastly manner.|$|R

500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} {{as a part}} of History Matters, a campaign led by several heritage organisations such as the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.|$|E
500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> But if I had to explain it to this girl using terminology she knew.....it's a kind of magic." [...] have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.|$|E
2500|$|Buddhism was not passive in the {{assimilation}} process, but was itself ready to assimilate and be assimilated. By {{the time it}} entered Japan it was already syncretic, having adapted to and amalgamated with other religions and cultures in India, China, and the Korean Peninsula. For example, already while in India, it had absorbed Hindu divinities like Brahma (Bonten in Japanese) and Indra (Taishakuten). When it arrived in Japan, it already had a disposition towards producing the combinatory gods that the Japanese would call [...] Searching for the origins of a kami in Buddhist scriptures was felt to be <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b>|$|E

60|$|The Englishman, {{absorbed in}} his own sudden passion, had seen <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common in <b>the</b> brief {{interchange}} <b>of</b> glances between <b>the</b> trio.

2500|$|After investigation, Church {{authorities}} {{confirmed the}} authenticity of the apparitions in 1862. In the 150 years since Bernadette dug up the spring, 69 cures have been verified by the Lourdes Medical Bureau as [...] "inexplicable" [...] after what the Church claims are [...] "extremely rigorous scientific and medical examinations" [...] that failed to find any other explanation. The Lourdes Commission that examined Bernadette after the visions ran an intensive analysis on the water and found that, while it had a high mineral content, it contained <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> that would account for the cures attributed to it. Bernadette said that it was faith and prayer that cured the sick.|$|E
2500|$|Daspit {{carefully}} documented {{his efforts}} to sink 19,000-ton whale factory ship Tonan Maru III on 24July 1943. He fired four torpedoes from two hit, stopping the target dead in the water. Daspit immediately fired another two; these hit as well. With no enemy anti-submarine combatants in sight, Daspit then took time to carefully maneuver into a textbook firing position, [...] square off the target's beam, where he fired nine more Mark14s and observed all with his periscope (despite the Japanese firing at it). All were duds. Daspit, suspicious by now {{he was working with}} a faulty production run of Mark14s, saved his last remaining torpedo to be analyzed by experts back at base. <b>Nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> was found.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 8 April, Bruun was ordered to patrol with Æger off Jæren and look for {{suspicious}} activity, after the British claimed to have laid a naval minefield in the area. By 09:00 he returned to Tananger and reported to his superiors that <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> had been observed. Thereafter Bruun brought Æger to Stavanger to restock provisions and carry out maintenance on the destroyer's weapons. The destroyer had only two torpedoes on board. At 22:00 Bruun was ordered by naval command to increase his ship's readiness and prepare for potential war. After hearing on the NRK radio news of the sinking of the German vessel [...] off the Norwegian port of Lillesand, and reports of German warship movements in the Kattegat south of Norway, Bruun was increasingly concerned about the situation.|$|E

At 06:54, the ATC controller tried notifying Flight 990 that radar contact had been lost, but received no reply. Two minutes later, the controller contacted ARINC {{to determine if}} Flight 990 had switched to an oceanic frequency too early.

60|$|Strangely enough, at {{that moment}} Tavernake saw <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common in her request.
