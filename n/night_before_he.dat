5|$|Brooke {{does not}} marry Noel, but rather spends {{a brief period}} in Munich where he tries to become {{intimate}} with a Belgian girl in order to lose his heterosexual virginity. This relationship also fails, and he returns to England confused about his sexuality. He and Nell continue to remain close until he goes on a vacation with his friends, where he again proposes to another of his friends. Brooke is refused resulting in a psychological breakdown and an extended absence from Grantchester while he is treated by a London doctor. After a few more months, Brooke returns to the Old Vicarage briefly before departing {{on a trip to}} Tahiti via Canada and the United States. The <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> leaves, Nell realises that she still loves Brooke and goes to Brooke's bed the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> leaves.|$|E
5|$|Göring made {{an appeal}} {{asking to be}} shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal, but the court refused. Defying the {{sentence}} imposed by his captors, he committed suicide with a potassium cyanide capsule the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was to be hanged.|$|E

5|$|The various musical themes {{associated}} with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire Ring cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies and phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments {{to the source of}} the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, on the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died in Venice, in 1883.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I fear, father,' hesitated Louisa, 'that he {{must have}} made some {{representation}} to Stephen Blackpool - perhaps in my name, perhaps in his own - which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three <b>nights</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> left the town.' ...|$|R

5|$|Rupert {{joined the}} King in the advance on London, playing {{a key role}} in the {{resulting}} Battle of Edgehill in October. Once again, Rupert was at his best with swift battlefield movements; the <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> had undertaken a forced march and seized the summit of Edgehill, giving the Royalists a superior position. When he quarrelled with his fellow infantry commander, Lindsey, however, some of the weaknesses of Rupert's character began to display themselves. Rupert vigorously interjected—probably correctly, but certainly tactlessly—that Lindsey should deploy his men in the modern Swedish fashion that Rupert was used to in Europe, which would have maximised their available firepower. The result was an argument in front of the troops and Lindsey's resignation and replacement by Sir Jacob Astley. In the subsequent battle Rupert's men made a dramatic cavalry charge, but despite his best efforts a subsequent scattering and loss of discipline turned a potential victory into a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was gaining}} adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim {{was not to}} enter politics, but to persuade {{existing}} parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province: the Man from Mars, who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist {{in the midst of}} plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart's characters, the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer, did not make an appearance; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the knee}} injury, Croyle {{received}} interest from members the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference, including Louisiana State and Florida State. Croyle showed interest in playing for Florida State {{due in part}} because of the team's offensive coordinator, Mark Richt. Croyle initially showed little interest in playing for Alabama after their head coach, Mike DuBose had recently been fired, but once Richt took the head coaching job with the Georgia Bulldogs, Croyle followed in his father's footsteps. On the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was to announce his college decision to play for Florida State, Croyle announced that he would instead play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Interestingly enough, the Crimson Tide were not fazed by Croyle’s rather serious ligament tear, for they felt he would heal well enough that his talent still warranted a spot on the roster. Croyle graduated early from high school and enrolled at the University of Alabama in January 2001. After red-shirting his freshman year at Alabama, Croyle earned a spot as the top backup in his second season behind senior starter Tyler Watts. Croyle's coaches voted for him as the Ozzie Newsome Most Improved Freshman after starting two games in 2002. After the 2002 season, Alabama head coach Dennis Franchione resigned to take the same position at Texas A. Washington State head coach Mike Price was hired to replace Franchione in January 2003.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2013–14 NBA {{season with the}} newly-renamed Pelicans {{with a pair of}} double-doubles, posting 20 points and 12 rebounds against Indiana on October 30 and 26 points and 17 rebounds against Orlando on November 1. In the Orlando game, Davis became the {{youngest}} player in franchise history to record 25 points and 15 rebounds in a game. In the third game of the season against Charlotte on November 2, Davis established career-highs with 6 blocks and 6 steals, while helping New Orleans to its first victory. He also became the first player with 6 blocks, 6 steals and 25 points in a game in the last 20 years and only the fifth with at least 5 blocks, 5 steals and 25 points in that period. For the week, Davis earned an NBA Player of the Week nomination, but lost out to Kevin Love. On November 8, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Davis scored a career-high 32 points and tied a career high with 6 blocks, along with 12 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to have at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 5 blocks in an NBA game. On November 16, he established a new career high with 8 blocks against Philadelphia. He again had 8 blocks on November 20 against the Utah Jazz. With two 8-block games in the Pelicans' first 11 games of the 2013–14 NBA season, Davis matched the number of 8-block games that Roy Hibbert had at that time in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 NBA seasons combined. No other players had two 8-block games as recently. According to ESPN, while drawing a charging foul from Amar'e Stoudemire, Davis suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left hand in the first quarter against the New York Knicks on December 1. Yahoo! Sports claims the injury came on an attempted alley oop. On December 3, the Pelicans announced a 4-6 week layoff was expected. The injury came the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was supposed to play in his hometown of Chicago, marking {{the second year in a}} row that he was sidelined for his chance to play in his hometown.|$|E

He was set to play against Coventry City on 6 November, but due to the birth of his first child the <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> missed the game.|$|E

There were the bread and wine consecrated by the words of Institution and by an invocation of the Holy Spirit; the bread was broken and Communion was given to the faithful. Undoubtedly, too, before this part of the service lessons were read from the Bible, as explicitly stated by Saint Justin Martyr.|$|E

She took him to her apartment, where he refused to let her call a doctor and instead went to bed. The next morning, she found him dead.

In the 2007 NBA Playoffs, Bargnani averaged 11.0 ppg and 4.0 rpg as the Raptors were defeated by the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the first round. On 8 May 2007, Bargnani and Garbajosa were named to the NBA All-Rookie team.|$|E

Before Gregor can elaborate further, fake FBI agents kill him and kidnap Martin to a remote location where he's reunited with Cosmo, who Martin thought had died in prison. While in prison, Cosmo developed ties with organized crime, allowing him to escape and become wealthy. He explains his plan to use Janek's box to destabilize the world economy, and offers Martin the chance to join him. Martin refuses, whereupon Cosmo uses {{the box to}} break into the FBI and connect Martin's current identity with his former name. Cosmo has Martin knocked out and taken back to the city.|$|E
25|$|The <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was {{scheduled}} to leave Shanghai in June 1931, Xiang Zhongfa, {{who was one of}} Zhou's most senior agents, decided {{to spend the night in}} a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou's warnings about the danger. In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel. Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the French Concession. Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang's expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene. Zhou's hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught. The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General Xiong Shihui, who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation. Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers all the information that they requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed.|$|E
