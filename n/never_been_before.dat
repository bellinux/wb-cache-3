25|$|Players like Gayle and Nannes {{had agreed}} {{to play in the}} event for less money than they demand elsewhere. Gayle hoped that his first season in Zimbabwe is a season to remember, while Nannes looked forward to bowl in a country where he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> Tait {{selected}} the Mid West Rhinos franchise because it was coached by a fellow Australian and former fast bowler Jason Gillespie. Both Gayle and Nannes were teammates for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2011 Indian Premier League (IPL 4) and 2011 Champions League Twenty20.|$|E
25|$|The decade {{also saw}} the birth of several new coin series which used {{innovative}} techniques that had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> These techniques were {{the use of a}} gold cameo in the coin. The first set that was part of this great innovation was the Aviation Collection, which debuted in 1990. The Canadian aviation heroes were commemorated on a 20-coin set. Every coin in the collection consisted of a 24-karat, gold-covered oval cameo portrait of an aviation hero--a first for the Royal Canadian Mint. The coin itself featured a different plane ranging from the Gypsy Moth to the legendary Avro Arrow. These were proof coins while the case of issue was an aluminum case {{in the shape of a}} wing.|$|E

25|$|Analysts and pollsters offered {{different}} opinions on whether smaller extraparliamentary parties had chances to enter parliament or not. According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had very good {{chances of getting}} into parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were {{as good as they}} had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated to be the very first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet really started campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} adapt to the Marvel Comics style of superhero adventure, Buscema [...] "synthesized the essence of [...] Kirby's {{supercharged}} action figures, harrowing perspectives, monolithic structures, mega-force explosions, and mythological planetscapes into a formula that he instantly integrated into his own superbly crafted vision," [...] wrote comics artist and historian Jim Steranko. [...] "The process brought Buscema's art to life {{in a way that it}} had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> Anatomically balanced figures of Herculean proportions stalked, stormed, sprawled, and savaged their way across Marvel's universe like none had previously".|$|E

It showcases {{the capabilities of the}} Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Armed Forces to deal with terrorism. Many technologies introduced in this series has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> shown to the public. It is also the only local television series to date to accurately depict the Police's elite Special Tactics and Rescue (STAR) team and the Army's Special Operations Forces (SOF) although the latter unit was never addressed by name in the show.

It’s going to affect everybody this season because that’s what’s more fun." [...] said Kitsis. On everyone in Storybrooke's memories returning Horowitz commented, [...] "One of the things that’s interesting to us to explore is this notion that just because the memories have returned {{does not mean that}} the past 28 years did not happen. Those memories, the Davids, the Mary Margarets, the Mr. Golds, all those people, who they were existed and what they did actually happened and those are the things that will have to be dealt with." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1979, the American mini-series Holocaust {{aired in}} West Germany. The series, which was watched by 20 million people or 50% of West Germans, first brought {{the matter of}} the {{genocide}} in World War II to widespread public attention {{in a way that it}} had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> After each part of Holocaust was aired, there was a companion show where a panel of historians could answer questions from people phoning in. The historians' panels were literally overwhelmed with thousands of phone calls from shocked and outraged Germans, a great many of whom stated that they were born after 1945 and that was the first time that they learned that their country had practiced genocide in World War II. By the late 1970s, an initially small number of young people had started to demand that the Länder governments stop neglecting the sites of the concentration camps, and start turning them into proper museums and sites of remembrance, turning them into [...] "locations of learning" [...] meant to jar visitors into thinking critically about the Nazi period.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2005 {{interview}} with the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, Litvinenko alleged that Ayman al-Zawahiri, a prominent leader of al-Qaeda, was trained for half a year by the FSB in Dagestan in 1997. Litvinenko said that after this training, al-Zawahiri [...] "was transferred to Afghanistan, where he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> and where, following the recommendation of his Lubyanka chiefs, he at once ... penetrated the milieu of Osama bin Laden and soon became his assistant in Al Qaeda." [...] Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy, a former KGB officer and writer, supported this claim and said that Litvinenko [...] "was responsible for securing the secrecy of Al-Zawahiri's arrival in Russia; he was trained by FSB instructors in Dagestan, Northern Caucasus, in 1996–1997." [...] He said: [...] "At that time, Litvinenko was the Head of the Subdivision for Internationally Wanted Terrorists of the First Department of the Operative-Inquiry Directorate of the FSB Anti-Terrorist Department. He was ordered to undertake the delicate mission of securing Al-Zawahiri from unintentional disclosure by the Russian police. Though Al-Zawahiri {{had been brought to}} Russia by the FSB using a false passport, it was still possible for the police to learn about his arrival and report to Moscow for verification. Such a process could disclose Al-Zawahiri as an FSB collaborator. In order to prevent this, Litvinenko visited a group of highly placed police officers to notify them in advance." [...] According to Sergei Ignatchenko, an FSB spokesman, al-Zawahiri was arrested by Russian authorities in Dagestan in December 1996 and released in May 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2007, {{some members}} of major Christian Churches, {{including}} Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans and Methodists, {{have participated in the}} Ashes to Go program, in which clergy go outside of their churches to public places, such as downtowns, sidewalks and train stations, to distribute ashes to passersby, even to people waiting in their cars for a stoplight to change. Anglican priest, Rev. Emily Mellott of Calvary Church in Lombard took up the idea {{and turned it into a}} movement, stated that the practice was also an act of evangelism. Anglicans and Catholics in parts of the United Kingdom such as Sunderland, are offering Ashes to Go together: Fr. Marc Lyden-Smith, the priest of Saint Mary's Church stated that the ecumenical effort is a [...] "tremendous witness in our city, with Catholics and Anglicans working together to start the season of Lent, perhaps reminding those who have fallen away from the Church, or have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>before,</b> that the Christian faith is alive and active in Sunderland." [...] The Catholic Student Association of Kent State University, based at the University Parish Newman Center, offered ashes to university students who were going through the Student Center of that institution in 2012, and the Rev. Douglas Clark of St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Church in Statesboro, among others, have participated in Ashes to Go. On Ash Wednesday 2017, Father Paddy Mooney, the priest of St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in the Irish town of Glenamaddy, set up an Ashes to Go station through which commuters could drive and receive ashes from their car; the parish church also had [...] "drive-through prayers during Lent with people submitting requests into a box left in the church grounds without having to leave their car". Reverend Trey Hall, pastor of Urban Village United Methodist Church, stated that when his local church offered ashes in Chicago [...] "nearly 300 people received ashesincluding two people who were waiting in their car for a stoplight to change." [...] In 2013, churches not only in the United States, but also at least one church each in the United Kingdom, Canada and South Africa, participated in Ashes to Go. Outside of their church building, Saint Stephen Martyr Lutheran Church in Canton offered Ashes to Go for [...] "believers whose schedules make it difficult to attend a traditional service" [...] in 2016. In the United States itself 34 states and the District of Columbia had at least one church taking part. Most of these churches (parishes) were Episcopal, but there were also several Methodist churches, as well as Presbyterian and Catholic churches.|$|E
