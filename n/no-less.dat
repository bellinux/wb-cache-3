He {{described}} Sleepless Nights as [...] "a thoroughly arresting listening experience, as Loveless lays twenty-first century gloss, if not sensibilities, {{on a few}} songs that haven’t been dusted off in quite some time." [...] Although he criticized the album's lack of up-tempo songs and felt {{that some of the}} covers were [...] "uncomfortable", he nonetheless commended Loveless for [...] "finding her wheelhouse on songs that are <b>no-less</b> classic but nonetheless haven’t achieved corner bar ubiquity", also saying [...] "The success of these songs is equal testament to Loveless’ outstanding country voice and the timeless quality of the material she’s selected." ...|$|E

In 1942 Kazimierz Korkucz was {{approached}} by a Jewish family-man Moshe Sonenson with a plea for help following the 1941 Ejszyszki massacre, which he escaped with his wife Zipporah, 10-year-old son Yitzhak and 6-year-old daughter Sonia (Scheinele). Their baby brother, Shaul, did not survive. Kazimierz Korkucz agreed to hide the Sonensons around his house {{as well as the other}} two families who came along: Kabaczniks and Solominanskys. Antoni Gawrylkiewicz, a shepherd employed by Korkucz, took it upon himself to do most of the caring. [...] "To him," [...] states Yitzhak Sonenson, [...] "we all owe our lives," [...] for he was the person most intimately involved with the care of the 16 Jews in hiding, including digging underground shelters, preparing food, removing bodily wastes, transfer from one locality to another, and <b>no-less</b> - warning them of approaching danger." [...] Zipporah Sonenson, while in hiding, gave birth to her fourth child, Hayyim, in June 1944.|$|E
40|$|The {{gravitational}} wave (GW) as standard siren directly determines the luminosity {{distance from the}} {{gravitational wave}}form without reference to specific cosmological model, of which the redshift can be obtained separately {{by means of the}} electromagnetic counterpart like GW events from binary neutron star (BNS) and massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). To see to what extent the standard siren can reproduce the presumed dipole anisotropy written in the simulated data of standard siren events from typical configurations of GW detectors, we find that, (1) for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) with different MBHB models during five-year observations, the cosmic isotropy can be ruled out at 3 σ confidence level (CL) and the dipole direction can be constrained roughly around 20 % at 2 σ CL, as long as the dipole amplitude is larger than 0. 06, 0. 05 and 0. 03 for MBHB models Q 3 d, pop III and Q 3 nod with increasing constraining ability, respectively; (2) for Einstein Telescope (ET) with <b>no-less</b> than 200 standard siren events, the cosmic isotropy can be ruled out at 3 σ CL if the dipole amplitude is larger than 0. 06, and the dipole direction can be constrained within 20 % at 3 σ CL if the dipole amplitude is near 0. 1; (3) for Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) with <b>no-less</b> than 100 standard siren events, the cosmic isotropy can be ruled out at 3 σ CL for dipole amplitude larger than 0. 03, and the dipole direction can even be constrained within 10 % at 3 σ CL if the dipole amplitude is larger than 0. 07. Our work manifests the promising perspective of the constraint ability on the cosmic anisotropy from standard siren approach. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, two column...|$|E

On the one hand the managers of community and state-run services largely {{at the behest of}} political cultures that have embraced economic liberal dogmas have engaged in persistent organizational and structural change. The result is a proliferation of spray-on categories like &# 039;budget responsibility&# 039;, &# 039;efficiency and accountability&# 039;, &# 039;quality assurance&# 039; triple bottom line&# 039;, &# 039;managing risk&# 039; or &# 039;strengthening community&# 039; allied to quite real changes in policy and practice. The second is the persistent role played by the tabloid elements of the mass media promoting an endless series of &# 039;moral panics&# 039; centering on the threat posed by young people because of their &# 039;criminal&# 039;, &# 039;violent&# 039;, &# 039;drug abusing&# 039;, or &# 039;anti-social&# 039; tendencies.

40|$|The abrupt {{climate change}} thesis {{suggests}} that climate passes through threshold transitions after which change is sudden, runaway and unstoppable. This concurs with recent themes in complexity studies. Data from ice cores indicates that major shifts in global climate regimes {{have occurred in}} as little as a decade, and that for most of the span of human existence climate has oscillated much more violently than it has over the last 10, 000 years. This evidence presents enormous challenges for international climate change negotiation and regulation, which has thus far focussed on gradual change. It is argued that existing social theoretic engagements with physical agency are insufficiently geared towards dissonant or disastrous physical events. Wagering on the past and future importance of abrupt climate change, the paper explores a way of engaging with catastrophic climatic change that stresses the inherent volatility and unpredictability of earth process, and the <b>no-less</b> inherent vulnerability of the human body. Drawing on Bataille and Derrida, it proposes a way of nestling the issue of environmental justice within a broader sense of immeasurable indebtedness to those humans who endured previous episodes of abrupt climate, and considers the idea of experimentation and generosity without reserve...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, the {{management}} of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been improved to some extent through installation of various schemes, development of new treatment technologies and implementation of economic instruments. Despite such progress, solid waste problems still impose an increasing pressure on cities and remain {{one of the major}} challenges in urban environmental management. Although approximating of waste generation in its management is important, the prediction of its production is a difficult job due to the effect of various factors on it. Artificial intelligence is an exciting and relatively new application of computers. It provides new opportunities for harnessing the scarce and often scattered pieces of valuable knowledge and experience in solid waste management which at present is in the possession of the privileged few. While conventional algorithmic programming replaced much of the sophisticated and repetitive analytical work of the solid waste practitioner, artificial intelligence is poised to take over the <b>no-less</b> important tasks of the ill-structured and lessdeterministic parts of the planning, design and management processes. In this research with application of feed forward artificial neural network, we proposed an appropriate model to predict weight of waste generation in Saqqez city of Iran. For this purpose, we used time series of generated waste of Saqqez which have been arranged weekly, from 2004 to 2007. After performing of the mentioned model, determination coefficient (R) and mean absolute relative error (MARE) in neural network for test have been achieved to be 2 equal to 0. 648 and 2. 17 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|Bruno Latour is {{a career}} subversive. Iconoclasm is his creed, dissent the beating heart {{of all his}} writings. For over three decades {{he has made a}} virtue of disputing what, in his view, passes for 2 ̆ 7 common sense 2 ̆ 7 within and beyond the sciences. He is one of our great debunkers, and in Politics of Nature his voice remains as idiomatic and incorrigible as it did when an English-speaking {{audience}} first encountered it in the late 1970 s. The book crowns a canon of commanding weight. It is the fifth of his single authored texts to be translated into English and confirms his status as more than a 2 ̆ 7 mere 2 ̆ 7 science studies scholar. Unlikely as it no doubt seemed when the germinal Laboratory Life (Latour and Woolgar, 1979) was published, Latour 2 ̆ 7 s serried writings have resonated far beyond the once obscure sub-field in which he first made his name. This is no accident, of course. Latour has self-consciously used his status as a pioneering science studies scholar to reach a much wider readership spanning the humanities and social sciences. This was most obvious in We Have Never Been Modern (1993), where he employed a constitutional metaphor to expose the contingency and non-necessity of the foundational assumptions that organize thought and practice in the Western world. Over a decade on, it is equally obvious in Politics of Nature, where Latour undertakes the <b>no-less</b> (im) modest task of drafting a new constitution for a democracy yet to come...|$|E
40|$|In Principles of Political Economy, John Stuart Mill both {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the workability and desirability of some prominent contemporary forms of socialism, and sketches his own view of how society might be transformed from capitalism into socialism. His assessment of contemporary forms of socialism–particularly Owenite communism, Saint-Simonism and Fourierism–in the main determines, not that the schemes are themselves wholly unworkable, nor that the criticisms socialists level against contemporary capitalism are entirely unwarranted, but that a better solution could be found which would also not involve their potential problems (particularly for the free development of individuality). Co-operative socialism, which avoids these problems, whilst also providing solutions to the problems of capitalism, is far more favourably reviewed. It is true that Mill’s language regarding the transformation of capitalism is possibilistic rather than deterministic or normatively prescriptive (often using “may” rather than, say, “will”), but there are both clues in his work that he thought some of these changes would come about (perhaps so long as dominant class-interest did not actively seek to prevent it), and that it should–after all, Mill describes a similar set of reforms as his “Utopia” and declared that, by the mid- 1840 s, his political philosophy was “under the general designation of Socialist”. Although the Saint-Simonian scheme called for state-wide adoption of socialism, and the Owenite and Fourierist schemes Mill assessed called for small intentional communities, they were linked by their demand for whole-scale adoption of socialism, and, therefore, for total, immediate, root-and-branch reform. Mill’s preferred model of transformation to socialism is piece-meal, peaceful, small-scale, incremental, voluntaristic, organic and grass-roots-led–but his proposed, and favoured, transformation is <b>no-less</b> radical or, in the end, wide-reaching. Although wary of being too prescriptive, the socialist proposals Mill did make, ultimately, call for some state-action, provision and ownership (at both national and local level), alongside agricultural and industrial producer- and consumer-cooperatives, which could be as communal in their living arrangements as members wished, and which would implement just distributions of the surpluses of co-operation according to principles of justice democratically determined by all members. He also envisaged radical reform to the family, to religion, to the social ethos and, ultimately, to human nature itself. This chapter sketches, firstly, Mill’s analysis of capitalism, and, secondly, his preferred road to socialism...|$|E
40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to elaborate on}} the scholarly discourse about normalisation in disability care. More specifically, the problem of imitation is addressed. The aim is to cast light on the tension between artificially created, “authentic” reality in activities that try to achieve nor-malisation for people with disability. The discussion is carried out by using examples from theatre for people with mental disability and home care for people with long-term mental ill-ness. Disability care in Swedish municipalities is {{described in terms of}} institutional logic. The logic of care is characterised by three sets of elements: regulative elements are made up of legislation, policy guidelines and organisational framework; normative elements like integra-tion and participation are grounded in national disability policy; cognitive elements are taken-for-granted values held by actors on the disability field, e. g. the value of work, not staying up all night, etc. When professionals undertake normalising activities, the logic of care is welded with a logic of everyday life. The underlying assumption appears to be that users benefit from lead-ing a life as similar to what is considered as normal as possible. The article probes deeper into two such logics, the logic of theatre and the logic of home. The logic of theatre stresses the artistic and creative elements of the work with disabled clients, which creates the opportunity to achieve alternative identities for users. The logic of home involves values such as a sense of control, the home as conveyor of identity, and providing a setting for important relations. Both theatre and home care involve institutional ambiguities. When welfare institutions attempt to imitate authentic everyday life, the assumption is that this would bring about posi-tive effects for clients. However, it is difficult to create this kind of authenticity within the therapeutic context of disability care – clients and outsiders are likely to see through the artifi-cial design of the situation. Occasionally, though, magic moments may occur when clients and staff engage in genuine activities that transcend the therapeutic purpose. However, given Giddens’ conception of late modernity, the problem of imitation may ap-pear less problematic. The design of normal-appearing environments in disability care seems to be similar to and <b>no-less</b> artificial than what is the case with normal people, in an age where individuals increasingly tend to reflexively create their identities...|$|E
