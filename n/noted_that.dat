5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, the National Hurricane Center <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{very cold}} cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, the National Hurricane Center <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E
