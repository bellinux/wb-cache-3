An example of this was employed by Spiegel Inc., a firm dealing in direct-mail operations who used neural networks to improve efficiencies. Using software developed by <b>NeuralWare</b> Inc., Spiegel identified the demographics {{of customers}} who had made a single purchase and those customers who had made repeat purchases. Neural networks where then {{able to identify the}} key patterns and consequently identify the customers that were most likely to repeat purchase. Understanding this information allowed Speigel to streamline marketing efforts, and reduced costs.|$|E

Specifically applications of data mining for neural networks using <b>NeuralWare</b> Predict ® software and genetic algorithms using Biodiscovery GeneSight ® software were selected for bioscience data sets of continuous numerical valued abalone fish data. Conclusions and future directions of the research are presented. Large volume of data and complexity in problem solving inspire research in data mining and modern heuristics. Data mining (i. e., knowledge discovery) is the process of automating information discovery. It is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives, summarizing it into useful information, and finding different patterns (e. g., classification, regression, and clustering).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of Machine Learning and Statistics {{to the problem of}} distinguishing between defective and non-defective industrial workpieces, where the defect {{takes the form of a}} long and thin crack on the surface of the piece. The images of the pieces are described by means of a set of visual primitives, including the Hough transform and the Correlated Hough transform. We have compared an attribute-value learner, C 4. 5, a backpropagation neural network, <b>NeuralWare</b> Predict, and the statistical techniques linear, logistic and quadratic discriminant for the classification of pieces. Moreover, two feature sets are considered, one containing only the Hough transform and the other one containing also the Correlated Hough Transform. The results of the experiments show that C 4. 5 performs best for both feature sets and gives an average accuracy of 93. 3...|$|E
40|$|Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) play an {{important}} part in developing intelligent and autonomous systems. By training the ANN with desired input-output patterns that are derived from human experience or simulation, the designers of such system avoid specifying detailed analytical model of such complex systems. Unlike conventional system design and development which is based on an iterative procedure of system analysis, specification, implementation and testing, ANN based system relies on training to formulate the control mechanisms. When such ANN-based components are embedded in a larger system, their interactions become harder to analyze and model. Formal testing of such system for safety properties is extremely hard {{due to the lack of}} a complete system model. In this paper, we propose the <b>neuralware</b> engineering framework to address the above issues. It is based on an iterative approach on specification, model checking, and testing. After the ANN-based system is designed and trained u [...] ...|$|E

This paper presents a method of discharge prediction for River Kaduna by developing an ANN-based model. Given the major triple problems of unavailability, inconsistency and paucity of data, the water resources planning and development in any drainage basin always suffer a setback. Rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and the stage height (input variables) and discharge (target output) data were obtained for River Kaduna drainage basin for April-October 1975 to 2004. In order to develop the ANN model, the data set was partitioned into two parts of 24 months sets. 70 % of the entire data was used as training data and 30 % of the entire data used as the validation data. From the results obtained, the developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model developed in the PredictDemo <b>NeuralWare</b> Environment using the Neural Statistics shows a correlation value of 82 %...|$|E
40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} provide {{a new approach}} to commodity forecasting that does not require algorithm or rule development. Neural networks have been deemed successful in applications involving optimization, classification, identification, pattern recognition and time series forecasting. With the advent of user friendly, commercially available software packages that work in a spreadsheet environment, such as Neural Works Predict by <b>NeuralWare,</b> more people {{can take advantage of the}} power of artificial {{neural networks}}. This thesis provides an introduction to neural networks, and reviews two recent studies of forecasting commodities prices. This study also develops a neural network model using Neural Works Predict that forecasts jet fuel prices for the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC). In addition, the results developed are compared to the output of an econometric regression model, specifically, the Department of Energy's Short-Term Integrated Forecasting System (STWS) model. The Predict artificial neural network model produced more accurate results and reduced the contribution of outliers more effectively than the STIFS model, thus producing a more robust model. NANAU.

30|$|As {{one of the}} {{approaches}} to improve these problems, cascade-correlation learning algorithm was developed by Fahlman and Lebiere (1991) [16] and showed significant improvements. Cascade-correlation is a method of incrementally adding processing elements. Instead of adjusting the weights in an ANN of fixed topology, cascade-correlation begins with a minimal network, then automatically trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating a multi-layer structure. Once a new hidden unit {{has been added to}} the ANN, its input-side weights are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the ANN, available for producing outputs or for creating other, more complex feature detectors. NeuralWorks Predict (NWP) software (<b>NeuralWare</b> Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used in this study which implements the cascade-correlation learning algorithm. NWP outperforms other neural network tools in that it also builds ANNs in the clever strategy of stopping rules against over-fitting on empirical data. Moreover, NWP undertakes some nonlinear transformation for input variables, and produces input neurons for each transformation in advance of learning process to avoid the complex representation of the model. Types of transformation used include linear (scaling), log, log–log, exponential, exponential of exponent, square-root, square, inverse, inverse of square-root, inverse of square, and so on, depending on the complexity of the problem [17]. NWP also uses a genetic algorithm to make a suitable choice of input variables from the set of all input variables and transformations of input variables [17], since it efficiently explores the large space of subsets of possible input variables.|$|E
40|$|Functional brain imaging {{brings many}} new offerings {{to the table}} of {{cognitive}} neuroscience, particularly offerings that help refine {{our understanding of the}} dynamic and adaptive properties of brain function that underpin learning and development. It is a little ironic that a methodology that is classically associated with static, still images, should be informative about dynamics and plasticity. But the association is no longer correct. In the early days of functional neuroimaging, in the late 1980 ’s, the scanners were less sensitive, so that all that was possible was a group average image depicting the areas of brain activation, averaged over several participants, contrasting a small number of experimental conditions. The current instrumentation, namely high-speed fMRI, is far more sensitive yielding enough data to observe reliable effects in single participants in a few minutes per experimental condition. Capturing the dynamics requires only a fast enough shutter speed and a willing subject. One of the consequences of the new technology of particular relevance here is {{that it is possible to}} examine the cognitive system as it adapts to slight differences in the quantitative and qualitative demands of a particular experimental condition. The result is that the brain adaptation is clearly manifest, and this manifestation is one of the key offerings of fMRI: the hardware-software distinction in the analysis of cognition that was previously a useful heuristic scientific strategy obscures one of the main adaptive properties of mind. The hardware (brain tissue) is dynamically recruited to meet the processing needs. The underlying software and the <b>neuralware</b> in whic...|$|E
40|$|Histological {{grade is}} a {{historically}} used and well-documented prognostic indicator in breast cancer. There are {{three categories of}} grade (G 1, G 2 and G 3) based {{on the degree of}} tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic count. A number of studies have reported that histological assessment is not uniformly reported. As a result of low inter-pathologist correlation associated with pathological diagnosis and non-standardised grading systems, patients are not always allocated into the correct grouping, and G 2 has often been considered a "safe" group if one is unsure. A previously published study used real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 5 genes to molecularly classify the G 2 tumours into either G 1 or G 3. Due to the workflow constraints within pathology laboratories it was not considered feasible to molecularly profile every G 2 tumour. In light of this we obtained the antibodies that corresponded to the 5 genes (BUB 1 B, CENPA, RACGAP 1, RRM 2 and NEK 2) and performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections of 43 tumours (11 G 1 and 32 G 3). Results for all tumours were randomly divided into training and testing sets and an artificial neural network (NeuralSight and <b>NeuralWare</b> Predict) was used to classify the grade of tumours. Thirty-three additional G 2 tumours were used for validation of the ANN. The ANN classified these tumours into 5 G 1 and 28 G 3 tumours. This predicted grade showed significant correlation with patient survival. Neural networks can be used to reclassify breast cancer G 2 tumours into G 1 and G 3 using a panel of 5 IHC markers. This has the potential to impact on patient care, treatment decisions and outcome. Griffith Health, School of MedicineNo Full Tex...|$|E
