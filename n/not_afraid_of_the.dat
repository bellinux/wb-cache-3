25|$|A drunken Raoul {{is sitting}} alone in a forlorn bar, contemplating the {{evolution}} {{of his relationship with}} Christine ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Meg enters and warns him that New York isn't a suitable place for his family, and she urges them to abandon Christine's performance contract and leave that night. Raoul refuses, citing their need for the money; he boasts that he is <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phantom, unaware that his rival has since slipped in and replaced the barman behind the counter. When Meg leaves, the Phantom confronts Raoul and intimidates him with veiled remarks that cause him to question his paternity of Gustave. The Phantom also offers Raoul a bet: if Christine fails to perform tonight, the Phantom will pay off all their debts and allow them to leave together, but if she sings the aria he has written for her, Raoul must go back to France alone. Raoul accepts the Phantom's dare and then experiences a moment of panic at what he has done ("Devil Take The Hindmost").|$|E
25|$|In {{a gloomy}} bar, Raoul contemplates his {{relationship}} with Christine. He is joined by Meg, who tells him she swims each day to wash away the stress of working. She tells Raoul that he must leave with Christine and Gustave and {{runs out of the}} bar ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Raoul says he is <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phantom. Suddenly, the Phantom reveals himself to Raoul and they make a bet that if Christine sings, the Phantom wins and if she doesn't, Raoul wins. If Raoul wins the bet, the Phantom will pay his debts and Raoul can leave with Christine and Gustave. However, if The Phantom wins, Christine and Gustave will remain in America with him and Raoul must return to Paris alone. The Phantom also leads Raoul to question Gustave's paternity ("Devil Take the Hindmost"). Fleck, Squelch and Gangle appear to advertise Christine's appearance at Phantasma ("Invitation to the Concert"). That night, Meg performs a strip-tease about her choice of swimming costumes ("Bathing Beauty"). She successfully impresses the audience, but Madame Giry reveals to Meg that the Phantom did not watch the performance, saying it was for nothing ("Mother, Did You Watch?").|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} {{life on a}} long sea voyage, Poe {{also drew}} from personal experience. In 1815, a six-year-old Poe along with his foster-parents traveled from Norfolk, Virginia to Liverpool, England, a journey of 34 days. During the difficult trip, young Poe asked his foster father, John Allan, to include him in a letter he was writing. Allan wrote, [...] "Edgar says Pa say something for me, say I was <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea." [...] The family returned to the United States in 1820 aboard the Martha and docked in New York after 31 days. Closer to the time Poe wrote his novel, he had sailed during his military career, the longest trip being from Boston to Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

He was awarded the Military Cross, promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant, and became [...] "obsessively determined not to betray his own men through cowardice". The novel's development of the [...] "clearly autobiographical hero" [...] of Olivero owes a great deal to Read's wartime experiences and the [...] "resolute self-possession" [...] they instilled in him. The irony of Olivero overthrowing a dictator only to become one himself is perhaps consistent with a view Read expressed in the mid-1930s: [...] "From certain points of view, therefore, I can welcome the notion of the totalitarian state, whether in its Fascist or Communist form. I am <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> totalitarian state as an economic fact, an economic machine to facilitate the complex business of living in a community." ...|$|E
500|$|Interest in the Galileo {{affair was}} revived {{in the early}} 19th century, when Protestant polemicists used it (and other {{events such as the}} Spanish Inquisition and the myth of the flat Earth) to attack Roman Catholicism. Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939, Pope Pius XII, in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his {{election}} to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the [...] "most audacious heroes of research... <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments". His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: [...] "Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely.

500|$|The police {{investigate}} {{a string of}} murders committed by the Creeper (Rondo Hatton), a mysterious killer with a hideously disfigured face. The Creeper attacks and murders Professor Cushman (John Hamilton), a professor from the nearby Hampton University. Later that night, the killer approaches a woman named Joan Bemis (Janelle Johnson) {{in front of her}} home and identifies himself as Hal Moffet. Joan screams hysterically at the sight of him until he is driven to kill her. When police cars approach, the Creeper climbs the fire escape of a city tenement building to escape and enters the apartment of Helen Paige (Jane Adams), a blind pianist. Unable to see the Creeper's deformed face, Helen is <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intruder, even when he admits to fleeing. [...] When police officers knock on her door, failing to identify themselves, Helen encourages him to hide in her bedroom, where he escapes through the window.|$|E

500|$|Hanna-Barbera {{founder and}} {{chairman}} Joseph Barbera considered Real Adventures a [...] "disaster" [...] because of changes to the characters and stories. He conceded, [...] "that's their business. Everybody needs {{to do their own}} thing." [...] Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. People liked the cast, particularly George Segal. Saturday Morning Fever praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough {{to be part of the}} action. He considered Jessie [...] "cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action." [...] He did not enjoy the [...] "toned down" [...] portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a [...] "man of action, not thought—though perfectly capable of deep thought", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.|$|E

Warner, John Ford, John Wayne, Edward G. Robinson, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Randolph Scott, Walter Pidgeon, Bob Hope and Marlene Dietrich. Cooper was buried in the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

50|$|Beyond Amado's {{treatment}} of women and Afro-Brazilian culture, Tent of Miracles is a powerful satire of modern Brazilian institutions, especially the mass media and parts of academia. Notably spared from the author's knife is the Brazilian military, which in 1967 was detaining, torturing and exiling some of Amado's political friends. A few scholars {{have suggested that the}} novel hides in its story a parable critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military dictatorship, particularly through <b>the</b> portrayal <b>of</b> a repressive but ineffectual assistant police commissioner, Pedrito Gordo. If so, the ridicule was mild, perhaps urging Brazilians to <b>not</b> be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime, and so well disguised that the novel was not censored.|$|R

Several Iraqis, reportedly unarmed, were shot in anti-Alliance demonstrations, mostly in the nation's Sunni Arab areas. While Shi'a Muslim areas were mostly peaceful, Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, who returned to Iraq after decades in exile shortly after the occupation began, said: [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British or American troops.

2500|$|The {{practice}} was {{drawn into the}} national spotlight at that time when Mark Wisdom, a Baptist pastor, responded to what he claims was a vision from God, and challenged the system in the national media.

[...] Wisdom claimed to have later discovered these same women {{on one of his}} evangelistic missions, held in bondage in a shrine just across the Volta River from his home, but previously unknown to him.
