40|$|It {{is known}} that a {{watershed}} is a complex system and is influenced by internal and external factors that may affect its various equilibrium relationships, and possibly lead to its degradation. This study aimed to determine the physiographic parameters of the micro watershed Dois Corregos, {{in order to provide}} information for planning and management of water resources in this watershed. Spring 5. 1 software was used, for the calculation of physiographic parameters of the studied area. Analyzing the results of this study, {{it was found that the}} Dois Corregos micro watershed is <b>not</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> due <b>to</b> its more elongated shape. With respect to drainage density, the area of study obtained a value of 0. 74 km/km 2 being classified as poor and unlikely to natural erosion processes. Pages: 4467 - 447...|$|R
5000|$|Static holiday caravans {{generally}} have sleeping accommodation for 6 to 8 people in 2 to 3 bedrooms and on convertible seating in the lounge. They tend towards a fairly [...] "open-plan" [...] layout, {{and while some}} units are insulated and centrally heated for year-round use, cheaper models without double glazing or central heating are available for mainly summer use. Holiday homes are intended for leisure use and are available in 10 ft and 12 ft widths, a small number in 13 ft and 14 ft widths, and a few 16 ft wide, consisting of two 8 ft wide units joined together. Generally, holiday homes are clad in painted steel panels, but can be clad in PVC panels. Static caravans are sited on caravan parks where {{the owner of the}} site leases a plot to the caravan owner. Many of these parks are sited in areas that are prone <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> and anyone considering buying a sited static caravan needs to take particular care in checking that their site is <b>not</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Some park owners used to have unfair conditions in their lease contracts but the Office of Fair Trading has produced a guidance document available for download called Unfair Terms in Holiday Caravan Agreements which aims to stop unfair practices.|$|R
