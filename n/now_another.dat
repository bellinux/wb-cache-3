25|$|The first {{solution}} in the 1970s was {{the development of}} water-free electrolyte systems based on organic solvents. Their advantages, among other things were lower leakage currents and nearly unlimited shelf life. But <b>now</b> <b>another</b> problem was observed. The growing mass production with automatic insertion machines requires a washing of the PCB's after soldering. The cleaning solutions contain chloroalkanes (CFC) agents. These halogens solutions sometimes permeate the sealing of the capacitors and start chlorine corrosion. Again there was a leakage current problem.|$|E
25|$|Finally, however, {{there came}} a point in July 1461 when the king's {{physicians}} concluded that Charles would not live past August. Ill and weary, the king became delirious, convinced that {{he was surrounded by}} traitors loyal only to his son. Under the pressure of sickness and fever, he went mad. By <b>now</b> <b>another</b> infection in his jaw had caused a tumor or abscess in his mouth. The swelling caused by this became so large that, for the last week of his life, Charles was unable to swallow food or water. Although he asked the Dauphin to come to his deathbed, Louis refused, instead waiting at Avesnes, in Burgundy, for his father to die. At Mehun-sur-Yèvre, attended by his younger son, Charles, and aware of his elder son's final betrayal, the King starved to death. He died on 22 July 1461, and was buried, at his request, beside his parents in Saint-Denis.|$|E
25|$|The most {{traditional}} {{dance and music}} of the region is called the Huapango or Son Huasteco. It is played by a trio of musicians: one playing a small, five-string rhythm guitar called a jarana huasteca, one on an eight-string bass guitar called a quinta huapanguera and another playing a violin. The two guitarists sing coplas, or short poetry stanzas, alternating verses between them. Son huasteco has two unique trademarks: improvised violin ornamentations based on a melody, {{and the use of}} a high falsetto voice. The style has spread beyond Veracruz and San Luis Potosí to other states including Hidalgo, which is <b>now</b> <b>another</b> center for the music. Unlike other folk music in Mexico, it is not in danger of disappearing and remains in high demand for major celebrations in La Huasteca. The music has been researched and cataloged for over forty years which has resulted in a two CD compilation called El Gusto. It was also the focus of a documentary called “A Mexican Sound” by Roy Germano.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{during the}} siege itself, war {{artifacts}} were collected, and shown to public by the city authorities, such as the German airplane that was shot down {{and fell to the}} ground in Tauricheskiy Garden (...) [...] Such objects were displayed as a sign of people's courage and gathered in a specially allocated building of the former 19с Salt Warehouses (...) [...] The exhibition was soon turned into a full-scale Museum of Leningrad Defence (now [...] ). Several years after the World War II, in late 1940s – early 1950s, Stalin's supposed jealousy of Leningrad city leaders caused their destruction in the course of politically-motivated demonstrative trials forming the after-WWII Leningrad Affair (the pre-war one followed in 1934 the assassination of the popular city ruler Sergey Kirov). <b>Now</b> <b>another</b> generation of state and Communist Party functionaries of the city was wiped out, supposedly for publicly overestimating the importance of the city as an independent fighting unit and their own roles in winning over the enemy. Their brainchild, the Leningrad Defence Museum, was also destroyed, and many valuable exhibits were destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Between about 1949 and 1962, {{virtually}} the entire route of US65 was relocated onto a streamlined alignment south of Tallulah, often following the now-abandoned Missouri Pacific Railroad line. [...] This work was accomplished in several stages, beginning {{with the construction of}} a new alignment between Ferriday and Waterproof in 1950. [...] The new route traveled through Clayton, bypassing what is now LA568 along the shore of Lake St. John. [...] At the same time, the town of St. Joseph was bypassed, eliminating a sharp loop through the town that is now part of LA128 and LA605. [...] In 1953, US65 was straightened through the Newellton area, moving the route slightly outside of the town and bypassing another section of the current LA605 along the shore of Lake St. Joseph. [...] A small loop through the town of Waterproof was bypassed around 1958 and is <b>now</b> <b>another</b> part of LA568. [...] This was roughly concurrent with the slight straightening of the route through Vidalia, which eliminated some modest curves and bypassed what is now known as Murray Drive. [...] The streamlined alignment between Waterproof and St. Joseph was opened by 1960, and in Madison Parish between Quimby and Tallulah around 1962.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} how Governor Milan, his sick body racked with fever almost from the first, restlessly {{suspicious}} and ofttimes with reason of his fellow men, jealous of his official power and position, administered the affairs of St. Thomas during his sixteen months' incumbency may be dealt with rather briefly. In Captain Meyer's attempt to provide the Fortuna, [...] with a good return cargo, the governor took but an indifferent interest, and as to the Esmits' returning on the Fortuna, he {{would have none of}} it. Just why he should deliberately keep with him persons who could not but be a source of trouble {{as long as they were}} near, is difficult to explain on other grounds than cupidity. Milan had been unable to lay his hands on Esmit's gains. In his relations with his council, he showed his arbitrariness and wilfulness. In place of Lieutenant Heins, who happened to be absent on the company's business when Milan arrived, the governor promptly appointed his son, Felix. Instead of selecting permanent councilors from among the planters as he had been instructed to do under certain specified conditions, he put in now one, <b>now</b> <b>another,</b> until fourteen planters had taken part in the government with him.|$|E

2500|$|In 1796, George Washington {{commissioned}} Ellicott as the U.S. representative on {{the commission}} for the survey of the southern border between the Spanish territories along the Gulf of Mexico coast in Florida and the United States as negotiated in the Treaty of San Lorenzo (also known as Treaty of Madrid) of 1795. Ellicott travelled with a military escort from Pittsburgh via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and worked together with Spanish commissioners, despite many difficulties, {{for the next four}} years. Another [...] "Ellicott's Line" [...] from this survey, running along latitude parallel 31° North, still defines the border today between the future states of Alabama and Florida. One of his many stone markers for the boundary line survives to this day and bears his name, Ellicott's Stone. In 1798, he complained to the government about four American generals receiving pensions from Spain, including General in Chief James Wilkinson, raising the specter of treason, which later involved Vice President (during Jefferson's first term), Aaron Burr. Ellicott showed considerable diplomatic talent during this joint project to bring it to a successful completion, and he presented his final report with maps to the government in 1800. (The Mapping episode of Philip Morrison's miniseries The Ring Of Truth illustrates Elllicot's surveying methods from Ellicott Hill in Natchez, Mississippi, which is <b>now</b> <b>another</b> National Historic Landmark.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Things {{soon began}} to fall apart. [...] A nine-year plague enveloped Morocco in 1598-1607, {{weakening}} the country tremendously, and taking al-Mansur in 1603. [...] His successor Abu Faris Abdallah was acclaimed in Marrakesh, but the jurists of Fez elevated his brother Zidan al-Nasir instead. Zidan managed to prevail and entered Marrakesh in 1609. [...] But <b>now</b> <b>another</b> brother, Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Ma'mun revolted in the north, and soon Zidan was reduced to Marrakesh. [...] As Saadian power buckled, Morocco fell into anarchy and fragmented into smaller pieces {{for much of the}} next century. [...] Zidan was driven out of Marrakesh by a religious leader, the self-proclaimed mahdi Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli in 1612, and was only restored in 1614 with the assistance of another religious leader, Yahya ibn Abdallah, a Sufi marabout from the High Atlas, who subsequently tried to exert his own power over the city from 1618 until his death in 1626. [...] Zidan somehow found the time and resources during all this to complete the Saadian Tombs at the Kasbah mosque. However, there were not enough resources to complete a grand Saadian mosque begun by Ahmed al-Mansur, slated to be called the Jemaa al-Hana ("Mosque of Prosperity"); local people {{soon began to}} call the unfinished site the Jemaa el-Fnaa (Mosque of the Ruins), what would become the future central square of Marrakesh.|$|E
2500|$|St Kilda {{features}} many notable {{grand old}} hotels, some which still operate as licensed premises {{and others that}} function as accommodation, {{most of which are}} listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The most famous is the Esplanade Hotel on the Esplanade. Built in 1878 and later modified, the Esplanade is an iconic pub and live music venue known by locals simply as the 'Espy'. The St Kilda Coffee Palace, built in the 1870s was once the St Kilda's main coffee palace. It is now a busy backpackers hostel. The George Hotel built in 1887 on the corner of Fitzroy and Grey streets. From 1979 to the mid '80s the [...] "Crystal Ballroom" [...] at the George (briefly the Seaview Hotel) became {{the heart and soul of}} Australia's Punk-inspired music scene, launching artists such as Nick Cave, Hunters and Collectors, Models and many more. In the 1990s, it was converted into studio apartments. Many of the interior and exterior features are in need of restoration. More recently, the ground floor has been renovated and is now a very modern and trendy function venue, nightclub and bar called The George Whitebar and Gallery. The Prince of Wales Hotel is another famous hotel which was built in 1940 in the moderne style on the site of the first Prince of Wales which was built in 1920. It has been used as a cabaret venue and is <b>now</b> <b>another</b> live music venue.|$|E
