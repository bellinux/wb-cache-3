An Asian woman, Xia is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but one that Juris picked for her, which means [...] "glow of the sunrise".

5000|$|On {{launching}} {{her music}} career, she did <b>not</b> use <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> Hoskins, since {{this might have}} caused confusion with Mary Hopkin, better known at the time. She chose [...] "Charles", as it was her father's name.|$|R

2500|$|Fertility Hollis : A {{friend of}} Tender's. [...] She meets him at her dead brother Trevor's crypt. At first, Fertility {{says she is}} repulsed by him, but as the novel {{progresses}} the two grow close. [...] "Fertility" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> but a pseudonym she uses for her job, which is acting as a surrogate mother for couples who cannot conceive. Her job is fraudulent in that she is actually sterile and has never managed to carry a child for a client. Fertility has the psychic ability to predict the future; she knows when, where, how, and to whom {{everything is going to}} happen, which takes all the fun out of life for her. She strikes up a friendship with Tender and helps him throughout the novel because she believes he is the only person who can surprise her. It is Fertility who leads Tender to hijack the plane. She also tells him that there is a way for him to [...] "survive", but her meaning is ambiguous.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will all}} be clear {{to you in a}} few days, Pet," [...] {{returned}} the ex-school-teacher soothingly. He had lately gotten to calling the lady [...] "Pet," [...] although that was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack, take me {{down that}} coast. Joe said I wouldn't dare to do it, so I must," [...] {{commanded}} Jill, as they paused for breath {{after the long}} trudge up hill. Jill, of course, was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but had been given because of her friendship with Jack, who so admired Janey Pecq's spirit and fun.|$|E
5000|$|An underclassman of Isshu {{that is in}} {{love with}} Shin and admires Miyabi. She {{introduces}} herself as Sayorin (さよりん) because she doesn't like her last name. Although she does <b>not</b> reveal <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> in the game, it is strongly hinted what her last name is.|$|R

5000|$|Her fictional {{biography}} confirms her age: 30, base of operations: Dorado, hacking occupation, {{as well as}} her {{affiliation and}} former affiliation with Talon and Los Muertos, respectively. However, unlike most other characters' fictional biography, Sombra's does <b>not</b> reveal <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> instead listing a censored [...] "░░░░░░" [...] in the field where her name should be. She later briefly appears in the 10th issue of the Overwatch digital comics.|$|R
60|$|This (as the reader, {{if at all}} {{acquainted with}} our {{literary}} biography, need scarcely be told) was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name.</b> She had assumed it, in the first instance, as her magazine signature; and, as it accorded well with something imperial which her friends attributed to this lady's figure and deportment, they half-laughingly adopted it in their familiar intercourse with her. She took the appellation in good part, and even encouraged its constant use; which, in fact, was thus far appropriate, that our Zenobia, however humble looked her new philosophy, had as much native pride as any queen would have known what to do with.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile he {{definitely}} forsook his old gods. The amazement with which {{at first he}} had looked upon {{the works of the}} impressionists, changed to admiration; and presently he found himself talking as emphatically as the rest on the merits of Manet, Monet, and Degas. He bought a photograph of a drawing by Ingres of the Odalisque and a photograph of the Olympia. They were pinned side by side over his washing-stand so that he could contemplate their beauty while he shaved. He knew now quite positively that there had been no painting of landscape before Monet; and he felt a real thrill when he stood in front of Rembrandt's Disciples at Emmaus or Velasquez' Lady with the Flea-bitten Nose. That was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but by that she was distinguished at Gravier's to emphasise the picture's beauty notwithstanding the somewhat revolting peculiarity of the sitter's appearance. With Ruskin, Burne-Jones, and Watts, he had put aside his bowler hat and the neat blue tie with white spots which he had worn on coming to Paris; and now disported himself in a soft, broad-brimmed hat, a flowing black cravat, and a cape of romantic cut. He walked along the Boulevard du Montparnasse as though he had known it all his life, and by virtuous perseverance he had learnt to drink absinthe without distaste. He was letting his hair grow, and it was only because Nature is unkind and has no regard for the immortal longings of youth that he did not attempt a beard.|$|E

25|$|Freud {{gave her}} the name 'Dora', and he {{describes}} in detail in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life what his unconscious motivations for choosing such a name might have been. His sister's nursemaid {{had to give up}} <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> Rosa, when she accepted the job because Freud's sister was also named Rosa—she took the name 'Dora' instead. Thus, when Freud needed a name for someone who could <b>not</b> keep <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> (this time, in order to preserve his patient's anonymity), Dora was the name that occurred to him.|$|R
5000|$|Yukiko Todoroki ( [...] Todoroki Yukiko; September 11, 1917 - May 11, 1967) was a Japanese actress. <b>Her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> was Tsuruko Nishiyama.

Crake hires her for sexual services and as a teacher to the Crakers, but she [...] secretly becomes Jimmy's lover as well. After the catastrophe, her memory continues to haunt Snowman. Her name is from the oryx, an African antelope: [...] "It's <b>not</b> even <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> which he'd never known anyway; it's only a word. It's a mantra" [...] (p.110). [...] She is described as likely originating from the South or South-East Asian region.|$|R

'He traced her to Plymouth, and set on his spies; {{and they}} found that {{she went to the}} shipping-office, and inquired if Mr. Alwyn Hill had entered his name as {{passenger}} by the Western Glory; and when she found that he had, she booked herself for the same ship, but <b>not</b> in <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name.</b> When the vessel had sailed a letter reached the Duke from her, telling him what she had done.

500|$|Angel is {{the student}} council {{president}} at the afterlife school. This places her {{at odds with the}} SSS as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and other disruptive activities that the team does. The SSS initially calls her [...] "Angel" [...] since they do <b>not</b> know <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but they still refer to her by it even after finding out <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> to be Kanade Tachibana. It is difficult to understand what she is thinking due to her rarely showing any outward emotions and her way of talking bluntly. She is personally dedicated to helping others overcome their regrets and pass on. However, she often lacks a proper understanding of others, as she never thinks to try to explain to the SSS why she was doing what she did. She enjoys eating mapo doufu, a spicy dish.|$|R

2500|$|In 2003, Iranian {{expatriate}} Azar Nafisi {{published the}} memoir Reading Lolita in Tehran about a covert women's reading group. In an NPR interview Nafisi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of Dolores/Lolita's character. She notes [...] "Because <b>her</b> <b>name</b> is <b>not</b> Lolita, <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> is Dolores which {{as you know}} in Latin means dolour, so <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence, while Lolita becomes a sort of light-headed, seductive, and airy name. The Lolita of our novel is both of these {{at the same time}} and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect of that little girl and the crassest interpretation of her." [...] Following Nafisi's comments, the NPR interviewer, Madeleine Brand, lists as embodiments of the latter side of Lolita, [...] "the Long Island Lolita, Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita".|$|R
5000|$|As a child Masuda {{lived as}} a nurse-maid {{in a large}} farming {{household}} near Shiojiri, where she got little to eat, no education, poor sleeping quarters, and was frequently punished. She initially {{spent most of her}} time looking after the owners' young children but, after being caught taking extra melons from the field to feed herself, she was forced to do manual labor. During these years other children gave her the derisive nickname [...] "Crane", as in the winter she was never allowed to wear socks and would lift one leg up and warm her foot on the thigh of the other leg. This nickname was used even when she started as a novice geisha. She did <b>not</b> learn <b>her</b> <b>real</b> <b>name</b> until she was hospitalized at the age of 12 and the doctors called her Ms. Masuda.|$|R
