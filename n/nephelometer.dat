25|$|The {{irradiation}} process adopted involves pumping {{of surface}} water through irradiation chambers fitted on the boat, removal of organic material such as litter of leaves, and then subjecting the water surface to the UV irradiation. A <b>nephelometer</b> {{installed at the}} treatment facility provides feedback on the bloom density for adjustment of exposure time to UV radiation. The entire process takes about 5 hours and a success rate of 99% removal of the algae is reported, killing all cells over an initial treatment of two days. Unlike other methods of treatment, no chemical contamination is produced in the UV radiation process.|$|E
25|$|In the {{investigations}} on radiant heat in air {{it had been}} necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed. A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the <b>nephelometer</b> and similar instruments that show properties of aerosols and colloids through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, {{the result is the}} ultramicroscope, which was developed later by others).|$|E

Different models of <b>nephelometers</b> {{have been used for}} decades for monitoring and research applications. Now, a series of <b>nephelometers</b> (Ecotech models M 9003, Aurora 1000 and Aurora 3000) with newly designed light sources based on light emitting diodes are available. This article reports on the design of these integrating <b>nephelometers</b> and a comparison of the Aurora 3000 to another commercial instrument (TSI model 3563) that uses an incandescent lamp. Both instruments are three-wavelength, total and backscatter integrating <b>nephelometers.</b> We present a characterization of the new light source design of the Aurora 3000 and provide parameterizations for its angular sensitivity functions. These parameterizations facilitate to correct for measurement artefacts using Mie-theory. Comparison measurements against the TSI 3563 with laboratory generated white particles and ambient air are shown and discussed. Both instruments agree well within the calibration uncertainties and detection limit for total scattering with differences less than 5 %. Differences for backscattering are higher by up to 11 %. Highest differences were found for the longest wavelengths, where the signal to noise ratio is lowest. Differences at the blue and green wavelengths are less than 4 % and 3 %, respectively, for both total and backscattering...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>nephelometer</b> [...] is an {{instrument}} for measuring concentration of suspended particulates in a liquid or gas colloid. A <b>nephelometer</b> measures suspended particulates by employing a light beam (source beam) and a light detector set to one side (often 90Â°) of the source beam. Particle density is then {{a function of the}} light reflected into the detector from the particles. To some extent, how much light reflects for a given density of particles is dependent upon properties of the particles such as their shape, color, and reflectivity. Nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate, then use environmental factors (k-factors) to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly. K-factor is determined by the user by running the <b>nephelometer</b> next to an air sampling pump and comparing results. There is a wide variety of research-grade nephelometers on the market as well as open source varieties.|$|E

After selecting a sample site {{to carry out}} research, the CSIRO suggested that the <b>nephelometer</b> should be used as the benchmark for the APO fire tests. This was installed to monitor smoke levels within the return-air ducts of the mechanical ventilation system, utilising a chart-recorder output display.|$|E

In the first category we review: (1) the Mueller algebra and Stokes vectors, (2) approximations for the single scattering properties of various aerosols, (3) the information content of the Mueller or scattering matrix and related limitations of lidar measurements, and (4) the effects of multiple scattering on lidar returns. In the second category we review: (1) polar <b>nephelometers,</b> (2) calibration procedures for <b>nephelometers,</b> and (3) characterization of the scattering medium.

50|$|The {{propensity}} of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them {{is now considered}} a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a <b>nephelometer</b> with the detector set up {{to the side of}} the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are lots of small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated <b>nephelometer</b> are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation.|$|E
