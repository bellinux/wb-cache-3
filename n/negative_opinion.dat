5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or <b>negative</b> <b>opinion.</b> Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E
5|$|Before {{researchers}} took active {{interest in}} it, {{the field of}} 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian Charles Burney had a <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> towards British vocal music in this period. That attitude was carried through {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, where in the first edition of the Oxford History of Music, Hubert Parry stated that English composers' sense of musical line was deficient.|$|E
50|$|Reputation {{management}} {{is the process}} of tracking actions and opinions, looking for positive and <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> about any particular service or product, and removing <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> (if any) and converting them into positive ones. It is important, however, not to attack or try to obscure <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> through devious means, as this is likely to have an overall negative effect on the brand. A better strategy is to respond to complaints with information and an apologetic attitude, cultivating later positive reviews.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{to what extent}} the influence of the opinion of third parties can predict a divorce. The third parties included the family, friends, neighbors and the church. This paper uses data on 551 married and 1795 divorced persons to answer this question. The data includes information about <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> of the third parties. Logistic regression analyses show that <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> of family members and friends increase the chance that someone will divorce. <b>Negative</b> <b>opinions</b> of neighbors and the church have no influence, although the norm of the church decreases the chance to divorce...|$|R

5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the law's passage, polling {{indicated}} the public's views became increasingly negative {{in reaction to}} specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010. Polling statistics showed a general <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> of the law; with those in favor at approximately 40% and those against at 51%, as of October 2013. About 29% of whites approve of the law, compared with 61% of Hispanics and 91% of African Americans. Opinions were divided by age of the person at the law's inception, with a solid majority of seniors opposing the bill and a solid majority of those younger than forty years old in favor.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|Journalists {{noted that}} many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> of the game, {{believed}} to be tied to the minimal impact on Portal 2s release time. These users cited complaints about the game being too short (with some saying it is only four hours long), the existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions, and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version. Journalists have defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co-op mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E

30|$|Critics of Islam often frame anti-Islamic {{positions}} {{as a defense}} of tolerance against intolerance, and of equality against inequality. Islam, for this perspective, poses challenges for the ideological integration of Muslim immigrants in Western societies. This paper examines Canadian Muslims’ opinions about same-sex marriage. The analysis suggests that Canadian Muslims, as a group, do have distinctively <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> about same-sex marriage, but that there is substantial and systematic variation in opinions about this issue within the Muslim-Canadian community. Indeed, it is religiosity in general, rather than Islam in particular, that generates <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> about gay marriage. Exposure to the Canadian context, and especially postsecondary education, largely undoes the distinctiveness of Canadian Muslims’ opinions about this issue.|$|R
25|$|By {{the twentieth}} century, Buddhism had {{penetrated}} {{deeply into the}} culture of Mongolia, and the populace willingly supported the lamas and the monasteries. Foreign observers usually had a <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> of Mongolian monks, condemning them as lazy, ignorant, corrupt, and debauched, but the Mongolian people did not concur. Ordinary Mongolians apparently combined a cynical and realistic anticlericalism, sensitive to the faults and the human fallibility of individual monks or groups of monks, with a deep and unwavering concern for the transcendent values of the church.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{the review}} in the Australian version of GamePro voiced a <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> on the game, giving Supreme Commander a rating of five out of ten. GamePro {{assessed}} Supreme Commander as an over-ambitious game, with performance (measured in frames per second), even on high end systems, as a major negative point. The reviewers observed that the game gradually slowed down while playing, and that this process accelerated when using the 'shift' key view. This review was subject to controversy, resulting in two rating compiling websites, Metacritic and GameRankings, removing it from their websites.|$|E
25|$|During {{these early}} years, Munch experimented with many styles, {{including}} Naturalism and Impressionism. Some early works {{are reminiscent of}} Manet. Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses. At one point, however, Munch's father, perhaps swayed by the <b>negative</b> <b>opinion</b> of Munch's cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.|$|E
50|$|Social tuning has resounding {{influences}} {{on both the}} memory and cognition of those affected by this process. Though social tuning could potentially aid memory and cognition should {{the views of the}} other person be correct, this phenomenon could also impede memory and cause incorrect cognition. For example, if an individual seeks a relationship with another individual who holds <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> about homosexuality, the first individual could be at risk for mirroring those <b>negative</b> <b>opinions</b> in order to be liked by the second individual. Such phenomenon can be harmful, in that they can cause people to hold opinions on subjects that are not based on concrete information, but on the opinions of others.|$|R
