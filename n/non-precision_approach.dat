25|$|Approaching , the {{navigator}} {{began calling}} out the radar altimeter's reading. This is not standard practice for a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach,</b> as the radar altimeter {{does not take}} into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the pressure altimeter, which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among these}} {{differences}} was {{a conclusion that}} the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and furthermore the crew {{did not want to}} land and after reaching 100m altitude (measured by radio altimeter) and had decided to go around using the autopilot. However, it was impossible for the autopilot installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach.</b> The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash.|$|E
50|$|The use of GNSS in {{aircraft}} {{is becoming}} increasingly common. GNSS provides very precise aircraft position, altitude, heading and ground speed information. GNSS makes navigation precision once reserved to large RNAV-equipped aircraft available to the GA pilot. Recently, more and more airports include GNSS instrument approaches. GNSS approaches consist of either overlays to existing <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> or stand-alone GNSS <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|R

25|$|Aero Flight 217 (AY217) was a {{domestic}} passenger flight from Helsinki to Mariehamn in the autonomous {{territory of the}} Åland Islands, operated by the Finnish flag carrier Aero O/Y (since 1968 also officially known as Finnair). On 8 November 1963, the aircraft serving the flight crashed in poor visibility while attempting to land on a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> at Mariehamn Airport in the municipality of Jomala.

2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the captain’s failure to adequately brief and execute the <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> and the first officer’s and flight engineer’s failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain’s execution of the approach.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} crashed {{at about}} 04:47local time (CDT, 09:47UTC) while making a localizer <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> to runway 18 at Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of head-up displays (HUD) in civil transport approach and landing operations, an operational evaluation was conducted on the flight simulator for advanced aircraft at Ames. A non-conformal HUD concept which contained raw data and Flight Director command information, and a conformal, flight path HUD concept was designed to permit terminal area maneuvering, intercept, final approach, flare, and landing operations. Twelve B- 727 line pilots (Captains) flew a series of precision and <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> under a variety of environmental and operational conditions, including wind shear, turbulence and low ceilings and visibilities. A preliminary comparison of various system and pilot performance measures as a function of display type (Flight Director HUD, Flight Path HUD, or No HUD) indicates improvements in precision and accuracy of aircraft flight path control when using the HUDs. The results also demonstrated some potentially unique advantages of a flight path HUD during <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches...</b>|$|R

40|$|As Europe {{explores the}} future role of Loran-C, the {{question}} has been raised of whether Loran can form a stand-alone alternative to satellite navigation as a Basic Area Navigation system for aircraft flying under the Instrument Flight Rules. The leading alternative to GNSS {{in the view of}} many airlines is DME (Distance Measuring Equipment). But General Aviation interests are promoting Loran as both a more economical solution and a more suitable one for flight at low level. A key question within this context is whether Loran is capable of supporting <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> (NPAs) ? Given that Loran NPAs were approved in the USA many years ago, this question may appear superfluous. Nevertheless, the NPA programme there ran into difficulties, some of which are only now being addressed by the FAA. Further, we have a much more sophisticated understanding than previously of what are commonly the largest position error components, Additional Secondary Factors (ASFs). Thus, revisiting the issue is fully justified. The paper concentrates on the accuracy of Loran-C under the special conditions of <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> to multiple runways of airports.
