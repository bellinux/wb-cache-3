5|$|An extra in the film, Tyler Nelson, {{violated}} his <b>nondisclosure</b> {{agreement in}} an interview with The Edmond Sun on September 17, 2007, which was then picked up by the mainstream media. It is unknown if he remained in the final cut. At Nelson's request, The Edmond Sun subsequently pulled the story from its website. On October 2, 2007, a Superior Court order was filed finding that Nelson knowingly violated the agreement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the film's production budget were also stolen from Spielberg's production office. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department set up a sting operation after being alerted by a webmaster that the thief might try to sell the photos. On October 4, 2007, the seller, 37-year-old Roderick Eric Davis, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.|$|E

40|$|A sender who has disclosable {{information}} with probability {{less than one}} may partially conceal bad news by choosing to withhold information and pooling with uninformed types. The success of this strategy depends on receivers' beliefs about {{the probability that the}} sender has disclosable news. In a dynamic context, informed senders try to cultivate a reputation for reticence either by concealing good news along with the bad, or by concealing some good news and disclosing some bad news. A reputation for reticence is valuable because it makes receivers less skeptical of past or future <b>nondisclosures.</b> The model provides insight into the choice by firms such as Google not to disclose quarterly earnings guidance to analysts, as well as Tony Blair's reticence over his son's vaccine record during the measles–mumps–rubella scare in the United Kingdom.

40|$|Employers 2 ̆ 7 lies, misrepresentations, and <b>nondisclosures</b> about workers 2 ̆ 7 {{legal rights}} and other working {{conditions}} can skew {{and sometimes even}} coerce workers 2 ̆ 7 important life decisions as well as frustrate key workplace protections. Federal, state, and local governments have long sought to address these substantial harms by prohibiting employers from misrepresenting workers 2 ̆ 7 rights or other working conditions {{as well as by}} requiring employers to disclose truthful information about these matters. These governmental efforts, however, are now increasingly vulnerable to constitutional attack in light of the recent antiregulatory turn in First Amendment law, in which corporate and other commercial entities seek [...] with growing success [...] to insulate their speech from regulation in various settings. This Article examines this trend 2 ̆ 7 s significant but underexplored implications for the workplace, exploring how First Amendment law now may be changing in ways that undercut the government 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to inform and empower workers by casting doubt on its ability to require truth or prohibit lies in certain contexts. It then considers the circumstances under which we should instead understand the First Amendment to permit the government to require employers to tell the truth about workers 2 ̆ 7 legal rights and other working conditions. To this end, this Article draws from First Amendment theory and doctrine in other settings in which listeners have less information or power than speakers, and thus where governmental efforts to inform and empower listeners by prohibiting lies and requiring truthful disclosures can improve the communicative discourse. The Article then explains how employer speech similarly occurs within a communicative relationship riddled by information and power asymmetries: employers not only control workers 2 ̆ 7 economic livelihood but they also know more than workers about the terms and conditions of employment, about industry and economic projections, and [...] as repeat players with greater resources [...] about available legal protections. The Article thus urges a First Amendment theory of employer speech that addresses these dynamics by treating workers 2 ̆ 7 interests as listeners as paramount. Because these interests are frustrated by employers 2 ̆ 7 lies and <b>nondisclosures,</b> it concludes that the First Amendment should be understood to permit government to require employers to disclose objectively verifiable information about workers 2 ̆ 7 rights and other working conditions as well as to prohibit employer lies or misrepresentations about these matters that threaten to coerce or manipulate workers 2 ̆ 7 choices...|$|R

25|$|A {{company that}} hires {{researchers}} {{to perform a}} study may require the researchers to sign a <b>nondisclosure</b> agreement before they are funded, by which researchers waive their right to release any results independently and release them only to the sponsor. The sponsor may fund several studies at the same time, suppressing results found contrary to their business interests while publicizing the results that support their interests. Indeed, a review of pharmaceutical studies revealed that research funded by drug companies was {{less likely to be}} published, but the drug-company-funded research that was published was more likely to report outcomes favorable to the sponsor.|$|E
40|$|Several {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} correspondence between self-reports and the delayed identity match-to-sample performance they supposedly described. The present two experiments used similar procedures to explore different characteristics of the self-reports. In both studies, match-to-sample responses were successful (earned points) if they were both correct and faster than a time limit. Following each response, a computer-presented query asked whether the response had been successful, and subjects replied by pressing a “Yes” or “No” button. Experiment 1 analyzed self-report latencies from a previously-published study (Critchfield, 1993 a). Latencies generally were longer for self-reports of failure than for self-reports of success. In Experiment 1, a “Yes” or “No” self-report was required to advance the session. In Experiment 2, self-reports were optional. In addition to “Yes” and “No” buttons, subjects could press a third button (a “nondisclosure” option) to remove the self-report query without providing a “Yes” or “No” answer. Across a range of conditions, <b>nondisclosures</b> always occurred more frequently after match-to-sample failures than after successes (i. e., under conditions in which a self-report of failure would be appropriate). The effects observed in the two experiments are consistent with a history of differential punishment for uncomplimentary self-reports, which casual observation and some descriptive studies suggest is a common experience in United States culture. The research necessary to explore this notion should produce data that are of interest to psychologists both within and outside of Behavior Analysis...|$|R

500|$|Humphrey Rang of the British Pharmacological Society {{wrote that}} Goldacre had chosen his target well and had {{produced}} some shocking examples of secrecy and dishonesty, particularly the <b>nondisclosure</b> {{of data on}} the antidepressant reboxetine (chapter one), in which only one trial out of seven was published (the published study showed positive results, while the unpublished trials suggested otherwise). He argued that Goldacre had gone [...] "over the top" [...] in devoting a whole chapter (chapter five) to recommending large clinical trials using electronic patient data from general practitioners, without fully pointing out how problematic these can be; such trials raise issues, for example, about informed consent and regulatory oversight.

500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the <b>nondisclosure</b> agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|E
