The Ministry of Aviation also opened the <b>Navaid</b> training school on part of the site. The GPO had blocks built in the south-east area of the site, and other blocks were adapted from their original conditions for new uses. The CTS division of GCHQ remained on the site within Blocks C and D until 1987. Aerial masts which had been erected by the division became unusable after the nearby train line was electrified, and were removed the year CTS left.|$|E
5|$|After the Partition of India, Dani {{migrated}} to East Pakistan. There, in 1947–49 {{he worked as}} Assistant Superintendent of the Department of Archaeology. At this time, he renovated the Verandra Museum at Rajshahi. In 1949, he married Safiya Sultana. Together, they had three sons (Anis, <b>Navaid</b> and Junaid) and a daughter (Fauzia). In 1950, Dani was promoted {{to the position of}} Superintendent-in-Charge of Archaeology. In the same year, he became General Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Pakistan in Dhaka. Later on, in 1955, he took the position of President of the National Committee for Museums in Pakistan. For a period of twelve years (1950–62), Dani remained Associate Professor of History at the University of Dhaka {{while at the same time}} working as curator at the Dhaka Museum. During this period, he carried out archaeological research on the Muslim history of Bengal.|$|E

The Falcons were sold to the RNoAF, the last being handed over in 1978, although FOF retained a contract to conduct heavy maintenance on them. The Electras were mostly used for charter flights for SAS, although they were also used to an extent on charter flights, particularly hauling of flowers from Genova and flights to Greenland. SAS gradually established its own network of cargo routes, reducing the amount subcontracted to Fred. Olsen. In the end SAS launched the Air de Cologne (AdC) concept, and one of Fred. Olsen's aircraft were painted in the black livery. SAS discontinued its freight-only flights in 1988, and FOS lost most of its business. AdC was sold to TNT, and FOF was able to secure freight contracts with it and KLM.|$|E

2500|$|Sixteen JetStars were {{produced}} for the USAF; Five C-140As were flight inspection aircraft for the Air Force Communications Service and {{were used to}} perform airborne testing of airport navigational aids (navaids) from 1962 onwards. They began service during the Vietnam War and remained in service until the early 1990s. The [...] "Flight Check" [...] C-140As were combat-coded aircraft that could be distinguished from the VIP transport version by their distinctive paint scheme. The C-140As were deployed to southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, where, {{in addition to their}} more usual <b>navaid</b> testing, they would loiter off the coast and act as communications relays between the Pentagon and the battlefield.

2500|$|The 200 series {{proved so}} popular that Beechcraft began work on a successor, with the Beechcraft {{designation}} Model 300 and marketed as the [...] "Super King Air 300". The B200's airframe was [...] "cleaned up" [...] and even more powerful engines (PT6A-60A, rated at 1050 shp) installed in redesigned cowlings (known as [...] "pitot cowlings" [...] due to the reshaped engine air intakes), with MTOW increased to 14,000lb (6,300kg). A Model 200 (c/no. BB-343) was modified to develop the updated systems to be used on the new model and flew in this configuration on October 6, 1981. The first flight of the prototype Model 300 took place on September 3, 1983 and deliveries commenced the following year. Because not all nations would then allow an aircraft of this type to be certified at an MTOW greater than 12,500lb (5,700kg), the Model 300LW was also developed at the same time, limited to the lower MTOW. Nineteen examples of a special version of the Model 300 were delivered to the FAA in 1987 and 1988. The first two were conversions of standard Model 300s, while the remaining 17 were purpose-built; since they were delivered the FAA has used the fleet to check the extensive network of navaids in the United States. 200 and 300 Series King Airs {{have been used for}} similar duties in several other countries, including Australia, Germany, Hong Kong (a B200C used for <b>navaid</b> calibration was the first aircraft to land at the then-new Chek Lap Kok Airport in 1996), Norway, Sweden and Taiwan.|$|E

40|$|Interference {{that causes}} partial loss of {{intelligence}} in air navigation signal is largely {{dependent on the}} environment around radio navigation aids (<b>navaids).</b> Buildings around airports have been restricted partly because they pose a technical threat to flight navigation. Previous {{studies have shown that}} about 50 % of air accidents occur during landing. However no data has been availed to determine the contribution of <b>navaids</b> to these accidents. The purpose of this paper was {{to determine the effects of}} roofing materials on air navigation signal strength. Radio transmitters, receivers and computers were used in a laboratory to measure signal level transmitted through six different roofing materials at a frequency of 9. 4 GHz. Decra offered the highest attenuation whereby 90 % of the signal propagated was lost, out of which 60 % was due to reflection. The equivalent transmission path field strength was 57 dBmV/M against an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommended minimum specification of minus 28 dBmV/M. Similarly decra exhibited desired-to-undesired signal ratio of minus 16 dB against ICAO recommended value of 20 dB. Highest and lowest reflections occurred at angles of incidence of 90 and 135 degrees respectively. Generally roofing materials had little effect on <b>navaids</b> signal strength in the transmission paths but had significant effect in the reflection paths. Highl...|$|R
