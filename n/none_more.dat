5|$|At {{the start}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, there were over 850 monasteries, nunneries and friaries in England. By 1541, there were <b>none.</b> <b>More</b> than 15,000 monks and nuns had been {{dispersed}} and the buildings had been seized by the Crown to be sold off or leased to new lay occupiers. Glastonbury Abbey was reviewed as having significant amounts of silver and gold as well as its attached lands. In September 1539, the abbey was visited by Richard Layton, Richard Pollard and Thomas Moyle, who arrived there without warning on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. The abbey was stripped of its valuables and Abbot Richard Whiting (Whyting), who had been a signatory to the Act of Supremacy that made Henry VIII the head of the church, resisted and was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor on 15 November 1539.|$|E
5|$|With the Viet Cong line of {{withdrawal}} carrying them past the Australian position, heavy fire was maintained on them as they attempted a partial retreat, resulting in further casualties. However, as daybreak neared the Viet Cong lingered, unwilling to commit to an all-out attack, but also unwilling to completely withdraw. Finally, the main Viet Cong attack began at 05:30. Earlier losses had been heavy, though, and {{they were unable to}} concentrate in sufficient numbers to mount a massed assault. Instead only a series of disjointed attacks followed, <b>none</b> <b>more</b> than 40 men strong. By 06:45 these attacks had been repelled by the Americans and the Viet Cong withdrew before dawn, avoiding the arrival of additional American air support.|$|E

25|$|As the 1860s progressed, Rossetti {{would become}} the grand prince of bohemianism as his {{deviations}} from normal standards became more audacious. And as he became this epitome of the unconventional, his egocentric demands necessarily required his close friends to remodel their own lives around him. His bohemianism was like a web in which others became trapped – <b>none</b> <b>more</b> so than William and Jane Morris.|$|E

25|$|Highlanders {{had never}} before been known to combine together, but Montrose knew that many of the West Highland clans, who were largely Catholic, detested Argyll and his Campbell clansmen, and <b>none</b> <b>more</b> so than the MacDonalds who with many of the other clans rallied to his summons. The Royalist allied Irish Confederates sent 2000 disciplined Irish {{soldiers}} led by Alasdair MacColla across the sea to assist him. The Irish proved to be formidable fighters.|$|E
25|$|His {{talent was}} first {{recognised}} in 1967 {{with members of}} the England under 25 team stating that he was the best keeper {{to come out of the}} South Asia. It was in England where he made his Test debut, with Colin Milburn being his first dismissal. With the bat he managed 15.88 per innings in his career. There were <b>none</b> <b>more</b> famous than his unbeaten 60 from number 11, in which he made a last wicket partnership of 133 with Wasim Raja.|$|E
25|$|Burbank has a rich {{cinematic}} history. Hundreds {{of major}} feature films have filmed in Burbank over the years, but perhaps <b>none</b> <b>more</b> famous than Casablanca (1942), starring Humphrey Bogart. The movie began production {{a few months}} after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Due to World War II, location shooting was restricted and filming near airports was banned. As a result, Casablanca shot most of its major scenes on Stage 1 at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, including the film's famous airport scene. It featured a foggy Moroccan runway created on the stage where Bogart's character doesn't fly away with Ingrid Bergman. Bonnie and Clyde (1967) was also filmed at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, Cook {{returned}} to the Ministry of Defence as one of two deputies to the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, Sir Solly Zuckerman, the other being Alan Cottrell. This was a turbulent time for the Ministry of Defence, with tight budgetary constraints leading to heated debates over procurement of new weapons systems, <b>none</b> <b>more</b> so than the BAC TSR-2, which was eventually cancelled. Cook was involved in negotiations with the French, and later German and Italian governments, to build a replacement, which eventually saw service with the RAF as the Panavia Tornado. He also managed to salvage a troubled project known as PT428, which became the Rapier surface-to-air missile.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{elements}} that are common across many virtual airlines but <b>none</b> <b>more</b> so than a website as {{the focal point of}} the community, typically including an Internet forum where discussion and social interaction can occur. Sometimes the community is solely based on an internet forum that is part of a flight simulation forum in general, such as Flightsim.com. From the early 21st century it became more common for virtual airlines to feature an Online database for recording and reporting flights and membership statistics. This functionality has steadily expanded in line with that of other virtual communities such as gaming clans. Flight simulation, and virtual airlines in particular, have been reported as an early adopter of new web technologies.|$|E
25|$|Through the decades, certain {{players have}} tended to {{dominate}} the game, but <b>none</b> <b>more</b> than its original star player, Joe Davis. Davis was world champion for twenty years, retiring unbeaten after claiming his fifteenth world title in 1946 when the tournament was reinstated after the Second World War. Davis was unbeaten in world championship play, and was only ever beaten four times in his entire life, with all four defeats coming after his world championship retirement and inflicted by his own brother Fred. He did lose matches in handicapped tournaments, but on level terms these four defeats were the only losses of his entire career. He was also world billiards champion. It is regarded as highly unlikely that anyone will ever dominate the game to his level again.|$|E

25|$|Although {{his overall}} Test batting record was modest, he played some {{important}} innings, <b>none</b> <b>more</b> so than his 76 during a seventh-wicket partnership of 221 {{in less than}} 3 hours with Denis Lindsay in the First Test at Johannesburg in 1966–67. When the two came together South Africa was six wickets down and 223 runs ahead and the match was evenly poised; when the partnership ended, South Africa's lead was virtually unassailable. In the Third Test of the same series another partnership with Lindsay took South Africa from 94 for 6 in the first innings to 197 for 7; van der Merwe scored 42, and again led South Africa to victory. In the Second Test in 1965 a partnership of 98 with Graeme Pollock rescued South Africa in the first innings from 80 for 5; van der Merwe made 38, and South Africa won the match by 94 runs.|$|E
25|$|The Hearst news empire {{reached a}} revenue peak about 1928, but the {{economic}} {{collapse of the}} Great Depression in the United States and the vast over-extension of his empire cost him control of his holdings. It {{is unlikely that the}} newspapers ever paid their own way; mining, ranching and forestry provided whatever dividends the Hearst Corporation paid out. When the collapse came, all Hearst properties were hit hard, but <b>none</b> <b>more</b> so than the papers; Furthermore, his now-conservative politics, increasingly at odds with those of his readers, only worsened matters for the once great Hearst media chain. Having been refused the right to sell another round of bonds to unsuspecting investors, the shaky empire tottered. Unable to service its existing debts, Hearst Corporation faced a court-mandated reorganization in 1937. From that point, Hearst was reduced to being merely another employee, subject to the directives of an outside manager. Newspapers and other properties were liquidated, the film company shut down; there was even a well-publicized sale of art and antiquities. While World War II restored circulation and advertising revenues, his great days were over. The Hearst Corporation continues to this day as a large, privately held media conglomerate based in New York City.|$|E
