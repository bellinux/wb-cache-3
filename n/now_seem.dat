25|$|Likewise, {{scholars}} have posited various mechanisms other than massive demographic change by which pre-migration Celtic place-names {{could have been}} lost. Scholars have stressed that Welsh and Cornish place-names from the Roman period seem {{no more likely to}} survive than English ones: 'clearly name loss was a Romano-British phenomenon, not just one associated with Anglo-Saxon incomers'. Other explanations for the replacement of Roman period place-names include adaptation of Celtic names such that they <b>now</b> <b>seem</b> to come from Old English; a more gradual loss of Celtic names than was once assumed; and new names being coined (in the newly dominant English language) because instability of settlements and land-tenure.|$|E
25|$|Nueva Trova, {{initially}} so popular, {{was dealt}} a blow {{by the fall}} of the Soviet Union, though it was already fading. It suffered inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences round the world have had their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so relevant in the 1960s and 70s <b>now</b> <b>seem</b> dry and passé; once a theme is no longer topical, the piece rests solely on its musical quality. Those pieces of high musical and lyrical quality, amongst which Puebla's Hasta siempre stands out, will probably last as long as Cuba lasts.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas of}} {{suitable}} temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This {{is the reason}} why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques <b>now</b> <b>seem</b> to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as Varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, {{it is possible that the}} Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.|$|E

500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and <b>now</b> <b>seem</b> less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E

In his Harrison obituary for Salon.com, in December 2001, Ira Robbins considered [...] "Within You Without You" [...] to be [...] "the song that most clearly articulated his devotion, both artistic and philosophical, to India", with a lyric that [...] "pairs worldview and personality in lines that <b>now</b> <b>seem</b> prophetic".|$|E

500|$|Before {{the twenty-first}} century, the Benedictine reform {{dominated}} history textbooks of the period, and the earlier tenth century and later eleventh received far less attention. According to Wormald: [...] "For English historians, the tenth century is above all one of [...] "Reformation", {{the enforcement of}} Benedictine observance upon the religious life". The main sources for the reform are the lives of Dunstan, Oswald and Æthelwold, and this creates the risk of exaggerating the role of these three men {{at the expense of}} the many lesser-known men who contributed to the process, and on concentrating on reformed communities at the expense of less rigorous and secular ones. The picture drawn of the reform by Æthelwold and his circle has been dominant, and historians have generally portrayed it favourably. In 2005 John Blair commented: [...] "Ecclesiastical historians' distaste for the lifestyle of secular ministers, which has become less explicit but can even <b>now</b> <b>seem</b> virtually instinctive, reflects contemporary partisanship absorbed into a historiographical tradition which has privileged the centre over the localities, and the ideals of the reformers over the realities and needs of grass-roots religious life." [...] In the twenty-first century, historians have been far more sceptical of the reformers' claims, and defended the contribution of the clerics and local churches.|$|E
500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details <b>now</b> <b>seem</b> discredited.|$|E

The blurb called Pearl Jam [...] "the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last." [...] Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam [...] "toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, [...] true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2." ...|$|E
