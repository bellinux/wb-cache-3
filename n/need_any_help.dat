2500|$|Benny made a cameo {{appearance}} in It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. [...] When {{some of the}} characters are arguing {{at the side of}} the road, Benny pulls up in his car and considerately asks, [...] "Trouble? [...] Having any trouble?", to which the character played by Ethel Merman yells, [...] "Yes, and we don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> from you!"

2500|$|On July 14, 1958, the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq {{was overthrown}} by a {{military}} coup d'état. Fearing {{that he would be}} next, Lebanese president Camille Chamoun appealed for American military aid within 48 hours to settle domestic unrest in his own country, invoking the Eisenhower Doctrine, which stated that the United States would intervene upon request to stabilize countries threatened by international communism. Holloway, who happened to be serving on a Selection Board in Washington at the time, promptly met with Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh A. Burke, who warned that a deployment order was imminent but that commitments in East Asia precluded any reinforcements from the Seventh Fleet. Retorted Holloway, [...] "I don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> I can take over all of the Lebanon if you say the word." [...] As one of Burke's few remaining peers in the Navy, Holloway took the opportunity to tease the CNO. [...] "But I've already had another proposition....From some Britisher. He thinks, if there's action, I should go up and take the port of Tripoli to protect their oil installations there." [...] The famously mercurial Burke cursed him out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, tut!" [...] {{said the}} Major. [...] "We'll have old {{soldiers}} and good ones against us. Come {{to me if}} you <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help,</b> you two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't likely they're <b>needing</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> Those on {{the vessel}} outnumber the Abenakis three to one, and I'm afraid they won't {{have any trouble}} in taking care of themselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, they bury Karis and Hercules tells Deon {{if he ever}} <b>needs</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> {{or someone}} to talk to he will be there. Deon thanks him and Cyrene asks if he will be coming back for the wedding, Hercules says [...] "I wouldn't miss it." ...|$|R
50|$|In February 2010, {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} Paterson administration {{may have been involved}} in witness tampering in a domestic abuse case involving staffer David W. Johnson after New York State Police and his staffers talked to the woman to get her to drop the case. Paterson was said to have asked the woman personally if she <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> a day before the case was dropped.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm all dressed, so I don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> I {{hope that}} is good and strong," [...] added Rose, eyeing the {{steaming}} cup with an eager look.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help,</b> if 'twa'n't {{for these}} bundles an' things. I guess I'll jest leave some of 'em here an'- Here! {{take one of}} these apples. I brought 'em from Lizy Jane's suller, back to Yaark State." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle {{can show}} you how to do that if you <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> He has been so {{successful}} in his first attempt, I fancy you won't require much," [...] said Mac, picking up the spools for the sixth time.|$|E
50|$|Police Lt. Ray Bozeman (Michael Paré), Sergeant Powers (Daniel Sunjata), and Detective Erica Lonsdale (Katherine Moennig) dismiss her claims, {{trying to}} look for any other excuse for Molly to be missing, believing that it's all in Jill's head. The department's newest {{homicide}} detective, Peter Hood (Wes Bentley), tells her that he believes her, giving Jill his card in case she <b>needs</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> about the case.|$|R
50|$|Betty finds {{work at a}} swank restaurant. Soon {{the mysterious}} man shows up and invites Betty to his table. She becomes uncomfortable with the {{stranger}} and is relieved when her boyfriend once again arrives. The mysterious man leaves after handing her a note that advises her to call him if she ever <b>needs</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> The boyfriend openly disapproves of Betty's job. He leaves after a still angry Betty dances wildly to provoke him.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Child Helpline International founder Jeroo Billimoria {{worked closely}} with street {{children}} in India as a social worker. She gave the children her telephone number {{and told them to}} call if they <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help,</b> after which she received a large volume of contacts. Billimoria realised that these children needed someone to speak to and assist them. The idea of a toll-free number emerged and she set up Childline India - India's first and only child helpline.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] she said, [...] "I don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> You {{must come}} again soon and see us, {{and show that}} you've {{forgotten}} what I've said." [...] She gave me her hand, and I could not help bending over it and kissing it. She gave a little, pathetic whimper. [...] "Oh, I know I've said the most dreadful things to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I am {{grateful}} for your offer of assistance; but even that is no salve to wounded pride. For that matter, {{it is no more}} than one white man should expect from another. Shipwrecked mariners are always helped along their way. Only this particular mariner doesn't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> Furthermore, this mariner is not going to Sydney, thank you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} that would do very well; {{they would not be}} likely to notice him very particularly, and {{probably}} the General would not have spoken at all. He would just have seen his friend sign the deed, and then have affixed his own signature as a witness. Well, everything seems in your favor, and should you <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> you can rely upon me." ...|$|E
2500|$|I'm {{sorry for}} whom I hurt , {{but the truth}} is...I did my job, in a {{roundabout}} way. I got people, in a way, really hyperventilating about a band that's been dormant for nearly a decade. In the terms of underground music...that's nearly impossible, with so many bands worthy of attention falling {{on and off the}} radar nearly daily. Not that this particular band <b>needs</b> <b>any</b> <b>help,</b> but with years and years of taunting new releases, new music, and then shooting them down, it became a game of [...] "band who cried album." ...|$|R
50|$|His curiosity having {{gotten the}} best of him, Touya ventured ever deeper into {{the ruins of the}} ward, {{eventually}} coming across a man who appeared to be gravely injured. Concerned, Touya rushed to his side, asking if he was okay and if he <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> But as Touya approached, the man suddenly stood up and attacked, screaming, “You’re an enemy!” And in the midst of invisible ringing bells, psychotic strangers, exploding walls of flame, and almost certain death, a small, cute girl with an enormous sword came charging in.|$|R
50|$|When Rajesh gets {{up in the}} morning, Raju {{has bought}} in breakfast. Raju then goes up to patch things up with Sonia, only to witness her trying to make him jealous by flirting with another boy. When he leaves to stop her, he realises the boy she is flirting with is {{actually}} Shera, his good friend. He explains his problem, and that the two actually love each other, so Shera backs off and explains to Raju that if he <b>needs</b> <b>any</b> <b>help,</b> he would be there. He also tells Raju where Vicky always drug deals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, dear; I don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help,</b> for {{our teacher}} is from Paris, {{and of course}} he speaks better French than your uncle." [...] Then she added, with a gesture of her head that set the little bells on her ears to tingling: [...] "How do you like my new ear-rings? Papa gave them to me last week, and {{everyone}} says they are lovely." ...|$|E
6000|$|The instant, however, that I did so {{he became}} calm, and said apologetically, [...] "Forgive me, Doctor. I forgot myself. You do not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> I am so worried {{in my mind}} that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait waistcoat. I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am sure you will understand!" ...|$|E
60|$|As for Zenobia, I saw no {{occasion}} to give myself any trouble. With her native strength, and her {{experience of the}} world, {{she could not be}} supposed to <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> of mine. Nevertheless, I was really generous enough to feel some little interest likewise for Zenobia. With all her faults (which might have been a great many besides the abundance that I knew of), she possessed noble traits, and a heart which must, at least, have been valuable while new. And she seemed ready to fling it away as uncalculatingly as Priscilla herself. I could not but suspect that, if merely at play with Hollingsworth, she was sporting with a power which she did not fully estimate. Or if in earnest, it might chance, between Zenobia's passionate force and his dark, self-delusive egotism, to turn out such earnest as would develop itself in some sufficiently tragic catastrophe, though the dagger and the bowl should go for nothing in it.|$|E
5000|$|I'm {{sorry for}} whom I hurt Fat Wreck Chords, {{but the truth}} is...I did my job, in a {{roundabout}} way.

5000|$|Mackey {{also had}} a close {{friendship}} with a prostitute, Connie Reisler, whom in an unseen story he found [...] "lying in a bathroom {{in a pool of}} bloody crystals," [...] trying to end her pregnancy with drain cleaner and a plunger. He told her if she ever <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> she could call him, and they developed a deep bond. However, Connie was killed in season two, while shacking up with a murderer in a criminal informant assignment. Since her death, Mackey occasionally checks in on her son, Brian, who is in foster care.|$|R
5000|$|After {{three years}} of duty in Mannheim, Moore went to the University of Louisville to work toward a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology. “I {{wanted to work with}} the space program as a human-factors engineer,” says Moore. “After awhile, I {{realized}} that wasn’t what I wanted, so I called up Kim Mohan and asked if he <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> on his staff.” Moore became a regular contributor of articles to Dragon beginning in 1980. He received the Army Commendation Medal and other awards during his five-year tour of duty at Ft. Bragg, N.C. and Mannheim, West Germany.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 the Tennessee Department of Correction banned prison {{visitors}} from wearing thong or g-string underwear. In {{the words of}} Correction Commissioner George Little, prisoners [...] "don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> getting turned on." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 16-18 month-old heifers for {{production}} on great demand from extensive farmers of Spanish continental plains, {{because of their}} good behavior, rusticity and calving facility (97% of the calvings do not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help).</b>|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the procession, which had long since passed from their sight, was {{beginning}} to break up and disperse. A flock of little children first appeared, all of whom went aside to the slaves' quarters except one, who came running up the path between the box- trees. He was the eldest grandson and namesake of the Senator, a dark-eyed, brown-haired boy of seven, with the golden bulla hanging round his neck. Up {{he came to the}} old man's knee, proud to tell how he had scaled every rock, and never <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> from the pedagogue slave who had watched over him.|$|R
50|$|At the admit area Luka hears that Steve {{has been}} brought in to the ER and that Sam is {{treating}} him. He goes {{to see if she}} <b>needs</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> When he gets to the suture room that Steve was being kept in he finds the door locked. He knocks and inside they freeze. He demands to be let in and Mary tells him to wait just a moment. Luka bangs on the door and they let him in. When Luka sees what's going on a struggle ensues. Mary stabs Luka in the back with a syringe full of vecuronium bromide. This causes him to collapse and stop breathing, paralysed.|$|R
5000|$|Deans credits an {{encounter}} {{he had at}} age 12 with a visually impaired woman as his inspiration to create iAid. He noticed that she was struggling {{to cross the street}} and “asked if she <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> and realized that she was visually impaired. I saw that she didn’t have any independence and couldn’t navigate well.” Deans taught himself to code, combining his knowledge of bat echolocation with robotics to create iAid prototypes. In an interview with CTV Canada AM anchor Marci Ien in June 2015, Deans remarked that [...] "nature is an incredible innovator," [...] and aimed to mimic bat echolocation through the development of the iAid.|$|R
50|$|After a big loss to Keflavík in the semi-finals, {{allegations}} rose that Booker had leaked Grindavík's playbook to Keflavík. Both Booker and Keflavík's head coach, Jón Kr. Gíslason, strongly {{denied the}} allegations, with Jón Kr. stating {{that he had}} multiple game tapes of Keflavík and didn't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> in finding their tactics. To further fuel the argument between the two parties, Booker requested that the club payed him bonus for it getting to the quarter finals as was stated in his contract.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{campaign}} for the election in which just under 4,500 people were eligible voters, the education minister Anthony Audoa called on Australia and New Zealand to run the election, as he claimed that his country {{would be unable to}} conduct a free and fair election. [...] However President Gioura said Audoa had no authority to make that call and said that Nauru did not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help</b> in running the election. Audoa had had responsibility for the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust removed by President Gioura and the two men had fallen out as a result.|$|E
50|$|Satsuki is Riku's 15-year-old older half-brother. He is very dimwitted and laid-back, {{but take}} precautionary steps to protect Riku, {{even though the}} current Riku does not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> He is first {{introduced}} trying to sell weird creatures from the Hiyokoya shop, calling them goldfish. Satsuki {{is the only one}} in the shop that does not know how to speak proper Japanese and has to rely on a translating book. He and Shii usually both want to do things, and end up playing rock-paper-scissors to settle it. Shii usually wins. Satsuki is irresponsible, as shown in chapter 2 of the first volume, when he lets the bagworm that he and Riku were transporting get stolen.|$|E
5000|$|Jessica Riehl, {{the retired}} RCMP constable {{who was the}} last person known to have seen Yoshikubo, {{recalled}} how she had considered asking her if she <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> As I drove past her, I thought it might not be the best idea for her being alone." [...] She had considered turning around and going back to offer help, but decided against it. [...] "I thought, it was only 11:30 a.m., she'll be OK ... She looked like she was sightseeing and it was close to zero, it wasn't freezing cold, and her pink coat was knee-length and she had on mitts and a hat—she was dressed for that temperature.|$|R
50|$|Mike tasks Jimmy with {{entering}} Los Pollos Hermanos {{to observe}} the courier when he comes inside. Jimmy tries and fails to act casual while watching the courier. When the courier dispenses with his trash and leaves with the knapsack, Jimmy reaches into the trash bin {{to see if the}} courier stashed anything in there. He is suddenly greeted by Gus Fring, who asks Jimmy if he <b>needs</b> <b>any</b> <b>help.</b> Jimmy pretends he accidentally lost his watch and Gus helps him. After leaving, Jimmy tells Mike that he saw nothing suspicious in the restaurant, much to Mike's frustration. Gus is outside cleaning litter, and looks up knowingly as Jimmy drives away, aware that Mike is onto him.|$|R
