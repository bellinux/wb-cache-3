5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> for existing ensembles. This meant that {{he was free to}} score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

25|$|A {{native of}} London, Margery Winifred Williams {{was born to}} {{successful}} and accomplished parents. The second daughter of a noted barrister and a renowned classical scholar, {{she and her sister}} were encouraged by her father, whom she remembered as a deeply loving and caring parent, to read and use their imaginations. Writing about her childhood many years later, she recalled how vividly her father described characters from various books and the infinite world of knowledge and adventure that lay on the printed page. She noted that the desire to read, which soon transformed into a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write,</b> was a legacy from her father that would be hers for a lifetime.|$|E

25|$|From {{the point}} of view of the author of a routine, raising an {{exception}} is a useful way to signal that a routine could not execute normally - for example, when an input argument is invalid (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function) or when a resource it relies on is unavailable (like a missing file, a hard disk error, or out-of-memory errors). In systems without exceptions, routines would need to return some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated by the semipredicate problem, in which users of the routine <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones.|$|E
25|$|Randel Helms {{argues that}} the books of the Bible were written for and against {{different}} points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write {{because they wanted to}} challenge or correct those who had written before them. So, for example, Paul said that he opposed Peter because he felt that Peter was clearly in the wrong (Galatians 1 and 2). Helms notes that Jeremiah condemned the entire religious establishment, that the prophets and priests were frauds, every one of them (Jeremiah 8:10). Luke felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> another gospel even though other writers had already drawn up their own account of events (Luke 1:1). Luke felt that Mark's gospel was filled with errors and edited it freely, even the words of the dying Christ were not left unaltered.|$|E

500|$|After an {{extensive}} tour in 1996, Björk {{returned to her}} home in Maida Vale with an urgent <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> new songs {{as a form of}} therapy. Björk would let audio engineer Markus Dravs into her home studio to start creating new songs. Björk wanted to create an album with [...] "a simple sound" [...] and [...] "only one flavour". The album began with the working title of Homogeneous, but Björk shortly afterwards changed it to Homogenic.|$|E
500|$|Red Dead Redemption {{is one of}} {{the first}} games by Rockstar to use an {{original}} score. Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich has cited the large scale of the game as one of the largest difficulties when producing the score. He said that, in order to achieve an effective gaming experience, the game could not solely feature licensed music, like previous Rockstar games. [...] "We figured we'd <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> an original score," [...] Pavlovich said. To work on the score, Rockstar engaged Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, member and former member of Friends of Dean Martinez, respectively. In collaboration with each other, the duo composed over fourteen hours of music, which scores the game's missions, across fifteen months. The original score and subsequent album were both recorded and mixed at Jackson's personal recording studio in Los Angeles, and mastered at Capitol Studios. Following the recording, Irish producer and composer David Holmes listened to the original score, and subsequently spent three weeks compiling fifteen instrumental tracks that could be used as standalone songs for the game's official soundtrack. Holmes attempted to make the soundtrack representative of the variety of sounds and moods in the game. Four vocal performances were also recorded for use in the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} of {{commercial}} success, the extensive media attention and [...] "the stress of the grand tour" [...] began to affect Björk, as she repeatedly complained about the intrusiveness of tabloids and reporters. During the Asian leg of the Post Tour, Björk arrived at Bangkok International Airport with her son Sindri after a long haul flight; reporters were present, despite Björk's earlier request that the press leave her and her son alone until she held a press conference. While she was {{walking away from the}} reporters, Julie Kaufman began to ask Sindri questions; this angered Björk, who lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground. Björk's record company said that the reporter had been pestering her for four days. She later apologised to Kaufman, who declined to involve the police. The televised incident generated unwanted attention, as did the suicide of Björk's stalker Ricardo López, which caused a media sensation. On 12 September, López sent a letter bomb rigged with sulfuric acid to Björk's residence in London, returned home and filmed his suicide. After viewing his video diary, police contacted Scotland Yard, who intercepted the package without incident. To record in privacy away from the unwanted interest of the press, Björk's tour drummer Trevor Morais offered his studio in Málaga, Spain for Björk to record what would be Homogenic. Björk had begun the first sessions of the album in 1996, at her Maida Vale residence, after the completion of the extensive Post Tour gave her an urgent <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> new songs as a form of therapy.|$|E
