25|$|In Copenhagen, {{the palace}} {{and most of}} the {{administration}} supported a strict adherence to the status quo. The same applied to foreign powers such as Great Britain, France and Russia, who would not accept a weakened Denmark in favour of a German power, such as Austria or Prussia, acquiring Holstein with the important <b>naval</b> <b>harbour</b> of Kiel or controlling the entrance to the Baltic.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war Cesare Rossarol was off {{the coast}} of Austria-Hungary, outside the empire's main <b>naval</b> <b>harbour</b> and arsenal at Pola. She had been {{assigned}} to serve as an anti-submarine patrol ship after giving support to the landing and occupation of the city when Lieutenant Ludovico De Filippi, captain of Cesare Rossarol, received orders to escort a Serbian officer to Fiume whose orders were to convince the Serb-Croatian irregular troops not to oppose to the Italian occupation of the city. Just before noon, she moved down from Pola to Cape Kamenjak and then on towards Fiume Harbour only to hit a mine early on Saturday afternoon 16 November 1918.|$|E
2500|$|Changes in the {{intellectual}} climate meant the old allegories no longer resonated with the population. [...] The assassinations of both Henry III and Henry IV of France, of William the Silent and other prominent figures, {{and the spread of}} guns, made rulers more cautious about appearing in slow-moving processions planned and publicised long in advance; at grand occasions for fireworks and illuminations, rulers now characteristically did no more than show themselves at a ceremonial window or balcony. [...] The visit of Louis XVI to inspect the <b>naval</b> <b>harbour</b> works at Cherbourg in 1786 seems, amazingly, to have been the first French entry of a King designed as a public event since the early years of Louis XIV well over a century before. Though considered a great success, this was certainly too little and too late to avoid the catastrophe awaiting the French monarchy.|$|E

2500|$|Bonetti {{was called}} upon to {{surrender}} but refused again and on 8 April, an attack by the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group was repulsed. A simultaneous attack by the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and the tanks of B Squadron 4th RTR broke through the defences on the west side. The Free French overran the defences in the south-west, as the RAF bombed Italian artillery positions. In the afternoon, Bonetti surrendered and the Allied force took [...] and [...] The harbour {{was found to have}} been blocked by the scuttling of two large floating dry docks, [...] ships and a floating crane in the mouths of the north <b>Naval</b> <b>Harbour,</b> the central Commercial Harbour and the main South Harbour. The Italians had also dumped as much of their equipment as possible in the water. The British re-opened the Massawa–Asmara railway on 27 April and by 1 May, the port came into use to supply the 5th Indian Division. The Italian surrender ended organised resistance in Eritrea and fulfilled the strategic objective of ending the threat to shipping in the Red Sea. On 11 April, President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the USA rescinded the status of the Red Sea as a combat zone under the Neutrality Acts, freeing US ships to use the route to carry supplies to the Middle East.|$|E

50|$|The Eddystone Rocks are an {{extensive}} reef approximately 12 miles (19 km) SSW of Plymouth Sound, {{one of the}} most important <b>naval</b> <b>harbours</b> of England, and midway between Lizard Point, Cornwall and Start Point. They are submerged at high spring tides and were so feared by mariners entering the English Channel that they often hugged the coast of France to avoid the danger, which thus resulted not only in shipwrecks locally, but on the rocks of the north coast of France and the Channel Islands. Given the difficulty of gaining a foothold on the rocks particularly in the predominant swell it was a long time before anyone attempted to place any warning on them.|$|R

40|$|We {{present some}} {{developments}} in the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) for the solution of complex coupled problems in marine, <b>naval</b> and <b>harbour</b> engineering involving fluid-soil-structure interaction (FSSI). The PFEM uses an updated Lagrangian description to model the motion of nodes (particles) in a continuum domain containing fluid, soil/rock and structures subdomains. A mesh connects the nodes defining the discretized domain where the governing equations {{for each of the}} constituent materials are solved with the FEM. The stabilization for dealing with an incompressibility material is introduced via the finite calculus (FIC) method. An incremental iterative scheme for solving the non linear transient FSSI problem is described. The procedure to model frictional contact conditions and material erosion at fluid-solid and solid-solid interfaces is described. We present examples of application of the PFEM to solve FSSI problems in marine, <b>naval</b> and <b>harbour</b> engineering such as the motion of rocks by water streams, the stability of breakwaters and constructions under sea waves, the sinking of ships and the collision of a ship with ice blocks.
