50|$|Developers Andy Edwardson and Shaun Gadalla of Wacky Wheels were {{inspired}} by Super Mario Kart, and wished to create a similar experience on the personal computer. During development, he sent out a playable demo that included its source code to Copysoft to canvas interest in funding the project. They rejected it and instead Apogee began funding development. However, {{just prior to the}} release of Wacky Wheels, Copysoft released a similar game titled Skunny Kart. Edwardson and Gadalla accused Copysoft of copyright <b>infringement,</b> <b>noting</b> the similarity in the games: however, no legal action was ever taken.|$|R
5000|$|On about August 3, 2010, BusyBox won from Westinghouse a default {{judgement}} of triple damages of $90,000 and lawyers' {{costs and}} fees of $47,865, {{and possession of}} [...] "presumably a lot of high-def TVs" [...] as infringing equipment in the lawsuit Software Freedom Conservancy v. Best Buy, et al., the GPL <b>infringement</b> case <b>noted</b> in the paragraph above.|$|R
40|$|The {{borrowing}} and rearrangement {{of musical}} content, {{especially in the}} digital context, raises difficult questions for copyright law. There is significant community support for a loosening of the restrictions on the derivative (and particularly creative) use of copyright material. Law reform is called for. This paper discusses the possible introduction of a new exception to copyright <b>infringement</b> but <b>notes</b> that in the drafting of any such exception not only the economic rights but also the moral rights of the originating author {{need to be taken}} into account...|$|R
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of <b>infringement.</b> He <b>noted</b> that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{linguistic}} {{human rights}} {{in various parts of}} the globe are now in vogue. The present paper analyses the language policy and practice in Kenya so as to determine the extent to which language rights are observed. The analyses focus on language use both in private and public domains. It turns out that to a large extent the language rights are upheld. However, some degree of <b>infringement</b> is <b>noted</b> both in the private and public levels of language use. It is shown that what constitutes a breach of language rights at the private level is largely “voluntary”. The article calls for a balancing act from the language planners and policy implementers so that a higher level of language rights for enhanced democracy is realised...|$|R
5000|$|However, due to s. 27(2)(e) of the Copyright Act, where {{a work in}} {{question}} was imported, only [...] "hypothetical infringement" [...] was necessary instead of primary <b>infringement.</b> Rothstein J. <b>noted</b> that this section protected Canadian copyright holders from parallel importation of copyrighted works, because an infringing work in Canada {{may not necessarily be}} infringing in the country of its manufacture. Therefore, s. 27(2)(e) requires, for imported goods, only that the plaintiff prove that the work [...] "would infringe copyright if it had been made in Canada by the person who made it." ...|$|R
40|$|Russia’s December 2011 {{accession}} to the World Trade Organization {{means that it}} has agreed to implement and enforce intellectual property (IP) laws {{in accordance with the}} Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property. This gives some hope that foreign enterprises, frequently victims of IP infringement in Russia, will receive protection. Yet the parallel experience of China, which acceded in 2001, tempers that enthusiasm because the WTO has been ineffective in stopping <b>infringement</b> there. This <b>Note</b> compares China’s and Russia’s historical attitudes toward IP rights, economic incentives to adopt Western standards, and institutional challenges to assess {{the extent to which the}} WTO’s performance in China can predict its efficacy in curtailing counterfeiting and piracy in Russia...|$|R
25|$|Stevens, in {{his initial}} draft, {{expressed}} great {{concern with the}} possibility that an individual might be liable for copyright infringement for copying a single program in his own home, and for his own use. At the same time, Justice Brennan was wavering on affirming based {{on the presence of}} non-infringing uses of the technology—but Brennan was not prepared to say that making home copies for repeated personal use did not constitute an <b>infringement.</b> Justice White, <b>noting</b> Brennan's position, suggested that Stevens shift the basis of his opinion away from arguments about whether home-use was, in fact, an infringement. White pointed out that the issue need not be resolved, because the suit was not against home-users, but against the producers of the technology that enabled them.|$|R
40|$|In an ever-changing {{technological}} landscape, strictly {{adhering to}} the language and definitions of the Copyright Act in cases involving emerging technologies may contravene the purpose and intent of copyright law. However, the Supreme Court’s 2014 opinion in American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo Inc. puts forth a commercial interest rationale that suggests copyright infringers {{may no longer be}} able to avoid liability based on perceived technological loopholes that have typically absolved online infringers of <b>infringement</b> liability. This <b>Note</b> argues that Aereo’s commercial interest rationale paves the way for a new approach to technologically complex copyright cases, particularly where in-line linking is involved. This Note surveys traditional copyright law and the evolution of the World Wide Web and discusses opinions from the Ninth and Seventh Circuits that reveal a tendency of courts to use technological distinctions to find that in-line linking is not an infringing use of copyrighted content on the Internet. This Note analyzes the Supreme Court’s rationale for deciding Aereo, with emphasis on the majority’s 2 ̆ 2 commercial interest” discussion. Finally, this Note explains how the rationale in Aereo seamlessly translates to in-line linking of Web content, concluding that an application of the “commercial interest” analysis could change the outcome of future copyright infringement cases involving in-line linking of creative content...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{focuses on}} the {{protection}} of a copyright holder against infringement {{in the form of}} film piracy. It centers on the recent litigation surrounding Dallas Buyers Club, a biographical film articulating the life and events surrounding an AIDS patient, diagnosed in the mid- 1980 s, who pursued experimental treatments by smuggling pharmaceuticals into the United States. In 2013, more than 4, 700 Australian Internet users allegedly downloaded the film within the span of one month. In August of 2015, an Australian federal court declared that the studio behind the film would need to post a $ 600, 000 bond before it could send letters to thousands of Australian Internet users demanding damages. The decision creates a hurdle for studios and production companies, which have been accused of “speculative invoicing. ” This Note uses Dallas Buyers Club as a starting point to discuss the effects of film piracy and the issue of speculative damages as they pertain to 17 U. S. C. § 504, which addresses damages and profits surrounding copyright <b>infringement.</b> Moreover, this <b>Note</b> addresses the overall depreciation of the international economy resulting from a lack of efficient enforcement of copyright law, which stifles tax revenue and job creation...|$|R
5000|$|Tengen (Atari’s NES games subsidiary) took a {{different}} tactic: the corporation obtained {{a description of the}} code in the lockout chip from the United States Patent and Trademark Office by claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case. Tengen then used these documents to design their Rabbit chip, which duplicated the function of the 10NES. Nintendo sued Tengen for these actions. The court found that Tengen did not violate the copyright for copying the portion of code necessary to defeat the protection with current NES consoles, but did violate the copyright for copying portions of the code not being used in the communication between the chip and console. Tengen had copied this code in its entirety because future console releases could have been engineered to pick up the discrepancy. On the initial claim, the court sided with Nintendo on the issue of patent <b>infringement,</b> but <b>noted</b> that Nintendo’s patent would likely be deemed obvious as it was basically [...] {{with the addition of a}} reset pin, which was at the time already commonplace in the world of electronics. An eight-person jury later found that Atari did infringe. While Nintendo was the winner of the initial trial, before they could actually enforce the ruling they would need to have the patent hold up under scrutiny, as well as address Tengen’s antitrust claims. Before this occurred, the sides settled.A small company called RetroZone, the first company to publish games on the NES in over a decade, uses a multi-region lockout chip for NTSC, PAL A, and PAL B called the Ciclone which was created by reverse engineering Tengen's Rabbit chip. It will allow games to be played in more than one region. It is intended to make the games playable on older hardware that uses the 10NES lockout chip and the two other regions, although the top-loading NES does not use a lockout chip. The Ciclone chip is the first lockout chip to be developed after the patent for the 10NES had expired. Since then there have been a few other open source implementations to allow the general public to reproduce multi-region CICs on AVR microcontrollers.|$|R

Risk of {{copyright}} <b>infringement.</b> The report <b>noted</b> that CRS reports [...] "in certain instances" [...] may contain [...] "appropriately credited" [...] material from copyrighted sources. In these instances, the CRS either: obtains permission for the use; (generally based on legislative {{use and the}} expectation that dissemination is limited to Members of Congress); considers its information-gathering function protected by the speech or debate clause; or believes that the use falls under the [...] "fair use" [...] doctrine of the Copyright Act as applied {{in the context of}} the legislative process. Although [...] "the copyright statute does not expressly include congressional use {{of copyright}}ed works as a fair use," [...] "both the House and Senate Reports on the Copyright Act of 1976 include the [...] "reproduction of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports" [...] among examples of fair use." [...] The legislative history also contains an observation that publication of copyrighted material in Congressional documents would constitute fair use [...] "where the length of the work or excerpt published and the number of copies authorized are reasonable under the circumstances, and the work itself is directly relevant to a matter of legitimate legislative concern..." [...] Thus, in an infringement action, a court might regard the publication of copyrighted material in a Congressional document for legitimate legislative purposes as a [...] "fair use." [...] If, however, the use is outside of such legislative purposes, it is possible that a traditional fair use analysis might result in liability for copyright infringement. Wider dissemination outside the confines of Congress would further complicate the [...] "fair use" [...] question.|$|R
