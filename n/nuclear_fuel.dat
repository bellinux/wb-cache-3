5|$|Recovering uranium and {{plutonium}} from spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> for reuse {{is one of}} {{the major}} processes of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> cycle. As it has a long half-life of just over 2millionyears, the alpha emitter 237Np {{is one of the}} major isotopes of the minor actinides separated from spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel.</b> Many separation methods have been used to separate out the neptunium, operating on small and large scales. The small-scale purification operations have the goals of preparing pure neptunium as a precursor of metallic neptunium and its compounds, and also to isolate and preconcentrate neptunium in samples for analysis.|$|E

25|$|British <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fuels</b> Limited (BNFL) was {{established}} in February 1971 from the demerger of the production division of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims {{to characterize}} the currently used <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> and their materials, describe a fuel cycle from the mining, processing and enrichment, to possibe management of used fuel, neatly summarize useing nuclear reactors with their basic specifications and outline the possible trends of development of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from {{tens of thousands}} to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> {{comes from}} nuclear weapons being dismantled, such {{as from the}} Megatons to Megawatts Program.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{has five}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 43% of its electricity around 2007 (34% in 2015). Some Swiss spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> {{has been sent}} for reprocessing in France and the United Kingdom; most fuel is being stored without reprocessing. An industry-owned organization, ZWILAG, built and operates a central interim storage facility for spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> and high-level radioactive waste, and for conditioning low-level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes. Other interim storage facilities predating ZWILAG continue to operate in Switzerland.|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{properties}} of irradiated <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> are {{extremely difficult to}} evaluate experimentally and thus have rarely been measured successfully, {{in spite of the}} vital role these properties play in fuel performance. A technique based on a commercially available ‘hot disk’ instrument is being developed to support thermal property investigations for plate-type <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels.</b> Theoretical analysis was performed in order to evaluate the instruments response to a multi-layered test piece and to support calibration. In addition, a scanning thermal diffusivity microscope is currently under implementation that will permit point-to-point determination of irradiated <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{nuclear waste}} was {{planned to be}} shipped to the site by rail and/or truck in robust {{containers}} known as spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> shipping casks, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada would have been public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport would have been secret for security reasons. State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> entered their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|By weight, neptunium-237 {{discharges}} {{are about}} 5% {{as great as}} plutonium discharges and about 0.05% of spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> discharges. However, even this fraction still amounts to more than fifty tons per year globally.|$|E
5|$|In Russia, the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) is {{responsible}} for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16% of its electricity. Minatom is also responsible for reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal, including over 25,000 tons of spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> in temporary storage in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Krypton-85 in the {{atmosphere}} {{has been used to}} detect clandestine <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> reprocessing facilities in North Korea and Pakistan. Those facilities were detected in the early 2000s and were believed to be producing weapons-grade plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is also {{produced}} in nuclear fission reactors {{and can be}} extracted from spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> (see synthesis of precious metals), though this source for palladium is not used. None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high-level radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fuel</b> and Waste Management Company. (Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB, {{known as}} SKB) {{was created in}} 1980 and is {{responsible}} for final disposal of nuclear waste there. This includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fuel</b> at Oskarshamn, about 150 miles south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast; transportation of spent fuel; and construction of a permanent repository. Swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn, {{where it will be}} stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{materials}} research {{focuses on}} two main subject areas, <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> and irradiation-induced modification of materials. Improvement of three <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> is crucial for obtaining increased efficiency from nuclear reactors. Irradiation effects studies have many purposes, from studying structural changes to reactor components to studying nano-modification of metals using ion-beams or particle accelerators.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium–aluminium is an {{alternative}} to the Pu–Ga alloy. It was the original element considered for δ phase stabilization, but its tendency to react with the alpha particles and release neutrons reduces its usability for nuclear weapon pits. Plutonium–aluminium alloy can be also used as a component of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is an {{important}} material in TRISO-coated fuel particles, the type of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> found in high temperature gas cooled reactors such as the Pebble Bed Reactor. A layer of silicon carbide gives coated fuel particles structural support and is the main diffusion barrier {{to the release of}} fission products.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{separation}} of technetium-99 from spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> {{is a long}} process. During fuel reprocessing, it comes out {{as a component of}} the highly radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible. A series of chemical processes yields technetium-99 metal of high purity.|$|E

5|$|The {{plutonium}} {{present in}} spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> contains about 12% of 241Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to 241Am, 241Pu can be extracted {{and may be}} used to generate further 241Am. However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of 241Pu decays to 241Am after about 15 years, and the 241Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years.|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{formerly}} {{used as an}} alloying element in TIG welding electrodes, as a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in gas mantles, but these have become marginal uses. It has been suggested {{as a replacement for}} uranium as <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> in nuclear reactors, and several thorium reactors have been completed.|$|E
5|$|Triton was {{the second}} {{submarine}} and the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Greek god Triton.
