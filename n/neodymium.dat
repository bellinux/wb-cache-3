5|$|Magnets {{are made}} of heavy metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, niobium, bismuth, praseodymium, <b>neodymium,</b> gadolinium, and dysprosium. <b>Neodymium</b> magnets are the strongest type of {{permanent}} magnet commercially available. They are key components of, for example, car door locks, starter motors, fuel pumps, and power windows.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of <b>neodymium</b> and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of <b>neodymium</b> and {{lower than those of}} samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of <b>neodymium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Willard Libby {{reported}} that he had found weak beta activity in pure <b>neodymium,</b> which was attributed to a half-life over 1012years. Almost 20 years later, it was claimed that the element occurs in natural <b>neodymium</b> in equilibrium in quantities below 10−20 grams of promethium per one gram of <b>neodymium.</b> However, these observations were disproved by newer investigations, because for all seven naturally occurring <b>neodymium</b> isotopes, any single beta decays (which can produce promethium isotopes) are forbidden by energy conservation. In particular, careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference 150Nd-150Pm is negative (−87keV), which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of 150Nd to 150Pm. In 1965 O. Erämetsä separated out traces of 145Pm from a rare earth concentrate purified from and apatite, resulting in an upper limit of 10−21 for the abundance of promethium in nature; this may have been produced by the natural nuclear fission of uranium, or by cosmic ray spallation of 146Nd.|$|E
5|$|In {{combination}} with <b>neodymium,</b> another rare-earth element, praseodymium {{is used to}} create high-power magnets notable for their strength and durability.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alloying}} agent with magnesium to create high-strength metals {{that are used}} in aircraft engines; yttrium and <b>neodymium</b> are also viable substitutes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of <b>neodymium</b> magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for <b>neodymium</b> magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.|$|E
5|$|Promethium is {{the only}} {{lanthanide}} and {{one of only two}} elements among the first 83 that has no stable (or even long-lived) isotopes. This is a result of a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84. The primary decay products are <b>neodymium</b> and samarium isotopes (promethium-146 decays to both, the lighter isotopes generally to <b>neodymium</b> via positron decay and electron capture, and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay). Promethium nuclear isomers may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope (145Pm) has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable praseodymium-141.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or <b>neodymium</b> without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-lived}} isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm, primarily decay by {{emission of}} alpha particles to isotopes of <b>neodymium.</b> Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of promethium, while heavier ones convert through beta decay to isotopes of europium.|$|E
5|$|All other {{praseodymium}} isotopes have half-lives under a day (and most under a minute), {{with the}} single exception of 143Pr with a half-life of 13.6days. Both 143Pr and 141Pr occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 141Pr is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of cerium, while that of heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of <b>neodymium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by <b>neodymium,</b> lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} save energy, the Volt will {{sometimes}} heat the seats instead of blowing heated air through HVAC system, as heating the vehicle's cabin draws significant power, and can even exceed {{what is needed to}} move the vehicle on occasions. A power-saving stereo system uses amplifiers that switch on and off rapidly to save power. It uses 50 percent less energy. The system is also lighter because the use of high grade <b>neodymium</b> magnets.|$|E
5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the <b>neodymium</b> {{substituted}} by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of relative concentrations of samarium and <b>neodymium</b> isotopes 147Sm, 144Nd, and 143Nd allows {{the determination of}} the age and origin of rocks and meteorites in samarium–neodymium dating. Both elements are lanthanides and have very similar physical and chemical properties. Therefore, Sm–Nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various geological processes, or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the ionic radii of the involved elements.|$|E
5|$|The colours of glass, ceramic glazes, paints, pigments, and {{plastics}} {{are commonly}} {{produced by the}} inclusion of heavy metals (or their compounds) such as chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, zirconium, molybdenum, silver, tin, praseodymium, <b>neodymium,</b> erbium, tungsten, iridium, gold, lead, or uranium. Tattoo inks may contain heavy metals, such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper. The high reflectivity of some heavy metals {{is important in the}} construction of mirrors, including precision astronomical instruments. Headlight reflectors rely on the excellent reflectivity of a thin film of rhodium.|$|E
5|$|The early {{lanthanides}} act {{as essential}} cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and <b>neodymium</b> alone are about equally effective. Praseodymium is otherwise {{not known to}} have a biological role in any other organisms, but is not very toxic either. Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals {{has been known to}} impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the nitrate, the oxide {{is similar}} to the {{corresponding}} samarium salt and not the <b>neodymium</b> salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by heating the oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure. This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600°C. Further annealing at 800°C and then at 1750°C irreversibly transforms it to a monoclinic and hexagonal phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner {{found out}} that the {{differences}} in properties between <b>neodymium</b> and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them. This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87. With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} very toxic either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and <b>neodymium</b> alone are about equally effective.|$|E
5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} <b>neodymium</b> magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation {{and is one of the}} important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until <b>neodymium</b> to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium is {{the third}} member of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides cerium to its left and <b>neodymium</b> to its right, and above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{comparable to that of}} silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f36s2; theoretically, all five outer electrons can act as valence electrons, but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally, praseodymium only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. Praseodymium is the first of the lanthanides to have an electron configuration conforming to the Aufbau principle, which predicts the 4f orbitals to have a lower energy level than the 5d orbitals; this does not hold for lanthanum and cerium, because the sudden contraction of the 4f orbitals does not happen until after lanthanum, and is not strong enough at cerium to avoid occupying the 5d subshell. Nevertheless, solid praseodymium takes on the 4f25d16s2 configuration, with one electron in the 5d subshell like all the other trivalent lanthanides (all but europium and ytterbium, which are divalent in the metallic state).|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{americium}} {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and <b>neodymium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{electric}} machines used in hybrid vehicles are brushless DC motors (BLDC). Specifically, they are of a type called an interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine (or motor). These machines are wound similarly to the induction motors found in a typical home, but (for high efficiency) use very strong rare-earth magnets in the rotor. These magnets contain <b>neodymium,</b> iron and boron, and are therefore called <b>Neodymium</b> magnets.|$|E
25|$|Some other {{examples}} include Bayko, Konstruk-Tubes, K'Nex, Erector Sets, Tinkertoys, and Meccano, and generic construction toys such as <b>Neodymium</b> magnet toys.|$|E
25|$|The only tetrahalides known are the tetrafluorides of cerium, praseodymium, terbium, <b>neodymium</b> and dysprosium, {{the last}} two known only under matrix {{isolation}} conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} <b>Neodymium</b> {{went through a}} price bubble due to Chinese export {{restriction}} in 2010–11, rising from $50/kg {{at the start of}} 2010 to $500/kg by the summer of 2011. This resulted in 'demand destruction' as many producers quickly turned to substituting induction motors in their cars to defend their production line. This was in spite of such motors inferior 'power to weight' ratio attributes significantly impacting all but the most powerful (energy guzzling) motor sizes, e.g. those used in the Tesla. As of April 2014 there are other non-Chinese producers of <b>Neodymium</b> and its price/kg is not much more than it was in 2010. Cutting edge U.K. motors that are now being produced are using <b>Neodymium</b> Permanent Magnet technology. As security of supply returns, it is certain that there will accordingly be a return to superior motor designs that NdFeB Permanent Magnets enable.|$|E
25|$|The {{protective}} action of NdCl3 on aluminium alloys {{is based on}} formation of insoluble <b>neodymium</b> hydroxide. Being a chloride, NdCl3 itself is a corrosive agent, which is sometimes used for corrosion testing of ceramics.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} the <b>neodymium</b> dopant in the {{material}} varies according to its use. For continuous wave output, the doping is significantly lower than for pulsed lasers. The lightly doped CW rods can be optically distinguished by being less colored, almost white, while higher-doped rods are pink-purplish.|$|E
25|$|Lanthanides, {{including}} <b>neodymium</b> {{are famous}} for their bright luminescence and therefore are widely used as fluorescent labels. In particular, NdCl3 has been incorporated into organic molecules, such as DNA, which could be then easily traced using a fluorescence microscope during various physical and chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|Various {{treatments}} {{are used to}} slow corrosion damage to metallic objects which {{are exposed to the}} weather, salt water, acids, or other hostile environments. Some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to corrosion, such as those used in <b>neodymium</b> magnets, which can spall or crumble into powder even in dry, temperature-stable indoor environments unless properly treated to discourage corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Yttrium {{aluminium}} garnet (YAG), Y3Al2(AlO4)3, is {{used for}} synthetic gemstones. Due to its fairly high refractive index, YAG {{was used as a}} diamond simulant in the 1970s until the methods of producing the more advanced simulant cubic zirconia in commercial quantities were developed. When doped with <b>neodymium</b> (Nd3+), these YAl-garnets may be used as the lasing medium in lasers.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of neodymium(III) chloride in solution crucially {{depends on the}} solvent: In water, the major species are Nd(H2O)83+, and this situation is common for most rare earth chlorides and bromides. In methanol, the species are NdCl2(CH3OH)6+ and in hydrochloric acid NdCl(H2O)72+. The coordination of <b>neodymium</b> is octahedral (8-fold) in all cases, but the ligand structure is different.|$|E
25|$|Neodymium(III) {{chloride}} is a dopant {{not only}} of traditional silica-based optical fibers, but of plastic fibers (dopedphotolime-gelatin, polyimide, polyethylene, etc.) as well. It is also used in as an additive into infrared organic light-emitting diodes. Besides, <b>neodymium</b> doped organic films can not only act as LEDs, but also as color filters improving the LED emission spectrum.|$|E
25|$|If the {{nonlinear}} optical crystal {{cannot be}} phase-matched, quasi-phase-matching (QPM) can be employed. This {{is accomplished by}} periodically changing the nonlinear optical properties of the crystal, mostly by periodical poling. With a suitable range of periods, output wavelengths from 700nm to 5000nm can be generated in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN). Common pump sources are <b>neodymium</b> lasers at 1.064µm or 0.532µm.|$|E
25|$|For gem {{identification}} purposes, a pick-up {{response to}} a strong <b>neodymium</b> magnet separates garnet from all other natural transparent gemstones commonly used in the jewelry trade. Magnetic susceptibility measurements in conjunction with refractive index {{can be used to}} distinguish garnet species and varieties, and determine the composition of garnets in terms of percentages of end-member species within an individual gem.|$|E
