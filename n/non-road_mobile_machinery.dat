50|$|Non-road engine (which {{may include}} non-road {{equipment}} and non-road vehicle) is an {{internal combustion engine}} or a gas turbine engine used for other purposes than being an engine of a vehicle operated on public roadways. The term is commonly used by regulators to classify the engines {{in order to control}} their emission. Non-road engines are used in an extremely wide range of applications which may include machinery and engines of vehicles in other modes of transportation with different fuel types such as gasoline and diesel fuel. In many jurisdictions, the term non-road engine is assumed to refer to the engines that have mobility or portability which is separated from the term stationary engine. The definition of non-road engine may explicitly exclude certain non-road vehicles such as aircraft, locomotives, and ocean-going marine vessels.

40|$|The Swedish {{government}} has decided {{an action plan}} against particulate matter (PM 10) within the county of Stockholm. Among other thing, the action plan stipulate that measures shall be taken {{in order to increase}} the knowledge about emissions of PM 10 from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> and their contribution to the air quality within densely populated areas. <b>Non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> are characterised as mobile machinery not intended for the use of passenger- or goods-transport on the road, and equipped with an internal combustion engine as specified in directive 97 / 68 /EC and directive 2000 / 25 /EC, i. e. agricultural and forestry tractors and construction equipment such as wheel loaders, excavators, articulated haulers and mobile cranes. The purpose of this project, which was financed by the Swedish national road administration, was to update and summarise the current knowledge concerning fuel consumption and emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> and their contribution to the air quality in densely populated areas. A more specific aim of the project was to estimate the occurrence and age distribution and annual work hours of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> within densely populated areas. Furthermore, annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts were also derived. Usually a single emission factor for each pollutant has been used when estimating emissions from the entire <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> sector, which has resulted in fairly uncertain results. Previous research has shown that {{it is not possible to}} develop one single set of emission factors that gives representative results for all types of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> and operations (Hansson et al., 2001; Starr et al., 1999; Ullman et al., 1999). The latest research within the EMMA-projects in Sweden about the presence, use and emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> has resulted in better knowledge and data concerning emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery.</b> Within the present project, emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> in two densely populated areas or population centres with different sizes have been studied. One large population centre represented by the city of Stockholm and one small represented by the town of Ljungby. The calculation of fuel consumption and emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> within the city of Stockholm has been conducted in accordance with the advanced approach presented by the emission inventory guidebook from the European Environement Agency (EEA, 2005). However, the methodology has been modified in order to thoroughly represent the actual assembly of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> including the work performed by those machines annually. The same model that was used to derive fuel consumption has been employed for emissions as well. Compared with using average information, more reliable data were obtained through describing the number of machines, annual hour, engine power, load factor, specific fuel consumption and emissions amounts for each type of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> and model year. All data were stored and used in different matrices, one for each variable. In total 31 different types of machines were defined for which data were collected for all model years from 1982 to 2006. Extensive inventories of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> were carried out for both the city of Stockholm and Ljungby. For Stockholm the inventory contained both number of units and annual work hour as function of the age of the machinery. Reliable data could be obtained through the Swedish Machinery Testing Institute’s accredited inspection database in combination with statistics over both annual sale returns and registered machinery from the national vehicle database. The results from the inventory showed that about 2 800 <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> with both varying age and annual work hours operated within the city of Stockholm. In the city of Ljungby, less than 100 <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> were estimated to operate, thus called for an alternative method for the inventory. Based on data from local contractors that operated in the city of Ljungby, annual work hour for different types of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> were collected. The result showed that about 48 000 hours of work with <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> were carried out within the city of Ljungby annually. Moreover, the majority of the work were performed with wheel loaders and different types of excavators.

40|$|This report {{comprises}} {{fuel consumption}} and emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> equipped with diesel engine with a rated power of 37 to 560 kW. <b>Non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> comprises of tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulated haulers and trucks etc. <b>Non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> is almost exclusively equipped with diesel engine and thus significantly {{contributes to the}} overall emissions of pollutants in the society. In Europe <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> contributes with about 15 to 20 % of the total emissions of nitrogen oxides (EEA, 2005). Besides estimates of annual fuel consumption and emission amounts this report also include inventories {{of the number of}} machines and the annual work hours. In total 15 different types of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> was identified, of which one was other machinery. Each type of machinery was further divided into three net power regions. Information concerning number of machines, annual work hour, rated engine power, load factor and fuel consumption and emission factors were obtained for each type of machine, power region and model year for the last 25 years. Annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts were individually calculated for each type of machine, net power region and model year. The methodology employed within this study differs to some extend to that of other recently conducted studies within the same area, emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery.</b> Firstly, concern was taken to the age distribution, for example both the number of machinery and the annual work hour varies significantly with age or model year of the machinery. Secondly, both fuel consumption and emissions factors were individually adapted the each type of machinery and activity in order to better represent the actual use of the machinery and thus resulting fuel consumption and emissions. The fuel consumption and emission factors were based on the CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook and European emissions regulations for <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> and adjusted for: • differences in quality and specification between the fuel stipulated for use during type approval and Swedish diesel of environmental class 1, • differences between the maximum value stipulated in the emission regulations and the recorded emission amounts during type approval, • differences in engine load between the test cycle employed during type approval and during real use of the machinery, and • deterioration in fuel consumption and emission formation with increasing age. In total, 290 000 <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW were estimated to operate in Sweden year 2006, which was about 25 % more machinery compared with the last published study concerning number of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> in Sweden (Flodström et al., 2004). The annual estimated fuel consumption and emission mounts from the <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> sector in Sweden for year 2006 is shown in table S 1. The estimated annual fuel consumption was about 5 % lower compared with previous studies despite the higher number of machinery included. For emissions the differences were even larger compared with the above-mentioned study. Emissions of both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were reduced with approximately 70 % each or 13 000 and 5 100 ton respectively. Corresponding data for emissions of nitrogen oxides was 20 000 ton or 50 %. However, the largest difference was obtained for emissions of particulate matter, the estimated amounts within the present study was reduced with 75 % or 3 100 ton compared with the amounts estimated in previous studies. The differences obtained could be attributed to several aspects, for example significantly improved inventory data and especially the age distribution and annual work hour as function of machinery age. Another important characteristics of the present study were the adaptation of fuel consumption and emission factors to the actual use and conditions in Sweden. Finally, the model employed calculated the annual fuel consumption and emission amounts for each type of machinery, net power region and model year individually and not only as averages...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} both the present {{situation}} and estimates of emissions from large <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> were studied. The estimates over future emission amount from the <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> sector in Sweden were conducted for the year 2010 and 2020. Special focus has been taken {{to the development of}} technology for diesel engines and alternative fuels. Moreover, possible measures and means of control to reduce emissions in the future were discussed. The study comprises fuel consumption and emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> equipped with diesel engines with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW. Nonroad mobile machinery for example includes tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulate haulers, mobile cranes, combined harvester, forestry machines and trucks. The estimate of annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts were based on input data concerning occurring types of machinery, number of machines, average engine power, annual work hour, load factors, fuel consumption and emission factors. Furthermore, concern was taken to the age distribution of the entire assembly of machinery. Inventory data regarding types of machinery, number, age, engine power, and annual work hour has been obtained from the Swedish machinery testing institute’s machinery inspection operation, statistics of sale returns from trade organisations and the Swedish motor-vehicle register. The fuel consumption and emission factors used were based on the CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook and European emissions regulations for <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> and adjusted for: • differences in quality and specification between the fuel stipulated for use during type approval and Swedish diesel of environmental class 1, • differences between the maximum value stipulated in the emission regulations and the recorded emission amounts during type approval, • differences in engine load between the test cycle employed during type approval and during real use of the machinery, and • deterioration in fuel consumption and emission formation with increasing age. In total, 290 000 <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW were estimated to operate in Sweden year 2006, which was about 25 % more machinery compared with the last published study concerning number of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> in Sweden (Flodström et al., 2004). The annual estimated fuel consumption and emission mounts from the <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> sector in Sweden for year 2006 is shown in table S 1. The estimated annual fuel consumption was about 5 % lower compared with previous studies despite the higher number of machinery included. For emissions the differences were even larger compared with the above-mentioned study. Emissions of NOx were halved while both emissions of CO and HC only amounted to approximately one-third of previously estimated amounts. The largest difference was obtained for emissions of particulate matter, a reduction with 75 %. The differences obtained could be attributed to improved input data with higher resolution, especially concerning annual work hour as function of machinery age and the adjustment of fuel consumption and emission factors. Possible changes in the assembly of machinery between the present and previous studies were assumed to only have minor importance. Several different estimates of future emission amounts were conducted. The first estimate was based on the introduction of the European emission regulation, which resulted in a reduction of emissions of NOx and PM with about 70 % compared with the present amounts. Corresponding reduction of NOx and PM to year 2010 were about 21 %. The development of technology for diesel engines is focused on the reduction of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. According to the study, current technologies for reduction of NOx were EGR, NOx-traps, SCR and engine-out modifications. For particulate matter, engine-out and different types of particulate filters will be utilised in order to fulfil future emission regulations. Alternative fuels can be used {{in order to reduce the}} emissions from current diesel engines, the most promising and suitable fuels in the future would probably be GTL-fuels, synthetic diesel and different types of biodiesel. For dedicated engines, dimethylester (DME) could be an interesting alternative. Several different means of control for reduction of emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> exists. Within the agricultural and forestry sector different types of economical means of control were assumed to be the most cost-effective methods.

We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art PEMS in-use emissions testing in the current and future European emissions legislation for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles as well as <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery.</b> For obtaining type approval in European Union (EU), light-duty vehicles have to comply with Euro 6 emission standards from January 2014 onward. In parallel, a new test procedure will complement standard emissions testing in the laboratory to control gaseous and particulate emissions over a wide range of real-world driving conditions. Two candidate procedures are developed at present, i. e., random cycle testing and on-road emissions testing with PEMS. Currently, key challenges are the definition of test conditions and design of a suitable method for data evaluation. For heavy-duty vehicles, in-use testing with PEMS is already enforced in the European Union since 2009. The revision of European requirements will be completed in 2014 and shifts the focus from engine conformity checking towards the assessment of emissions under real-world driving conditions. The feasibility of PEMS for measuring particle mass is currently investigated by an industry-run pilot program. Moreover, the application of PEMS to Stage IV and V engines of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> is currently under discussion. We conclude that in-use testing with PEMS will play an important role in the future European vehicle emissions legislation. The application of PEMS can effectively control vehicle emissions, may accelerate the adoption of novel emission abatement technologies and thereby contribute to air quality improvements throughout Europe.

40|$|In {{this report}} future annual {{emissions}} amounts of gaseous pollutants, particulate matter (PM 10) and {{noise from the}} <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> sector in Sweden were estimated. The estimates over future emissions amounts were conducted for each year from 2006 to 2020. Special focus has been taken {{to the impact of}} European and national legislations, the age distribution of different types and sizes of machinery and measures to reduce the annual emissions. Besides different measures to reduce emissions, corresponding costs were also estimated. The study comprises fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and noise from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> equipped with diesel engines with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW. <b>Non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> for example includes tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulate haulers, mobile cranes, combined harvesters, forestry machinery and trucks. The current report was a supplementary study to a report describing a methodology for estimating annual fuel consumption and emissions from the <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> sector in Sweden for year 2006. Inventory data of the year 2006 study was obtained from the Swedish machinery testing institute’s machinery inspection operation, statistics of sale returns from trade organisations and the Swedish motor-vehicle register. The number of machinery and annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts for year 2006 is presented in table S 1. Besides estimates of annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts, emissions of noise was also derived both at a national level and for a specific construction site. For the case study the results showed {{that it was possible to}} reduce the average noise level with more than 3 dB(A) compared with the base scenario just by choosing the machinery fulfilling the strictest noise limits, i. e. Stage II which was mandatory for most machinery from 2006. Other measures simulated included various types of retrofit of noise reduction packages. The specific cost for the different measures to reduce average noise emissions from the specific construction site varied from 4 000 up to more than 500 000 SEK dB- 1. For the estimate of future fuel consumption and emissions amounts various simulations were conducted, each with a different measure for reducing the annual amounts. Five main emission reduction measures or programs were studied: - Scrappage program - Alternative fuel program - Voluntary emission regulation program - Retrofit of aftertreatment program - Noise reduction program The impact on engine exhaust gas emissions and noise of the current European emission and noise regulations, Stage I to IV and Stage I to II for emissions and noise respectively were common for all simulations or programs. Besides the impact of European regulations, annual work was set to a fixed value for each type of machinery and year simulated, thus eliminating any potential changes of the state of the market. The result of the baseline scenario "Business as usual" (BAU), i. e. only taking account to the impact of European regulation, is presented in table S 2 for four different years Both fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2 remains fairly constant as an effect of the assumption that the annual work was set at a fixed value. However, emissions of especially NOx and PM showed a major reduction due to the tighter and tighter regulations. All programs simulated were able to reduce the emissions compared with the BAU scenario with exceptions for emissions of nitrogen oxides, which increased in some of the alternative fuel programs. Both the absolute reduction and cost varied significantly between and within the various programs. Reduction of NOx varied from an accumulated increase in emissions of 25 000 tonne to an accumulated reduction of 22 000 tonne for the studied period from 2006 to 2020. At the same time the accumulated cost for the programs varied from a few hundred million SEK to more than 60 000 million SEK. In table S 3, specific reduction cost for each pollutant in SEK kg- 1 for eight typical emission reduction programs are presented. The results showed that the most economically favourable alternative for reducing emissions from <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> was the voluntary emissions regulation program, i. e. early introduction of machinery fulfilling coming emission limits. Another important result was that the introduction of alternative fuels as a mean of emissions reduction was associated with rather high costs compared to the actual reduction in emissions. For emissions of nitrogen oxides the specific reduction cost varied from almost 100 SEK kg- 1 up to a few hundreds of SEK kg- 1 except for the alternative fuel programs, which resulted in a considerable higher cost...|$|E
40|$|<b>Non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> is {{used for}} a range of {{different}} operations with varying engine load characteristics. Fuel consumption and emission amounts from such machinery are dependent on the operation performed. The engine load during many of the operations performed is largely transient in nature. However, the majority of fuel consumption and emission data reported in the literature are based on static measurements and engine load patterns not representative of the real use of the vehicle. Emission data derived from the average annual use of agricultural tractors, based on three different typical areas of use, were compared with emission data obtained from European and international standards. The results showed that the emission amounts obtained from the engine load cycles stipulated in European and international emissions regulations were not representative of the real use of <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery.</b> Furthermore, operations can be performed using a variety of different approaches depending on factors such as vehicle characteristics and driver behaviour. An engine load simulation model was developed and the results from the simulations showed that by using different driving strategies or transmission characteristics, it was possible to affect the emissions for a specific operation without affecting the fuel consumption or duration of the operation. Changes in engine speed and torque, i. e. transients, are likely to affect the fuel consumption and formation of emissions due to periods of time lags in e. g. the fuel injection system or the boost pressure. During normal operations a decrease in the fuel efficiency due to transient loads was detected. The fuel consumption increased with up to 13 % compared with the corresponding steady-state condition. In order to study the effects of transients, special transient test cycles were developed. At high transients, both in engine speed and torque, the effects on fuel consumption and emissions were substantial. For example emissions of particulate matter increased with up to twelve times. Based on these results, a mathematical model was developed that could derive transient fuel consumption and emission amounts for all types of operations using a limited amount of emission measurements...|$|E

The control of the DDH system was implemented directly with a servomotor driving a pump without conventional hydraulic control valves. Angular speed of the servomotor, in-coming oil flow from the pump, and out-going flow to the hydraulic motor determined the velocity of the double-acting cylinder piston. An earlier study by the authors presented that the hydro-mechanical losses were dominant in the original DDH setup. Resulting theoretical investigation indicated that the best scenario efficiency for DDH was estimated to be 76. 7 %. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed analysis based on Sankey diagrams of various powertrain topologies with DDH. This study of powertrains illustrated that DDH has the highest impact with 174 % efficiency improvement with an electric NRMM powered by batteries instead of a conventional topology.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{technologies}} available {{to meet the}} exhaust emissions regulations for Internal Combustion Engine of, light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles, <b>non-road</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> and motorcycles This includes fast light-off catalysts, more thermally durable catalysts, improved substrate technology, diesel particulate filters, selective catalytic reduction, NOx absorbers and lean DeNOx catalysts. The stricter world wide emission legislation and growing demands for lower fuel consumption and anthropogenic CO 2 emission require significant efforts to improve combustion efficiency while satisfying the emission quality demands. Ethanol fuel combined with gasoline provides a particularly promising and, at the same time, a challenging approach. Extensive usage of automobiles has certain disadvantages {{and one of them}} is its negative effect on environment. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and particulate matter (PM) come out as harmful products during incomplete combustion from internal combustion (IC) engines. As these substances affect human health, regulatory bodies impose increasingly stringent restrictions on the level of emissions coming out from IC engines. Modern combustion techniques such as low temperature combustion (LTC), homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) etc. would be helpful for reducing the exhaust emission...|$|E

50|$|The CAN bus based system IQAN was {{developed}} by a small Swedish company around 1990-95. First version was introduced on the market 1995. Shortly after, around 1995 the Swedish company VOAC Hydraulics Co. bought this company and in February 1996 VOAC Hydraulics was acquired by Parker Hannifin. The IQAN-system was integrated into Parkers product range of system components for <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery.</b> The system has been was further developed within the Parker organization.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{and other}} <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> used for {{transport}} (over land, sea, air, rail) {{and for other}} uses (agricultural, mobile power generation, etc.) contribute heavily to climate change and pollution, so zero emission engines are an area of active research. These technologies almost in all cases include an electric motor powered by an energy source compact enough to be installed in the vehicle. These sources include hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and flywheel energy storage devices.|$|R
