500|$|The Battle of Gettysburg (July 1–3, 1863) was {{to prove}} {{a turning point in}} the war, and the end of Lee's advance. Steuart's men arrived at Gettysburg [...] "exhausted and footsore...a little before dusk" [...] on the evening of July 1, {{following}} a [...] march from Sharpsburg, [...] "many of them barefooted". Steuart's men attacked the Union line on the night of July 2, gaining ground between the lower Culp's Hill and the stone wall near Spangler's Spring. But fresh Federal reinforcements blocked his further advance, and no further ground was gained. During the night a large <b>number</b> <b>quantity</b> of Union artillery was wheeled into place, the sound of which caused the optimistic Steuart to hope that the enemy was retreating in its wagons.|$|E

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of field measurements of a façade was evaluated by a Round Robin Test (RRT) {{conducted in a}} full-scale experimental building at the Construction Technologies Institute of the National Research Council of Italy (ITC-CNR). Each of the 9 teams involved in the RRT replicated the tests 5 times, {{for a total of}} 45 measurements, while reverberation time was repeated 110 times. Both for façade sound insulation and reverberation time the main variations in the one-third octave bands were found in the low frequencies range. The study was also focused on the evaluation of single <b>number</b> <b>quantities</b> (SNQs) and their uncertainties. Single <b>number</b> <b>quantities</b> were evaluated in both narrow (from 100 to 3150 Hz) and extended (from 50 to 5000 Hz) range. Concerning the SNQs and their uncertainties, no significant differences were observed whether the low frequencies were included or not, unlike the case of airborne sound insulation (investigated {{in the first part of}} this study). The uncertainty results were compared with the relevant standards and with literature results. Based on these comparisons, it was highlighted that the standard deviation of reproducibility of façade elements is not adequately reflected in the ISO 12999 - 1 and further research is needed to specify the in situ standard deviation of reproducibility for façade elements...|$|R

[...] Unity is one moment in time. Plurality is several moments. Totality is expressed as all moments. But Monck noted that [...] "Kant does not trace out specially the Schemata of the Categories of Unity, Plurality, and Totality." [...] Monck supposed: [...] "In the Category of Unity I presume we should stop at the first term of the Time - series: for the Category of Plurality we should represent the addition of unit to unit without laying down any determinate limit; and for the Category of Totality we should limit the number of units and complete the addition up to this number." ...|$|E

Focused on Foundational Number Sense (FoNS), we examine how each book’s tasks facilitate children’s learning of those number-related competences that require instruction and which underpin later mathematical learning. Analyses identified both similarities and differences. Similarities lay in   books’ extensive opportunities for children to recognise and write numbers and undertake simple arithmetical operations. However, neither offered {{more than a few}} tasks related to estimation or simple number patterns. Differences lay in the Swedish book’s greater emphases on different representations of <b>number,</b> <b>quantity</b> discrimination and relating numbers to quantity, highlighting conceptual emphases on number.

We examine whether white males ’ stated attitudes and behavior toward African Americans change based on the number and type of black peers to whom they are exposed. To overcome selection bias, we exploit data from the U. S. Air Force Academy in which students are randomly assigned to peer groups. Results show significant evidence in favor of the contact hypothesis. White males are significantly affected by both the <b>number</b> (<b>quantity)</b> and aptitude (quality) of the black peers with whom they are exposed. Specifically, white men randomly assigned to higher-aptitude black peers report being more accepting of blacks in general {{and are more likely to}} match with a black roommate the following year after reassignment to a new peer group with a different set of black peers. We also find that, ceteris paribus, exposure to more black peers significantly increases the probability of a bi-racial roommate match...|$|E
40|$|Sophisticated {{computation}} {{methods were}} developed 4000 {{years ago in}} Mesopotamia {{in the context of}} scribal schools. The basics of the computation can be detected in clay tablets written by young students educated in these scribal schools. At first glance, the mathematical exercises contained in school tablets seem to be very simple and quite familiar, and therefore, they have little attracted the attention of historians of mathematics. Yet if we look more closely at these modest writings, their simplicity proves deceptive. The feeling of familiarity primarily results from a projection on to the past of thought patterns ingrained from our own early learning. Careful observation of school tablets reveals subtle differences between ancient and modern notions of <b>number,</b> <b>quantity,</b> measurement unit, order, divisibility, algorithm, etc. In fact, we find a completely original mathematical world with rules of its own.
