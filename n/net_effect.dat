5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the distributional effects of public higher education financing {{in a lifetime}} perspective. The benefits that university graduates obtain {{in terms of their}} tertiary education are compared to the graduates’ education-related (tax) burden. To calculate the education-related tax burden, we resort to the proportionality approach and use data from the Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) {{as well as from the}} Sample Survey of Income and Expenditure (EVS). We show that graduates benefit from positive <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of public higher education subsidies because they do not pay back the costs of their tertiary education by their corresponding tax payments. We observe especially high <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> for health professionals, and especially low <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> for university graduates in law, economics, and social sciences. Compared to earlier studies, the absolute <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> have even increased for graduates. Based on the observed <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> we compute a differentiated system of tuition fees that take into account the varying <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> for the various university types and fields of study.

40|$|Suppose that a {{sequence}} of treatments are assigned to influence an outcome of interest that occurs after the last treatment. Between treatments there exist time-dependent covariates that may be posttreatment variables of the earlier treatments and confounders of the subsequent treatments. In this article, we develop a parametric approach to inference of the causal effect of the treatment sequence on the outcome called the sequential causal effect. We construct a point parametrization for the conditional distribution of an outcome given all treatments and time-dependent covariates, in which the point parameters of interest are the point effects of treatments considered as single-point treatments. We (1) identify <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments by point effects of treatments, (2) express patterns of <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments by constraints on point effects of treatments, and (3) show that all sequential causal effects are determined by <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments. Accordingly we (1) estimate <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments through point effects of treatments by maximum likelihood, (2) improve the estimation by constraints on point effects of treatments and assignment conditions of treatments, and (3) use the estimates of <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments to obtain those of sequential causal effects. As a result, we obtain unbiased consistent maximum-likelihood estimates of sequential causal effects even for long treatment sequences. For illustration of our method, we study the causal effects of various sequences of recreational drugs on the CD 4 count among HIV patients. Comment: 33 pages, 3 table...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} mobile {{phone in the}} {{diffusion}} of knowledge for better governance in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000 - 2012. For this purpose we employ Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The empirical evidence is based on three complementary knowledge diffusion variables (innovation, internet penetration and educational quality) and ten governance indicators that are bundled and unbundled. The following are the main findings. First, there is an unconditional positive effect of mobile phone penetration on good governance. Second, the <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> on political, economic and institutional governances {{that are associated with}} the interaction of the mobile phone with knowledge diffusion variables are positive for the most part. Third, countries with low levels of governance are catching-up their counterparts with higher levels of governance. The above findings are broadly consistent with theoretical underpinnings on the relevance of mobile phones in mitigating bad governance in Africa. The evidence of some insignificant <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> and decreasing marginal impacts may be an indication that the mobile phone could also be employed to decrease government quality. Overall, this study has established <b>net</b> positive <b>effects</b> for the most part. Five rationales could elicit the positive <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> on good governance from the interaction between mobile phones and knowledge diffusion, among others, the knowledge variables enhance: reach, access, adoption, cost-effectiveness and interaction. In a nut shell, the positive <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> are apparent because the knowledge diffusion variables complement mobile phones in reducing information asymmetry and monopoly that create conducive conditions for bad governance. The contribution of the findings to existing theories and justifications of the underlying positive <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> are discussed...|$|R

This highway ran from the Ohio state line north to Hillsdale, ending in rural southeastern Calhoun County. This trunkline was extended northerly in 1926 through Homer to end at the contemporary US12 in Albion. In {{the latter half of}} 1929, this highway was redesignated M-9 (now M-99). At the same time, the original M-9 in Keweenaw County between US41 and Eagle Harbor was renumbered M-64. The <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> was to swap the numbers between roads on opposing ends of the state. The next year, the M-64 number was swapped with another highway, the original M-129 that ran along the west side of Lake Gogebic and south to the Wisconsin state line.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{literature}} on causal statistical inference, an important goal {{is to examine the}} causal mechanisms or channels through which the treatment affects the outcome of interest. Net (or direct) causal effects measure the effect of the treatment on the outcome while blocking the effect of the treatment on the variable that represents the mechanism. Hence, <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> are useful in learning {{about the ways in which}} the treatment causally affects the outcome. This paper provides sufficient conditions under which <b>net</b> average <b>effects</b> can be partially and point identified without functional form, distributional, or constant-effects assumptions. First, we show that the data usually available to researchers contains information on the relevant potential outcome used in the definition of causal <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> only for a particular subpopulation: those individuals for which the treatment does not affect the mechanism variable. An implication of this result is that estimation of <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> for other subpopulations can only be based on extrapolations involving typically strong assumptions. Second, we show that by imposing a monotonicity condition on the effect of the treatment on the mechanism variable—which is also imposed on methods currently used for estimatio...|$|R

Within five independent areas, we sampled surface soils in sites subjected to three grazing intensities: (1) ungrazed sites inside grazing exclosures, (2) moderately grazed sites adjacent to them, and (3) intensely grazed sites within the same paddock.

5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to gain insight into the factors {{correlated}} with active arts participation. Drawing on the cultural reproduction theory and the cultural mobility model, we assess the relative effects of level of education and art education versus social background and focus on possible interaction effects between them. We thereby query if and to what extent art education programs and parental milieu can account for differences in participation according to level of education. Results based on stepwise logistic regression analyses on representative population data for Flanders (N = 3, 146) offer a mixed picture. Although we find clear effects of social background on the odds of active arts participation, <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of art education prove more substantial. However, the context of art education clearly matters: for most of the art forms considered, only out-of-school art education shows <b>net</b> <b>effects,</b> while in-school art education has no <b>net</b> <b>effects.</b> Furthermore, we find how the effects of level of education on active art participation are equally attributable to parental milieu and to art education programs. Finally, four significant interaction effects are found corroborating the cultural mobility model. Results are discussed in the light of both theorems and routes for further research are suggested...|$|R
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} empirical and theoretical evidence that {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) may be motivated not {{by the desire to}} exploit some competitive advantage possessed by multinationals, but to access the technology of host economy firms. Using a panel of FDI flows across OECD countries and manufacturing sectors between 1984 and 1995, we test whether these contrasting motivations influence the effects that FDI has on domestic total factor productivity. The distinction between technology-exploiting FDI (TEFDI) and technology-sourcing FDI (TSFDI) is made using R&D intensity differentials between host and source sectors. The hypothesis that the motivation for FDI has an effect on total factor productivity spillovers is supported: TEFDI has a <b>net</b> positive <b>effect,</b> while TSFDI has a <b>net</b> negative <b>effect.</b> These <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> are explained in terms of the offsetting influences of productivity spillovers and market stealing effects induced by incoming multinationals. ...|$|R
