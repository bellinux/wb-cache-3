5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the <b>next</b> <b>Sunday</b> is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E

25|$|After {{delivering}} a rousing commencement address at Oberlin College in 1839, the school offered Blanchard a professorship, but he declined. In 1841, Blanchard founded the Presbyterian of the West, later {{known as the}} Herald and Presbyter, a radical Presbyterian weekly journal. He represented the Ohio State Anti-Slavery Society as a delegate to the 1843 World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England and was elected its American vice president. In early October 1845, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Blanchard debated the morality of slavery with fellow Presbyterian minister Nathan Lewis Rice (December 29, 1807 - June 11, 1877). This debate was recorded in full, and later published as A Debate on Slavery Held in the City of Cincinnati (Cincinnati: William H. Moore & Co., 1846). Blanchard's first opposition to Freemasonry came in 1845, when he condemned a Covington, Kentucky lodge that refused aid to a widow of a long-time member. A mob of over fifty men attacked him over the article. The <b>next</b> <b>Sunday,</b> Blanchard preached against secret societies, a position that he would hold {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E

500|$|The strong {{coherence}} {{between the}} first four cantatas of this series, as belonging to the same set, has been described for instance by Christoph Wolff. The first of these cantatas begins with a chorale fantasia {{in the form of}} a French overture, with the soprano singing the cantus firmus of the chorale. The opening movement of the cantata for the <b>next</b> <b>Sunday</b> is in motet style, with the cantus firmus sung by the alto. For the next occasion, St. John's Day, Bach wrote a cantata with an opening movement in the style of an Italian violin concerto, in which the cantus firmus was given to the tenor. The next day followed a cantata opening with a movement in vocal and instrumental counterpoint with the cantus firmus sung by the bass. Conductor John Eliot Gardiner writes about these first four cantatas of the chorale cantata cycle: [...] "Together they make a fascinating and contrasted portfolio of choral fantasia openings." ...|$|E
