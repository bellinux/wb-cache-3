5|$|Chief Justice Morrison Waite died a {{few months}} later, and Cleveland {{nominated}} Melville Fuller to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Civil Service Commission, preferring his Chicago law practice. The Senate Judiciary Committee spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Massachusetts, where he remained politically {{active in the}} state. He established Republican dominance in Worcester, even though the state was dominated by Federalists. He was elected lieutenant governor under James Sullivan in 1807, but failed to win election {{in his own right}} in 1809 in a highly partisan election. He retired from politics in 1811, declining <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court because of his health.

5|$|Henry Sue, a voter from Queensland, {{disputed the}} {{election}} of Hill and filed a petition under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in the High Court of Australia, sitting in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. Sue argued that on the date of Hill's <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate {{she was still a}} citizen of the United Kingdom and thus, because of the operation of section 44 of the Australian Constitution, was ineligible to be elected to the Parliament of Australia.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt {{nominated}} Black to {{fill the}} vacancy. By tradition, a senator nominated for an executive or judicial office was confirmed immediately and without debate. However, when Black was nominated, the Senate departed from this tradition {{for the first time}} since 1853; instead of confirming him immediately, it referred the <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Judiciary Committee. Black was criticized for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and his Klan membership, when that became public.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 1941, Roosevelt {{announced}} Minton's <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chicago-based Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties. The information of the Multiple Property Documentation Form {{can be used to}} nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously, or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future. Thus, additions to an MPS can occur over time.|$|E
5|$|Hayes attempted, unsuccessfully, {{to fill a}} third vacancy in 1881. Justice Noah Haynes Swayne {{resigned}} {{with the}} expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews, who was a friend of both men. Many Senators objected to the appointment, believing that Matthews was too close to corporate and railroad interests, especially those of Jay Gould, and the Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination. The following year, when James A. Garfield entered the White House, he re-submitted Matthews's <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate, which this time confirmed Matthews by one vote, 24 to 23. Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889. His opinion in Yick Wo v. Hopkins in 1886 advanced his and Hayes' views on the protection of ethnic minorities' rights.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the town}} closed the bridge {{as it was}} deemed unsafe and badly deteriorated. It was {{estimated}} that $72,000 {{would be needed to}} relocate the bridge. In February 1999, an eight-member committee was tasked with planning a municipal park on the site. First Selectman Paul Brycki, hoped that the pending <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places would help obtain grant money to repair the bridge. Prior to February 1999, the historic bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot near the town hall and a replacement bridge was installed. The bridge was also on the state of Connecticut's historic register list.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 York's {{city council}} {{and a number}} of {{heritage}} organisations submitted a bid for York's entire city centre to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This <b>nomination,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport would have included York on a list of tentative sites to be reviewed by UNESCO itself. York's bid failed, leading to 'disappointment' from the team involved. This indirectly led to the city making a successful bid {{to be part of the}} UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a city of Media Arts. It is the fourth of these cities, following Lyon, France; Enghien-les-Bains, France; and Sapporo, Japan.|$|E
5|$|James Baird Weaver {{grew up on}} the Iowa frontier, and was {{involved}} with the Republican Party from its early days in the late 1850s. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the Union Army. Weaver saw action at the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and Resaca, and rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general. After the war, he continued to be active in Iowa Republican politics. Weaver sought <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives and the Governorship, but each time was defeated by candidates from the party's more conservative faction, led by William B. Allison. He campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, but also attended the 1876 Greenback National Convention as an observer.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{never gave}} up on a return to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with the Democratic candidate, Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E

50|$|In 1803, Trimble {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Bourbon County in the Kentucky House of Representatives.

5|$|McCreary {{campaigned for}} Democrat William Goebel during the {{controversial}} 1899 gubernatorial campaign. Between 1900 and 1912, he represented Kentucky at four consecutive Democratic National Conventions. Governor J. C. W. Beckham and his well-established political machine supported McCreary's <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate in 1902. His opponent, incumbent William J. Deboe, {{had been elected}} as a compromise candidate six years earlier, becoming Kentucky's first-ever Republican senator. Deboe had done little to secure support from legislators since his election, however, and McCreary was easily elected {{by a vote of}} 95‚Äì30. Following his election to the Senate, McCreary supported Beckham's gubernatorial re-election bid in 1903. In a largely undistinguished term as a senator, he continued to advocate the free coinage of silver and tried to advance the state's agricultural interests.|$|E
5|$|Member {{states may}} choose to {{maintain}} a list of tentative sites that the World Heritage Committee may consider for <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> list of World Heritage Sites. Only sites previously listed on a country's tentative list may be nominated to the World Heritage List. Madagascar has recorded seven sites on its tentative list. The names and descriptions of all tentative sites are recorded by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in the language selected by the nominating country. Tentative sites in Madagascar are named and described in French and have been unofficially translated below.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the inefficacy of the 1914 session was that McCreary was engaged in a {{three-way}} primary race for the Democratic <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senate. The other major candidates were former Governor Beckham and Augustus O. Stanley; a fourth candidate, David H. Smith, withdrew early from the race. McCreary ran a mostly positive campaign, touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents. Beckham and Stanley, however, were bitter political and personal enemies, and the campaign reflected their animosity. Without the support of Beckham's political machine that had helped him in the gubernatorial contest, McCreary never had a realistic chance to win the nomination. Beckham secured the nomination with 72,677 votes to Stanley's 65,871 and McCreary's 20,257.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the House of Delegates, the Senate has {{the sole}} {{responsibility}} in the state's legislative branch for confirming gubernatorial appointees to positions that require confirmation. After the Governor forwards his <b>nomination</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate, the Executive Nominations Committee reviews the nominee and makes a recommendation for confirmation or rejection to the Senate as a whole. Only one gubernatorial nominee in recent history has been rejected; Lynn Buhl, nominated as Maryland Secretary of the Environment by Governor Robert Ehrlich, was rejected over concerns about her qualifications. The Senate also has sole responsibility for trying any persons that have been impeached by the House of Delegates. They must be sworn in before such a trial takes place, and a two-thirds majority is required for conviction of the impeached person.|$|E
