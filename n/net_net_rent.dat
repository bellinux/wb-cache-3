Firing of high-level transitions may involve firing of object <b>net</b> transitions, transporting object <b>net</b> tokens through the high-level <b>net,</b> and applying <b>net</b> transformation rules to object <b>nets.</b> <b>Net</b> transformations include <b>net</b> modifications such as merging or splitting of object <b>nets,</b> and <b>net</b> refinement.

The mean CPUE for pooled data of all gears was 2. 247 ± 0. 265 kg. gear- 1 day- 1 and 2. 697 ± 0. 355 kg. gear- 1 day- 1 for 2007 and 2008 respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this {{contribution}} is to give an overview of constructions and results for Petri <b>net</b> transformations in the ≫Petri <b>Net</b> Baukasten ≪ developed by the “DFG-Forschergruppe Petrinetz-Technologie”. The two main concepts of Petri <b>net</b> transformations considered in this context are <b>net</b> class and <b>net</b> model transformations. In both cases we present first the relevance of transformations in the application developer view and them the technical constructions and results in the expert view of the ≫Petri <b>Net</b> Baukasten≪. <b>Net</b> class transformations are transformations between different Petri <b>net</b> classes, like elementary <b>nets,</b> place/transition <b>nets</b> and algebraic high-level <b>nets.</b> <b>Net</b> model transformations {{on the other hand}} are transformations of the <b>net</b> structure for <b>nets</b> within one Petri <b>net</b> class, like place or transition refinement. The main technical results are concerning the preservation of safety resp. liveness properties of <b>net</b> model transformations and compatibility results between <b>net</b> class and <b>net</b> model transformations. The relevance of the constructions and results for the application developer view is demonstrated by a small case study modeling the interaction of a buffer, a printer and a communication unit consisting of secure and non-secure channels. Finally we give an overview of other concepts of transformations: On one hand, transformations between Petri <b>nets</b> and other system modeling techniques, {{and on the other hand}} transformations between different <b>net</b> representation formats using XML-schemes and DTD-standards. ...|$|R

Fishing rods with baited hooks and fishing lines used in various ways are used for fishing for some particular types of fish. Fishing using <b>nets</b> like cast <b>nets,</b> hand <b>nets,</b> drift <b>nets,</b> gillnets, seine <b>nets,</b> trawl <b>nets,</b> surrounding <b>nets</b> etc. of various sizes and construction as well as longline fishing with hundreds of hooks on a line fishing both for bottom and pelagic fish (near surface fish) are the most common devices used to catch high yields of fish. The crab fisheries uses crab pots baited with dead fish to catch crabs.In some parts of the Pacific Northwest, fishing with baited traps is also common. Common commercial methods for catching shrimp and prawns include bottom trawling, cast <b>nets,</b> seines, shrimp baiting and dip <b>netting.</b> Bottom trawling often tears up the ocean bottom and can be very destructive to all bottom dwelling fish. Trawling involves the use of a system of <b>nets</b> deployed on or near the sea floor. Benthic trawling is towing or dragging a <b>net</b> at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a <b>net</b> just above the benthic zone. Midwater trawling (pelagic trawling) is trawling, or <b>net</b> fishing nearer the surface of the ocean.|$|R
