Additionally, we investigated whether insecticide-sprayed refuges of non-Bt crops would delay or accelerate resistance to the Bt crop. We used a system of Bt broccoli expressing Cry 1 Ac, a population of the pest Plutella xylostella with a low frequency of individuals resistant to Cry 1 Ac and the insecticide spinosad, and a natural enemy, Coleomegilla maculata, to conduct experiments over multiple generations. The results demonstrated that after 6 generations P. xylostella populations were very low in the treatment containing C. maculata and unsprayed <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> plants. Furthermore, resistance to Bt plants evolved significantly slower in this treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte {{is a major}} pest of {{corn and}} causes over a billion dollars of {{economic}} loss annually through yield reductions and management costs. Corn producing toxins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has been developed to help manageD. v. virgifera. However, previous studies have demonstrated the ability of this species to evolve resistance to Bt toxins in both laboratory and field settings. RESULTS: We used an experimental evolution approach to test the refuge strategies for delaying resistance of D. v. virgifera to corn producing Bt toxin Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1. In the absence of refuges, D. v. virgifera developed resistance to Bt corn after three generations of selection. In some cases, <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuges</b> reduced the level of resistance compared with the strain selected {{in the absence of}} refuges, but refuge strains did show reduced susceptibility to Bt corn compared with the unselected strain. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuges</b> delayed resistance to Bt corn by D. v. virgifera in some cases but not others. Combining the refuge strategy with pyramids of multiple Bt toxins and applying other pest management strategies will likely be necessary to delay resistance of D. v. virgifera to Bt corn...|$|R

Late planted corn is more vulnerable to losses from first generation European corn borer. Growers will need to watch the late planted crop carefully. Fortunately, much of the late planted corn has Bt for corn borer control. But farms using Bt corn will also need to have a <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> that is at least 20 % the size of the entire corn field. The <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> is designed to slow the development of resistance by the pests to the Bt corn.

Moths that will be laying eggs for the second generation of these pests are active now and growers will need to monitor fields in the coming weeks. Because of the wet spring and early summer, corn planting was delayed in many corn fields. Late planted corn is late harvested corn. This increases potential losses to corn borers late in the season.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{analyzes}} {{effects of}} insect-resistant Bt cotton on pesticide use and agricultural productivity in Argentina. Based on farm survey data, it is {{shown that the}} technology reduces application rates of toxic chemicals by 50 per cent, while significantly increasing yields. Using a damage control framework, the effectiveness of Bt versus chemical pesticides is estimated, and technological impacts are predicted for different farm types. Gross benefits could be highest for smallholder farmers, who are not currently using the technology. The durability of the advantages is analyzed by using biological models to simulate resistance development in pest populations. Rapid resistance buildup and associated pest outbreaks appear to be unlikely if minimum <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> areas are maintained. Thus, promoting a more widespread diffusion of Bt cotton could amplify the efficiency, equity, and environmental gains. Conclusive statements about the technology’s sustainability, however, require longer-term monitoring of possible secondary effects and farmers ’ behavior in maintaining refuges. 1...|$|E

Corn Belt. Widespread planting of Bt corn places intense selection pressure on target insects to develop resistance, and evolution of resistance threatens to erode benefits associated with Bt corn, such as reduced reliance on conventional insecticides. Recognizing the threat of resistance, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency requires seed companies to include an insect resistance management (IRM) plan when registering a Bt trait. The goal of IRM plans is to delay Bt resistance in populations of target insects. One element of IRM {{is the presence of}} a <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> to maintain Bt-susceptible individuals within a population, and growers are required to implement IRM on-farm by planting a refuge. Field-evolved resistance has not been detected for the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), even though this species has been exposed to Bt proteins common in U. S. corn hybrids since 1996. The IRM situation is unfolding differently for Bt corn targeting the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte. In this article, we examine the scientific evidence for D. v. virgifera resistance to Bt rootworm traits and the cropping system practices that have contributed to the first reports of field-evolved resistance to a Bt toxin by D. v. virgifera.

40|$|Transgenic {{crops that}} express {{insecticide}} genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used worldwide against moth and beetle pests. Because these engineered plants can kill over 95 % of susceptible larvae, they can rapidly select for resistance. Here, {{we use a}} model for a pyramid two-toxin Bt crop to explore the consequences of spatio-temporal variation in the area of Bt crop and <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> habitat. We show that variability over time in the proportion of suitable non-Bt breeding habitat, Q, or in the total area of Bt and suitable non-Bt habitat, K, can increase the overall rate of resistance evolution by causing short-term surges of intense selection. These surges can be exacerbated when temporal variation in Q and/or K cause high larval densities in refuges that increase density-dependent mortality; this will give resistant larvae in Bt fields a relative advantage over susceptible larvae that largely depend on refuges. We address the effects of spatio-temporal variation in a management setting for two bollworm pests of cotton, Helicoverpa armigera and H. punctigera, and field data on landscape crop distributions from Australia. Even a small proportion of Bt fields available to egg-laying females when refuges are sparse may result in high exposure to Bt for just a single generation per year and cause a surge in selection. Therefore, rapid resistance evolution can occur when Bt crops are rare rather than common in the landscape. These results highlight the need to understand spatio-temporal fluctuations in the landscape composition of Bt crops and non-Bt habitats in order to design effective resistance management strategies...|$|E
40|$|Widespread {{planting}} of crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) imposes selection on many key agricultural pests to evolve resistance to Bt. Fitness costs can slow {{the evolution of}} Bt resistance. We examined effects of entomopathogenic nematodes on fitness costs of Bt resistance in the pink bollworm,Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a major pest of cotton,Gossypium hirsutum L., in the southwestern United States that is currently controlled by transgenic cotton that produces Bt toxin Cry 1 Ac. We tested whether the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) affected fitness costs of resistance to Cry 1 Ac in two laboratory-selected hybrid strains of pink bollworm reared on non-Bt cotton bolls. The nematode S. riobrave imposed a recessive fitness cost for one strain, and H. bacteriophora imposed a fitness cost affecting heterozygous resistant individuals for the other strain. Activity of phenoloxidase, {{an important component of}} insects 2 ̆ 7 immune response, did not differ between Bt-resistant and Bt-susceptible families. This suggests phenoloxidase does not affect susceptibility to entomopathogenic nematodes in Bt-resistant pink bollworm. Additionally, phenoloxidase activity does not contribute to Bt resistance, as has been found in some species. We conclude that other mechanisms cause higher nematode-imposed mortality for pink bollworm with Bt resistance genes.

Here we used {{simulation}} modeling {{to explore the}} consequences of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow in cotton fields {{on the evolution of}} resistance in a generic pest. We modeled a landscape of 0. 5 -ha fields where growers used farm-saved seed, as could often occur in the developing world. Specifically, we examined the effects of moderate and high gene flow rates, larval feeding behavior, dominance of resistance, refuge type and abundance, and the interactions among these factors. With either completely dominant or completely recessive inheritance of resistance, gene flow among plants and larval feeding behavior had limited practical impact on resistance evolution. With intermediate dominance, however, moderate or high gene flow among plants substantially accelerated resistance evolution in some simulations where <b>non-Bt</b> cotton <b>refuges</b> were 5 or 20 % of the cotton acreage. The acceleration was usually greater when larvae moved and fed indiscriminately among Bt and non-Bt cotton plants than when larvae were sedentary or discriminated among plant types. Adding alternative host plant refuges to the landscape delayed resistance, while increasing the <b>non-Bt</b> cotton <b>refuge</b> from 20 to 50 % of the cotton acreage had positive, negative, or neutral effects, depending on dominance, the amount of alternative host plant refuges, and larval feeding behavior. The results suggest that, under certain conditions, reducing gene flow between refuges and Bt crops could help delay pest resistance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Crops {{producing}} insecticidal toxins {{derived from}} the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are widely planted to manage insect pests. Bt crops can provide an effective tool for pest management; however, the evolution of Bt resistance can diminish this benefit. The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis H€ubner, is a significant pest of maize and is widely managed with Bt maize in the Midwest of the United States. When Bt crops are grown in conjunction with <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuges,</b> fitness costs of Bt resistance can delay the evolution of resistance. Importantly, fitness costs often vary with ecological factors, including host-plant genotype and diapause. In this study, we examined fitness costs associated with Cry 1 F resistance in O. nubilalis when insects were reared on three maize lines. Fitness costs were tested in two experiments. One experiment assessed the fitness costs when Cry 1 F-resistant and Cry 1 F-susceptible insects were reared on plants as larvae and experienced diapause. The second experiment tested resistant, susceptible and F 1 heterozygotes that were reared on plants but did not experience diapause. Despite some evidence of greater adult longevity for Cry 1 F-resistant insects, these insects produced fewer fertile eggs than Cry 1 F-susceptible insects, and this occurred independent of diapause. Reduced fecundity was not detected among heterozygous individuals, which indicated that this fitness cost was recessive. Additionally, maize lines {{did not affect the}} magnitude of this fitness cost.

40|$|Transgenic crops expressing insecticidal toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{have been}} {{deployed}} in agricultural landscapes around the globe. While the key strategy to delay resistance is the mandatory planting of a <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> crop that is preferred by the target pest, the efficacy of this resistance management strategy across different landscape contexts over time is rarely considered. Here, we develop an individual-based model to simulate the spatio-temporal distribution of a highly mobile, polyphagous, global pest, Helicoverpa spp, across agricultural landscapes dominated by transgenic cotton. The simulation model allows us to explore refuge ‘electivity’, the relative utilization of refuge habitat by female Helicoverpa, in relation to Bt cotton habitat. Refuge electivity is an emergent function of egg distributions resulting from individual moth behavior, within multiple landscapes during different seasons and crop phenology. The individual-based model is validated against independent data collected from the field. Our findings suggest that refuge electivity is sensitive to the spatial and temporal context of the attractiveness of host crops in the landscape and the preferences of the moths. The attractiveness of mandated refuges, such as pigeon pea relative to Bt cotton, influences how effective {{they are in the}} landscape. Dynamics between other host crops, such as sorghum, also play an important role that varies over time and space. We use the model to identify scenarios where refuge strategies are likely to be most effective in terms of boosting susceptible populations and increasing landscape movement (genetic mixing). This dynamic approach has potential to inform better refuge design for Bt resistance management across a wide range of landscape contexts. For example, these findings justify the removal of sorghum as an option for mandated refuge in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Bt cotton in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Mason,Charles E. The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), {{is a major}} {{lepidopteran}} pest {{of maize}} in the United States and Canada. One {{of the most effective}} control methods for ECB is the use of transgenic crops that encode for insecticidal crystalline (Cry) proteins that are derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The continued effective use of Bt corn relies on compliance with insect resistance management practices; where planting a small percentage of <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuge</b> corn adjacent to or as seed blends within Bt corn fields provides a population of susceptible insects that can mate with rare resistant individuals. Little is known about how these non-Bt plant blends affect movement behaviors of ECB in the third instar, an intermediary stage where the larva begins to bore into corn stalks. The objective of my study was to assess and characterize the amount of movement off of infested plants in the field using a variety of five plant arrays containing lepidopteran Bt corn plants and non-lepidopteran protein marked refuge corn plants. Additional studies sought to determine the presence and persistence of three different Bt Cry proteins in third instars using monoclonal ELISA test strips. Based on two years of field movement studies I found that the range of third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a Cry 1 Ab corn plant is approximately 30 % to 65 %. The range for third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a Cry 1 F corn plant was approximately 20 % to 60 %, and that the range for third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a non-lepidopteran protein marked refuge corn plant was about 6 % to 18 %. The range of movement off of the infested plant for the protein marked refuge plants was consistent with that for near isoline control plants. The lepidopteran targeted Bt Cry proteins were found to be consistently detected for seven sampling points over a 24 hour feeding period. However, the non-lepidopteran Bt Cry proteins could not be consistently detected over the same 24 hour period. Additionally, the persistence of Bt plant material in third instars varied depending on the Cry protein. Future research using ELISA plate methods could yield more consistent results for the non-lepidopteran Bt Cry proteins. University of Delaware, Department of EntomologyM. S...|$|E

In conjunction with <b>non-Bt</b> <b>refuges,</b> fitness costs of Bt resistance can delay resistance evolution. Fitness costs arise in the absence of Bt toxin when individuals with resistance alleles have lower fitness than Btsusceptible genotypes. We quantified the level of resistance and fitness costs of resistance for a strain of western corn rootworm with laboratoryselected resistance to transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) producing Bt toxin Cry 3 Bb 1. Survival to adulthood on Cry 3 Bb 1 maize was more than twofold higher for resistant insects vs. susceptible insects, which is similar to the magnitude of resistance first observed in the field. Fitness costs were measured in two experiments; the first used maize hybrids and the second used inbred lines. The experiment with maize hybrids compared resistant and susceptible strains while the experiment with maize inbreds compared resistant, susceptible and heterozygous genotypes. The only nonrecessive fitness cost detected (i. e. cost affecting heterozygotes) was for adult size. Recessive fitness costs (i. e. costs affecting the resistant strain) were observed for developmental rate, female survival and egg viability. However, when reared on non-Bt maize, the resistant strain also displayed higher fecundity, higher survival for males and greater adult longevity compared to the susceptible strain.

Because of Bt crops’ high pest control efficacy, there is concern that pests will develop resistance to Bt toxins so that Bt crops are less or no longer effective. To delay the evolution of resistance, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently requires Bt crop growers to also plant non-Bt (conventional) crops on a minimum percentage of their total Bt crop acreage as a refuge for susceptible (Bt toxin sensitive) pests. Refuge allows susceptible pests to survive and mate with resistant adults surviving on Bt crops and so slows the development of resistance in the pest population. The existing literature on the welfare analysis of Bt crops generally does not {{consider the fact that}} planting Bt crops not only increases the yields of Bt crops themselves but can also increase the yields of non-Bt (conventional/refuge) crops by reducing pests pressure. For example, based on annual population surveys of European corn borer (the most widespread insect pest throughout the U. S. Corn Belt) from the initial invasion of the pest into the Midwestern United States in the 1940 s through the commercial adoption of Bt corn during the period 1996 to 2009, Hutchison et al. (2010) showed that ECB populations have declined relative to the pre-Bt era since commercialization of Bt corn, particularly since 2002. The existing literature typically claims that Bt crop producers are possibly winners if the yield increasing effect of the Bt crop beats the price reducing effect. However, conventional crop producers are sure to lose since the price reducing effect — the only effect comes to play for them — reduces their economic surplus. This outcome makes producers skeptical of the benefits for allowing pests to survive in <b>non-Bt</b> crop <b>refuge</b> and {{is at the root of}} the refuge compliance problem. Take Bt corn for example. Based on USDA data, Jaffe (2009) estimates that farmer compliance over all three categories of Bt corn, ECB (European corn borer), CRW(corn rootworm), and stacked hybrids, averaged 73 % for distance and 74 % for size. In other words, one out of four producers did not comply with the Bt corn refuge requirements. Failure to incorporate the positive externality of Bt crops on conventional crops in existing literature results in underestimation of consumer surplus and overestimation of Bt crops growers’ producer surplus. We model the positive externality of Bt crops on conventional crops as a kind of “technology spillover”. Therefore, planting Bt crops will shift the supply curve to the right, not only for Bt crops growers, but also for conventional crop growers, although the magnitudes should differ. Following Alston et al. (1995), we describe a framework to analyze distribution of gains from planting Bt crops in a large open economy context incorporating the technology spillover from Bt crops to conventional crops. We assume that the U. S. is a large open economy that exports crops to the rest of world. Rather than assuming specific functional forms for the supply and demand curves, we instead use a logarithmic differential approximation to solve the model. According to Alston and Wohlgenant (1990), the logarithmic differential (linear elasticity) approximation is good for small changes with constant elasticity supply and demand and is exact with linear supply and demand. We conclude that all world consumers always win due to the introduction of Bt crops since the Bt toxin is effective at increasing yield and reducing production costs. Bt crop producers might win depending on which effect (the yield increasing effect or the price reducing effect) is dominant. Conventional crop producers are no longer doomed to lose, as they might also win if the yield increasing effect of the “technology spillover” due to fewer pests outweighs the price reducing effect. This finding provides more evidence that Bt crop producers have incentives to comply with refuge policy. In the United States, corn has been the most abundant transgenic crop planted to resist insect pests and the most widespread insect pest throughout the U. S. Corn Belt has been the European corn borer which before the advent of Bt corn cost growers about $ 1 billion annually in losses and control costs. We apply the above model to analyze the distribution of gains from planting ECB Bt corn. The estimated of shift of conventional corn’s supply curve induced by planting ECB Bt corn is crucial to the economic surplus calculation. We combine information from farmer survey and USDA data to refine our estimates. We find that for year 2009, ignoring the positive externality of ECB Bt corn on conventional corn results in underestimation of world consumer surplus by 15. 64 % and overestimation of Bt corns growers’ producer surplus by 8. 43 %. The magnitude of these results indicates the importance of including the technology spillover from Bt crops to conventional crops when estimating the welfare effect of Bt crops. In addition, we find that conventional crop producers can also benefit when others use Bt technology. We see high potential for generating discussion as grower compliance with refuge policy for Bt crops continues to be a problem and has apparently gotten worse (Jaffe 2009). Our finding that both Bt and non-Bt acres can benefit from Bt crops will help encourage growers that the refuge/conventional crops that they plant can also benefit from Bt technology. welfare, Bt, pest suppression, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
