25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, San Jose International Airport (KSJC/SJC) {{was one of}} the first U.S {{airports}} to participate in the noise regulation program enacted by the U.S. Congress for delineation of airport <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> and developing a pilot study of residential sound insulation. This program showed that residences near the airport could be retrofitted cost-effectively to reduce indoor aircraft noise substantially.|$|E
50|$|An {{industrial}} estate now occupies {{much of the}} former residential area for the base. In the late 1990s, Richmond River Shire Council sought approval from the Department of Transport to subdivide land for residential development {{at the southern end}} of runway 14/32. Whilst this was approved by the department, there is substantial evidence and opinion that it was not in accordance with the original intention of the Airport Local Ownership Agreement. The residential estates encroached upon existing <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> and led to council shortening the available distance of the runway and restricting the size and type of aircraft operations. The actions of council have also been criticised by veteran's groups.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of sound}} {{exposure}} level contour area reduction has been proposed as an alternative or supplemental metric of progress and success for the NASA Quiet Aircraft Technology program, which currently uses the average of predicted noise reductions at three community locations. As the program has expanded to include reductions in airframe noise as well as reduction due to optimization of operating procedures for lower noise, there is concern that the three-point methodology may not represent a fair measure of benefit to airport communities. This paper addresses several topics related to this proposal: (1) an analytical basis for a relationship between certification noise levels and <b>noise</b> <b>contour</b> areas for departure operations is developed, (2) the relationship between predicted <b>noise</b> <b>contour</b> area and the noise levels measured or predicted at the certification measurement points is examined {{for a wide range}} of commercial and business aircraft, and (3) reductions in contour area for low-noise approach scenarios are predicted and equivalent reductions in source noise are determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} modifies the emitted {{sound waves}} of an aircraft during propagation {{and is therefore}} important in the calculation of <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> or synthesis. <b>Noise</b> <b>contours</b> present the resulting noise levels {{on the ground and}} are, as such, often applied for regulatory purposes. Aircraft noise synthesis is a technique that allows to transform a calculated prediction into audible sound that can be experienced in a virtual reality environment. Noise synthesis techniques allow people to be subjected to aircraft, routes or procedures that are still being designed. This dissertation describes recent research to improve the modeling of atmospheric propagation effects in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> as well as aircraft noise synthesis. Multi-event <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> are usually calculated with standardized models that take non-standard propagation into account in an empirical fashion. A propagation algorithm was developed to augment such a model. Signal processing steps can be applied to transform a source noise prediction into an audible result. Furthermore, such steps can be utilized to apply propagation effects to a source noise signal. For a non-standard atmosphere this is not trivial. The role of a non-standard atmosphere is described by a dedicated simulation framework developed in this dissertation. The framework is applied to a flyover to demonstrate the effects associated with multiple ray paths and shadow zones. Besides demonstrating non-standard atmospheric effects, the framework was used to create synthesized results of actual flyovers near an airport. Subsequently, a comparison between measured results and synthesized results was executed. Furthermore, a method was designed to include the effect of turbulence-induced coherence loss of the direct and ground reflected ray in noise synthesis.

50|$|London’s {{largest and}} only hub airport, Heathrow, has been {{operating}} at almost full capacity since 1993. The two-runway airport is less than 20 miles west of Central London and is completely surrounded by urban development, leaving no room to build additional runways to cater for additional air passenger demand. Due to the UK’s prevailing southwesterly winds, aircraft predominately approach Heathrow over Central London.

Extended vertical rise of VTOL aircraft as a method of limiting the intense noise exposure to the terminal area is shown to be only partially effective as well as costly. Comparisons are made of <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> for conceptual V/STOL transports for several PNdB criteria.

50|$|In {{the case}} of airport expansions, courts {{consistently}} upheld {{the sovereignty of the}} FAA over the EPA, in allowing air traffic needs to be met over environmental concerns. Thus airports were required to study impacts of air traffic and facilities expansions and provide detailed <b>noise</b> <b>contour</b> maps, but in the final analysis the EPA exposure guidelines only advisory in nature. To respond to the shortcomings of the voluntary guidelines, FAA created a well funded program to insulate thousands of homes in the vicinity of major airports. The program was based upon computer modeling of alternative insulation strategies, calculated on a house-by- house basis. While this program did nothing to mitigate exterior sound levels, it benefited residential interiors significantly.|$|R

40|$|One {{might expect}} that houses closer to an airport and those in higher {{minority}} population neighborhoods experience more airport noise. We find evidence supporting these conjectures when estimating a standard ordered probit model for houses sold near the Atlanta airport. However, because the various neighborhood demographics surrounding the airport can be heterogeneous, and the <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> are not necessarily correlated with distance in certain neighborhoods, we hypothesize that the impacts of explanatory variables on the probability of greater noise vary across space. We explore spatial heterogeneity by estimating ordered probit locally weighted regressions (OPLWR). These results differ from those using a standard ordered probit model. Moreover, we find notable differences in parameter estimates for different observations (i. e., houses). Even in relatively small areas, our results imply that the standard ordered probit model can generate biased estimates. Airports; Regional economics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{questions}} the main techniques of mapping {{in the context}} of aircraft noise in the vicinity of airports, and compares these techniques in terms of their purpose, benefits and limitations. Then the paper describes a method to summarise radar traces of a given air transport departure or arrival route into a median route and its envelope containing 80 % of flights. This makes it possible to map global and easy-to-read maps of current air procedures around airports based on actual pathways flown by the aircraft. It also makes it possible to investigate the impact of change in aeronautical procedures on the actual geography of air routes around airports. Such maps complement <b>noise</b> <b>contour</b> maps and offer a good basis for debating aeronautical procedures at airports whose operations expose the population to noise. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Opponents of airport expansions argue that increased noise will reduce property values and lower tax bases. The results of this paper suggest that aircraft are becoming so much quieter that the airport can be expanded without causing a drop in local property values or tax bases.

Established by the FAA in the early 1980s, this program evaluated the cost effectiveness of reducing interior sound levels for homes near the airport, within the 65 CNEL <b>noise</b> <b>contour.</b> The program made use of a noise computer model to predict improvement in specific residential interiors for a variety of noise control strategies. This pilot program was conducted for a neighborhood in South San Francisco and success was achieved in all of the homes analyzed.
