5|$|A {{graduate}} of Center High School and the University of Iowa, Vlasic was selected 88th in the 1987 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. He was a backup for Dan Fouts {{during his first}} season, then started two games the following year. After <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> playing time in 1989, Vlasic started the season opener in 1990, his last year with San Diego. He played for two seasons with Kansas City and one with Tampa Bay, but was released in 1994, having not had actual playing time since 1991.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the appeal}} of the Polish Four-Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army, and <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> much {{opportunity}} to advance in his military career in the now-peaceful Saxony, on 28 June 1792 he joined the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of podpułkownik and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice-brigadier. Joining in the final weeks of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, he did not see combat in it. Unfamiliar with the intricasies of Polish politics, like many of Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792.|$|E

While in school Vázquez met and befriended Fernando Cisneros Carrillo. The {{friendship}} between the two was so strong that they considered each other brothers, and Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez as one of their own children. After leaving school they both went their separate ways, <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym.|$|E

Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|After {{a time of}} <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> Tigerstar, Sasha {{returns to}} her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E

5|$|Australia's {{working class}} culture also {{influenced}} {{that of the}} AIF. Approximately three-quarters of AIF volunteers {{were members of the}} working class, with a high proportion also being trade unionists, and soldiers frequently applied their attitudes to industrial relations to the Army. Throughout the war there were incidents where soldiers refused to undertake tasks that they considered demeaning or protested against actual or perceived mistreatment by their officers. These actions were similar to the strikes many soldiers had taken part in during their pre-enlistment employment, with the men <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> themselves as mutineers. The protests which occurred in 1918 over the planned disbandment of several battalions also used similar tactics to those employed in industrial disputes. Historian Nathan Wise has judged that the frequent use of industrial action in the AIF led to improved conditions for the soldiers, and contributed to it having a less strict military culture than was common in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Cisneros Carrillo {{was born}} on August 25, 1932, son of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz Isabel Carrillo Iñiguez in the Lagunero town of Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. While in school Cisneros met and befriended José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal, a {{friendship}} that was close that they considered each other's brothers. The friendship between the two {{was so strong that}} Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez as one of their own children. After leaving school they both went their separate ways, <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym where Cisnero met with some success as a Golden Gloves boxer. Cisnero was also an avid cyclist, having participated in the first ever Vuelta Coahula bicycle race. Late in life he credited training as a boxer and cyclist for his stamina in the ring.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Auerbach relinquished {{his general}} {{managing}} duties and became president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics. In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game 2 {{hero in the}} finals against the Lakers, for Seattle's first round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston in the finals for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, the pick acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias from Maryland, arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach's stellar career. With the team's star players still in their prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> me, that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. Heading into the draft, the Capitals had only five picks due {{to a variety of}} trades, which was tied for the fewest in {{franchise}} history. Believing that they had prospect depth in their organization and <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> an available player who could help immediately, Washington traded their first round pick for Troy Brouwer. With just late round selections remaining, the Capitals decided to take players that required time to develop. Three of their four picks were in, or set to attend, college. Fourth-round pick Steffen Soberg, the lone player not attending college, played in the GET-ligaen, Norway's highest level of competition. At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships, he posted the second-highest save percentage in the tournament and was considered one of Norway's top three players, though no Norwegian goaltender has ever played an NHL game.|$|E
5|$|The first {{portion of}} the 827th to be {{deployed}} for combat was a single company {{in support of the}} 714th Tank Battalion of the 12th Armored Division, on 20 December 1944. Failing to see action, the company was withdrawn to reserve after three days on the line. Discipline proved to be a problem during this period, with men abandoning their guns to collect firewood, despite assistance and advice from the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion (an experienced and well-regarded black unit operating in the same area). A second company was used for screening purposes {{in the first week of}} January, also <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> combat, while the remainder of the battalion narrowly avoided being assigned to an indirect-fire role it was completely unprepared for.|$|E

5|$|While {{keeping his}} {{involvement}} with Waters's underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After charging them for a major repair to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated it from {{him and told him}} that they would not continue to financially support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and then disappeared, <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that he was fine, but on none did he leave a return address. Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris's doctor, who prescribed the southern state's warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris's muscular dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|During the ordeal, several forward air-controllers {{were sent}} out to make low passes over Khâm Đức, to locate the CCT, without success. Then, in {{response}} to a call for the nearest aircraft to land on the runway to search for the stranded CCT, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred J. Jeanotte approached the airfield from the south and landed his C-123 on the runway with support from fighter-bombers, which were used to suppress enemy fire. <b>Not</b> <b>seeing</b> the men, Jeanotte applied full power and took off to avoid taking hits from North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire. As the C-123 rolled past the CCT's position, the three men came out of their position chasing the aircraft with their arms waving. Believing that the aircraft had missed them, the three men ran back to the ditch {{on the left side of}} the runway. As the C-123 was airborne, Jeanotte banked his aircraft to the left, and that enabled the aircrew to see the three men running back towards the ditch. However, Jeanotte was deterred from making another attempt at landing, because of low fuel. The next C-123 in line, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Joe M. Jackson, landed on the runway as fire swept through the Khâm Đức facility, and the aircrew were able to extract the stranded CCT under heavy fire, and they flew out to Đà Nẵng. By 17:00, the evacuation was over. On 13 May, 60 B-52s bombed the Khâm Đức camp.|$|E
5|$|He ran in {{the primary}} {{elections}} of the Justicialist Party (PJ) for the 1989 presidential elections. Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, prevailed in both the primary and the main elections and became {{the new president of}} Argentina. Rodríguez Saá was elected to the Constituent Assembly that drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. He attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1995 presidential elections against Menem, who was seeking re-election. <b>Not</b> <b>seeing</b> any chance of prevailing against the president, he abandoned his candidacy. He also attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections, and resigned his candidacy again, this time on behalf of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Duhalde lost the elections to the radical Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodríguez Saá was again re-elected as governor. He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the mayor was a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Before Hope and Liam's {{official}} legal {{wedding in}} the United States, Steffy spends {{a night on}} the town with Liam. Hope finds out and leaves Liam. Steffy and Liam are reunited, and she soon finds she is pregnant in early 2013. However, she keeps it to herself when she sees Hope and Liam kissing. Liam finds out about the pregnancy and recommits himself to Steffy, but shortly after their wedding she who loses the baby in a motorbike accident. Steffy then learns that her accident has left her infertile. Devastated, Steffy decides to divorce Liam and relocate to Paris. She returns to Los Angeles several months later for a brief visit, informing Liam that her infertility issues have been corrected, hoping that it could mean a second chance for them. Despite this, Liam insists that he is obligated to Hope, and Steffy leaves town again. After another short visit to Los Angeles in February 2015, Steffy returns months later to help Ridge take over Forrester Creations by overthrowing Rick. She becomes president of the company and rekindles her romance with Liam, ending his relationship with her cousin, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer). Steffy's cousin, Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), resents Steffy, attributed to the fact that Taylor had accidentally killed her mother, Darla (Schae Harrison), years ago in car accident. An unstable Aly attempts to kill Steffy on PCH, resulting in Steffy killing Aly with a tire iron in self-defense. However, Ivy recorded a video of the accident on her phone, <b>not</b> <b>seeing</b> the rock Steffy killed Aly with. Ivy gets involved with Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks) and Ivy blackmails Steffy with the video, calling the accident a murder. Ivy decides to delete the video after Steffy tries to convince Wyatt to delete it. Thomas tells Steffy that he made out with Ivy while Wyatt was on a business trip. Steffy confronts Ivy and convinces her to tell Wyatt but tells Wyatt before Ivy has a chance. Wyatt breaks up with her and Ivy is angry at Steffy and confronts her in front of a broken electrical panel, resulting in an altercation in which Ivy gets electrocuted. Ivy survives and files a restraining order against Steffy while Wyatt resumes his relationship with Ivy. Ivy realized she never got over Liam and convinces Liam to give them another chance if she drops the restraining order. Quinn overhears Ivy telling Liam she loves him and exposes this in front of Steffy and Liam while Wyatt is proposing to Ivy. Wyatt breaks up with Ivy and she packs her bags for Australia. On top of the staircase, Steffy confronts Ivy and she tumbles down. Liam is angry at Steffy and breaks up with her. Liam hits his head on the plane with Ivy, while Wyatt comforts Steffy. Liam disappears (he was really kidnapped by Quinn after having passed out due to concussion symptoms he acquired by hitting his head while on a plane and passing out in the parking lot of Forrester Creations and losing his memory as a result) and Wyatt tells her that Liam must have once again let her down. He shows her how to have fun by surfing on the beach and even buys her a motorcycle, which she hasn't driven since her miscarriage. The two fall in love and eventually get married on the beach. Steffy's marriage to Wyatt eventually breaks down due to their differing opinions about Quinn and they separate while Steffy contemplates divorcing Wyatt. She eventually rekindles her love and relationship with Liam, Liam proposes to Steffy and she accepts, and after Steffy's divorce from Wyatt was finalized, Steffy & Liam got married in Sydney; Australia.|$|E
