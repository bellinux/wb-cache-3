The seeding polymerization is rapid and suitable for bulk quantities production [165]. The synthesized polyaniline nanofibers were found to be high in capacitance. Template synthesis include hard template (i.e. zeolite) and soft template (i.e. water soluble polymers [166], gels [167] and liquid crystalline polymers [168]).

30|$|Nanotubes made {{of carbon}} and diverse {{inorganic}} compounds have continuously attracted significant attention {{due to their}} unique fundamental physical properties and many potential applications [1 – 3]. Inorganic nanotube generation strategy can generally be classified into two categories: first, one-step self-organization such as self-rolling and/or Ostwald ripening; second, two-step template-based fabrication through either scarification or recently developed solid-state reaction utilizing the Kirkendall effect [4 – 6]. From a viewpoint of final device integration, aligned nanotube arrays are highly desirable. In addition to the direct epitaxial growth of nanotube arrays on lattice-matched substrates, a solid-state reaction under thermal annealing and using readily available <b>nanostructure</b> arrays as <b>templates</b> could be {{an efficient way to}} generate novel chemically complex, multiphase nanotube arrays.

A plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD) system with CH 4 precursor was used to deposit DLC films on Si and quartz substrates. These films were then characterized using Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), nanoindentation, and contact angle measurement. By varying the RF power and pressure of the PECVD, DLC films with good uniformity, smooth surfaces (< 0. 2 nm RMS), low surface energy (~ 40 mJ/m 2), and high hardness (~ 22 GPa) were achieved. Nanoimprint lithography and liftoff process were used to pattern Cr mask on DLC films.

40|$|Anodic {{aluminum}} oxide (AAO) {{has been successfully}} used to fabricate a variety of well-ordered, regular nanostructured systems {{for a range of}} applications including electrochemical energy storage technologies. Template synthesized nanomaterials based on AAO can lead to well-designed nanoarchitectures composed of multiple favorable (high energy capacity, high electrical conductivity, strong mechanical strength) electrical energy storage materials and also one and three dimensional. Combining nanomaterials within a single system to form heterogeneous nanostructures leads to synergic effects unrealized with single components. Adding dimensionality to nanostructures potentially offers drastic improvements in both energy density and power density. This dissertation describes the design, fabrication, and characterization of heterogeneous nanostructures based on AAO template synthesis methods for use as supercapacitor electrodes. The first approach utilizes two straightforward deposition techniques, atomic layer deposition and electrochemical deposition, for the construction of MnO 2 /TiN nanotube arrays. Both the inner and outer surfaces of the nanotubes, where the charge storage takes place, are exploited for enhanced capacitance. The second approach uses a novel well-ordered three-dimensional <b>nanostructured</b> <b>template</b> based on the modification of AAO during pore formation.

30|$|Graphene, {{a single}} layer of an sp 2 -hybridized carbon film, has drawn great {{attention}} {{in the last few}} years, as it possesses unique optoelectronic properties, such as high carrier mobility, zero band gap, and frequency-independent absorption. These properties facilitate its potential applications in the field of nanoelectronics, nanocomposites, chemical sensors, biosensors, and photodetectors [1 – 6]. However, the zero energy gap of graphene limits its applications in electronic and photonic devices. Consequently, it is highly desirable to open the energy gap of graphene and in turn improve the Ion/Ioff ratio [7]. It is universally acknowledged that the band gap of graphene can be tuned by various methods, including application of an electric (or magnetic) field to the bilayered graphene [8, 9], chemical doping [10], application of strain [11], and reshaping of the nanostructure of graphene [12 – 14]. For example, in 2017, Cheng et al. introduced the chemically regulative graphene with incorporated heteroatoms into the honeycomb lattice and demonstrated microstructure-tailored nanosheets (e.g., 0 D quantum dots, 1 D nanoribbons, and 2 D nanomeshes), which enlarged the band gap and induced special chemical and physical properties of graphene, further presenting promising applications in actuators and power generators [15]. However, among all the methods that tuned the band gap of graphene, reshaping the nanostructure of graphene is currently the most convenient way [16], as it minimizes the inherent electronic properties of graphene [17]. The properties of graphene are reshaped when it is scaled to nanostructures, such as a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) [18 – 20], graphene nanoring, and graphene nanomesh [21 – 24]. Sun et al. proposed a simple method to open a comparable band gap in graphene by narrowing it down into a GNR and employed it in FETs, achieving large Ion/Ioff ratios of ~[*] 47 and ~[*] 105 at room temperature and 5.4  K, respectively [12]. However, the fabrication of long, narrow GNRs is difficult, which will be an obstacle in the application of nanoelectronic devices. Graphene nanomesh (GNM), a simpler nanostructure to fabricate, can open up a band gap in large graphene sheets, and the FETs based on GNMs can support currents nearly 100 times greater than individual GNR devices [25]. In 2017, Yang et al. utilized a mesoporous silica (meso-SiO 2) template for the preparation of GNM FETs with improved on/off ratios, constructing highly sensitive biosensors for selective detection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. This further proved that it is an effective method to tailor the graphene into the GNM to open the band gap [26]. In general, GNMs can be fabricated by nanoimprint lithography, template-assisted lithography technology, and self-organized growth [27]. Haghiri’s group reported the fabrication of a large surface GNM applied to label-free DNA detection by nanoimprint lithography [22]. Nevertheless, the neck width of the GNM was too large (~[*] 260  nm) to open the energy gap. Zang et al. demonstrated a novel template-assisted method to prepare GNM using an anodic aluminum oxide membrane as a pattern mask with the help of O 2 plasma etching [28]. Most of the GNMs are prepared by prefabricating a <b>nanostructured</b> <b>template</b> or nanoparticles as a protective mask for reshaping the graphene layer. However, the synthesis of the nanomask is relatively complex, and the neck width of the GNM is difficult to control to realize the fabrication of large-scale, uniform arrays.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuing}} development of mobile electronic devices {{and the increasing}} importance of electric vehicles (EV) drives the demand for improved batteries. Further improvements of current batteries are needed to enable novel applications. This requires new device concepts that improve battery safety, power and energy density. A solution might come from the three dimensional (3 D) all-solid-state thin film battery. 3 D thin film batteries use a <b>nanostructured</b> <b>template</b> in which the battery stack is deposited. By fabricating a thin film battery in a 3 D substrate, the total storage capacity is increased whereas the benefit of using a thin film (high power) is retained. In this work the effect of downscaling the battery components is evaluated. Such ultra-thin films {{are expected to be}} used in all-solid-state 3 D batteries. When nanoscaling battery films, different physical phenomena set in. Examples are an increased Li-ion storage capacity, changes of the electronic conductivity and a shift of the intercalation site energy. The onset of these type of phenomena in different thin film battery materials is studied in detail. The first material investigated for use in 3 D thin film batteries was the spinel structured LiMn 2 O 4. This material can store two Li+-ions in its structure, one is inserted at 4 V and one at 3 V vs Li+/Li. Currently only the 4 V region is used due to the volume expansion associated with the intercalation of the second lithium ion (at 3 V). Such volume expansion leads to cracking of the electrode and a loss of contact with the current collector. By nanoscaling LiMn 2 O 4 layers we have shown that the volume changes associated with the insertion of the Li-ion in the 3 V region can be accommodated. By preventing manganese dissolution, layers exhibiting stable cycling were shown, retaining ~ 100 % of the capacity after 70 cycles. Furthermore, the maximum theoretical capacity was measured in the thinnest films (25 nm), leading to exceptionally high capacities of 1. 2 Ah/cm 3. Attaining these storage densities has proven impossible in thicker films. Finally, the thin film LiMn 2 O 4 showed exceptional rate performance. The thinnest layers could be charged to 75 % of the theoretical capacity within 18 s (or a rate of 200 C). LixMg 1 - 2 xAl 2 +xO 4 was evaluated for use as a solid electrolyte in battery applications. The material is a lithium doped version of the classic MgAl 2 O 4 spinel. It was anticipated to possess a high Li-ion conductivity (predicted from NMR measurements and modeling). Furthermore, its spinel structure could allow the fabrication of a lattice matched battery. Matching the crystal lattices provides an optimal interface between the battery components and, as such, allows easy transport of lithium. In addition, MgAl 2 O 4 has a wide bandgap which allows the downscaling of the solid electrolyte layers, thus improving the battery's energy density. Investigation of spinel structured LixMg 1 - 2 xAl 2 +xO 4 (x= 0 to 0. 25) films showed low electronic leakage but also low ionic conductivity. This seemingly contradicted the results of cyclic voltammetry measurements which evidenced lithium plating and stripping and even lithium-platinum alloy formation. To further investigate this discrepancy, potential dependent impedance measurements were performed, showing an increase in conductivity of over 3 orders of magnitude on approaching 0. 1 V versus Li+/Li. This is explained by lithium intercalation in the LixMg 1 - 2 xAl 2 +xO 4 layers, increasing their ionic conductivity. Once a stable composition is formed, the layer acts as a solid electrolyte. Upon reversing the potential, the lithium is removed from the layer and the original resistance values are regained. In the final part of the thesis, thin films of the solid electrolyte LiPON (nitrogen doped Li 3 PO 4 glass) were investigated. The influence of sputtering conditions, film thickness and substrate material on ionic conductivity were studied. When the amount of incorporated nitrogen is increased, ionic conductivity rises and the activation energy reduces. No influence of layer thickness or substrate material was found on these quantities. In studying the electronic conductivity of LiPON with varying thickness, layers up to 15 nm LiPON were found to be electronically insulating, in contrast with other literature reports. In a next step, the breakdown characteristics of LiPON layers were investigated using I-V measurements. These showed the prevalence of a distinct constant current plateau, attributed to the dissociation of the LiPON layer and the diffusion limited Li-ion transport. During LiPON dissociation, Li+, oxygen or nitrogen gas, and a phosphate-rich compound are generated. Finally, hard breakdown is observed - {{as a result of the}} formation of lithium filaments that short the solid electrolyte layer. status: publishe...|$|E

[...] Coating the ZnO nanostructures with a ZFO aggregated layer appreciably enhanced their acetone gas-sensing capability at 250  °C in comparison with pure ZnO nanostructures. The presence of many depleted nanoscale ZFO crystallites, the rugged surface of the heterostructures, and electron depletion at the ZnO/ZFO interface might contribute to the enhanced acetone gas-sensing response. Furthermore, the larger surface area and higher light absorption of ZnO–ZFO relative to the surface area and light absorption of ZnO were correlated with a substantial enhancement of the photocurrent value of ZnO–ZFO in photoelectrochemical tests produced by the simulated solar light irradiation.|$|R

Electrochemical properties of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II/III) and ferrocene/ferricinium in the LLC were examined by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry on platinum foil and microdisk electrodes. The hexacyanoferrate showed reversible redox behaviour under diffusion control with a diffusion coefficient of 0. 5 – 1. 0 × 10 – 6 cm 2 s– 1, up to 14 times lower than in water. Ferricinium reduction, while complicated in water by precipitation of ferrocene, showed solution behaviour and normal diffusion control in the liquid crystal. Effective diffusion coefficients of ferrocene and ferrocinium in the lyotropic liquid crystal were found to be further reduced to 4 – 5 × 10 – 8 cm 2 s– 1.

40|$|Here {{we report}} on the {{development}} of an unconventional approach for the physical synthesis of laterally ordered self-organized arrays of metallic nanowires supported on <b>nanostructured</b> dielectric <b>templates.</b> The method, based on a combination of nanoscale patterning of the glass substrate by ion beam sputtering with shadow deposition of the metal nanoparticles, provides a viable alternative to time consuming serial nanopatterning approaches. Far-field optical characterization demonstrates that the nanowire arrays exhibit tunable anisotropic properties in the visible range due to the excitation of localized plasmon resonances...|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{the use of}} <b>nanostructured</b> <b>templates</b> or moulds {{has become}} a {{preferred}} way to build ordered structures organized over areas of hundreds of square micrometer in size. By depositing/casting the desired materials inside the templates, large arrays can be made efficiently and economically [1]. One of the simplest and most widely used materials for this purpose is opaline. It consists of spheres of glass, minerals, or plastic stacked in close-packed arrays. These arrays can either be produced naturally or artificially by induced self-assembly, for instance, by capillary forces [2]. Another method is {{through the use of}} polymer stamps. They are fabricated by casting on lithographically generated rigid moulds [3] or made using self-assembled copolymers deposited on flat substrates [4, 5]. Another strategy to generate the template material is the use of anodized aluminum oxide membranes (AAOs). This type of membrane is usually prepared by the anodization of aluminum foils or thin films to obtain a honeycomb arrangement of pores perpendicular to the exposed surface [6 – 8]. This material has been used to build metal-insulator-metal nanocapacitor arrays for energy storage [9] and also to design highly specific and sensitive detectors for molecules of biological origin such as troponin, a protein marker for individuals with a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction [10].|$|R
40|$|The use {{of short}} chain block {{copolymer}} melts as <b>nanostructured</b> <b>templates</b> with sub- 10 nm domains is often limited by their low segregation strength (χN). Since increasing molar mass to strengthen segregation also increases the interdomain spacing of block copolymer melts, {{it is more}} desirable to increase the Flory−Huggins segment−segment interaction parameter, χ, to produce strong segregation. We have recently shown that poly(oxyethylene−oxypropylene−oxyethylene) block copolymer melts can undergo disorder-to-order transition when blended with a selectively associating homopolymer that can hydrogen bond {{with one of the}} blocks. Here, we study the effect of the molar mass of poly(acrylic acid) in the range 1 − 13 times that of the copolymer on the segregation of a 6. 5 kg/mol poly(oxyethylene−oxypropylene−oxyethylene) copolymer melt. The neat copolymer is disordered, and the addition of poly(acrylic acid) resulted in a well-ordered lamellar morphology with an interdomain spacing of 10 ± 1. 0 nm. Using small-angle and ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering, we found that the blends remain well ordered at 80 °C over the entire range of homopolymer chain lengths. A small increase in the interdomain spacing of the lamellae and an order−order transition from lamellae-to-cylindrical morphology was observed in all blends as a function of increasing homopolymer concentration. The trends observed in experiments were validated by self-consistent field theoretical simulations...|$|R
