5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, in <b>normal</b> <b>usage</b> moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{this was}} not the case. For most of its history, ain't was {{acceptable}} across many social and regional contexts. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of <b>normal</b> <b>usage</b> for both educated and uneducated English speakers, and was found in the correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Variations {{are also}} found with the {{spelling}} of unit names in countries using the same language, including differences in American English and British spelling. For example, meter and liter {{are used in the}} United States whereas metre and litre are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term metric ton is the <b>normal</b> <b>usage</b> whereas in other varieties of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.|$|E

5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of <b>normal</b> <b>usage.</b>|$|E

40|$|A new {{deterministic}} floating-point arithmetic called precision arithmetic {{is developed}} to track precision for arithmetic calculations. It uses a novel rounding scheme to avoid excessive rounding error propagation of conventional floating-point arithmetic. Unlike interval arithmetic, its uncertainty tracking {{is based on}} statistics and the central limit theorem, with a much tighter bounding range. Its stable rounding error distribution is approximated by a truncated normal distribution. Generic standards and systematic methods for validating uncertainty-bearing arithmetics are discussed. The precision arithmetic {{is found to be}} better than interval arithmetic in both uncertainty-tracking and uncertainty-bounding for <b>normal</b> <b>usages.</b> The precision arithmetic is available publicly at [URL] 54 Pages, 32 Figure...|$|R

25|$|Some {{magnetrons}} have ceramic insulators with {{beryllium oxide}} (beryllia) added. The beryllium in such oxides {{is a serious}} chemical hazard if crushed then inhaled or ingested. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be handled. This is a danger if the microwave oven becomes physically damaged, if the insulator cracks, or when the magnetron is opened and handled, yet not during <b>normal</b> <b>usage.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{instances}} where the programmer performing the optimization must {{decide to make}} the software better for some operations but {{at the cost of}} making other operations less efficient.

25|$|The {{territory}} of 'Southern Rhodesia' was originally {{referred to as}} 'South Zambezia' but the name 'Rhodesia' came into use in 1895. The designation 'Southern' was adopted in 1901 and dropped from <b>normal</b> <b>usage</b> in 1964 on the break-up of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Rhodesia became {{the name of the}} country until the creation of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979. Legally, from the British perspective, the name Southern Rhodesia continued to be used until 18 April 1980, when the name Republic of Zimbabwe was formally proclaimed. The colonial history of Southern Rhodesia lasted from the British government's establishment of the government of Southern Rhodesia on 1 October 1923, to Prime Minister Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Like in English, Dutch has {{generalised}} the dative {{over the}} accusative case for all pronouns, e.g. Du me, je, Eng me, you, vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir. There is one exception: the standard language prescribes {{that in the}} third person plural, hen is to be used for the direct object, and hun for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in <b>normal</b> <b>usage,</b> with hun being more common. The shared unstressed form ze is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use.|$|E
500|$|Although epikleros {{was most}} often used {{in the case of}} a {{daughter}} who had no living brothers when her father died, the term was also used for other cases. The Suda, a 10th-century CE lexicon and encyclopedia, gives other definitions, including an heiress who was married at the time of her father's death and an unmarried daughter without brothers still living with her father. The Suda also stated that the term could be used of a daughter who had living sisters. Although the Suda indicates that in <b>normal</b> <b>usage,</b> the mother of the heiress was also dead, this is incorrect: whether or not the mother was alive had no bearing on the status of the epikleros. Occasionally the term is also used as a feminine form of the Greek term orphanos, or [...] "orphan". Although a scholiast of Aeschines, or a later writer amending the text, stated that the term could also be used of a daughter who was given to a man in marriage on her father's deathbed, there is no extant use of the term in that sense in literature, and the scholiast has probably misunderstood a scenario from the comic playwright Aristophanes.|$|E

Animal poisons delivered subcutaneously (e.g., by sting or bite) are also called venom.

Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features, which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as Windows' Control-Alt-Delete combination, which brings up the system security options screen.|$|E

Jeremy Hooker, however, describes both Owen and [...] as [...] " [...] 'Welsh Romances' [...] " [...] and relates this to Powys [...] "drawing on a tradition of storytelling far older than that of any 'historical novelist'" [...] and suggests that [...] "n a way, he {{is close to the}} medieval Arthurian romances". Hooker also emphasises the influence of the Welsh mythological classic The Mabinogion on this novel, stating [...] "that the mythology is more essential, more integral, to this romance than its historical circumstances are". Another view, while accepting that Owen is an historical novel, sees it as [...] "a marvellous blend of historicity and vision, of mythology and romance".|$|E
