5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an office at the RNC, {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration. RNC chairman Ray Bliss and his aides were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for {{a month after the}} inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.|$|E
25|$|Asquith's {{motion was}} passed by 364–198. As in the Maurice Debate, his sense of {{political}} tactics was, in Jenkins' view, overcome by his sense of Parliamentary propriety. He could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> withdraw the amendment, but could not support the government either.|$|E
25|$|After the Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pelletan {{attempted}} {{to give the}} heart to Louis-Charles's uncle, Louis XVIII, however he refused because he could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> believe that was {{the heart of his}} nephew. Dr. Pelletan then donated the heart to the Archbishop of Paris, Hyacinthe-Louis de Quélen.|$|E
60|$|Pierston could <b>not</b> quite <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> {{see that}} he had behaved badly to his too {{imperious}} lady, and declined to ask forgiveness {{for what he had}} not done.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Excell came on {{to marry}} them, but Jack sent his best wishes by mail; he could <b>not</b> quite <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> see Mary give herself away--even to his hero.|$|R
60|$|The {{story of}} how Jim Hooker had personated him stopped short upon Clarence's lips. He could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> now <b>to</b> add that revelation to the {{contempt}} of his small companion, which, {{in spite of its}} naivete, somewhat grated on his sensibilities.|$|R
25|$|During their 1803–1806 expedition, Meriwether Lewis and {{the other}} members of the Corps of Discovery {{consumed}} dog meat, either from their own animals or supplied by Native American tribes, including the Paiutes and Wah-clel-lah Indians, a branch of the Watlatas, the Clatsop, the Teton Sioux (Lakota), the Nez Perce Indians, and the Hidatsas. Lewis and the members of the expedition ate dog meat, except William Clark, who reportedly could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> eat dogs.|$|E
25|$|Back in the present, the Prince contemplates what he {{believes}} to be the historical significance of the vote and also its deeper meaning. This leads him to ask Ciccio how he voted in the Plebiscite. At first reluctant, Don Ciccio finally admits that, {{as the son of}} a Bourbon royal game keeper, he could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> vote in favor of the revolution. Many others in Donnafugata voted the same way, but Don Calogero rigged the election and announced the results as unanimously in favor of the House of Savoy.|$|E
25|$|He left Vienna on 1 July 1842 {{after the}} Spring Italian season, {{travelling}} to Milan, Bergamo (in {{order to see}} the now-aging Mayr, but where the deterioration of his own heath became more apparent), {{and then on to}} Naples in August, a city he had not visited since 1838. A contract with the San Carlo remained unresolved. Also, it appears that he wished to sell his Naples house, but could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> go through with it, such was the sorrow which remained after his wife's death in 1837.|$|E
60|$|If {{this should}} be...! He scarce dared put his hope into words. He could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> really <b>to</b> believe. But he went. He ran downstairs {{and out into}} the street, took his stand under a {{projecting}} doorway nearly opposite the house which held the woman he loved, and leaning against the wall, he waited.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John {{greeted the}} man with an attempt at cordiality. He could <b>not</b> yet <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> like his personality, but on Myrtle's account {{and because he was}} <b>himself</b> generous enough <b>to</b> wish to be of service to anyone so forlorn and unhappy, he treated Mr. Jones with more respect than he really thought he deserved.|$|R
6000|$|Pentfield saw, {{though he}} could <b>not</b> quite <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> believe. Glancing through the headline, [...] "Young Lochinvar {{came out of the}} North," [...] and {{skimming}} the article until the names of Mabel Holmes and Corry Hutchinson, coupled together, leaped squarely before his eyes, he turned {{to the top of the}} page. It was a San Francisco paper.|$|R
25|$|That night, after Homer puts Bart in bed, Sideshow Bob, who {{was hanging}} {{to the back}} of the door to Bart's room, leaps down. Bart tries to get the shock {{bracelet}} remote control, but Sideshow Bob already has it and throws it out of the window, gags Bart with a piece of tape, picks him up and prepares to kill him with a knife, bent on killing him once again. However, Sideshow Bob realizes he is accustomed to Bart's face and he can <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> do it. With that, Sideshow Bob tries to take his leave, but gets zapped continuously by his shock bracelet (because of birds pecking the remote after it had landed in their nest).|$|E
25|$|When {{he finally}} finds the Bane, he learns {{that it is}} not an adult monster, as was assumed, but instead a baby whose parents have just died. He can <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> kill it, and so he and Ares take it to be raised by the only {{friendly}} rat they know: Ripred. After this, the two return to Regalia, where Nerissa has just been crowned queen due to the crown princess's apparent death. The flier Andromeda, human Howard, Ares, and Gregor are tried for treason because they failed to kill the Bane. They are saved, though, by Nerissa, who explains how it is good Gregor was not heartless enough to kill a baby. Shortly thereafter, Gregor is trying to finally face the reality of going home without Boots when she is suddenly returned to the palace, having been saved in turn by Luxa, Temp, and an unnamed moth. The two then return to the surface world.|$|E
500|$|In May 1738 {{his first}} major work, the poem London, was {{published}} anonymously. Based on Juvenal's , it describes the character Thales leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London, which is portrayed {{as a place of}} crime, corruption, and poverty. Johnson could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> regard the poem as earning him any merit as a poet. Alexander Pope said that the author [...] "will soon be déterré" [...] (unearthed, dug up), but this would not happen until 15 years later.|$|E
6000|$|The old man's {{heart was}} {{softened}} towards her. He could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> [...] <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> {{say a word}} to her of direct encouragement, but he [...] kissed her before she went, telling her that she was a good girl, [...] and bidding her have no care as to the house in the Kleinseite. As [...] long as he lived, and her father, her father should not be [...] disturbed.|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} full midsummer, {{and it is}} now early spring: and during the {{intervening}} months the doctor had not had a happy time of it. On that night, as we have before told, he took his niece to his heart; but he could <b>not</b> then <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> tell her that which it was so imperative that she should know. Like a coward, he would put off the evil hour till the next morning, and thus robbed himself of his night's sleep.|$|R
60|$|For common extasies, he {{had them}} almost every day, {{especially}} at the altar, and after the sacrifice of the mass: insomuch, that many times they could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> him <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> with pulling him by the robe, and violently shaking him.|$|R
500|$|Consumed by sport, Wills, to his father's chagrin, {{fell behind}} academically. It {{was said that}} he [...] "could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> study for {{professional}} work" [...] after [...] "having led a sort of nomadic life when a youth in Australia". Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his study with objects {{to remind him of}} Lexington, including Aboriginal weapons. Horatio wrote to Tom about the latter's friends, the Djab wurrung: [...] "They told me to send you up to them as soon as you came back." ...|$|E
500|$|At the time, {{the game}} was known as Blam!, but Bungie had always {{expected}} to replace the working title with something better (Blam! was only used after studio co-founder Jason Jones could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> tell his mother their next project was dubbed Monkey Nuts.) Titles such as The Crystal Palace, Hard Vacuum, Star Maker, Star Shield, and The Santa Machine were suggested. Russel suggested calling it Project: Halo because of the ring. Despite concerns that the title seemed too religious or lacked action, the name stuck. In turn, [...] "Halo" [...] became the ring's name as well.|$|E
500|$|In May 1738, {{his first}} major work, a poem called London, was {{published}} anonymously. The work was based on Juvenal's [...] and describes the character Thales's leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London. In particular, the poem describes how London {{is a place of}} crime, corruption, and the neglect of the poor. Johnson could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> regard the poem as granting him any merit as a poet; however, Alexander Pope claimed that the author [...] "will soon be déterré" [...] (brought to light, become well known), although it did not immediately happen.|$|E
60|$|Before he had {{finished}} his question he detected his man reflected in the mirror behind the bar. The gambler imagined <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> be hidden behind the screen which separated the women's drinking-place from the main room, {{and did not know}} that Kelley had seen him in the glass. His revolver was in his hand and malignant purpose blazed in his eyes--and yet he hesitated. Lawless as he was, it appeared that he could <b>not</b> instantly <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> the point of shooting an officer in the back.|$|R
6000|$|I call it folly, {{not because}} I am adverse to {{feminine}} [...] reserve, not because I am prone to quarrel even with what [...] I call coyness; but because I know his nature so well, and [...] {{feel that he}} would not bear rebuffs of which many another [...] man would think nothing; that he would <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> [...] <b>to</b> ask again, perhaps even for a seventh time, as they [...] might do. And, if it be that by some frequent asking his [...] happiness and yours could be insured, would it not be [...] folly that such happiness should be marred by childish [...] disinclination on your part to tell the truth? ...|$|R
60|$|Wharton nearly {{asked his}} friend,--almost summoned courage to ask him,--whether {{his father had}} done much for him. They were very intimate; and on one subject, in which Lopez was much interested, their {{confidence}} had been very close. But the younger and the weaker man of the two could <b>not</b> quite <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> the point of making an inquiry which he thought would be disagreeable. Lopez had never before, in all their intercourse, hinted {{at the possibility of}} his having or having had filial aspirations. He had been as though he had been created self-sufficient, independent of mother's milk or father's money. Now the question might have been asked almost naturally. But it was not asked.|$|R
500|$|Bourne {{breaks in}} and holds Conklin and {{logistics}} technician Nicolette [...] "Nicky" [...] Parsons (Julia Stiles) at gunpoint. When Conklin begins pressing him to remember his past, Bourne recalls {{his attempt to}} assassinate Wombosi through successive flashbacks. As Kane, and working under orders from Treadstone, Bourne infiltrated Wombosi's yacht but could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> kill Wombosi while Wombosi's children were present, and instead fled, being shot during his escape. Bourne announces he is resigning from Treadstone and {{is not to be}} followed. As agents descend on the safe house, Bourne fights his way free. When Conklin leaves the safe house, he encounters Manheim, who kills him under Abbott's orders. Abbott then shuts down Treadstone.|$|E
500|$|Bungie {{continued}} to expand, and in 1997 work began {{on a new}} project, codenamed Blam! (Jones had changed the name from Monkey Nuts because he could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> tell his mother about the new game under that title.) Blam! evolved from a real-time strategy game to a third-person shooter to a first-person shooter called [...] Jones role in development was unlike Marathon and Myth, where Jones was involved in developing {{more than half the}} levels and much to most of the story. Instead, he was the project lead and a manager, barely providing any code to the game. He would read war journals by authors such as John Kinkaid and Winston Churchill.|$|E
500|$|In the 1856 presidential election, Grant {{cast his}} first presidential vote for Democrat James Buchanan, later {{saying he was}} really voting against Republican John C. Frémont over concern that his anti-slavery {{position}} would lead to southern secession and war. Although Grant was not an abolitionist, neither was he considered a [...] "slavery man", and could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> force slaves to do work. By the 1860 election, Grant was openly Democratic, favoring Democrat Stephen A. Douglas over Abraham Lincoln, and Lincoln over the Southern Democrat, John C. Breckinridge. Lacking the residency requirements in Illinois at the time, he could not vote. After Lincoln was elected, Southern states seceded from the Union forming a Confederacy, seizing federal forts and institutions.|$|E
500|$|In 1927 Peng was {{approached}} several times by Communist Party members, {{some of which}} were old friends, who attempted to recruit him into the Communist Party. In August 1927 Peng {{was approached}} by an old military comrade, Huang Gonglue(黄公略): Peng was sympathetic, but could not decide to join the Party. On October 12, Peng was approached by Duan Dechang(段德昌), a Communist Party representative: Peng again expressed sympathy and interest, but at that time considered himself a member of the [...] "Kuomintang left wing", and could <b>not</b> yet <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> break with the party. Peng considered joining the Communist Party for some time, met Duan again later that October, and began to study basic communist theory. Peng secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party in mid-February 1928.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{services}} on Sunday? Oh!" [...] said Herbert, with {{as great a}} gasp of relief {{as if he had}} been responsible for them; and, indeed, Rosamond declared that both her husband and Mr. Bindon looked like new men since Wil'sbro' was off their backs. Archie was coming back that evening. Jenny much longed to show her two treasures to each other, for it was a useless risk for the healthy man, and the sick one was too weak and tired to wish for a new face, or the trouble of speaking; nay, he could <b>not</b> easily <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> cheerful acquiescence in even his favourite Lady Rose taking his sister's place to set her free for an evening with Archie at the Hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} he has done {{anything}} of the kind," [...] said Mr. Wharton, who was vacillating between different opinions. He did in his heart believe that the Portuguese whom he so hated had saved his son from the thieves, and he also had almost come to the conviction that he must give his daughter to the man,--but {{at the same time he}} could <b>not</b> as yet <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> abandon his opposition to the marriage.|$|R
500|$|Lennon could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> {{look at his}} mother's corpse when he {{was taken}} to the Sefton General Hospital, and was so distraught that he put his head on Mimi's lap {{throughout}} the funeral service. Lennon refused to talk to Walley for months afterwards, and Walley felt that Lennon somehow held him responsible. Julia was buried in Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. Her gravesite was for some time unmarked, but it was later identified as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805". The graveyard's location is approx. 1.19miles east of 1Blomfield Road. Baird said that the Stanley family hoped to finally put a headstone on her mother's grave, which she hoped [...] "will be a private affair for the family and not for the public". A headstone was subsequently placed on Julia's grave (replacing a wooden cross), with the words [...] "Mummy, John, Victoria, Julia, Jackie" [...] inscribed.|$|E
500|$|Kanae {{imagined}} {{himself a}} realist and was distressed at the avant-garde {{that was coming}} to dominate the European art world; he {{found it difficult to}} comprehend and reconcile it with his understanding of a realist ideal in Western art. [...] His disappointment and confusion impacted his productivity; he produced few of the prints that were supposed to fund his stay, and the language barrier made it difficult to find buyers. [...] A Tokyo agent of his committed suicide after appropriating money from Kanae and other clients. [...] He could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> reveal his and his parents' financial situation, so he had another agent, Rokurō Watanabe, send money to Paris just so he could send it back to his parents, who were under pressure from a loan shark. [...] Along with his disappointment in the Western art world, Kanae witnessed first-hand the impact Japanese art had had there. [...] Though he kept such thoughts to himself he began to feel a sense of the superiority of Japanese art—of the same traditions he had denied himself during his years of training.|$|E
2500|$|Reith's {{animosity}} towards Churchill continued. When {{offered the}} post of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (a position he had long coveted), he could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> accept it, noting in his diary: [...] "Invitation from that bloody shit Churchill to be Lord High Commissioner." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the present}} {{occasion}} the examination was actually {{to be carried}} on {{by two of the}} kings in person. Sir Gregory had declared that as so large a portion of his heart and affections was bound up with the gentlemen of the Weights and Measures, he could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> actually <b>to</b> ask questions of them, and then to listen to or read their answers. Should any of his loved ones make some fatal faux pas, his tears, like those of the recording angel, would blot out the error. His eyes would refuse to see faults, if there should be faults, in those whom he himself had nurtured. Therefore, though he came with his colleagues to the Weights and Measures, he did not himself take part in the examination.|$|R
6000|$|In writing so far, Miss Marrable had {{intended}} to signify that Captain Marrable had been slow to ask Edith Brownlow to be his wife {{while he was at}} Dunripple, because he could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> so soon <b>to</b> show <b>himself</b> indifferent <b>to</b> his former love; but that now he would not hesitate, knowing as he would know, that his former love had bestowed herself elsewhere; but in this {{there would have been a}} grievous accusation against Mary, and she was therefore compelled to fill up her sentence in some other form;-- ...|$|R
60|$|Augustus {{received}} the tale almost in silence. In reply to his brother's authoritative, domineering speeches he said nothing. To {{him it was}} all new, but to him, also, it seemed certainly to be untrue. He did <b>not</b> at all <b>bring</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> believe that Mr. Grey was in the conspiracy, {{but he had no}} scruple of paternal regard to make him feel that this father would not concoct such a scheme simply because he was his father. It would be a saving of the spoil from the Amalekites, and of this idea he did give a hardly-expressed hint to his brother.|$|R
