Generalized additive models revealed that high C. edentulus catches were associated withfew boat loadings <b>of</b> large-sized <b>fishes,</b> which were conserved in higher boat storage temperatures and attained high market prices. Our long-term study stressed that variations on C. edentulus fishery were related to changes on boat storage temperature, fish size, price paid per kg, and frequency of landings, and that these descriptors are correlated with C. edentulus ecological traits and high phytoplankton availability. Nevertheless, further studies should be performed to address whether less evident factors, such as the fluctuation of concurrent Sardinella brasiliensis stock, would explain the temporal dynamics of C. edentulus stocks in Guanabara Bay.

40|$|Due to {{overfishing}} {{and the use}} of one-third <b>of</b> wild <b>fish</b> {{catches for}} feeding farmed fish and livestock, there is a strong need for alternative sources of suitable proteins and lipids in fish feeds. Small freshwater worms of the species Lumbriculus variegatus can be such a source based on their high protein content, variable lipid content and amino acid pattern. In addition, their production can be combined with waste reduction, as they can be grown on safe organic wastes. In this article, it was investigated whether fatty acid (FA) profile of the worms changed with feed source. Profiles of worms grown on different feeds were highly similar, but also reflected profiles of feeds. Data suggest that the worms are capable of poly-unsaturated fatty acids bioaccumulation. The worms converted different organic wastes (fish faeces and food industry sludges) with an efficient feed conversion ratio of ~ 1. 8 (dry to wet weight) resulting in a theoretical production of 0. 1 - 0. 14 <b>kg</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>of</b> waste.
