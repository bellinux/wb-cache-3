40|$|Description The soGGi package {{provides}} a toolset to create genomic interval aggregate/summary plots of signal or motif occurence from BAM and bigWig files {{as well as}} PWM, rlelist, GRanges and GAlignments Bioconductor objects. soGGi allows for <b>normalisation,</b> <b>transformation</b> and arithmetic operation on and between summary plot objects as well as grouping and subsetting of plots by GRanges objects and user supplied metadata. Plots are created using the GGplot 2 libary to allow user defined manipulation of the returned plot object. Coupled together, soGGi features a broad set of methods to visualise genomics data {{in the context of}} groups of genomic intervals such as genes, superenhancers and transcription factor binding events...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of illicit materials using Raman spectroscopy is of widespread interest {{for law enforcement}} and healthcare applications. One of the difficulties faced when analysing illicit mixtures {{is the fact that}} the narcotic can be mixed with many different cutting agents. This obviously complicates the development of quantitative analytical methods. In this work we demonstrate some preliminary efforts to try and account for the wide variety of potential cutting agents, by discrimination between the target substance and a wide range of excipients. Near-infrared Raman spectroscopy (785 nm excitation) was employed to analyse 217 samples, a number of them consisting of a target analyte (acetaminophen) mixed with excipients of different concentrations by weight. The excipients used were sugars (maltose, glucose, lactose, sorbitol), inorganic materials (talcum powder, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium sulphate), and food products (caffeine, flou). The spectral data collected was subjected to a number of pre-treatment statistical methods including first derivative and <b>normalisation</b> <b>transformations,</b> to make the data more suitable for analysis. Various methods were then used to discriminate the target analytes, these included Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Support Vector Machines...|$|R
40|$|The flowBeads {{package is}} an {{extension}} of flowCore for bead data. It provides basic functionality for loading, gating and doing normalisation with bead data. Beads specially manufactured to known fluoresence, defined in terms of standard units of fluorescence, are routinely run in flow cytometry for the purpose of instrument quality control and <b>normalisation.</b> The <b>transformation</b> of measured intensity (Mean Fluorescence Intensity) to standard units of fluorescence, Molecules of Equivalent Fluorochrome, allows for sensible comparison of data acquired on different days and on different instruments. The parameters of the transform also correspond to basic quality control estimates of the detector linearity and the background. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 1967 - 1995, Swedish mental {{healthcare}} underwent a complete re-organisation, starting with county councils taking over responsibility for mental healthcare from the state. Asylums were then phased out {{and mental health}} care moved closer to patients. The Mental Health Reform of 1995 completed this decentralisation and put the emphasis on an independent and integrated life as a citizen in society {{and the idea of}} a dwelling of one’s own. This thesis describes and analyses spatial aspects of decentralised mental healthcare in Sweden, focusing on the decentralisation discourse regarding organisation, localisation, patient care and working methods behind decentralisation and its spatial performance. A case study of decentralised mental healthcare in Nacka, a Stockholm suburb, between 1958 - 1999 examines in particular the emerging decentralisation discourse 1958 - 1973, The Nacka Project 1974 - 1980 (one of the first examples of community care in Sweden), psychiatry in Nacka 1980 - 1994 and the official report Welfare and Freedom of Choice from 1995. The methods used include studies of documents, interviews, visual and architectural drawing analysis. The theoretical point of departure for the analysis is a post-structural heterogeneous concept of space where spatial materiality and discursiveness are looked upon as intertwined.    The result shows that the re-organisation of mental healthcare brought about a substantial spatial <b>transformation.</b> <b>Normalisation</b> of patients’ lives involved integration into society and support for independent living. The local environment was the main trope for the early stage of decentralised mental healthcare, but the notion of a dwelling of one’s own became the important trajectory to an independent life after 1995. The idea of the patient is challenged by the independence discourse, which could be said to contain an idea of the ‘non-patient’. Overall, it can be concluded that spatial organisations of the built environment are never value-free or neutral. They reflect, enable and constrain power relations in a society and material space can contribute to the power of one group at the expense of another. Furthermore, the results of the spatialities, or the meanings, cannot be predicted. It is therefore crucial to distinguish power in all its configurations and scales and to keep negotiations alive, especially within the field of mental healthcare, but also in the care sector as a whole and in other societal institutions where policies buildings and built environment interact with user practices. This kaleidoscopic perspective can be used for examining complexities in the past and present and for encouraging future potentialities in the process of making/enacting spatial relations.
