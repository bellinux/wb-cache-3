40|$|Every year, {{thousands}} of refugees are forced to leave their countries of origin and are hosted by their neighboring countries. However, very few {{is known about the}} impact of these refugees on the local economy and its inhabitants. Based on hypothesis formulated during a two-month iterative field research, a theoretical framework is used to understand how the refugee inflow would affect the good and labour markets of the local economy. We then test the theoretical predictions regarding the potential winners and losers among the refugee-hosting population, using household panel data collected in the region of Kagera in Tanzania. Preliminary results suggest that the local hosts do not necessarily suffer from the refugee presence. Net economic benefits could even emerge provided a sufficient mass of refugees is gathered. Furthermore, the economic benefits appear to be unevenly distributed among the refugee-hosting population. The agricultural worker is likely to suffer the most from an increase in competition on the labor markets and the surging prices of several goods. On the contrary, the <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>worker</b> and the self-employed farmer are {{in a better position to}} benefit from such a refugee inflow...|$|E
40|$|Cuba and Venezuela {{have been}} argued to be {{examples}} of state capitalism, populist capitalism, socialism, or simply the ambiguous “mixed economy. ” By focusing on these countries as social formations in movement, or in transition, a more adequate understanding is presented. The first essay develops {{a theory of}} socialist transition, with focus on the dynamic, rather than static character of socialism. Furthermore, worker cooperatives are analyzed {{with a focus on}} the roles they play in the different stages of the transition to socialism. Finally, this framework is utilized to analyze the experience of the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela. The second essay utilizes this framework to analyze the particular cases of countries dominated by imperialist relations. As this essay argues, throughout history two opposing conceptions regarding the relation between anti-imperialism and socialist transition have been present in the Marxian tradition. The first argues that an anti- imperialist capitalist development stage within dominated regions is required before a socialist transition can begin. The second view argues that capitalist development is blocked in dominated regions, and as a result the only route to economic development is through a transition to socialism. This essay undertakes an examination of key Marxist thinkers and revolutionary processes across the globe to assess the theories and the processes associated with these conceptions. Finally, the third essay assesses the current direction of institutional change in Cuba. Some analysts believe the current changes in the Cuban system indicate the beginning of a transition to capitalism, while others disagree. By focusing on one particular institution, the <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>worker</b> cooperatives, this essay demonstrates that the current reform process in Cuba has included features that could contribute to the mergence of a new socialist formation characterized by participatory planning...|$|E

30|$|The {{large share}} of {{agriculture}} in total employment {{is a sign of}} structural underdevelopment 40, and has pension system consequences. Before 1972 agricultural workers were not covered by any pension system. Instead of covering them in the public system, a special system was established for this group (KRUS). That system is in fact a mixture of a type of social assistance for the poor living in the countryside, and a method of not paying contributions. More than 90 percent of KRUS expenditure is covered by a budgetary subsidy, so it is a method of redistribution from <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> to agricultural workers. The most important problem stemming from that is the motivation for agricultural workers to stay in agriculture instead of flowing to non-agricultural sectors of the economy. Average productivity in agriculture is very low – many times lower than in non-agricultural sectors.|$|R

While on average compensations offered were close to the reported market valuations of land, owners of high grade multi-cropped (Sona) lands were undercompensated, which balanced over-compensation of low grade mono-cropped (Sali) lands. This occurred owing to misclassification of most Sona land as Sali land in the official land records. Under-compensation relative to market values significantly raised the chance of compensation offers being rejected by owners. There is considerable evidence of the role of financial considerations in rejection decisions. Land acquisition significantly reduced incomes of owner cultivator and tenant households, despite their efforts to increase incomes from other sources. Agricultural workers were more adversely affected relative to <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>workers,</b> while the average impact on workers as a whole was insignificant.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} heterogeneity {{among the}} self-employed in 74 developing countries, representing {{two thirds of}} the population of the developing world. After profiling how worker characteristics vary by employment status, we classify self-employed workers outside of agriculture as “successful ” or “unsuccessful ” entrepreneurs, based on two measures of success: Whether the worker is an employer, and whether they reside in a non-poor household. Four main findings emerge. First, jobs exhibit a clear pecking order, with household welfare and worker education highest for employers, followed by wage and salaried employees, <b>non-agricultural</b> own-account <b>workers,</b> <b>non-agricultural</b> unpaid family <b>workers,</b> and finally agricultural workers. Second, a substantial minority of own-account workers reside in non-poor households, suggesting that their profits are often a secondary source of household income. Third, as per capita income increases, the structure of employment shifts rapidly, first out of agriculture into unsuccessful non-agricultural self-employment, and then mainly into non-agricultural wage employment. Finally, roughly one third of the unsuccessful entrepreneurs share similar characteristics with their successful counterparts, suggesting they have the potential to be successful but face constraints to growth. We conclude that although interventions such as access to credit can benefit a substantial portion of the self-employed, effectively targeting the minority of self-employed with higher growth potential is important, particularly in low-income contexts. The results also highlight the potential benefits of policies that facilitate shifts in the nature of work, first from agricultural labor into non-agricultural self-employment, and then into wage and salaried jobs...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, there has been {{widespread}} recognition that a sizeable and growing share of the global workforce is in the informal sector. To explain this, neo-liberals contend that enterprises operate in the informal sector due to high taxes, public sector corruption and too much state interference in the free market and that the consequent remedy is to reduce taxes, public sector corruption and the regulatory burden via minimal state intervention. This paper evaluates critically this neo-liberal policy approach. To do this, International Labor Organization data from 16 Latin American countries on the share of the workforce in informal sector enterprises is compared with cross-national variations in tax rates, corruption and levels of state interference using World Bank development indicators. Revealing that one in three <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> in Latin America are employed in informal sector enterprises and analyzing the economic and social conditions in different countries, no support is found for the neo-liberal tenets that higher tax rates, greater levels of corruption and state interference are correlated with larger informal sectors. Instead, higher levels of regulation and state intervention are associated with smaller (not larger) informal economies resulting in a tentative call for more, rather than less, regulation of the economy and state intervention to protect workers. ...|$|R

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among young married scheduled castes women in Thiruvarur district of Tamilnadu state in India. Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in 28 villages selected using multistage sampling technique for selecting 605 women in the age group of 15 - 24 years during July 2010 -April 2011. Data analysis was by use of SPSS version- 17, with statistical significance set at p-value of 0. 05. Results: Around 8. 8 % of women experienced sexually transmitted infections among the study population. The proportion of women who experienced STIs was seven times higher among illiterates (46. 9 %) than women who completed secondary education (6 %). The women in households in the high standard of living index (SLI) were less likely to experience STIs (1. 7 %) than women in low SLI (15. 6 %).

40|$|Each year, in {{an effort}} to {{alleviate}} labor shortages, the State Department permits over one hundred thousand low-skilled foreign workers to legally enter the United States for purposes of temporary employment. Workers come from poorer nations around the globe, enticed by the promise of high paying jobs and the chance to make an honest and comfortable living for themselves and their families. The majority of workers employed through the United States guest worker program are forced to take on crushing debt in the form of various point-of-hire fees. Unfortunately, these fees, which almost always come out of the worker’s pocket, are rarely recoverable and create a system of involuntary servitude. This happens for several reasons, one being that under current United States law foreign workers often pay, at least initially, all inbound transportation and visa costs. The other major cause of this debt is the fact that employers often look to recruitment agencies to secure workers. Unscrupulous recruiters promise prospective workers high wages, overtime pay, and green cards. Believing they will make a lot of money, the workers are even more vulnerable to the recruiter’s demands for an additional recruitment fee. Since World War II, foreign workers have been a driving force behind the United States economy. The United States, through a number of agreements and passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act, has created a massive government program aimed at protecting the economy by alleviating the ill effects of labor shortages. In doing so, Congress has {{gone to great lengths to}} ensure that United States business interests, as well as interests of the domestic workforce, are protected. With these important interests in mind, it is of no surprise that little thought has ever been given to the actual laborers. Part I of this Note provides background on the United States guest worker program, particularly its historical purpose and the changes that have occurred over time. One major theme throughout this Note is the administratively created distinction between agricultural and <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> and the problems that result therefrom. Part II examines two sharply contrasting circuit court cases: the first, an Eleventh Circuit opinion holding that point-of-hire fees, in the context of agricultural workers, are primarily for the benefit of the employer and thus reimbursable; the second, a recent Fifth Circuit decision holding that none of these fees are reimbursable for <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>workers.</b> Part III analyzes current United States law and its application in the wake of these two divergent opinions. This Part explains that an employee’s inbound transportation, visa, and recruitment fees are primarily for the benefit of the employer. These fees operate to drive an employee’s wages below the minimum wage requirement established by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Finally, Part IV addresses the future of the guest worker program and discusses policy alternatives aimed at preventing foreign workers from falling prey to unscrupulous recruiters and exorbitant debt...|$|R
