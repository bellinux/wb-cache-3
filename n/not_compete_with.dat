5|$|During the decade, {{many smaller}} {{manufacturers}} could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> the Big Three and either {{went out of}} business or merged. In 1954, American Motors was formed when Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in a deal worth almost $200 million, the largest corporate merger in United States history at that time.|$|E

5|$|Marble Madness was commercially successful. The {{game was}} ported to {{numerous}} platforms and inspired {{the development of}} other games.

5|$|That {{exposed the}} fact that {{domestic}} firms could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> foreign imports because of the overvalued currency and long-term structural problems. A financial reform was implemented that aimed both to liberalize capital markets and to link Argentina more effectively with the world capital market.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by critics, who praised its combat, pacing, {{and use of}} the Third Edition rules. However, some reviewers felt that the graphics and engine had become outdated, and could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> its contemporaries.|$|E
30|$|This {{reversed}} pattern occurs for the following: when {{exposure is}} measured {{with the growth}} of job posts on Craigslist, we compare the 25  % most and the 25  % least exposed websites, and when websites that serve the entire USA are coded as <b>not</b> <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> Craigslist.|$|R

The budget escalated as various directors and writers got involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project.|$|E

3000|$|Specifically, average {{fees for}} posting a job ad at {{competing}} websites decreased by an estimated $ 2.4 per day of posting a job ad (column 1 in Table  4) {{for every year}} that the websites faced competition from Craigslist. This estimate is not statistically significant when national websites are coded as <b>not</b> <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> Craigslist (column 4 in Table  4). We find evidence that Craigslist’s entry resulted in a drop in a fee by $ 28.8 for a month of access to CV postings only when national websites are coded as <b>not</b> <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> Craigslist. Craigslist’s entry had no effect when these websites were coded as <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> Craigslist (columns 2 and 5 in Table  4).

5|$|Nichols {{recommended}} that S-50 and the Alpha tracks at Y-12 be closed down. This {{was done in}} September. Although performing better than ever, the Alpha tracks could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2million a month.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E
5|$|Kim himself {{considered}} his treatise a failure. Films it {{had contributed to}} were enjoyed at home, but abroad they were ridiculed. North Korean cinema could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> the quality of foreign, and in particular South Korean, films. This directly prompted him to kidnap Shin Sang-ok, South Korea's most famous film director, in 1978. Shin and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, were kept in North Korea for eight years under cruel conditions. Nevertheless, Shin studied On the Art of the Cinema to please Kim with the kaijū film Pulgasari, which credits Kim as the executive producer. Kim was delighted with the film and allowed Shin and Choi to travel to Vienna, where {{they were supposed to}} negotiate a deal for a sequel. The couple used the opportunity to escape, and ended up in America.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{hoped that}} the Manhattan Project would develop {{improved}} calutrons and construct Alpha III racetracks, but they were judged to be uneconomical. The Alpha tracks were closed down in September 1945. Although performing better than ever, they could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> K-25 and the new K-27, which commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2million a month. Staff numbers at the Radiation laboratory fell from 1,086 in May 1945 to 424 {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E

5000|$|Navarro {{argues that}} China violates fair trade by [...] "illegal export {{subsidies}} and currency manipulation, effectively flooding the U.S. markets" [...] and unfairly making it [...] "virtually impossible" [...] for American companies to compete. It is {{a critique of}} [...] "global capitalism" [...] including foreign labor practices and environmental protection. Currency manipulation and subsidies are stated as reasons that [...] "American companies cannot <b>compete</b> because they’re <b>not</b> <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> Chinese companies, they’re <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> the Chinese government." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note, however, that the North-South model only applies to countries that are completely specialized; that is, they are <b>not</b> <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> foreign markets - {{they are the only}} ones producing whichever good they are producing. The way around the terms of trade trap predicted by the North-South model is to produce goods that do <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> foreign goods. For example, the Asian Tigers are famous for pursuing development strategies that involved using their comparative advantage in labor to produce labor-intensive goods like textiles more efficiently than the United States and Europe.|$|R
5|$|Nonetheless, Alexander Twining and James Harrison set up ice {{plants in}} Ohio and Melbourne {{respectively}} during the 1850s, both using Perkins engines. Twining {{found he could}} <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> natural ice, but in Melbourne Harrison's plant came to dominate the market. Australia's distance from New England, where journeys could take 115 days, and the consequent high level of wastage– 150 tons of the first 400-ton shipment to Sydney melted on route– made it relatively easy for plant ice {{to compete with the}} natural product. Elsewhere, however, natural ice dominated the entire market.|$|E
5|$|Power looms {{introduced}} in the early 19th century {{put an end to}} the last remnants of the domestic system in Crompton, but not without resistance. Weavers and spinners were paid according to the amount of cloth they produced; independent hand loom weavers saw a drop in their income, and could <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> the mechanised mass production that was gathering pace in the township. Luddites rioted in the township in 1826, smashing 24power looms at Clegg's mill at High Crompton in protest against their worsening standard of living.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Atlus {{picking up}} the title, Vanillaware had {{encountered}} difficulties finding a publisher due to Kamitani's sparse record as a developer. Completed in 2006, Odin Sphere was delayed into the following year so it would <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> Atlus' own titles. The localization was handled by Atlus USA, and proved challenging in multiple areas. Upon release, it garnered a positive reception from video game journalists: praise was given to its story, visuals and old-school gameplay, with criticism focused on its inventory system and framerate issues. Leifthrasir was praised for its improved performance and reworked mechanics. The game was a commercial success, contributing {{to the rise of}} Vanillaware as a developer.|$|E

In the 1980s, national TV only aired Saturday mornings, <b>not</b> <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> the weekday and Sunday blocks of syndication aired by local independent stations but; however, by the 1990s, Fox and then WB started airing weekday afternoon blocks. By {{the end of}} the 1990s, both syndicated and national TV ended up losing most of its children's market to the rise of cable TV channels like Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network which provided appealing children's entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours.|$|R
