5|$|Players build a {{space station}} on a flat plane using tetromino-shaped floors that {{represent}} rooms. Rectangular workers generate the resources to build more spaces by working in these rooms. The workers occasionally must defend the base against attackers, who come in waves of increasing difficulty. The player can have the workers research four TMA-1-style monoliths for additional shield, speed, and generator upgrades. Rooms are used for special purposes: mineral mining (extractors), growing food (gardens), cooking it (kitchens), making workers (quarters), and creating power (reactors). The goal is to flourish and protect the station's inhabitants, but there are three concrete objectives: research all four monoliths, survive 28 waves, and research all monoliths in under 45 minutes. The game ends if all workers are killed. There is a tutorial, but <b>no</b> <b>story.</b> The player is not specifically told about the endgame goals.|$|E

25|$|The {{game has}} been met with near {{universal}} disapproval, citing {{a lack of}} gameplay depth, character customization, <b>no</b> <b>story,</b> and very expensive in app purchases for basic gameplay functionality.

On April 11, 2013 the game was released on the Android platform in Japan and on September 12, 2013 in North America.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} race, a superior–inferior {{relationship}} with valuation is also accordingly implied, {{as it is}} unmistakable in virtually all interactions between whites and blacks in the Tarzan stories, and similar relationships and valuations {{can be seen in}} most other interactions between differing people, although one could argue that such interactions are the bedrock of the dramatic narrative and without such valuations there is <b>no</b> <b>story.</b> According to James Loewen's Sundown Towns, this may be a vestige of Burroughs' having been from Oak Park, Illinois, a former Sundown town (a town that forbids non-whites from living within it).|$|E
25|$|Giorgione also {{introduced}} a new range of subjects. Besides altarpieces and portraits he painted pictures that told <b>no</b> <b>story,</b> whether biblical or classical, or if they professed to tell a story, neglected the action and simply embodied in form and color moods of lyrical or romantic feeling, much as a musician might embody them in sounds. Innovating with the courage and felicity of genius, he had for a time an overwhelming influence on his contemporaries and immediate successors in the Venetian school, including Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo, Palma il Vecchio, il Cariani, Giulio Campagnola (and his brother), and even on his already eminent master, Giovanni Bellini. In the Venetian mainland, Giorgionismo strongly influenced Morto da Feltre, Domenico Capriolo, and Domenico Mancini.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars was released on October 15, 2012. The concept of the video shows Mars {{having a good time}} with his bandmates, doing things like smoking, drinking beer and playing games. He is also seen singing the song with his band at a club. The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun. <b>No</b> <b>story</b> line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live... It's very VHS-y. I love that man, it takes me back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that.

It’s about a {{director at the}} top of his game orchestrating terrific talent into a bravura crescendo. Only someone who has showed death the door can open windows to life like this." [...] Filmfare gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make you cry in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth. Pritam's music adds a nice silent-era charm to this already fantastic story, making it an occasion when words simply aren’t enough." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com has given 3.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "Barfi! is a well-crafted script with an intriguing back-and-forth narrative but it all goes south towards the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, in her {{review for}} TrekNation, {{said that she}} saw the Hayes/Reed arc come full circle {{with the death of}} Hayes and the return of Reed to the {{position}} he had previously held prior to the MACO's arrival. She felt that otherwise, the episode consisted of action to the exclusion of character development but Green criticised the ease at which some of the Xindi side with Archer. She called it a [...] "strong arc episode" [...] and set-up the finale, but was concerned that the strong build-up could lead to it being an anticlimax. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", gave the episode a rating of three out of four. He felt that the structure of the plot was the same as the previous episode, but that it had <b>no</b> <b>story</b> and was [...] "simply plot and action skillfully assembled — a series of events framed as goal-oriented nonstop momentum." [...] He was pleased to see an improvement in the writing of the Reed/Hayes relationship and the MACOs, although he felt the collaborative working between the two parties should have occurred earlier in the season.|$|E

500|$|On April 12, 2016, {{the first}} teaser trailer {{for the film}} debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly {{compared}} the [...] "series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes" [...] featured in the trailer to the film Inception, as did Scott Mendelson of Forbes. Forbes added that {{the structure of the}} trailer resembled early marketing for the film Batman Begins. The Hollywood Reporters Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to The Matrix and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of Hugh Laurie's Gregory House from House, calling them not [...] "necessarily a real problem, of course... there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: {{due to the nature of}} the trailer, there's <b>no</b> <b>story</b> beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material." [...] McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of [...] "Tilda Swinton literally knock Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body," [...] but concluded, [...] "as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured" [...] than the first trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert, {{also of the}} Chicago Sun-Times, gave it two and a {{half out}} of four stars, and called the film a [...] "disappointment" [...] {{compared}} to his recent movies. Jonathan Trout of the BBC said, [...] "Youngsters and Miyazaki fans will coo at the world's depth and rich surreality, but opaque plotting, and a tendency to mope with Sophie whilst Howl is off affecting events let the momentum of the first act vanish into thin air." [...] Writing for Salon, Stephanie Zacharek said, [...] "the plot of [...] "Howl's Moving Castle" [...] meanders so listlessly that its details become less and less charming. Miyazaki's storytelling style resembles that of a breathless young tot who's fearlessly exercising his newfound powers of expression." [...] Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post criticized the plot of the film, saying [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>story,</b> or rather, there's no force to the story, which meanders almost casually this way and that for no apparent reason." [...] However, he said that the movie also empowered young women, and was [...] "beautiful beyond telling." [...] David Rooney, writing in Variety, stated that [...] "the narrative motor roars ahead in the opening hour and is more erratic thereafter," [...] and suggested that better translation would help. Literary scholar Matt Kimmich stated that the film came across as [...] "uneasy compromise between two plots and two imaginations," [...] referring to Jones' original story and Miyazaki's style of animation and storytelling. However, he stated that those scenes which were not dependent either on Jones' original plot or Miyazaki's added plot threads found [...] "a visual humor that recalls the verbal wit and lightness of Jones's novel," [...] and that the [...] "animation manages to free itself from the demands of the two plots—and flies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike pure music {{which has}} no {{reference}} {{in the real world}} and <b>no</b> <b>story</b> component, program music is instrumental music that may tell a story with explicit episodes, reveal facets of a character, place or occasion, or imitate the sounds of the world.
