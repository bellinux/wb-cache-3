40|$|Because of {{the upswing}} in {{electronic}} commerce via the Internet, {{governments in the}} European Union and the United States have been discussing the shaping of an effective system of turnover taxation in cyberspace since the late 1990 s, but have failed {{to agree on a}} definite tax system. An analysis of the various possible approaches to turnover taxation in cyberspace shows that the main challenge of the new economy is to effectively cope with business-to-consumer (B 2 C) transborder trade in digital on-line goods and services. However, the traditional systems of turnover taxation that are based on the country-of-destination principle such as the transitional system of the European Union, the sales tax system, the community principle, and the VIVAT and CVAT approaches give rise to several surveillance, efficiency, incentive, and identification problems in taxing B 2 C e-commerce. This is also the case with the more innovative proposals that have been made with regard to the taxation of B 2 C transborder trade in digital on-line goods, such as the German payment flow proposal, the U. S. e-card proposal, the modified country-of-origin proposal of the EU Commission, or the bit tax proposal. As a consequence, there are only two appropriate approaches to deal with the special characteristics of transborder trade in cyberspace: the country-of-origin principle combined with a taxation of digital goods and services at the physical location of producers, and the community principle in combination with a withholding tax (WITHVAT). Under the country-of-origin principle, exports are taxed at the rate of the country of origin and imports are free of tax. The taxation of goods turnovers at the physical location of the firms involved could at least partly prevent the transfer of Internet firms to low-tax countries. The main advantage of the country-of-origin principle {{is that it does not}} require any transborder tax adjustment and that it is also a suitable and effective approach for the turnover taxation of traditional off-line and on-line goods. However, the country-of-origin principle requires an administratively burdensome central clearinghouse system in order to guarantee the regional fiscal assignment according to the countryof- destination principle as demanded by the governments of the EU member states. Under the WITHVAT system, exports of digital on-line goods are taxed at the rate of the country of destination and consumers are responsible for passing the tax funds on to their <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> <b>authorities.</b> In order to set incentives for consumers to correctly report their digital on-line purchases to <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> <b>authorities,</b> all suppliers of digital online goods would be forced to add a withholding tax that equals the highest VAT rate of all countries participating in the transborder VAT system to any sales to consumers. Consumers would get a refund according to the difference between the withholding tax and the tax rate of the country of destination if they presented the bills to their <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> <b>authorities.</b> The main advantage of the WITHVAT approach is that it does not need a central clearinghouse mechanism, because decentralized clearing is endogenous in the system. However, the WITHVAT approach may give rise to an unspecifiable obstacle to e-commerce and is not a suitable approach for the taxation of traditional off-line and on-line goods. [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Firm informality is {{pervasive}} throughout the developing world, and Bangladesh is no exception. The informal status of many firms substantially reduces the tax basis and therefore affects {{the provision of}} public goods. The literature on encouraging formalization has focused predominantly on reducing the direct costs of formalization and has found negligible effects from such policies. In this paper, we focus on a stick intervention, which, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, is the first in a developing-country setting to deal with the most direct and dominant form of informality: the lack of registration with the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> and direct link to the country's potential revenue base and thus public goods provision. We implement an experiment in which firms are visited by representatives who deliver an official letter from the Bangladesh <b>National</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority</b> stating that the firm is not registered and threatening punishment if it fails to register. We find that the intervention increases the rate of registration among treated firms, while firms located in the same market but not treated do not seem to respond significantly. We also find that only larger-revenue firms at the baseline respond to the threat and register. Our findings have at least two important policy implications: 1) the enforcement angle, which could be an important tool to encourage formalization; and 2) targeting of government resources for formalization to the high-end informal firms. The effects are generally small in level, leaving open the question of why many firms still do not register...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of taxes on capital {{income in the}} recent decades points {{to the notion that}} international tax competition that follows globalization of capital markets put strong downward pressures on the taxation of capital income; a race to the bottom. This behavior has been perhaps most pronounced in the EU- 15 following the single market act of 1992. The 2004 enlargement of the EU with 10 new entrants put a strong downward pressure on capital income taxation for the EU- 15 countries. Tax havens, and the inadequacy of cooperation among <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> in the OECD in information exchanges, put binding ceilings on how much foreign-source capital income can be taxed.

The current practice of international taxation indicates that fiscal authorities in Latin America and the Caribbean could attain a more equitable share of capital tax revenue without depressing investment and growth.

This type of allotment garden in Japan was born to meet the need for farming recreation by urbanites and is considered to be an effective method to ensure sustainable utilization and preservation of urban farmland.

We, then, looked into a pioneeringcase whereby a farmer and urban consumers jointly run a corporate farm. Such a case indicates that distinction between farmers and consumers is becoming obscure and farmland preservation and utilization are conducted not by farmers alone, but with the collaboration of citizens. This new trend of a consumer participatory way of farmlandmanagement will increase in importance in the future because of the acceleration of aging and of the decrease in the farm population.

Amongst the findings are that: (i) the transfer of withholding tax receipts to the residence country, as planned in the EU, has no effect on equilibrium tax rates, but acts purely as a lump sum transfer; (ii) in contrast, allocating some of the revenue from information exchange to the source country counter to usual practice (though no less so than the EU agreement) would have adverse strategic effects on total revenue; (iii) nevertheless, any withholding tax regime is Pareto dominated by information exchange combined with appropriate revenue sharing; and, in particular, (iv) sharing of the additional revenues raised from information provided, while efficiency-reducing, could be in the interests of large (high-tax) countries as a means of persuading small (low-tax) countries to provide that information voluntarily. ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{arrangements}} for multi-national company taxation in EU are plagued by severe conceptual and administrative problems, leading to high compliance costs, considerable uncertainty and ample room for abuse. Integration is amplifying these difficulties. There are two possible approaches in designing an efficient trans-border corporate tax {{system for the}} European Union. The first is to consolidate the EU-wide operations of MNEs, using an agreed common base as the reference variable, and then to apportion this total tax base using some presumptive indicators of activity in each tax jurisdiction – hence, implicitly, of the likely benefits stemming from each location. The apportionment formula should respect requisites of neutrality between productive factors and forms of corporate financing. A radically different approach is also available that offers considerable advantages in terms of efficiency, simplicity and decentralisation, including full administrative autonomy of <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> <b>authorities.</b> It entails abandoning corporate income as the relevant tax base and taxing at a moderate rate some agreed measure of business activity such as company value added, sales or employment.

Since 2009, an unprecedented interventionism has been best illustrated by the amendments and enlargements of various mutual assistance instruments, both at OECD and EU levels. This widening of scope undoubtedly involves implications for taxpayers who are directly or indirectly concerned by the exchange of information. The unremitting efforts to achieve efficient exchanges among <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> has, so far, resided in the promptness with which the information gathered is transferred and thereby encouraging requested States to limit taxpayers’ notification and participation rights.

The case study will illustrate broader trends of transformation both of statehood and the international state system, from the classical liberal model based on interdependence and coordination of nation-states through central governments, towards a post-liberal one of decentred multi-level global governance, in which state functions are increasingly fragmented, and coordination is increasingly by international regulatory networks. Direct taxation of income and profits has been the centrepiece of the modern fiscal state during the past century, when the internationalization of business, especially through transnational corporations (TNCs) helped to transform the world economy. In response to {{the first phase of}} emergence of TNCs (1870 - 1914), arrangements were developed for allocation between states of rights to tax business income (1920 - 1945). These were consolidated after 1950, and helped to lay the basis for the rapid growth of foreign direct investment by TNCs in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Increasing strain has been placed on these arrangements for coordination in the past thirty years, both by the increased integration of international business, and the greater complexity of international finance, especially with the emergence of tax havens and offshore financial centres. The various initiatives to strengthen international tax coordination are examined, focusing especially on the problems of (i) legitimising cooperation based on governmental and professional networks, and (ii) coordination between taxation and related regulatory issues, especially supervision of financial institutions and markets (e. g. money-laundering, financial fraud, and prudential supervision) ...|$|E
