40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of sustaining exercise for 90 minutes of football match-play is that the capability of muscle to generate force declines. This impairment is reflected in the decline of work-rate towards the late part of the game. Causes of this phenomenon, which is known as fatigue, and some of its consequences are considered in this article. The stores of muscle glycogen may be considerably reduced {{by the end of the}} game, especially if there has not been a tapering of the training load. Thermoregulatory strain may also be encountered, resulting in a fall in physical performance, or there may be a reduced central drive from the nervous system. The decline in muscle strength may increase the predisposition to injury in the lower limbs. Central fatigue may also occur with implications for muscle performance. Strategies to offset fatigue include astute use of substitutions, appropriate <b>nutritional</b> <b>preparation</b> and balancing pre-cooling and warm-up procedures. There is also a role for endurance training and for a pacing strategy that optimizes the expenditure of energy during match-play...|$|E
40|$|There exist a {{wide variety}} of {{metabolic}} responses to different types of carbohydrates and their influence on metabolism during endurance training. Recent studies revealed that the physiological responses to food are far more complex than was previously appreciated. The rapid release of insulin and the decline in blood sugar levels during the first stages of endurance training are linked to the Glycemic Index of foods. Researchers cannot still make use of the old distinction between starchy and sugary food or simple and complex carbohydrates. These distinctions are based on the chemical analysis of the food, which does not totally reflect the effects of these foods on the body. The Glycemic Index is a more reliable guideline to apply in nutritional management for endurance athletes. The major object {{of the study was to}} indicate the importance of utilizing the Glycemic Index (GI) as part of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>preparation</b> for endurance events. The study investigated the advantages of ingesting a Low Glycemic Index meal prior to exercise and compared it with the ingestion of a High Glycemic Index meal. A pretest-posttest design was used. Twelve healthy, male and female cyclists participated in the study. Subjects were selected according to their level of training. The total test period consisted of 14 days, which included two different dietary interventions of 7 days each. Diet -and training analysis were done on the subjects prior to the commencement of the study. Each subject completed three exercise trials. The first exercise trial consisted of a V 02 max test until exhaustion. Two submaximal trials (65 - 70 % of V 02 max) followed and were preceded by two dietary interventions. The dietary interventions (7 days each) had the same amount of CHO, fat and protein but differed in the Glycemic Index of the pre-exercise meals. The first pre-exercise meal was a High Glycemic Index (HGI) meal. The second pre-exercise meal was a Low Glycemic Index (LGI) meal. The results of the study indicated the advantages of ingesting a Low Glycemic Index meal prior to endurance exercise. The drop in blood glucose levels significantly differed (p< 0. 05) with an average of 0. 68 mmol/L between the two tests after 10 minutes of cycling. It took 20 minutes for the blood sugar level of the first testto reach the same level of the blood sugar level of the second test. After the ingestion of the High Glycemic Index meal in Test 1, the blood lactate levels were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) during the first 15 minutes. The total distance covered by the subjects was 22. 86 km after the first dietary intervention (High glycemic Index food) and 27. 43 km after the second dietary intervention (Low glycemic Index food) although it is not statistically significant due to the small sample size. The difference in the distance covered of the two tests is 4. 57 km in a period of 50 minutes. Subjects indicated that they experienced more physical strain (higher RPE values) in Test 1 (High Glycemic Index food) than in Test 2 (Low Glycemic Index food) (p< 0. 05). The study results support the fact that Low glycemic index food may confer an advantage when eaten prior to prolonged strenuous exercise by providing a slow¬releasing source of glucose to the blood without causing extensive hypoglycemia. Proper preparation and the correct choice of the pre-exercise meal can exclude the occurrence of sudden drops in the blood sugar levels. The Glycemic Index can also be successfully applied during and after events to improve performance. Dissertation (MA (MHS)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Athletes {{who follow}} optimal {{nutritional}} strategies {{are able to}} maintain good health, achieve an ideal body weight and composition, and maximise sports performance. Past research, however, has focused primarily on developing nutritional strategies for able-bodied athletes, leaving doubt as to whether these guidelines are suitable for {{the growing number of}} athletes with disabilities. The primary aim of this thesis, therefore, was to identify those key factors considered to be important in developing optimal nutritional strategies for athletes with disabilities from the perspectives of both the athletes themselves and sports dieticians. In the first of two studies, members of the 2004 Australian Paralympic swimming team were surveyed about their nutritional strategies around the time of competition. The team comprised 26 swimmers with disabilities (12 males, 14 females). A 31 -item self-administered questionnaire was completed by the team at a training camp in July, 2004. Most swimmers had competed at a national/international level for at least 2 years. However, only two swimmers had sought professional nutrition advice on more than five occasions. While 46 % of the team commence their <b>nutritional</b> <b>preparation</b> at least 3 days before competitions (BC), 35 % (4 males, 7 females) commence 24 hours BC. During the week BC, about 70 % of the swimmers reported that they consume the same amount of food (total food), with 58 % increasing high carbohydrate foods, 77 % maintaining high protein foods and 69 % decreasing high fat foods. A majority (77 %) of the swimmers increased their water consumption BC and 54 % increase their sports drinks consumption. Most of the swimmers (88 %) had their last meal 3 - 4 hours prior to a race, with 42 % consuming a high carbohydrate meal at this time. The survey findings indicated that the nutritional strategies adopted by the Paralympic swimmers leading up to competition were quite varied and, in some cases, may not have been appropriate for achieving peak performance for competition. Professional dietary advice obtained by the swimmers with disabilities also varied, indicating the need for closer attention to the nutritional needs of the swimmers around the time of competition. In the second study, 26 sports dietitians (25 females, 1 male; mean age 36. 6 ± 11. 6 years) who were members of Sports Dietitians Australia participated in an on-line survey (39 item questionnaire) about their professional experience, interest and opinions in providing nutritional advice to people with disabilities, both athletes and non-athletes. Most of the sports dietitians (80 %) lived in Australia and worked across several different employment areas, and 14 of them were accredited anthropometrists. Only eight (30. 8 %) of the sports dietitans were very interested in the topic of nutritional advice for people with disabilities, with seven (26. 9 %) showing little interest. Some of the sports dietitians had worked with athletes with disabilities (n= 10; 38. 5 %) and non-athletes with disabilities (n= 14; 53. 9 %). The sports dietitians mostly agreed that they would require details of the classification, level and duration of the client’s disability, socioeconomic background, physical injuries experienced, and types and doses of medications and nutritional/herbal supplements. However, there was disagreement on the use of dietary reference intakes based on healthy able-bodied people and the presence of a caregiver during consultation. The sports dietitians considered traditional anthropometric measures such as weight, BMI, sum of skinfolds, waist-hip ratio and the restricted anthropometric profile to be useful for athletes with a spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} Australian sports dietitians currently provide dietary advice to athletes and non-athletes with disabilities using guidelines based on the healthy able-bodied population. Several of the dietitians, however, stated that there was a need for specific anthropometric and nutritional guidelines for people with disabilities. The sports dietitians also identified the need for more professional development (e. g. reference materials, training courses) in providing dietary advice to people with disabilities.

40|$|Background: Increasing dietary {{protein intake}} synergistically {{improves}} {{the effect of}} exercise to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the plasma amino acid response of two novel protein <b>nutritional</b> <b>preparations,</b> beef protein isolate (BeefISO™) and hydrolyzed chicken protein isolate (MyoCHX™). Methods: The postprandial plasma amino acid response over 3 hours was monitored in young adults (n= 6) following consumption of 23 grams of WPC, BeefISO™, or MyoCHX™. Amino acid compositional analysis and molecular weight distributions of each protein were performed by HPLC. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA where appropriate and corrected for multiple comparisons to account for the cross-over design. Results: Compositional evaluations revealed similar levels of essential and branched-chain amino acids for WPC and MyoCHX™. While the results of this study predictably demonstrated plasma amino acids levels increased following consumption of the different proteins, the kinetics of the postprandial response was unique to each protein source. WPC and MyoCHX™ were rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma amino acid concentrations observed at 30 and 15 min, respectively. The slightly faster absorption of MyoCHX™ was associated with the increased peptide content of MyoCHX™ (greater than 76...|$|R

40|$|Glutamine, an amino acid, is the {{principal}} energy substrate for small intestinal cells. It also acts as a nitrogen carrier through its amide nitrogen. Arterial glutamine is supported by net synthesis in skeletal muscle. Glutamine is rapidly metabolized by the intestine, whether supplied from the lumen or from the arterial circulation. Intestinal uptake of glutamine increases after trauma and operative stress. The consumption of glutamine by the gut may in large part be dependent on mucosal glutaminase activity and on enterocyte glutamine transport. Glutaminc {{has been shown to}} improve gut morphology and outcome in animal models of encerocolitis. It may play a similar role in aiding repair of human intestinal injury in persons with sufficient glutamine in their diet compared to those who arc glutamine deficient. Glutamine may {{have a positive effect on}} the immune function of the intestinal mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. Glutamine is not currently available in <b>nutritional</b> <b>preparations</b> for routine clinical use, yet it has recently been shown to benefit maintenance of nitrogen balance in humans. Due to the instability and low solubility of glutamine, dipeptides have been studied. L-alanyl-L-glutamine seems to be the most promising glutamine precursor for parenteral use in humans, as it is safe and rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to release free glutamine. The exact role of glutamine as a therapeutic agent to promote intetitinal well-being has yet to be determined. However, preliminary evidence suggests that glutaminc will be helpful in a variety of clinical scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Functional food or {{medicinal}} food is any {{healthy food}} {{claimed to have}} a health-promoting or disease-preventing property beyond the basic function of supplying nutrients. Three <b>nutritional</b> <b>preparations</b> including wheat powder salt solution (WPSS), milk-wheat solution (MWS), fermented milk (FM) and fermented soymilk (FSM) were evaluated for their anti-diarrheal activity by oral administration in model of Castor oil induced diarrhea in rats. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) was used as positive control. The fermented products were prepared using a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 : and Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 700541 (1 : 1 v/v) to obtain a final level of 10 7 - 8 CFU/ml after incubation at 37 °C. Beside the gain body weight (BW), certain biochemical parameters such as total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, creatinine, alanine amino-transferase (ALT), aspartate amino-transferase (AST), sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron and phosphorus were determined. According to follow the diarrheal symptoms including stool frequency, stool characteristics and BW, rats administrated with FSM were recovered from diarrhea (on the 3 rd day) faster than other groups followed by those subjected with FM and CY. The ORS-positive control group rats were recovered on the 6 th day, while diarrheal symptoms still appeared on the negative control rats (subjected with basal diet only; without ORS) with 16 % death rate.

40|$|Effective defense {{response}} of the body requires the proper <b>nutritional</b> and metabolic <b>preparation</b> and adequate energy expenditure. Every pathological process with coexisting malnutrition is subject to {{an increased risk of}} failure and complications in medical treatment, which is a serious threat to human health and life. Malnutrition, particularly protein-calorie malnutrition, is characterized by a decrease in resistance, particularly involving cellular immune deficiency, which in turn causes a significant decrease in resistance to infections. Inflammation is the price that the organism has to pay for the effective antimicrobial defense. Therefore, uncontrolled changes may occur in the immune system in nutrition disorders, especially in a significant protein-calorie malnutrition, which in turn prevents the correct response to microbial infection, including bacterial infection, which occurs in the course of periodontitis or untreated caries disease. Research determining the relationship between the clinical state of oral health, selected immune parameters and indicators of nutritional status of the organism, is an alternative to other attempts undertaken to reduce these risks.

Methods: Fifty-nine hospitals in the People’s Republic of China participated in a nutrition survey. The resulting information on nutritional support was analyzed. Results: We received 379, 584 nutritional-support prescriptions over 40 days in 2013. PN provided approximately 63. 2 % and EN provided approximately 36. 8 % of nitrogen intake. PN provided 63. 5 % and EN provided 36. 5 % of lipid intake. There were obvious differences in nitrogen and lipid intake between PN and EN in different regions, departments, and diseases. The percentage of nourishment provided by PN in different regions was highest in Chengdu, followed by the Beijing, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou areas. The percentage of nourishment provided by PN in different departments was highest in general surgery, followed by gastroenterology and the intensive care unit. The percentage of nourishment provided by PN in different diseases/conditions was highest in acute pancreatitis, followed by cancer, and burns. The main source of nitrogen in PN was balanced amino-acid preparations, and in EN, it was protein. The main source of lipids in PN was long- and medium-chain triglyceride lipid emulsion injection. Conclusion: Despite recent improvements in the application of nutritional support in the People’s Republic of China, a much higher percentage of nitrogen and lipids is delivered through PN than through EN. Furthermore, there are marked regional, departmental, and disease-based differences in the selection of PN versus EN. The rationale for use of nutritional support needs to be improved.
