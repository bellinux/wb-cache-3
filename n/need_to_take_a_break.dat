5000|$|In season 6, Andy {{takes an}} {{interest}} in receptionist Erin Hannon, who has mutual affections, but due to miscommunication, {{there was a long}} period where the two waited for the other to make a move. However, Andy eventually asks Erin out on a date, and she graciously accepts. A few months later, after Erin discovers, through Michael Scott, of Andy's former engagement to accountant Angela Martin, she throws cake in Andy's face, and decides that they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from one another. Over a year later, Erin, after breaking up with Gabe Lewis, asks Andy out on a date, but he dismisses her advances, because of his lingering issues with her leaving him for Gabe. When Andy introduces his girlfriend Jessica to the Office at a Christmas party, Erin initially appears friendly to her, but she becomes drunk, and confesses to Andy that she wishes Jessica was deceased. Greatly offended, Andy informs Erin that she needs to get over their break-up, and briskly leaves. Upon learning that Erin wishes to live in Tallahassee, Florida, Andy drives to Tallahassee to get back together with Erin. At first he is unsuccessful, but ultimately gets her back, and they make up and kiss {{in the middle of the}} street. When Andy discovers his job is stolen by Nellie when he and Erin return to the office, he is demoted to salesman again and holds back his anger. The day seems to get worse when their sex life becomes the subject of a staff meeting, embarrassing them. When Nellie makes another quip, Erin snaps and in turn, encourages Andy to finally let his anger loose on Nellie, which later helps Andy get his confidence back and improves their sex life. However, during season 9, their relationship starts to show cracks as Andy comes back from a training seminar that has made him more confident, but seemingly more selfish to Erin. When Andy takes his parents boat to Bermuda for three weeks, he leaves Erin behind, who looks on disappointed. Erin later goes out with Pete, a new co-worker for drinks. Three weeks later becomes three months, which makes Erin increasingly unhappy after Andy neglects her by being unsociable. Erin later tries to dump Andy in [...] "Couples Discount", until he convinces her that they can fake love each other like his parents did. Erin initially agrees to this until she talks to Pete, who only wants her to be happy. This prompts Erin to finally break up with Andy by citing both his neglect for her and that he was irresponsible for being gone for three months from work. During [...] "Moving On", Andy's distraught behavior affects his professional relationship with Erin and the staff, and has him confiding some of the staff, including Pete, whom Erin is dating in secrecy from Andy. When Andy learns of their relationship, he acts irrationally to where Erin and Pete lecture him that he needs to move on. Vengeful, Andy hires both Gabe and Alice (Collette Wolfe), who is Pete's ex-girlfriend and a marketing professional, with the intent of making Erin and Pete uncomfortable. The ploy works to the point where arguments break out between the parties in the conference room, as Erin and Pete's issues with their past relationships surface. Andy smugly says to the camera that making the new couple unhappy, has made him feel better. In the episode Livin' the Dream, Andy and Erin are seen speaking pleasantly to each other and Erin even admits her concern for his well being saying she's worried he'll [...] "be homeless or even starve." [...] Later on during Andy's goodbye song Erin can be seen watching Andy with a serious look of affection, making it unclear whether or not the two still have romantic feelings for each other. In the Finale Andy, Erin, and even Pete are all shown to be getting along well and spending time together during the after party in the warehouse, indicating the tensions from earlier have vanished (though it is unclear if Erin and Pete are still a couple at that point, as the episode doesn't provide any evidence in either direction).|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{shifts the}} debate on {{sustainable}} tourism destinations from an emphasis on ecotourism and eco-resorts towards sustainable urban tourism destinations. A quantitative online survey of visitors to Melbourne, Australia, examined tourists' pro-environmental behaviours in four major categories: recycling; green transport use; sustainable energy/material use (lighting/water usage), and green food consumption. It explores five major antecedents to those categories: habitual behaviour, environmental attitudes, facilities available, a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from environmental duties, and sense of tourist social responsibility. The paper also examines the poorly understood belief that pro-environmental behaviour weakens when residents become tourists. Existing habits were found to strongly influence all four urban pro-environmental behaviours. Available facilities are {{the second most important}} antecedent. Overall, urban tourist pro-environment behaviour drivers differ markedly from those of residents or ecotourists. A range of tourism industry and public sector agency policy recommendations are made, in terms of developing specific, well sited and easy to find/use environmental infrastructure assets such as recycling facilities and public transport, reducing implementation barriers and in formulating an overall pro-environmental image for the destination. The study envisages a new concept, tourist social responsibility, with high relevance to furthering tourism's sustainability. Griffith Business School, Department of MarketingNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|In {{virtual reality}} space, {{we get a}} highly {{immersive}} sense, which allows us to concentrate well on work activities. In such space, there is, however, a general problem associated with desk work; continuously working decreases concentra-tion due to fatigue and other factors, and work efficiency is in turn decreased. To have some sense of feeling refreshed, workers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> In real space, workers can leave their work area to relax, so we hypothesized that we could help workers in virtual reality space to feel refreshed by changing their virtual environment. However, it is the timing of when the user needs refreshing that is problem-atic. We propose here a method of supporting personal work activities in virtual reality space utilizing physiological data obtained from the user. We evaluate whether the user’s physiological data {{as a measure of}} the extent of concen-tration can be used to determine when to switch the work space to a virtual conversation space for relaxation. As it is reported that previous the 60 seconds of brain activity level can indicate a worker’s mental state, when concentra-tion is determined to have decreased to below the reference threshold by monitoring brain waves, the work space is au-tomatically switched to a conversation space in which users can relax. The experimental results reveal that human error was decreased by the proposed method, resulting in improved work efficiency. These findings suggest the utility of the pro-posed technique in improving work efficiency in virtual re-ality space. 1...|$|E

40|$|Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} {{is one of}} {{the injury}} caused by the bad of MMH (Manual Material Handling). Laundry workers are at risk for musculoskeletal disorders. The risk is indicated by their working attitude. Their position is not ergonomic. The purpose of the study is to analyze the work attitude and to describe musculoskeletal disorders of laundry workers. This research used several laundry worker in tembalang region. The result showed that musculoskeletal disorders occur in skeletal muscle. It is the muscle of the neck, shoulders, arms, fingers, back, waist and low body muscles. The musculoskeletal issus is dominated by low back pain. The more of work period mean the more risk of musculoskeletal disorders for the worker. Additionaly, musculoskeletal disorders influenced by the excessive stretching of working poor posture, repetitive movements, bad working attitude. Based on the research, it can be conclude that the work postures during the ironing session are in the action level 2. It is indicated that the further and the deep investigation is needed. The most common complaint is on the neck, nape of neck, right shoulder, back, right upper arm, waist, hips, forearm, wrist, and right hand. In order to avoid musculoskeletal disorders, work posture and work tools that fit with the anthropometry of each respondent is needed. In ironing session, the workers need to use a chair with backrest. This backrest is aimed to support the back of the workers. During the ironing session, the workers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> for 5 to 10 minutes. This way, the workers can relax for a while.
