5|$|The {{production}} of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), {{released by the}} anterior pituitary gland. TSH release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> {{to occur}} on pulse {{secretion}} of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the <b>negative</b> <b>feedback,</b> breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. <b>Negative</b> <b>feedback</b> mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.|$|E
40|$|We {{tested a}} model based on goal-setting and {{self-regulation}} {{theories of the}} cross-lagged relationships among <b>negative</b> career-related <b>feedback,</b> <b>negative</b> affect (career-related stress), and career goal revision (downward goal revision and goal disengagement). Participants were 409 Chinese university/college students (Mage 19 years; 58 % female), who completed a survey at 2 time points approximately 6 months apart. Consistent with our hypotheses, <b>negative</b> career-related <b>feedback</b> at T 1 was related to more career goal disengagement and greater downward goal revision at T 2. Career-related stress partially mediated the relationship between <b>negative</b> career-related <b>feedback</b> and downward goal revision. In addition, there were reverse relationships between <b>negative</b> career-related <b>feedback</b> and career-related stress, and between career-related stress and goal disengagement. These findings highlight important roles for <b>negative</b> career-related <b>feedback</b> and <b>negative</b> affect in young peoples’ career goal pursuit.

40|$|Cellular {{networks}} {{are composed of}} complicated interconnections among components, and some subnetworks of particular functioning are often identified as network motifs. Among such network motifs, feedback loops are thought to play important dynamical roles. Intriguingly, such feedback loops are very often found as a coupled structure in cellular circuits. Therefore, we integrated all the scattered information regarding the coupled feedbacks in various cellular circuits and investigated the dynamical role of each coupled structure. Finally, we discovered that coupled positive feedbacks enhance signal amplification and bistable characteristics; coupled <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> realize enhanced homeostasis; coupled positive and <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> enable reliable decision-making by properly modulating signal responses and effectively dealing with noise...|$|R

40|$|Soil organisms {{influence}} {{plant species}} coexistence and invasion potential. Plant–soil feedbacks occur when plants change soil community composition such that interactions with that soil community in turn may positively or negatively affect {{the performance of}} conspecifics. Theories predict and studies show that invasions may be promoted by stronger <b>negative</b> soil <b>feedbacks</b> for native compared with exotic species. We present a counter-example of a successful invader with strong <b>negative</b> soil <b>feedbacks</b> apparently caused by host-specific, pathogenic soil fungi. Using a feedback experiment in pots, we investigated whether the relative strength of plant–soil feedbacks experienced by a non-native woody invader, Sapium sebiferum, differed from several native tree species by examining their performance in soils collected near conspecifics (‘home soils’) or heterospecifics (‘away soils’) in the introduced range. Sapium seedlings, but no native seedlings, had lower survival and biomass in its home soils compared with soils of other species (‘negative feedback’). To investigate biotic agents potentially responsible for the observed <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks,</b> we conducted two additional experiments designed to eliminate different soil taxa (‘rescue experiments’). We found that soil sterilization (pot experiment) or soil fungicide applications (pot and field experiments) restored Sapium performance in home soil thereby eliminating the <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> we observed in the original experiment. Such <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> apparently mediated by soil fungi could have important effects on persistence of this invader by limiting Sapium seedling success in Sapium dominated forests (home soils) though their weak effects in heterospecific (away) soils suggest a weak role in limiting initial establishment...|$|R

40|$|The ENSO observing {{system in}} the {{tropical}} Pacific {{plays an important role}} in monitoring ENSO and helping improve the understanding and prediction of ENSO. Occurrence of ENSO has been explained as either a self-sustained and naturally oscillatory mode of the coupled oceanatmosphere system or a stable mode triggered by stochastic forcing. In either case, ENSO involves the positive ocean-atmosphere feedback hypothesized by Bjerknes. After an El Niño reaches its mature phase, <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are required to terminate growth of the mature El Niño anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific. Four <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> have been proposed: reflected Kelvin waves at the ocean western boundary, a discharge process due to Sverdrup transport, western Pacific wind-forced Kelvin waves, and anomalous zonal advections. These <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> may work together for terminating El Niño, with their relative importance varying with time. Because of different locations of maximum SST anomalies and associated atmospheric heating, El Niño events are classified as eastern and central Pacific warming events. The identification of two distinct types of El Niño offers a new way to examine global impacts of El Niño and to consider how El Niño may respond and feedback to a changing climate. In addition to interannual variations associated with ENSO, the tropical Pacific SSTs also fluctuat...|$|R

BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits <b>negative</b> <b>feedback,</b> causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost of {{the global}} {{stability}} or convergence results appearing so far for delayed Lotka-Volterra-type systems or other delay differential systems require that the instantaneous <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> dominate both delayed feedback and interspecific interactions. Such a requirement is rarely met in real systems since feedbacks are generally delayed. This leads to the long standing question: Under what conditions will the global stability of a nonnegative steady state of a differential delay system persist when time delays involved in {{some part of the}} <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are small enough? This paper presents a partial answer to this open question. Roughly, our results show that if the delay differential system remains dissipative when delays are introduced, then the above open question has an affirmative answer. Our results also improve some recent findings...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Women with a {{negative}} body evaluation display covariation bias: They overestimate the relation between their own body and <b>negative</b> social <b>feedback.</b> This study aimed to develop a more fine-grained understanding of this covariation bias and {{to determine whether it}} could be diminished. METHODS: Seventy women completed a computer task wherein three categories of stimuli - pictures of their own body, a control woman's body, and a neutral object - were followed by (nonverbal) <b>negative</b> social <b>feedback</b> or nothing. Participants' estimates of the relation between each stimulus category and <b>negative</b> social <b>feedback</b> were assessed throughout the task. RESULTS: Before starting the task, women with a more negative state body evaluation expected their body to be followed by more <b>negative</b> social <b>feedback</b> (demonstrating a priori covariation bias). During the task, when the relation between stimulus category and <b>negative</b> social <b>feedback</b> was random, women with a more negative trait and state body evaluation perceived at the present moment (online covariation bias) and retrospectively (a posteriori covariation bias) that their body was followed by more <b>negative</b> social <b>feedback.</b> When contingencies were manipulated so that women's own body was rarely followed by <b>negative</b> social <b>feedback,</b> covariation bias was temporarily diminished; this coincided with improvements in state body evaluation. LIMITATIONS: The task did not incorporate neutral or positive social feedback and focused only on undergraduate women. CONCLUSIONS: Covariation bias exists preexperimentally and occurs when situational information is ambiguous. It is possible to (temporarily) diminish covariation bias. This might be a technique for improving body evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{non-linear}} controller for linear switched reluctance motors (LSRMs) {{is developed}} by utilizing their properties {{and the energy}} dissipation theory. As the electrical time constant is {{much smaller than the}} mechanical time constant, the whole LSRM driving system can be treated as a two-time-scale system.

Because a system consisting of two passive subsystems connected through <b>negative</b> <b>feedbacks</b> is still passive as a whole, stability of an LSRM driving system can be achieved at system level. The proposed control strategy is characterized by a simple structure and easy implementation. Experimental results are also provided to prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed position control for LSRM...|$|R
