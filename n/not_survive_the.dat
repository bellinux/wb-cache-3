5|$|Puritan {{prejudice}} did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> Restoration. In 1671, a {{man called}} Edward Bound was charged with playing cricket on the Sabbath and was exonerated: evidence that attitudes had changed. The case was reported in Shere, Surrey.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Girlschool's fondest fans {{formed a}} club called 'The Barmy Army', which {{followed}} {{and supported the}} band during every tour in Great Britain and Europe. The fan club did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> decline of the band and almost ceased its activities {{by the end of}} 1982.|$|E
5|$|Meskó was {{fighting}} for the punter position with undrafted rookie Ryan Allen. Meskó did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> final cuts. Bleacher Report stated {{that the reason for}} the cut was that if Meskó had stayed for his fourth year, he would have made $1.3 million, while Allen would only cost $405,000.|$|E
50|$|After 3.5 {{sacks in}} three seasons, the Patriots cut Cunningham on August 31, 2013, <b>not</b> <b>surviving</b> <b>the</b> final cuts.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} fifteen chapter {{version has}} <b>not</b> <b>survived.</b> <b>The</b> version available on DVD is the 1928 ten chapter re-release.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 2012, the Swiss {{government}} reported {{about half}} of the bee population had <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> winter. The main cause of the decline was thought to be the parasite Varroa destructor.|$|R
5|$|SpaceX {{initially}} {{attempted to}} land {{the first stage of}} the Falcon 1 by parachute, however the stage did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> re-entry into the atmosphere. They continued to experiment with parachutes on the earliest Falcon 9 flights after 2010. SpaceX subsequently switched its focus to developing a powered descent landing system.|$|E
5|$|The school's {{facilities}} were {{destroyed in the}} aftermath of a massive earthquake that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to Sidon but did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> Arab conquest of 635. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Beirut's historic center.|$|E
5|$|To {{commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Jeff Hall's death, the club {{commissioned}} a memorial clock {{to replace the}} original which did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> 1990s renovations. Placed centrally above the Main Stand, it was unveiled in September 2008 by Hall's teammates Alex Govan and Gil Merrick. However, adverse reaction to the clock's size and position provoked the club into ordering a larger replacement to be incorporated in a proposed big screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{external}} borders left by Bolesław III at {{his death}} closely resembled the borders left by Mieszko I; this original early Piast monarchy configuration had <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> fragmentation period.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Piazza del Campidoglio by Michelangelo has <b>not</b> <b>survived.</b> <b>The</b> project is based on {{drawings}} made at second hand. With CLACL was made a compositional hypothesis on a new basis.|$|R
50|$|Since her logs have {{apparently}} <b>not</b> <b>survived,</b> <b>the</b> ship decommissioning date is unknown, {{but she was}} sold at public auction at New York City on 30 November 1865. Her subsequent career remains a mystery.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{original}} incorporated city of Chicago in 1837, Rush Street is one of the city's oldest thoroughfares. Like Clark Street, parts of Rush Street roughly follow the path of an Indian trail called Green Bay trail (later Green Bay Road) that ran to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Early Rush Street was commonly agreed to be desirable place of residence, and hosted the first house designed by an architect in Chicago (designed for the first Mayor of Chicago William Ogden by John M. Van Osdel). The house, bounded by Erie, Ontario, Rush and Cass (now Wabash Avenue) Streets, did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> Great Chicago Fire of 1871.|$|E
5|$|Dale walks {{alone in}} the fields to cool off when he comes across a cow that has had its stomach gutted. Realizing the danger, {{he is about to}} head back when a walker attacks him. The group races towards his screams, and Daryl quickly dispatches the walker; Carl realizes it is the walker he found in the swamp. Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will <b>not</b> <b>survive.</b> <b>The</b> group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the {{revolver}} and ends Dale's suffering.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the results}} of the operation, the SOE and Combined Operations Headquarters {{believed}} that the SSRF could still be of use, and ensured that it was not dissolved. Command of the unit was given to the newly promoted Major Appleyard. At the end of 1942, most of SSRF were moved to Algeria and absorbed into the 2nd Special Air Service Regiment. Appleyard did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> war. He was returning from a Special Air Service mission when his plane was reported missing. It was the same day that Captain Hayes was executed in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} of the Proto-Austronesian language stops at the western shores of Taiwan; any related mainland language(s) have <b>not</b> <b>survived.</b> <b>The</b> only exceptions, the Chamic languages, derive from more recent migration to the mainland [...]|$|R
50|$|In Ireland {{the case}} of State (DPP) v Walsh and Conneely in 1981 found that {{presumption}} of marital coercion had <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> enactment of the 1937 Constitution and so the defence is no longer available there.|$|R
5000|$|The small {{aircraft}} company, founded {{with this}} money, did <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Versailles of 1919. His extraordinary construction of {{driving a car}} with no use of a gear-box did not stand against the established constructions.|$|R
5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, {{a small part}} of the ice floe broke away and he was only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of the men of the next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|Fusō and Yamashiro {{were the}} only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and both were lost {{in the early hours of}} 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} afloat and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for Yamashiro; she did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> encounter, and Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura went down with his ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{stained-glass windows}} have <b>not</b> <b>survived.</b> <b>The</b> oldest {{of those that}} exist now date from 1718. Of these, the window depicting the Adoration of the Magi (above the Door of Avemaria) {{is the work of}} Antoni Viladomat.|$|R
5000|$|Gulf Arabic has 10 {{personal}} pronouns. The conservative dialect has {{preserved the}} gender differentiation of the 2nd and 3rd {{person in the}} plural forms, whereas dual forms have <b>not</b> <b>survived.</b> <b>The</b> following table bears the generally most common pronouns: ...|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{a report}} was {{published}} stating {{the first case}} of CCD, according to more stringent definitions, occurring outside of the US was in Switzerland.At the end of May 2012, the Swiss government reported {{about half of the}} bee population had <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> winter. The main cause of the decline was thought to be the parasite Varroa destructor.|$|R
5|$|In April 1987, Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation burnt {{part of one}} {{population}} in an experimental regeneration fire. The mature plants were killed, and the seedlings that volunteered did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> summer drought. A Matchstick Banksia Recovery Team was established in 1995, and over time they succeeded in establishing {{a large number of}} seedlings. A large adult population was destroyed by bushfire in 1996, causing further concern, but this was followed by the recruitment of large numbers of seedlings.|$|E
5|$|In Earth 2, Green Lantern Alan Scott was {{revealed}} as gay. In issue 3, Scott is revealed {{to have a}} boyfriend named Sam, to whom he intends to propose while on vacation in China. Before he can do so, however, the train on which the couple is travelling is suddenly wrecked. A mysterious green flame protects Scott and heals him; a disembodied voice informs him that the crash {{was caused by a}} force that threatens the whole world, and that Sam did <b>not</b> <b>survive.</b> <b>The</b> grief-stricken Scott is then told that he will be given the power to avenge his love and protect the world.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> English {{invasion}} for long, for he {{was defeated}} and mortally wounded or killed by the future Malcolm III ("King Malcolm Ceann-mor", son of Duncan I) {{on the north side}} of the Mounth in 1057, after retreating with his men over the Cairnamounth Pass to take his last stand at the battle at Lumphanan. The Prophecy of Berchán has it that he was wounded and died at Scone, sixty miles to the south, some days later. Macbeth's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Gurnard {{arrived on}} the scene, found Captain Leroy Johnson, the {{aircraft}} commander, and brought him aboard. Lieutenant Colonel J.L. Vaughn, the radar navigator, had <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> night. Aircraft sighted his body floating face down, still tied to his raft.|$|R
50|$|Much of his monumental work, {{including}} a Kaiser Frederick I {{in front of}} the Bode Museum and an Otto I and two mounted figures placed on the attic level on the Reichstag building have <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> ravages that Berlin endured.|$|R
50|$|Though the playwright’s {{handwriting}} for Edward III has <b>not</b> <b>survived,</b> <b>the</b> text, as printed, {{has been}} analyzed {{in order to}} discover indications of characteristics that the handwriting might contain, {{in the same way}} that the First Folio and other printed texts have been scrutinized.|$|R
5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> proceedings, and knowing that his testimony was key to their case, prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under cross-examination by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to {{the problems in the}} couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E
5|$|Monitor {{likewise}} did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> year. She {{was ordered}} to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, {{to take part in}} the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon the water in the hold gained on the pumps, and then put out the fires in her engines. The order was given to abandon ship; most men were rescued by , but 16 went down with her when she sank in the early hours of December 31, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{policies}} that Diefenbaker held dear did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> 16 years of Liberal rule which followed his fall. By the end of 1963, {{the first of the}} Bomarc warheads entered Canada, where they remained until the last were finally phased out during John Turner's brief government in 1984. Diefenbaker's decision to have Canada remain outside the OAS was not reversed by Pearson, and it was not until 1989, under the Tory government of Brian Mulroney, that Canada joined.|$|E
50|$|In Byrne v Ireland, the Irish Supreme Court {{declared}} that sovereign immunity had <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> {{creation of the}} Irish Free State in 1922, and that accordingly the state could be sued for and held vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of its servants and agents.|$|R
50|$|Over 11,000 {{graffiti}} samples {{have been}} uncovered in the excavations of Pompeii. Archaeologists {{have been studying}} and recording graffiti in Pompeii since the 1800s. These documentations remain the best evidence of over 90 percent of recorded graffiti from the area, which has <b>not</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> elements.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{original}} score has <b>not</b> <b>survived,</b> <b>the</b> work can <b>not</b> be dated with certainty. Traditionally, scholars believed that Bach composed [...] for a funeral in Leipzig in 1726. Stylistic {{comparison with other}} works such as , suggests that Bach wrote it already in his Weimar period (1708-1717).|$|R
