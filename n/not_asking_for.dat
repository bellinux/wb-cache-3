The most elite students of the yeshiva would set out on foot to strange communities without money in their pockets, simultaneously abstaining from speech and <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a ride or even food.

He believed {{that there were many}} comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.|$|E

25|$|Many media {{accounts}} {{have linked}} this story with Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress that involved Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the first Muslim {{elected to the}} US Congress. Ellison's desire to use a Qur'an at the ceremonial reenactment of his oath, while symbolically important, was never a judicial issue. The swearing-in was en masse and involved no texts whatsoever. Both of the main figures taking issue with Ellison, Dennis Prager and US Representative Virgil Goode of Virginia, made sure to clarify that they were <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> him to be banned from serving if he insisted on using a Qur'an instead of a Bible at his reenactment photo-op. In this regard the Matten case is far more significant.|$|E

Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life. But I do not show my life directly, in full view; nor even look at it while others watch." ...|$|E

500|$|In Lucha Libre {{there is}} a long-standing {{tradition}} of keeping the personal information of masked wrestlers private from the public, including wrestling promotions not revealing their real names and news outlets <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> personal details in interviews. Because of this tradition the real name of the wrestler known under the ring names Rey Hechicero and Hechicero is not public knowledge, nor has the year of his birth been established, Hechicero himself has stated that he made his debut, on February 15, 2001, referring to it as [...] "Hechicero's" [...] birthday. Hechicero resides in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico {{but it has not}} been confirmed if this is also his birthplace. During interviews he revealed that he had been trained by a number of Monterrey local wrestlers both before making his debut and after such as Arcángel, Cachorrro Zapata, Chucho Villa, Garringo, Mario Segura, Pequeño Diamante and Katsuyori Shibata.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day (28 August), Deputy Foreign Minister of Indonesia Suwito summoned the British Charge d'Affaires {{complain that the}} British notification had been far too casual, and whilst <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> the British to receive Indonesian permission for such an action, he asked Britain to give a more formal, preferably written, announcement next time. Or else, Suwito warned, [...] "present tension might result in an unplanned, unwanted but serious incident," [...] a statement that was quickly {{passed on to the}} British government. The Charge d'Affairs replied that any further notice would be in writing, so as not to provoke any issue. Several days later, on 2 September, the day after the Labis landings, Subandrio took an even tougher line, telling the Australian Ambassador to Jakarta that the Victorious would be refused return passage through the Strait. The motivations for such a ban are not clear, as official documents on from the time are unavailable, but Subandrio's announcement was in line with government policy on passage through Indonesian waters, which was moving towards cracking down on unauthorized passages after an American carrier group had made the voyage earlier in the month. Indonesian policy-makers was also likely worried about the threat of British air power so close to Jakarta as well as the possibility that the British were attempting to provoke a response similar to the Vietnamese had made against America during the Gulf of Tonkin incident earlier that year. The latter seems exceedingly probable given Sukarno's furious response to the incident, and it is unsurprising in such a context that the response to the British incursion was equally forceful. In any case, the pervading thought in the Indonesian command was that this was a direct retaliation to the Pontian landings and a signal of British resolve, which although worrying could not overtake the British violation of their nautical claims in importance.|$|E
500|$|Rainey {{introduced}} legislation for an Alabama Centennial half dollar in the House of Representatives on February 28, 1920, {{with the bill}} designated as H.R. 12824. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on}} the coinage proposal that would become the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar, with the Alabama coin the first order of business. Congressman Rainey, in his bill, had asked for 100,000 quarter dollars, and while addressing the committee stated that the sole criticism of his coinage proposal in the Alabama press was one article suggesting he should have asked for double the amount. The choice of denomination came as a surprise to committee member William A. Ashbrook of Ohio, a coin collector, who asked why Rainey was <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> half dollars, as other states had. [...] Rainey was amenable to that, and also accepted Ashbrook's discouragement when the Alabaman wanted to double the authorized number of coins. [...] The committee voted to recommend Rainey's bill, with an amendment to provide for half dollars instead of quarters, and then proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston about the Pilgrim coin, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters. Vestal issued a report on behalf of his committee on March 27, 1920, indicating his committee's support for the Alabama bill once amended, and attaching the note from Secretary Houston.|$|E

[...] However, he felt the game did feature [...] "some genuinely disconcerting moments, an interesting story of demonic misadventure, some fairly ghastly sights and sounds, and some genuinely standout frights." [...] He further wrote [...] "Certainly it's been well designed in places." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering has some scary moments, {{but for the most}} part they punctuate a fairly regular, albeit twisted, action game, rather than driving it [...] It's a shame, because The Suffering could have been great.
