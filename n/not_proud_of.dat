500|$|With the {{approach}} of the Second World War, Raymond moved back to New York, ending the New Hope experiment. He formed a partnership with civil engineer Arthur Tuttle, structural engineer Elwyn Seelye and mechanical engineer Clyde Place. With the country's emphasis on the war effort, the company focused on US army contracts. Their work included: prefabricated houses at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey (1942) and Camp Shanks, New York (1942–1943) and housing and an airport in Fort Dix, New Jersey (1943). Controversially, in 1943, Raymond was asked to design a series of middle class Japanese style homes on which the Army could test the effectiveness ordnance (specifically incendiaries). These houses were eventually erected on the Dugway Proving Ground, nicknamed [...] "Japanese village". Raymond admitted in his autobiography that he was <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the work.|$|E

As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E

[...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I {{think it was a}} great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

He is now a different person, a Malaysian, but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others, but shared unequally. And {{as if this is}} not enough, he is being asked to give up more and more of his share of influence." [...] Mahathir's defence of Malay rights focused both on the [...] "definitive people" [...] line of reasoning and the argument in favour of affirmative action, which the Reid Commission had chosen: [...] "It is not... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon. ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non-Malays in the field of education. The Malays are <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> this treatment."

500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} {{so little time}} to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order {{to sound like a}} live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the fourth}} Test got underway, England won the match {{to take the}} series. Partly {{prompted}} by Jardine, Eddie Paynter scored 83 having released himself from hospital. Jardine went on to make a painstaking 24, at one point facing 82 balls without scoring a single run. He was <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his batting performance, being shamefaced to Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton, and describing his batting to Bill O'Reilly as being [...] "like an old maid defending her virginity." [...] England also won the final Test ending on 28 February, with a final clash taking place between Jardine and Larwood. After a long bowling spell, Larwood was furious when Jardine sent him in to bat as nightwatchman but went on to score 98 runs. Later, Larwood broke his foot while bowling in the second innings, but Jardine was not convinced that he was seriously injured. He made him stay on the field until Bradman was out. Larwood, partly through this injury and partly through political repercussions from this series, never played another Test. Also in this match, Jardine enraged Harry Alexander by asking him not to run on the pitch as he was damaging it and giving his side an advantage. He proceeded to bowl hostile bouncers at Jardine, who was struck painfully {{to the delight of}} the crowd.|$|E

500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{said the}} film was [...] "the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all". Richard Corliss of Time and David Ansen of Newsweek praised it, as did Vincent Canby of The New York Times. [...] "Though {{it seems to have}} the manner of some magically reconstituted B-movie of an earlier era, The Last Crusade is an endearing original," [...] Canby wrote, deeming the revelation Indiana had a father who was <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> him to be a [...] "comic surprise". Canby {{believed}} that while the film did not match the previous two in its pacing, it still had [...] "hilariously off-the-wall sequences" [...] such as the circus train chase. He also said that Spielberg was maturing by focusing on the father–son relationship, a call echoed by McBride in Variety. Roger Ebert praised the scene depicting Indiana as a Boy Scout with the Cross of Coronado; he compared it to the [...] "style of illustration that appeared in the boys' adventure magazines of the 1940s", saying that Spielberg [...] "must have been paging through his old issues of Boys' Life magazine... the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop. Spielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines." [...] The Hollywood Reporter felt Connery and Ford deserved Academy Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|The October 1970 Quebec FLQ Crisis put Lewis in the spotlight, {{as he was}} {{the only}} NDP MP with any roots in Quebec. He and Douglas were opposed to the October 16 {{implementation}} of the War Measures Act. The Act, enacted previously only for wartime purposes, imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties, and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects, usually with little to no evidence required. Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec, since it was federal legislation, it was in-force throughout Canada. Some police services, from outside of Quebec, took advantage of it for their own purposes, which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation, as Lewis and Douglas suspected. Sixteen of the 20 members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the War Measures Act in the House of Commons. They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it. [...] Lewis stated at a press scrum that day: [...] "The information we do have, showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the War Measures Act." [...] About five years later, many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so, and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it. [...] Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield {{went so far as to}} say that, [...] "Quite frankly, I've admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, and those fellows in the NDP for having the courage to vote against that, although they took a lot of abuse at the time....I don't brood about it. I'm <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|E

According to Carpenter, the editing process was very bare bones. One mistake Carpenter was <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> was one shot [...] "cut out of frame," [...] which means the cut is made within the frame so a viewer can see it.

[...] In her own opinion, her writing improved considerably during this period; {{with her children}} entering school, {{she was able to}} devote a great deal more focus to it than had been possible since she graduated from Duke. [...] With Celestial Navigation, Tyler begin to get national recognition: Gail Godwin gave it a very favorable review in the New York Times Review of Books. While she is <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> her first four novels, Tyler considers this fifth novel one of her favorites. [...] It was a difficult book to write she notes, since it required rewriting draft after draft to truly develop her understanding of the characters. John Updike gave a favorable review to her next novel, Searching for Caleb, writing, “Funny and lyric and true, exquisite in its details and ambitious in its design…This writer is not merely good, she is wickedly good.” Afterwards he proceeded to take an interest in her work and reviewed her next four novels as well. Morgan's Passing (1980) won the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for Fiction and was nominated for both the American Book Awards and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Joyce Carol Oates gave it good review in Mademoiselle: “Fascinating….So unconventional a love story that it appears to take its protagonists themselves by surprise.” ...|$|E

He {{acknowledges}} doing things he was <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> to keep her safe, and tells Claire that Sylar had been taken care of, but that she must keep silent about her powers because she is in danger from others like him. Bennet later meets with Sylar, confined in a prison cell, and tells him that the cell is keeping his powers suppressed. Sylar taunts Bennet telling him that Bennet is just like him. [...] In their next confrontation Bennet turns the taunt back at Sylar telling him how they plan to study him to determine what makes him [...] "tick." [...] Sylar boasts that he would escape and kill Claire, taking her healing abilities. Eden suggests using her powers to persuade Sylar to kill himself, but Bennet declines (though briefly tempted), as he takes orders from someone higher up. Bennet later takes Claire to the police station, where she is interviewed about Jackie's murder. Officer Parkman is unable to read the thoughts of Claire or her father, since the Haitian is hiding behind a nearby corner. Afterwards, Bennet orders the Haitian to wipe the memories of his son and Claire's friend, Zach. [...] When Claire finds out {{that the two of them}} have lost all memory of her powers she rings her father in a panic. [...] It is left open whether it is only then that he orders the Haitian to wipe Claire's memories or whether he has already done so.|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, Einstein {{released}} the album Mazal Gdi (Capricorn), {{which was not}} very successful. He therefore looked for a new sound {{and went on to}} produce the album Puzi with the Churchills, considered the first Israeli rock album. He stopped performing live in the early 1980s. He said: [...] "I performed from the age of 18 until I was 42...I wasn't exactly a stage animal. I was held back by the embarrassment, the bashfulness, and it became more evident as the years went by... By the way, when I say bashfulness, I'm <b>not</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it... I wish I could grab a microphone and sing like a Sinatra, but I don't have what it takes, and a person should adapt to his capabilities. On the other hand, in the studio, I blossom. That's my natural habitat, where I'm not bashful. The problem is that this profession has its field mines: success is accompanied by fame and a form of adoration, and I really don't get along with that. That's where I draw the line. It's pleasant to be loved, but not more." [...] For those who knew Einstein this came as no surprise. Einstein was regarded as a very humble and modest musician who focused solely on the artistic and creative aspect of the musical world and actively shied away from the lime-light, fame, and the entertainment business. This was also evident much later in his career when he preferred to collaborate with lesser known and younger musicians as the lifestyle and obsession with fame of more prominent artists did not suit his style.|$|E
