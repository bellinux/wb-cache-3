40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{characterize}} fiber reinforcements used in the pultrusion process in terms of compressibility and permeability. The compressibility of single and multiple layers of reinforcement are obtained by applying a defined compression load ramp to the material positioned into a tool mounted to a universal testing machine.

The tensile strength of silane coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 °C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. The water sized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution of the water sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three parameter Weibull distribution. The strength distributions of the sized fibres were more complicated and required the use of a bimodal Weibull distribution.

40|$|Textile {{reinforced}} concrete (TRC) {{is a composite}} <b>of</b> <b>rovings</b> (multi filament yarns) and fine grained concrete which is used in civil engineering to fabricate new structural elements and to strengthen existing constructions. The proposed multi-scale approach {{is based on a}} hierarchical material description on the micro, the meso and the macro scale. The paper deals with structural models of the macro scale, using the detailed information of the micro- and the mesoscopic models to simulate the behavior of typical structural members made of {{reinforced concrete}}. Due to the textile reinforcement in TRC the crack opening displacements are very small. This leads to the major influence of the post cracking behavior of concrete on the overall response of the structural member. In the case of a steel and textile reinforced concrete plate the simulated crack width of the meso model is used to capture this effect within the framework of a multi-scale analysis.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the {{documented}} research project the focus was on investigating the modification of carbon fibers by electropolymerization and impregnation <b>of</b> carbon fiber <b>rovings</b> by means <b>of</b> aqueous polymer powder dispersions. Bringing to bear the outstanding mechanical characteristics of carbon fibers in composite materials requires a purposeful modification of the fiber surfaces adapted to the respective matrix material. Based on the natural conductivity of carbon fibers the method of electropolymerization offers itself. Among the variety of possibilities of electrochemical deposition of polymers, oxidative anodic polymerization of monomers, which leads to intrinsically conductive polymers, was selected. The formation of these polymers occurs in a step-by-step reaction analog to polycondensation. In the process, at least two electrochemical oxidation equivalents are required for each step of growth, with the polymers being deposited as conducting polymeric radical cations containing anions dispersed from the conducting salt used in the electrolytic bath. The investigation of deposited polymers was made by means of gravimetry, electrochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) was used as matrix material. Handling of this subject involved the problem whether it would not be appropriate to substitute powder impregnation for melt impregnation during the impregnation <b>of</b> <b>rovings.</b> Relating to this problem, contributions were made in respect of procurement, classification, characterization and production of fine particle polymer powders.

40|$|The {{potential}} of mechanical joints in monolithic carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates {{is limited by}} the poor local bearing response under bolt loads. To improve the mechanical performance of bolt-loaded open holes, often metallic inserts or fiber reinforcements like Advanced and Tailored Fiber Placement (AFP, TFP) are used. In this work, an alternative to AFP and TFP is investigated, where winded carbon rovings are twisted around the bolt and work without sewing. These multi-loop <b>rovings</b> consist <b>of</b> turns around the hole and free slings in the design area around the hole.

On principle manufacturing methods for planar textiles, like special lenofabrics and lattice-like multiaxial-multiply-fabrics are developed. For the production of threedimensional reinforcement textiles, a double wall warp knittting machine and a circular warp knitting machine are presented.

Damit lassen sich die den Verbundwerkstoff charakterisierenden mechanischen Kenngrößen aus experimentell ermittelten Kraft-Verschiebungs-Abhängigkeiten ableiten. Diese Kenngrößen sind mit heutiger Messtechnik nicht direkt experimentell bestimmbar. Es wird ein Mikro-Meso-Makro-Prognosemodell (MMM-Prognosemodell) für Textilbeton entwickelt, das basierend auf der Simulation des Mikrostrukturverhaltens das makroskopische Materialverhalten prognostiziert. Die Grundlage dafür bildet die {{qualitative}} und quantitative Bestimmung der Verbundeigenschaften zwischen der Filamentbewehrung und der einbettenden Matrix.

The present work {{deals with}} the simulation and the prediction of the effective material behavior of the high performance composite textile reinforced concrete (TRC) subjected to tension. Based on a hierarchical material model within a multi scale approach the load bearing mechanisms of TRC are modeled on three structural scales. Therewith, the mechanical parameters characterizing the composite material can be deduced indirectly by experimentally determined force displacement relations obtained from roving pullout tests. These parameters cannot be obtained by contemporary measuring techniques directly. A micro-meso-macro-prediction model (MMM-PM) for TRC is developed, predicting the macroscopic material behavior by means of simulations of the microscopic and the mesoscopic material behavior. The basis is the qualitative and quantitative identification of the bond properties of the roving-matrix system. The partial impregnation <b>of</b> the <b>rovings</b> and the corresponding varying bond qualities are identified to characterize the bond behavior <b>of</b> <b>rovings</b> in a fine-grained concrete matrix. The huge variety of roving cross-sections is approximated by superellipses on the meso scale. The macroscopic behavior of TRC subjected to tension including multiple cracking of the matrix material is correctly predicted {{on the basis of}} the micro- and meso-mechanical models. The calibration and verification of the MMM-PM is performed by simulations of roving pullout tests, whereas a first validation is carried out by a comparison of the numerical predictions with the experimental data from tensile tests. The MMM-PM for TRC is applied to tensile tests of structural members made of TRC. Furthermore, a steel-reinforced concrete plate strengthened by a TRC layer is accurately simulated yielding the macroscopic deflection of the plate, the mesoscopic stress state of the roving and the microscopic stresses of the filaments...|$|R

This study {{aimed to develop}} effective organo-silicate coatings for wool textiles. Formulations based on silanes with contrasting properties were applied to fabrics by padding and to single fibres and rovings by dip coating, and examined by microscopy. The bending rigidities and water repellencies of fabrics, and the tensile properties <b>of</b> <b>rovings</b> were determined. The silanes used were methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and (3 -glycidoxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GLYMO). Methylimidazole (MI) was used to catalyse the reaction between the epoxy groups of GLYMO and the amine groups of wool. MTES coatings of up to 3. 0 % solids on mass of wool {{could be applied to}} woven fabric without causing unacceptable stiffness. MTES coatings of as little as 0. 3 % solids on mass of wool imparted water repellency. The water repellency was increased by adding hydrophobic compounds to the formulation. Hydrophilic GLYMO-MI formulations gave greater wetting and coverage of dip coated single fibres than MTES formulations, due to the greater reactivity of the fibre surface towards GLYMO, and the flocculation of hydrophobic MTES during drying. On roving, inter-fibre bonding masked the differences between MTES and GLYMO-MI coatings observed in single fibre studies. At low levels (&# 61603; 0. 05 % by mass of formulation solids), a non-ionic surfactant improved the ability of GLYMO-MI coatings to wet-out wool, while at higher levels it caused flocculation. The surfactant had an inconsistent effect on MTES coatings. Increasing the critical surface tension of wool by chlorination, lowered the minimum GLYMO-MI solids level needed for continuous coating from 4. 0 % to 3. 0 %. In contrast, chlorination gave only small improvements to MTES coatings. The surface of wool accommodates extension by the separation of cuticle scales. Continuous coatings hinder this separation and crack at the scale junctions. It has been shown that these undesirable effects are avoided with discontinuous coatings, such those produced by MTES formulations. This work has shown that organo-silicate coatings can be tailored by choice of silane precursors, addition of surfactant, controlling reactivity between coating and wool, and modifying wool's surface energy, to effectively coat wool textiles...|$|R
