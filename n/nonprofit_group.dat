25|$|Two {{personal}} injury lawsuits, seeking more than $200,000 in compensation, were brought against Dogpatch USA in 1979 {{and settled in}} 1980.

25|$|When {{the school}} finally made public {{its plans to}} move the Maxwell Street Market and {{demolish}} the buildings, the community petitioned to list the Maxwell Street Market area on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, in 1994, and again in 2000. This effort was spearheaded by the Maxwell Street Historic Preservation Coalition, a <b>nonprofit</b> <b>group</b> based in Chicago. The proposal was eventually turned down {{as a result of}} efforts by the University, backed by Mayor Richard M. Daley (son of Richard J. Daley). In 2004 the Maxwell Street Historic Preservation Coalition was renamed the Maxwell Street Foundation, reflecting its current mission to preserve the history of the Market through its website and other outreach efforts. The Foundation also serves as an advocate for the New Maxwell Street Market, a downsized version of the original, located on Desplaines Street from Roosevelt Road north to Harrison Street. It has been suggested that President Barack Obama's Presidential Library may be located near this area at the University of Illinois. Local retail stores may be given an economic boost if this occurs and quite possibly once again there will a reason to bring the Blues back to this area.|$|E
