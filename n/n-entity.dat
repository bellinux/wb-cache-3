5000|$|In telecommunication, a <b>n-entity</b> is {{an active}} element in the n-th layer of the Open Systems Interconnection--Reference Model (OSI-RM) that (a) interacts {{directly}} with elements, i.e., entities, of the layer immediately above or below the n-th layer, (b) is defined by {{a unique set of}} rules, i.e., syntax, and information formats, including data and control formats, and (c) performs a defined set of functions.|$|E
5000|$|At {{each level}} two {{entities}} (<b>N-entity)</b> interact {{by means of}} the (N) protocol by transmitting Protocol Data Units (PDU).Service Data Unit (SDU) is a specific unit of data that has been passed down from an OSI layer, to a lower layer, and has not yet been encapsulated into a PDU, by the lower layer. It is a set of data that is sent by a user of the services of a given layer, and is transmitted semantically unchanged to a peer service user [...]The PDU at any given layer, layer 'n', is the SDU of the layer below, layer 'n-1'. In effect the SDU is the 'payload' of a given PDU. That is, the process of changing a SDU to a PDU, consists of an encapsulation process, performed by the lower layer. All the data contained in the SDU becomes encapsulated within the PDU. The layer n-1 adds headers or footers, or both, to the SDU, transforming it into a PDU of layer n-1. The added headers or footers are part of the process used to make it possible to get data from a source to a destination.|$|E
