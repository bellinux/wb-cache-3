The most mineralogically interesting are the associated agpaitic (alkali rich, low aluminium and silicon) pegmatites, the intrusive breccias, and the hornfels derived from the metasomatised sedimentary wall rocks. There have been over 366 distinct species of minerals collected at Mont Saint-Hilaire, 50 of which have this site as type locality.|$|E
25|$|Soft-paste porcelains {{date back}} from the early {{attempts}} by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit. Soapstone and lime were {{known to have been}} included in these compositions. These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures. As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality. Formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenite</b> or other feldspathic rocks. These were technically superior, and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.|$|E
40|$|The Early Cenozoic {{alkaline}} {{complex of}} Morro de Sa˜o Joa˜o intrudes the Precambrian basement {{at the eastern}} end of the Rio de Janeiro coastline. It is mostly made up of melanocratic <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> and <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites,</b> with subordinate clinopyroxenites, shonkinites (melasyenites), and alkali gabbros. Melanocratic <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> and <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> are cross-cut by thin dykes, ranging in composition from phonotephrite to phonolite. The mafic–ultramafic rocks are meso- to orthocumulates, with mineral compositions and whole-rock chemistry suggesting crystallization from a moderately evolved batch of magmas (potassic tephrite/ phonotephrite). Melanocratic <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> and <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> likely represent magma–crystal mixtures, whereas a few finegrained rocks roughly approximate liquid compositions; alkali syenites are typical cumulitic rocks. Major and trace element compositions reflect a genesis of clinopyroxenitic to shonkinitic rocks from tephritic parental magmas, which evolved toward phonotephritic and phonolitic compositions. Initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios (0. 7048 – 0. 7061 and 0. 51231 – 0. 51239, respectively) overlap the values in the analog intrusions of the Serra do Mar province, supporting a genesis from similar parental magmas and source mantle. The dominant lithospheric components of the latter may be responsible for the potassic affinity and strongly incompatible element enrichment of the derived melts...|$|R

50|$|Macroscopic {{aspects of}} <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenite</b> {{are similar to}} those of granite. The {{presence}} of nepheline and absence of quartz are the fundamental difference. Biotite is generally of low content and the main mafic minerals are clinopyroxene (±) and amphibole (±). The macroscopic colour is grey, being little darker than granite. There is high-grade metamorphic rock originated from <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenite</b> that is characterized by gneiss texture of very rare occurrence.

40|$|<b>Nepheline</b> natrolite <b>syenites</b> of Center 2 of the Coldwell {{alkaline}} complex exhibit rare wispy mafic-rich modal layering, extensive xenolith-rich {{zones and}} {{a wide variety of}} textural types, the latter resulting from the imposition of high temperature shearing and recrystallization on consolidated syenite. The textures developed range from allotriomorphic granular to porphyroclastic to mosaic granulob-lastic. The <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> are pyroxene-poor. Pyroxenes occur most commonly as corroded diopside to diopsidic hedenbergite cores surrounded by amphibole and less commonly as acmitic hedenbergite overgrowths upon cores of iron-rich amphiboles. Amphiboles are the dominant mafic phase and range from magnesian hastingsitic hornblende to hastingsite to hastingsitic hornblende to ferroedentic hornblende. Nephelines contain excess silica and have not equilibrated to compositions characteristic of low temperatures. Feldspars lack microcline twinning and perthites and have undergone extensive ion exchange at high sub-solidus temperatutes with sodium-rich fluids. Formation of late stage primary and replacement natrolite, muscovite and thomsonite is characteristic. The <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> are considered {{to be a part of}} a cycle of continental rift magmatism and to have been emplaced by cauldron subsidence as a hot hydrous magma. The rocks did not undergo long term subsolidus re-equilibration as the high temperature mineral assemblage has been preserved by uplift during post-intrusive regional block faulting. The <b>nepheline</b> <b>syenites</b> were probably derived by extensive fractional crystallization of alkali basaltic magmas...|$|R
