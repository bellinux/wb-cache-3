40|$|We {{study the}} long {{standing}} {{issue of whether}} markets can supply banks with sufficient liquidity or whether markets should be complemented with a lender of last resort (LOLR). For this purpose, we develop an extended version of the recent model of Holmström and Tirole (1998) on the supply of liquidity to firms. H&Ts original model analyses liquidity supply to firms that are facing solvency shocks. We apply their framework to banking and extend the framework to admit the analysis of problems associated with transitory <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows,</b> even absent any change in a bank's value. Our premise is that the scope for moral hazard may increase in connection with <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows.</b> Moral hazard, which we interpret as the possibility of laxity in banks' monitoring of firms, may increase with <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows</b> because banks need to increase their monitoring efforts in order to safeguard their own interests. The model illustrates many key aspects the classical LOLR debate. The model shows how moral hazard limits of banks’ ability to borrow from markets to cover <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows.</b> It also predicts banks’ demand for liquid reserves and the economies associated with centralization of reserves in a liquidity pool when the holding of liquid reserves entails opportunity costs. Finally, the model enables discussion of viable lending policies for the LOLR and contrasts these with the ‘Bagehotian principles’, which are still widely used as benchmark criteria in evaluating LOLR operations. liquidity; lender of last resort; banking; central banking...|$|R

The {{goal of the}} {{research}} described in this paper {{was to investigate the}} causes and sources of financing this deficit. Hence, an analysis of disequilibrium measures in the balance of payments, for a period of the past five years, more precisely, from 2010 to 2014, was conducted. The analysis comprised the standard measures of disequilibrium, but also some nowadays not so frequently used measures such as the basic balance, the <b>net</b> <b>liquidity</b> balance and the official settlements balance. The cause of the current account deficit is the merchandise trade balance deficit, which is higher than the sum of the balance of services, balance of primary income and balance of secondary income surpluses. This deficit is financed largely by foreign direct investment, but also by debt instruments based on other investment, because of which the country 2 ̆ 7 s external debt grows. Given that the merchandise trade balance deficit was the main cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina current account deficit, in order to solve this problem, the country has to stimulate exports of goods and to lessen its import dependence. Simultaneously, the country needs to strengthen the balance of services surplus.

One of the most important sets of regulations is the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) where the liquidity coverage requirement has been inserted.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyse}} the {{connection}} between the Eurozone's balance of payments crisis and the TARGET 2 balances. These balances represent mutual clearing relationship of the individual euro area member states to the European Central Bank inside the TARGET 2 system, which serves as a heart of the Eurozone's payment settlements. In fact, the central banks of the core countries hold significant positive balances while the peripheral central banks accumulated substantial negative positions. The TARGET 2 balances appeared mainly {{as a consequence of the}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflow</b> from the peripheral countries to the core due to the large imbalances in fundamental factors such as the NCA deficits, net foreign debt, public and private debt or competitiveness. The development of the balances was further facilitated via uneven liquidity provisions from the Eurosystem, as the peripheral countries effectively financed their balance of payments disequilibrium by issuing new liquidity that almost immediately moved to the core. The banking systems of the core started to operate in the liquidity excess status as the monetary base increased in 2011 and 2012. Assets with questionable quality collateralized the increasing refinancing operations in the periphery as the collateral requirements were repeatedly lowered. It resulted in an increase in the credit risk of these operations primarily in the periphery countries. This situation, among many others presented in this thesis, raises further questions about the parameters of the future single monetary policy as well as the continuance of the European monetary union...|$|R
40|$|The extant {{literature}} has documented {{the significance of}} foreign trades on domestic markets {{as well as the}} importance of commonality in liquidity in a market, but it seems to be silent on how foreign trades affect commonality in liquidity, especially at the transaction level. The lack of research that investigates this line of enquiry provides the overarching research theme for this thesis. To investigate the research theme I use transaction data from the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) that allows me to identify the trading activities of foreign-versus-domestic investors on a trade-by-trade basis. I find that foreign investors enhance commonality in spread when they initiate trades {{on both sides of the}} market which are motivated either by differences in interpreting information or by the desire to trade immediately, but not by information asymmetry. This finding is surprising given the prevalence of asymmetric information evidence surrounding domestic and foreign interaction and the proposition of Chordia, Roll and Subrahmanyam (2000) suggesting that information asymmetry could induce commonality in liquidity. The lack of evidence to link information asymmetry between domestic and foreign investors and commonality in liquidity, along with the findings indicating that foreigners trade more aggressively than locals, lead me to raise and investigate a follow up research question. This second research question is why do foreigners have a propensity to place more aggressive orders as costs associated with these trades are higher? Investigating the second research question, I find more evidence to exclude information asymmetry as the channel through which foreigners affect commonality in liquidity and find more evidence to support the finding that foreigners affect commonality in liquidity through their desire to trade immediately. This finding implies that an inventory risks explanation is more appropriate in explaining the impact of foreign trades on commonality in liquidity. Given that foreign trades are aggressive and this affects commonality in liquidity, I then examine whether their trades are motivated by information advantage. Using price discovery analysis, I find that domestic investors make a greater contribution to the price discovery process compared to foreign investors and the contribution of domestic investors to the price discovery process can be explained by domestic and foreign interactions. Furthermore, analysing the information types that are reflected in domestic and foreign price series, I find that domestic prices reflect firm-specific information while foreign price series reflect systematic information. These findings, along with the findings on the price discovery analysis, seem to suggest that the low contribution of foreign investors to the price discovery process could be due to the fact that they base their investment decisions on systematic information, rather than firm-specific information. In summary, I find evidence suggesting that foreign investors affect commonality in liquidity through their needs of immediacy rather than information asymmetry. The evidence also suggests that there is a mutually-beneficial relationship between foreign (<b>net)</b> <b>liquidity</b> demanders and domestic (<b>net)</b> <b>liquidity</b> suppliers. This enduring relationship holds up very well during the 2008 financial crisis, demonstrating its resilience. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Business School, 201...|$|R

We test whether banks bid at lower rates in MROs before the LTRO and at higher rates after the LTRO, compared to other operations. We offer two main findings. First, we find that in general banks bid in the MRO before the LTRO at lower rates as compared to 2 ̆ 01 cother 2 ̆ 01 d MROs.

40|$|Central bankers wish {{to ensure}} {{worldwide}} that large-value transfer systems, {{as a component}} of the key market infrastructure, exhibit sufficiently robust levels of operational resilience. We focus on the operational resilience of the Hungarian real time gross settlement system, known as VIBER. The goal of the research is the quantitative assessment of the ability of the system to withstand certain types of operational shocks. Systemically important participants are identified and it is argued that they overlap with endangered participants. An indicative list of participants who might be endangered by a liquidity shock is compiled by analysing proxies for liquidity risk. We shed light on the capacity of the system to function smoothly in the event of operational problems by simulating the technical default of one or two systemically important participants in VIBER. Altogether six plausible scenarios were formed, three entire-day incidents and three incidents involving less time (part-time incidents). The impact of behavioural reactions of technically non-defaulted participants and the application of existing backup procedures are also considered. The disturbance in the payment system was measured by the value of initially not submitted payments, the value of rejected payments, the total value of queued payments, the maximum queue value, the average queue length and the settlement delay. By means of gross and <b>net</b> <b>liquidity</b> deficit indicators, liquidity assistance required to settle all previously rejected transactions is calculated. By comparing the value of unsettled payments with the value of eligible collaterals in the banks' balance sheet, we can gain insight into whether the liquidity deficit can be financed through normal monetary policy operations...|$|R

The financial indicators {{examined in this study}} were: sales (value and growth), Net Income, Profitability, <b>Net</b> Working Capital, <b>Liquidity,</b> General Debt, Long Term Debt, EBITA and Indicators of export. After the analysis we can conclude that the companies participating in the ISE have greater potential for sales and exports. Companies that {{are not part of the}} ISE have better financial performance...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{identify}} the political and financial risk components that matter most for the activities of multinational corporations. Our paper is the first paper to comprehensively {{examine the impact of}} various components of not only political risk but also financial risk on inward FDI, from both long-run and short-run perspectives. Using a sample of 93 countries (including 60 developing countries) for the period 1985 - 2007, we find that among the political risk components, government stability, socioeconomic conditions, investment profile, internal conflict, external conflict, corruption, religious tensions, democratic accountability, and ethnic tensions have a close association with FDI flows. In particular, socioeconomic conditions, investment profile, and external conflict appear to be the most influential components of political risk in attracting foreign investment. Among the financial risk components, only exchange rate stability yields statistically significant positive coefficients when estimated only for developing countries. In contrast, current account as a percentage of exports of goods and services, foreign debt as a percentage of GDP, <b>net</b> international <b>liquidity</b> as the number of months of import cover, and current account as a percentage of GDP yield negative coefficients in some specifications. Thus, multinationals do not seem to consider seriously the financial risk of the host country.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} alternative option pricing models based either on jump-diffusion nor stochastic volatility data generating processes. We assume either a smooth volatility function of some previously defined explanatory variables or a model in which discrete-based observations can be employed to estimate both path-dependence volatility and the negative correlation between volatility and underlying returns. Moreover, we also allow for liquidity frictions to recognize that underlying markets may not be fully integrated. The simplest models tend to present a superior out-of sample performance and a better hedging ability, although the model with liquidity costs seems to display better in-sample behavior. However, none of the models seems {{to be able to}} capture the rapidly changing distribution of the underlying index return or the net buying pressure characterizing option markets. pricing, conditional volatility, hedging, <b>liquidity,</b> <b>net</b> buying pressure. ...|$|R
