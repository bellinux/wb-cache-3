In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single ovaries, much harder by <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> detect.

5|$|After several {{variants}} were proposed {{but later}} abandoned, some industry observers became skeptical of new aircraft proposals from Boeing. However, in early 2004, Boeing announced tentative {{plans for the}} 747 Advanced that were eventually adopted. Similar in <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> the 747-X, the stretched 747 Advanced used technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems.

40|$|Connectedness <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> (i. e., an {{affective and}} experiential {{connection}} <b>to</b> <b>nature)</b> is known <b>to</b> {{have a positive}} effect on psychological well-being, but its specific associations with body image have not been fully examined. To attend to this oversight, we conducted a preliminary investigation of associations between connectedness <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> and body appreciation. A total of 380 British adults completed measures of connectedness <b>to</b> <b>nature,</b> body appreciation, and self-esteem. Bivariate correlations revealed significant positive associations between all variables in women. In men, body appreciation was significantly correlated with self-esteem, but not connectedness <b>to</b> <b>nature.</b> Mediation analysis showed that, in women, self-esteem fully mediated the relationship between connectedness <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> and body appreciation. In men, body appreciation was significantly associated with self-esteem, but not connectedness <b>to</b> <b>nature.</b> These results point to a potential route for improving body image among women through connectedness <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> and self-esteem, but further research is necessary...|$|R

His men rob the original copies of the loan documents in the local branch of Bank of Maharashtra and destroy the bank records. Surya slowly becomes both popular and feared as an extortionist, while Dharavi locals praise him as their saviour. Surya is aware of Bhardwaj's intentions. To safeguard himself, he traps Bhardwaj's daughter Chitra, a keen painter, by posing as a NRI businessman interested in arts. They both fall in love. However, by the time Surya realises that he truly loves her, Bhardwaj has exposed Surya's real <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> Chitra which makes her hate him. Surya is immediately arrested.|$|E
5|$|At Nintendo's E3 {{press conference}} on June 15, 2010, the Nintendo 3DS {{handheld}} console was revealed.

The gameplay is similar in <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> DJ Hero, where the stylus and touchscreen are used to mimic scratching and crossfading between songs. It is unknown if the game is still in development after Activision stopped production of the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero franchises.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in <b>nature.</b> <b>To</b> gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E

5|$|Czechoslovak {{education}} in the Czech and German language ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechoslovaks emigrated to core Czechoslovakia (the later Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> that of the Czechoslovak ones before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new Polish national authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often fired from work. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. The local Poles continued to feel like second-class citizens {{and a majority of}} them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only 11 months until the invasion of Poland started on 1 September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> {{the culture of the}} time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, {{the diaries}} of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His {{description}} of Napoleon {{in the months}} before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in <b>Nature</b> <b>to</b> put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.|$|E

40|$|Volume 13 of BiAS series {{brings out}} into {{prominence}} {{issues at the}} bottom of dialogue between African and Christian attitudes <b>to</b> <b>nature.</b> The Shona notion of hierarchy of sacredness of <b>nature</b> as opposed <b>to</b> the intrinsic value of nature forms a barrier to a possible reconciliation between Shona and Christian attitudes <b>to</b> <b>nature.</b> This is largely {{based on the belief that}} some aspects of nature in Shona are imbued with spirits. Although sacred aspects may be accidentally protected, there is a weakness in the discriminative attitudes that leaves other aspects vulnerable. It appears the Shona have yet to extricate themselves from an ethic based on fear of ancestral spirits to conscious assessment of scientific causes of ecological imbalances. Shona attitudes <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> fail <b>to</b> take account of the denial of the sacredness of some aspects of nature. The Christian attitudes <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> on the other hand, propound the doctrine of the equal worth and equal integrity of all aspects of nature, rather than a discriminative sacredness of nature. The attitudes are, however, based on the assumption that nature is purely material. This position results into divergent attitudes <b>to</b> <b>nature.</b> Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> presented from a Christian perspective appear reluctant to identify divinity with natural phenomena. Christianity suggests the idea of creation value to bridge this gap. To this end, the creation value to which Christian attitudes tend to lend support, might well act as common denominator between Shona and Christian attitudes <b>to</b> <b>nature</b> particularly in the light of eco-spirituality and move towards African-Christian environmental ethics...|$|R
