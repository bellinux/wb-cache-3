Three design parameters, i. e., carbon content (wt %), forming temperature, and sintering schedule were investigated. Iron powder ASC 100. 29 was mechanically mixed with different wt % of carbon and copper powder for 30 minutes to prepare the feedstock. Green compacts were then formed through uni-axial die compaction process at 30 °C and 180 ºC. The defect-free green compacts were then sintered at 1000 ºC in an argon gas fired furnace at a heating/cooling rate of 5 ºC/minute for 30, 60, and 90 minutes, respectively. The green samples as well the sintered products were characterized through relative density measurement, radial shrinkage, and microstructure evaluation.

40|$|Metal alloys can be {{successfully}} thixoformed in the partially liquid state if they display non-dendritic nearglobular microstructures. The article presents {{the development of}} feedstock with such non-dendritic microstructure produced through the solid-state route of strain-induced melt-activated (SIMA) method, for a Stellite 21 alloy. Stellite alloys are a range of cobalt-chromium alloys designed for wear and corrosion resistance, currently shaped by casting, powder metallurgy or forging processes, but semisolid-state processing offers {{the possibility of a}} <b>near-net-shaping</b> method for these alloys. In this work, sprayformed followed by extrusion samples were heated to the temperature range at which the liquid and solid phases coexist in the material and spheroidal shape solid particles in a liquid matrix were obtained as required for semisolid processing. Microstructural investigations were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), with a further objective of analyzing the rheological properties of Stellite 21 alloy in the semisolid state, providing results to be used for identi- fication of a processing window of temperature and viscosity ranges for thixoforming this alloy...|$|R
5000|$|The {{process can}} be used for <b>near-net-shape</b> casting, {{including}} in protocols where the final casting has a cavity {{in the shape of the}} casting pattern - in that case, the metal is poured into the cavity, which has been arranged to lie in the middle of a quantity of [...] "filler" [...] corresponding to the reaction product, and wicks itself to fill the pores in the filler.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operational}} concept of EBF3 {{is to build}} a <b>near-net-shape</b> metal part directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) file. Current computer-aided machining practices start with a CAD model and use a post-processor to write the machining instructions (G-code) defining the cutting tool paths needed to make the part. EBF3 uses a similar process, starting with a CAD model, numerically slicing it into layers, then using a post-processor to write the G-code defining the deposition path and process parameters for the EBF3 equipment. It uses a focused electron beam in a vacuum environment to create a molten pool on a metallic substrate. The beam is translated with respect {{to the surface of the}} substrate while metal wire is fed into the molten pool. The deposit solidifies immediately after the electron beam has passed, having sufficient structural strength to support itself. The sequence is repeated in a layer-additive manner to produce a <b>near-net-shape</b> part needing only finish machining. The EBF3 process is scalable for components from fractions of an inch to tens of feet in size, limited mainly by the size of the vacuum chamber and amount of wire feedstock available.|$|E
50|$|TFP {{technology}} has been introduced in the early 1990s by the IPF Dresden. At the beginning handmade stitched reinforcement structures (preforms) were manufactured initialized by an industry inquiry about stress adapted fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) parts with a curvilinear pattern. An adaptation of this method to industrial embroidery machines, by using the sewing capabilities of those automates, was implemented in the mid-90s. The technology was named to Tailored Fiber Placement, which describes the variableaxial <b>near-net-shape</b> fibre placement capabilities. Nowadays, the Tailored Fiber Placement is already in a few companies a well-established textile technology for dry preform manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|Since {{conventional}} production of high-temperature materials involves high investments and costly consumption of both energy and time, reaction engineering methodology combined with near-net shaping {{is often the}} answer to {{problems associated with the}} fabrication of advanced materials. Over the last decades, the number of different reaction-based processing methods for near-net-shaped ceramics has gradually increased. In this review, different reactive processing techniques and their potential for <b>near-net-shaping</b> are treated, e. g. SHTS (self-supporting high temperature synthesis), the Lanxide method DIMEX, reaction bonding (RB), reactive processing of Alumina-Aluminide Alloys (3 A) and Al 2 O 3 -Al alloyed metal composites (3 AMC). In addition to their potential for near-net shaping, other advantages to reactive processing routes are recognized to be reduced processing temperatures, reduced glassy phase formation at the grain boundaries, fine grained microsturctures and improved mechanical strength. Since the exothermic reactions constitute the base for reactive processing of high quality materials in an economic way, control of these reactions is essential. The process flows are described together with characteristic features of process and materials. In addtion, specific aspects of reaction-based synthesis will be illustrated with examples from own work in the area of reaction bonding of silicon nitride and alumina...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} years, {{technological}} processes to manufacture parts, made by metal matrix composites (MMC) reinforced with alumina or carbide particles, {{have been using}} hot plastic deformation (like extrusion) to form them into <b>near-net-shapes,</b> aiming to decrease expensive secondary machining operations. In fact, as high percentage of reinforcement, characterized by high hardness and strength, brings a decreasing in machinability, making costs of products grow up, its strengthen allows to improve mechanical behaviour of composites. On the other hand, fundamental is a good physical-chemical link at matrix/reinforcement interface to obtain safe microstructure both {{at the end of}} the process productive cycles and during component underloading service. Concurrent presence of these two so different phases (in terms of deformation topics) is responsible for microstructure damaging (particle fracturing, matrix-particle interface debonding, clustering of reinforcement particles), and, therefore, cause for decreasing in mechanical properties. For this reason, a proper selection of process parameters has to be suggested to optimise the final component behaviour. In particular, regarding hot deformation technologies, in the present paper, the aluminum matrix composite Al 2124 / 26 % vol. SiCp has been characterized in terms of microstructure and fracture mechanics behaviour, both in form of as received sintered billet, and in form of part forged into a pump body for automotive applications...|$|R
40|$|The Automotive {{sector is}} {{undergoing}} transformation from conventional metallic materials to textiles manufactured using conventional 2 D processing techniques. It is envisaged that although still immature, composite applications into the sector will grow significantly {{over the next}} 5 to 10 years and enter more mass market vehicle applications. With the opportunity offered by 3 dimensional advanced flexible materials, the adoption process could be more attractive to Automotive and wider industrial sectors. Currently the benefits of 3 D woven preforms are being exploited in the aerospace sector by Safran ltd, with approximately 30 % weight reduction over metallic components for the leap fan blade. These reductions in weight due to superior performance are allowing {{the development of more}} efficient aerospace components and are leading the way for adoption into the automotive sector. With the need for high speed manufacturing of composite components, it is expected that weaving 3 D woven <b>near-net-shapes</b> could offer superior benefits to the automotive sector. Larger scale components have a particular attraction and when manufactured as a one piece woven structure (preform) will offer significant benefits {{to a wide range of}} composite applications. Manufacturing composite components is labour intensive with precise placement of multiple layers of pre-impregnated woven plies required. As the composite industries mature, further development of processes is anticipated, with high deposition rates and repeatability high on the priority list. Although many methods of processing from fibre to fabric structure exist, the ability to reduce layup times combined with rapid manufacturing using high speed looms, weaving multilayers at once is an attractive proposition and capable with conventional weaving machines. Traditionally 3 D weaving and 3 D woven structures have been classed as expensive and slow to process, severely limiting the adoption in to wider end uses and applications. This paper demonstrates how mass manufacturing capability is linked to woven 3 D structures and how output and costs in materials manufacture can be further optimised. Initial designs from CAD software were conducted and inputted into a standard weaving loom without Jacquard technology and then a 3 D one piece woven structure was obtained. The considerations of weave design, conformability, and permeability were discussed and large scale single- and various-weave one piece woven preform were designed, woven and resin-infused...|$|R
50|$|The first {{observation}} of cellular structures {{resulting from the}} freezing of water goes back over a century, but the first reported instance of freeze-casting, in the modern sense, was in 1954 when Maxwell et al. attempted to fabricate turbosupercharger blades out of refractory powders. They froze extremely thick slips of titanium carbide, producing <b>near-net-shape</b> castings that were easy to sinter and machine. The goal of this work, however, was to make dense ceramics. It was not until 2001, when Fukasawa et al. created directionally porous alumina castings, {{that the idea of}} using freeze-casting as a means of creating novel porous structures really took hold. Since that time, research has grown considerably with hundreds of papers coming out within the last decade.|$|E
50|$|NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) {{originated}} (EBF3) technology development. The {{additive manufacturing}} process was primarily developed and engineered by Karen Taminger, material research engineer for NASA LaRC. EBF3 is a NASA-patented additive manufacturing process designed to build <b>near-net-shape</b> parts requiring less raw material and finish machining than traditional manufacturing methods. EBF3 {{is a process}} by which NASA plans to build metal parts in zero-gravity environments; this layer-additive process uses an electron beam and a solid wire feedstock to fabricate metallic structures. The process efficiencies of the electron beam and the feedstock make the EBF3 process appropriate for in-space use. Since 2000, {{a team of researchers}} at the NASA LaRC have led the fundamental research and development of this technique for additive manufacturing for metallic aerospace structures. Additive manufacturing encompasses processes in which parts are built by successively adding material rather than by cutting or grinding it away as in conventional machining. Additive manufacturing is an outgrowth of rapid-prototyping techniques such as stereolithography, first developed for non-structural plastic parts over 30 years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Die forming {{typically}} occurs {{immediately after}} polymer melt has exited an [...] extruder. The most basic process involves guiding {{the stream of}} molten polymer under pressure through a die, which three distinct regions: manifold, approach, and lip. The 'manifold' serves to channel the polymer melt from its initial extrusion point to a <b>near-net-shape</b> of the final product. The 'approach' region further guides the melt into the final shape, and begins to correct for any non-uniform [...] flow. Finally, the 'lip' forms the melt into the final desired cross section and compensates for any remaining flow asymmetry. After exiting {{the lip of the}} die, the polymer melt will undergo die swell before curing. Die swell is an expansion of the melt as the pressure is released, and is dependent on polymer chemistry and die design. After curing, the solid, continuous part is drawn onto a take-up roller or cut into transportable lengths, {{depending on the type of}} part. This process may vary significantly depending on the type of die and extrusion process.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThermoplastic {{composites}} with {{a complex}} three-dimensional (3 D) shape are attractive construction materials {{because of their}} good specific mechanical properties and their possibility to be processed very rapidly.

40|$|The linear {{friction}} welding (LFW) process is finding increasing interest from industry for the fabrication of <b>near-net-shape,</b> titanium alloy Ti– 6 Al– 4 V, aerospace components.

To address this problem, two-dimensional (2 D) computational models were developed using the finite element analysis (FEA) software DEFORM and validated with experiments.

The precursors were then electro-deoxidized in molten calcium chloride [3. 2 V, 1173 K (900 C) ] against a graphite anode.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the use of HIPed aluminum castings as <b>near-net-shape</b> blanks for large electrostatic focusing electrodes in ion lithography machines. The electrodes must have very smooth finishes which are free of pores and other defects.

The use of a <b>near-net-shape</b> casting for the blank was expected to save a significant amount of money and time. The test was conducted on a single cast blank which was supplied by the Partner in the HIPed and stress relieved condition. Rough machining and diamond turning operations conducted by LMES/ER revealed that the casting contained unacceptably large defects. The conclusion was reached that HIPed aluminum castings in the large sizes and of the quality levels required would probably be unobtainable in a cost-effective manner.
