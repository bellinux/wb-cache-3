40|$|Knowledge of {{differences}} in voice and speech characteristics between novice and professional broadcasters is essential for effective education of broadcast journalism students. Because <b>newsreaders</b> rely on optimal voice production, information pertaining to vocal hygiene is also important. The first {{aim of this study}} was to compare the voice and speech characteristics of professional <b>newsreaders,</b> student <b>newsreaders</b> and control participants. The second aim was to compare the awareness and use of vocal hygiene across these groups. Professional radio <b>newsreaders,</b> broadcast journalism students and two matched control groups were included in the study. Each participant recorded a news bulletin and completed a questionnaire on vocal hygiene. Data analysis of the recording included objective analysis and perceptual ratings by a panel of three judges. Significant student-professional differences were found. Compared to both the students and the control groups, the professional <b>newsreaders</b> had greater variation in speaking fundamental frequency, a faster rate of speech, fewer pronunciation errors and higher perceptual ratings on vocal quality, emphasis, continuity, phrasing and style of newsreading. Female professional <b>newsreaders</b> had a higher speaking fundamental frequency than both their control participants and the student <b>newsreaders.</b> Comparison of vocal hygiene awareness revealed few significant differences between any of the groups...|$|R

25|$|Many Internet service providers, {{and many}} other Internet sites, operate news servers for their users to access. ISPs that do not operate their own servers {{directly}} will often offer their users an account from another provider that specifically operates newsfeeds. In early news implementations, the server and <b>newsreader</b> were a single program suite, running on the same system. Today, one uses separate <b>newsreader</b> client software, a program that resembles an email client but accesses Usenet servers instead. Some clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Outlook Express provide both abilities.|$|E

25|$|For the program's first 25 years, weather {{reports were}} {{delivered}} by the host or <b>newsreader.</b> Dave Garroway illustrated the day's forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept, and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map. When the show converted to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair's retirement on March 14, 1975, Lew Wood took over the <b>newsreader</b> and weather reporting duties. When Floyd Kalber was brought in as <b>newsreader</b> in 1976, Wood was relegated to weather, sports, roving reporter assignments, and presenting live on-air commercials until his departure in 1978.|$|E
