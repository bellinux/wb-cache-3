5|$|Berkman {{spent his}} last years eking out a {{precarious}} living {{as an editor}} and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who had {{changed his name to}} Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10o'clock that night.|$|E
25|$|Costas' {{decision}} to be positive rather than negative has been viewed by some in both political parties as a weakness, a lack of the killer instinct. Some have said that Costas is too <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a politician. Some have charged {{that it was a}} political mistake not to go after the mayor (Butterfield) on the Pratt deal when Costas had the chance. Maybe. We'll never know if Costas might have won if he had been a more typical political campaigner.|$|E

500|$|In 1892, Chekhov {{bought the}} small country estate of Melikhovo, about forty {{miles south of}} Moscow, where {{he lived with his}} family until 1899. [...] "It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a lord," [...] he joked to his friend Ivan Leontyev (who wrote humorous pieces under the {{pseudonym}} Shcheglov), but he took his responsibilities as a landlord seriously and soon made himself useful to the local peasants. As well as organising relief for victims of the famine and cholera outbreaks of 1892, he went on to build three schools, a fire station, and a clinic, and to donate his medical services to peasants for miles around, despite frequent recurrences of his tuberculosis.|$|E
500|$|Paramount {{secured the}} {{likeness}} rights of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto {{in the summer}} of 2011 for an upcoming game based on the universe of the film Star Trek (2009). It was not until a year later in June 2012 that the voice work contracts were signed for the pair, and it was also announced that the likeness rights and voice acting {{of the rest of the}} main cast from the film had been secured. Some cast members such as Pegg improvised parts of their performances. Quinto praised the positive experience in the recording studio, and said that [...] "it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to play the character and not have to do all this physical stuff".|$|E
500|$|Several film reviewers drew precise {{parallels}} between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, and The Avengers. Indeed, the producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles. Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being [...] "the most well-trod turf on the planet," [...] but noted {{that he had not}} been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compared to it, since [...] "if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good".|$|E

500|$|In the film, {{she plays}} Eli, a child vampire who {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} the main character, 12-year-old Oskar (played by Kåre Hedebrant). Oskar is frequently tormented by bullies. Eli initially tells Oskar to fight back, and rescues him in the end, killing three of the bullies in process. Because Eli {{is supposed to be}} an androgynous character in the film, director Tomas Alfredson decided to overdub Leandersson's voice with a less feminine one. [...] "Lina's voice is beautiful, but I thought it was too high in pitch", he said. Eli's voice throughout the whole film was provided by Elif Ceylan. In an interview with Dagens Nyheter, Leandersson laughingly commented that [...] "it was actually <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dubbed, my voice sounds weird".|$|E
500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, {{set in the}} Los Angeles underworld. The {{film was}} not well {{received}} by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie [...] "finds a certain warmth {{in a kind of}} role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] girlfriend, and maybe she is." [...] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as [...] "horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara" [...] who relies on [...] "gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips." [...] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's [...] "Anybody Seen My Baby?" [...] as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.|$|E

I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Guides Matt Mitovich {{observed}} that [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] was the [...] "best {{episode of the}} season" [...] as it [...] "kept all of the comedy rooted in the actual storylines". He wrote that the Tracy story was [...] "packed [...] plenty of amusement", and that the character's spending problem was [...] "funny for the sight gags alone". Mitovich commented that Hayek's character was [...] "one of Jack's best matches yet". Jeremy Median of Paste opined that [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] featured one of the [...] "funniest sight gags in 30 Rock history", referring to Tracy wearing a coat made out of money, shoes made of gold, and [...] "a Mad Hatter-like hat made out of money, as only Tracy could pull off." [...] He also wrote that it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reminded of Liz's [...] "baby-cravings, a story that's been bubbling on the surface {{for a while now}} but reemerged here." [...] Nathan Rabin for The A.V. Club noted that this episode [...] "juggled its various lovestruck plots with aplomb", and gave this episode an A−. Rabin liked all the plots, but most enjoyed Jenna's story of her trying to play Janis Joplin.|$|E

500|$|Hoping to {{continue}} the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell were considered for the role. In particular, Campbell, following his involvement with the sixth season episode [...] "Terms of Endearment", was considered, but, due to a contractual obligation, could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed {{him out of the}} role". In the end, the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. Reportedly, Patrick was cast {{due to the fact that}} his featured role in [...] (1991) would attract a great 18- to 35-year-old male demographic to the show. In fact, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able {{to do something like that}} that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E
500|$|On 26 January 2009, Rehman {{signed a}} loan deal with League Two club Bradford City, {{which was to}} last {{until the end of}} the 2008–09 season. Rehman had turned down a chance to move to Luton Town and team up with Mick Harford, who was {{previously}} the assistant manager at QPR, and said he was only prepared to drop down to League Two if he joined Bradford City. Rehman said of the move, [...] "I was only prepared to drop down the leagues to play for this club. I spoke to the manager and chairmen and I know they want to get Bradford back up to where they belong. I've been involved in relegation battles in the past and it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> joining a club pushing for promotion – that's a good pressure to have." [...] He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat to Bury at Gigg Lane, and in doing so became the first British Asian to play in all four divisions of professional football in England. He made his home debut on 31 January, playing at right back, in a 2–0 home win over Grimsby Town at Valley Parade. In March he turned down the chance to play for Pakistan in the Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup qualifiers in order to help Bradford's push for promotion.|$|E

500|$|Churchill's final {{departure}} from political office came some sixteen months later when, on 5 April 1955, he chaired his last cabinet, almost fifty {{years since he}} had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be Prime Minister, Churchill replied, [...] "It's always <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> home". For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing bezique or sitting [...] "by the fish pond, feeding the golden orfe and meditating". Of his last years at the house, Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, recalled, [...] "in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'wheelbarrow' chair contemplating {{the view of the}} valley he had loved for so long". On 13 October 1964, Churchill's last dinner guests at Chartwell were his former principal private secretary Sir Leslie Rowan and his wife. Lady Rowan later recalled, [...] "It was sad to see such a great man become so frail". The following week, increasingly incapacitated, Churchill left the house for the last time. His official biographer Martin Gilbert records Churchill was, [...] "never to see his beloved Chartwell again". After his death in January 1965, Lady Churchill immediately relinquished her lease and presented Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to the public in 1966, one year after Churchill's death.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept for}} using an {{underwater}} theme park as the game's setting {{came from a}} conversation Uchikoshi had with a friend, who mentioned it being <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Disneyland parks when it is raining, as very few people are there then, making it feel like the park is reserved to oneself. Uchikoshi agreed that empty theme parks are nice, and considered setting the game in an empty theme park on land, but moved it underwater after realizing that the characters could escape by climbing the fence and that some further obstacle was needed. This setting, described by Uchikoshi as [...] "you're trapped somewhere and trying to escape", was made to embody two of humanity's instinctive desires: the unconscious desire {{to return to the}} safety of one's mother's womb and shut oneself away from the world, and the desire to escape from and overcome one's current condition. German elements were used a lot in the game's setting, including German terminology. This was decided on for multiple reasons: the developers thought that English was [...] "too ordinary", and when they decided to use the pharmaceutical company Leiblich in the story, they also thought that Germany and Switzerland were known for pharmaceuticals. Additionally, Uchikoshi had visited Germany and was influenced by the 1999 animated film , and how the friend he had the theme park conversation with spoke German. Each of the game's heroines were assigned a related attraction in the park, where their [...] "impactful events" [...] would occur. The one exception was Coco, as [...] "her speech and conduct was already as delightful as an attraction".|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E
