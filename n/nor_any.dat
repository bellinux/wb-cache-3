5|$|Although his {{original}} objective was solely {{to protect the}} Serb population against the Ustaše, Dangić quickly became {{an important factor in}} the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia. The Germans sought to win Dangić over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti-Partisan operations in the region, where Dangić's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10,000 men, but at this time neither Dangić <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> of Mihailović's other commanders had any arrangement with the Germans.|$|E

5|$|Neither U-10 <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> of {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914.

As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E

5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> of their escorts were damaged; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E

5|$|Bristol notably {{does not}} award by title any bachelor's degrees in music, which is {{available}} for study but awarded B.A. (although it does award MMus and DMus), <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> degree in divinity, since divinity is not available for study (students of theology are awarded a B.A.). Similarly, the university does not award BLitt (Bachelor of Letters), although it does award both MLitt and DLitt. In regulations, the university does not name MD or DDS as higher doctorates, although they are in many universities as these degrees are normally accredited professional doctorates.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{a central}} asset to Finnish {{military}} forces during the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–1944), when {{tens of thousands}} of horses were the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles. Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful in preserving the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380000 animals as soon as 1945.|$|E

5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in {{relative}} poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor.

Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E

Neither he <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> guests on the ride were harmed following the ride cars being held at the boarding station. He was arrested for a public order offence, and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.|$|E

She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage. In 1816, {{on the advice of}} doctors, she and her family returned to Britain; in her autobiography Sherwood relates that she was continually ill in India and it was believed at the time that neither she <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> of her children could survive in a tropical climate.|$|E
