25|$|The World Englishes initiative, in {{recognizing}} and describing the New Englishes of the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, has been partly {{motivated by a}} consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by {{a consideration of the}} wider cultural and political contexts of language acquisition and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of pluralism and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, <b>new</b> <b>realities,</b> new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.|$|E
25|$|The {{program for}} {{restructuring}} and modernizing the coffee industry in Colombia has estimated {{an investment of}} two billion dollars.

The Colombian coffee institutions and the policy making entities are facing the <b>new</b> <b>realities</b> of globalization and monetary volatility and economic uncertainties. Technological advances are being made in electronic commerce, production engineering and quality control, {{in an effort to}} reduce production costs and increase productivity. The historical evidence demonstrates that the institutions, organizations and policy making instruments of the coffee industry in Colombia are very dynamic and shall continue to adapt to changing circumstances and perform with leadership, innovation and positive results.|$|E
25|$|His tenure, 1979 – 1988, as the Chairman of the Kenya Cultural Council {{witnessed}} prolific prominence {{and recognition}} of culture in Kenya. Until then, {{dating back to the}} colonial era, African culture in Kenya had not received the prominence it deserved. Moreover, he was instrumental in spearheading the enactment of a dynamic national cultural policy to make certain that pertinent changes and amendments in the law were being aptly undertaken in synergy with <b>new</b> <b>realities.</b> Among a plethora of his most effective initiatives in the antecedent capacity were the strengthening and enlargement of cultural activities across the country; and the increase in the council’s annual budgetary allocations. In all, his tenure witnessed a period of amplified holistic emphasis on culture in the country.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, a {{decision}} was passed to renew the Jezreel Valley railway, and plans were made to alter the historical route to conform to <b>new</b> <b>realities</b> {{on the ground in}} several points on the route. However, it was not until ten years later, in 1998, that a survey of the land was made to inspect its suitability for a modern railway line, which was also not immediately used. Several years later, major foreign investment began flowing into the country following the worldwide early 2000s recession, which prompted resuming discussions about renewing the valley railway, which has regional importance for transporting goods to and from parts of Israel and Jordan via rail links for export/import through Israeli seaports on the Mediterranean sea.|$|E

In 2010, Achebe was awarded The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize for $300,000, {{one of the richest}} prizes for the arts.|$|E

Allied commanders also faced a dilemma: whether to keep their exhausted divisions on the attack and run the risk of having insufficient manpower or replace them with fresh divisions and lose momentum.

500|$|John Pierce also {{regarded}} Dragon's Egg as {{hard science}} fiction at its best, while Forward's later novel Martian Rainbow (1991) was the genre at its worst. Both novels have cardboard human characters, {{but this does}} not matter in Dragon's Egg, where {{the focus is on the}} deeper personalities of the cheela characters. The novel even makes readers care about the fate of an unsympathetic cheela ruler, whose rejuvenation [...] treatment fails catastrophically. Pierce wrote that the best works of this genre create a literary experience, but one of an unusual kind. Instead of offering a metaphor for a reality the reader already recognizes, they create <b>new</b> <b>realities</b> in which the reader is caught up.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Lawrence {{was able}} to add greater {{historical}} depth {{to the study of}} cargo cults, and observed the striking continuity in the indigenous value systems from pre-cult times to the time of his study. Kenelm Burridge, in contrast, placed more emphasis on cultural change, and on the use of memories of myths to comprehend <b>new</b> <b>realities,</b> including the [...] "secret" [...] of European material possessions. His emphasis on cultural change follows from Worsley's argument on the effects of capitalism; Burridge points out these movements were more common in coastal areas which faced greater intrusions from European colonizers.|$|E

Data is used to help retailers spot trends and act accordingly.

[...] This information helps businesses adjust to <b>new</b> <b>realities.</b> Radio programmes such as [...] "Radio New Zealand National" [...] have quoted agency data.|$|E
2500|$|He was modern in another, more {{significant}} aspect; his contract banned him from cursing, punishing or denying charity funds from transgressors. He lacked any jurisdiction in civil affairs from the start. Ismar Schorsch noted that {{twenty years after}} the retirement of his predecessor Raphael Cohen, whose authority was undermined by complaints to the government {{on the part of}} nonobservant members, Bernays symbolized the transformation of the rabbinate. From an institution entrusted with judging, collecting taxes and enforcing Halakha upon all Jews, their concerns were transferred solely to the religious sphere, created when <b>new</b> <b>realities</b> engendered a secular, neutral one, unregulated by religious law, something which was foreign to traditional Jewish society. Even the title [...] "rabbi" [...] was denied to him by the community, and he was given the designation of [...] "Hacham", like his Sephardi equivalents. His contract also specifically forbade him from interfering in the matters of the Temple congregation, whose members paid both their own membership dues and taxes to the community. The two groups coexisted side by side.|$|E

As for the External form and forms of Life,--what can we say except {{that out of the}} Eater there comes Strength; out of the Unwise there comes not Wisdom! Shams are burnt up; nay, what as yet is the peculiarity of France, the very Cant of them is burnt up. The <b>new</b> <b>Realities</b> are not yet come: ah no, only Phantasms, Paper models, tentative Prefigurements of such! In France there are now Four Million Landed Properties; that black portent of an Agrarian Law is as it were realised! What is still stranger, we understand all Frenchmen have 'the right of duel;' the Hackney-coachman with the Peer, if insult be given: such is the law of Public Opinion. Equality at least in death!
