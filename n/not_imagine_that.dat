500|$|Caracciola {{first met}} Adolf Hitler, {{the leader of}} the Nazi Party, in 1931. Hitler had ordered a Mercedes-Benz 770, at that point Mercedes' most {{expensive}} car, but due to {{the amount of time spent}} upgrading the car in line with the Nazi leader's wishes, the delivery was late. To mollify Hitler's anger, Caracciola was dispatched by Mercedes to deliver the car to the Brown House in Munich. Caracciola drove Hitler and his niece Geli Raubal around Munich to demonstrate the car. He later wrote (after the fall of the Nazi Party) that he was not particularly awed by Hitler: [...] "I could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> this man would have the requirements for taking over the government someday." ...|$|E
500|$|Rosas's {{authority}} and influence spread {{far beyond the}} House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy {{as well as his}} cabinet, stating: [...] "Do <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> my Ministers are anything but my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." [...] His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. Rosismo was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: [...] "I tell you I am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party." [...] During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the Rosismo movement.|$|E
2500|$|The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael cited four {{reasons for}} why [...] "Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore," [...] as {{reported}} in [...] (1) so that the Israelites should <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the Egyptians escaped the sea on the other side, (2) so that the Egyptians should <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the Israelites {{were lost in the}} sea as the Egyptians had been, (3) so that the Israelites might take the Egyptians' spoils of silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls, and (4) so that the Israelites might recognize the Egyptians and reprove them.|$|E
60|$|Littleson was {{a little}} surprised. He had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> Phineas Duge would ever again {{remember}} his niece's existence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since I have intruded so unwittingly, I had best {{remain to}} make my apologies," [...] he said. [...] "I {{was on my way}} to your {{residential}} quarters, O'Moy, <b>not</b> <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> I should break in upon your privacy in this fashion." ...|$|R
60|$|Charnock {{tried to}} brace {{himself as he}} went away. So far, he had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> Festing might die. He had got a shock, but must not let it {{overwhelm}} him. Thinking hard, he walked to Norton's shack to get some food. He was worn out and felt some pain.|$|R
2500|$|Descartes, {{among other}} philosophers, {{marveled at the}} {{phenomenon}} of {{what we now know}} as metacognition. [...] "It was not so much thinking that was indisputable to Descartes, but rather thinking about thinking. He could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the person engaged in such self-reflective processing did not exist". In the late 19th century, Bowne and James contemplated, but did not scientifically examine, the relationship between memory judgments and memory performance.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{problem was}} that he claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI {{would never be able}} to capture the human ability to {{understand}} context, situation or purpose in the form of rules. But (as Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell would later explain), an argument of this form can not be won: just because one can not imagine formal rules that govern human intelligence and expertise, this does not mean that no such rules exist. They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus':"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1942, at {{the height}} of Antonescu's {{alliance}} with Nazi Germany, Gomoiu's friend Barbu Lăzăreanu was arrested with other Jews and scheduled to be deported to Transnistria Governorate, but was spared thanks to Gomoiu's appeal to Queen Helen, who intervened on Lăzăreanu's behalf. As a Swiss journalist reported at the time, Gomoiu, [...] "a man so nice that he could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the Jews are so persecuted", personally visited the Jewish detainees and convinced himself of their mistreatment, before contacting the queen. The latter insisted that she would leave the country, and endanger Antonescu's legitimacy, if the deportations would continue.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{was greatly}} {{surprised}} over the news which Peleg Snuggers conveyed to him. He knew that Jasper Grinder was an intensely passionate man when aroused, {{as on the}} occasion of the attempted caning, but he had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the man would fall into a fit while in such a condition.|$|R
60|$|This disconcerted Clarke. He had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> his object {{would be}} known, {{and he had}} counted upon Challoner's being {{surprised}} and thrown off his guard. It {{looked as if the}} Colonel had been making inquiries about Blake. Clarke wished that he could guess his reason, for it might affect the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never;--but {{that is not}} {{the point}} here. I am not acting on Jane Gardner's report. I should never trouble myself to be jealous of such a scoundrel as Mark. I am <b>not</b> <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> there is any fear of her {{accepting}} him. Though, if such a notion once possessed her, nothing would hinder her from rushing on inevitable misery.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Arab warfare {{against the}} Jews in Palestine ... {{had always been}} marked by {{indiscriminate}} killing, mutilating, raping, looting and pillaging. This 1947–48 attack on the Jewish community was more savage than ever. Until the Arab armies invaded Israel {{on the very day}} of its birth, May 15, 1948, no quarter whatsoever had ever been given to a Jew who fell into Arab hands. Wounded and dead alike were mutilated. Every member of the Jewish community was regarded as an enemy to be mercilessly destroyed....he Arab population of Palestine anticipated nothing less than massacres in retaliation if the Jews were victorious. Measuring the Jewish reaction by their own standards, they simply could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the Jews would not reply in kind what they had suffered at Arab hands. And this fear {{played a significant role in}} the Arab flight.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell {{joined the}} staff of Tribune as {{literary}} editor, and from then until his death, was a left-wing (though hardly orthodox) Labour-supporting democratic socialist. On 1 September 1944, about the Warsaw uprising, Orwell expressed in Tribune his hostility against {{the influence of the}} alliance with the USSR over the allies: [...] "Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for. Do <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of the sovietic regime, or any other regime, and then suddenly return to honesty and reason. Once a whore, always a whore." [...] According to Newsinger, although Orwell [...] "was always critical of the 1945–51 Labour government's moderation, his support for it began to pull him to the right politically. This did not lead him to embrace conservatism, imperialism or reaction, but to defend, albeit critically, Labour reformism." [...] Between 1945 and 1947, with A. J. Ayer and Bertrand Russell, he contributed a series of articles and essays to Polemic, a short-lived British [...] "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" [...] edited by the ex-Communist Humphrey Slater.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of this, my dear uncle! Do <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> I am growing faint-hearted; do <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> I am drawing {{back from}} the task which I now claim as my right. Death, or some other sort of punishment, shall surely fall upon her; she shall not escape! Only think what is best.|$|E
60|$|This disconcerted Clarke, who had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> his object {{would be}} known and had counted upon Challoner's being {{surprised}} when he heard it and thrown off his guard. It, however, {{looked as if the}} Colonel had been making inquiries about Blake, and Clarke wished he could guess his reason, because it might affect the situation.|$|R
60|$|Where {{the letter}} was I could <b>not</b> <b>imagine,</b> {{excepting}} <b>that</b> it {{might be in the}} cabin or the captain's stateroom.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, I shall <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> will be disagreeable to you,' she said; and {{she looked}} just as good-humored as possible." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he went up}} he did <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> Hank Griswold was {{watching}} him.|$|E
60|$|He did <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{any human}} beings were within {{sound of his}} voice.|$|E
60|$|She did <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{she had it}} in her to have hated any one so much.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I were a poet,' said Tancred, bending before her, 'I {{would attempt}} to express my {{gratitude}} to the Lady of Bethany. I hope,' he added, after a moment's pause, 'that Baroni laid my message at your feet. When I begged your permission to thank you in person to-morrow, I had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> I should have been so wilful as to quit the tent tonight.' ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{the matter}} of the models. Kirk had {{supposed}} that {{it was only in the}} comic papers that the artist's wife objected to his employing models. He had classed it with the mother-in-law joke, respecting it for its antiquity, but <b>not</b> <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> it ever really happened. And Ruth had brought this absurd situation into the sphere of practical politics only a few days ago.|$|R
60|$|Again the {{surprised}} expression {{crossed his}} face. He had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> {{a woman would}} dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home {{in this sort of}} discourse. I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.|$|R
60|$|Papa need <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> I {{have a bad}} cold or am stone-blind {{from this}} description, which is the whole truth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I should <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> George {{had often}} driven my father out,' said Aubrey, again looking lazily up from {{balancing}} his spoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "After that {{confession}} from Mr. Bundercombe before witnesses," [...] he said, [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{our case}} will require very much more proof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I cannot say, sir. I {{had gone}} into Erfurt soon after five, and had already picked up {{a good deal of}} news, from the talk of a party of French non-commissioned {{officers}} who were taking breakfast at a small inn; and who, <b>not</b> <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> I could understand them, talked very freely over affairs. They sat over their meal some time, and I did not go out until they had left.|$|R
60|$|Montesinos.--That {{would of}} course be {{according}} to the circumstances on both sides. But I entreat you <b>not</b> to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> I am any way desirous of enduring the experiment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he admitted, [...] "that it {{was rather}} a clumsy joke. I apologize, Mrs. Fitzgerald. I hope you did <b>not</b> really <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> it had been stolen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, Yoomy," [...] said Babbalanja, [...] "are you not in fault? Because I {{sometimes}} speak wisely, {{you must}} <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> I should always act so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you said}} before, Captain Pennington. But do <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{the taking of}} Port Arthur will be easy. The Russians have {{fortified}} it in every possible manner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he did so, {{one would}} <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be}} {{satisfied}} with blotting-paper," [...] Don Sebastian agreed. [...] "You said there was some coffee on the table." ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{the work}} should be a jolt for many Africa-watchers — {{offering}} a portrait of post-apartheid Mandela-land as anything but {{the best of all}} possible worlds — its key issues resonate far from that continent. Like Americans during the Clinton scandals, for instance, Mrs. Ubu (Busi Zokufa) fixates on accusations of sexual excess, <b>not</b> <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> her lord and master might be committing bigger crimes; when she learns the truth, she immediately turns those crimes into media gold.|$|R
60|$|They {{set out in}} the darkness, {{and reached}} the cabin half an hour later. They found that the settler was away, to join the army; but his wife and daughters were home, and they speedily did all they could for our friends, giving them a hot supper, and {{dressing}} the wounds as skilfully as trained nurses. They had heard of the fall of the Alamo, but had <b>not</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> all of the garrison were slaughtered.|$|R
60|$|When Cicely accidentally met Ralph in the garden, a {{few hours}} later, {{she said to him}} that she could <b>not</b> have <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> Miss Panney was such a dear old lady.|$|R
