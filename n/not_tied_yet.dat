5000|$|In the Age of Enlightenment the {{adjective}} volkstümlich usually meant the cultural achievements of uneducated Germans {{as well as}} popular culture. The [...] "Volksdichtung" [...] (People's Poetry) was 'high' literature, the culture of distinction, and partly devalued the elite education and partly idealised it. The concept was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>tied</b> to a certain nation, and attributed some of its characteristics to non-German culture.|$|R

He {{did not know where}} the train was, only that it was near. The woods throbbed with a savage din; the big cars, loaded with rattling gravel, clanged and roared as they plunged down grade.|$|R
40|$|A {{developmental}} {{paradox is}} discussed: studies of infant processing {{of language and}} language-like stimuli indicate considerable ability to abstract patterns over specific items and to distinguish natural from unnatural English sentences. In contrast, studies of toddler language production find little ability to generalize patterns over specific English words or constructions. Thus, infants appear to be abstract auditory or language processors whereas toddlers appear to be non-abstract, item-specific language users. Three resolutions are offered to this paradox. The first, that no resolution is necessary because only the toddler findings come from language use in a communicative context and so only the toddler findings are relevant to linguistic knowledge, is rejected. The second, that the contra-dictions {{are rooted in the}} differing methodologies of the two sets of studies (comprehension vs. production), is found to explain important aspects of the contradictory findings. The third, that the contractions come from the differing content of the stimuli in the studies, is also found to be explanatory and is argued to carry greater weight. Resolution 3 suggests that the patterns that infants extract from their linguistic input are <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>tied</b> to meaning; thus, toddlers do not lose these earlier-abstracted forms but their use of them is limited until they have been integrated with meaning. It is argued that in language acquisition, learning form is easy but learning meaning, and especiall...|$|R
