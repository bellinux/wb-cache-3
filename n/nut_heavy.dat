6000|$|A {{story goes}} that {{once in the}} {{twilight}} undergrowth of a forest of nut-bearing trees a number of little purblind creatures wandered, singing for nuts. On some of these purblind creatures the <b>nuts</b> fell <b>heavy</b> and full, extremely indigestible, and were quickly swallowed; on others they fell light, and contained nothing, because the kernel had already been eaten up above, and these light and kernel-less nuts were accompanied by sibilations or laughter. On others again no nuts at all, empty or full, came down. But nuts or no nuts, full nuts or empty nuts, the purblind creatures below went on wandering and singing. A traveller one day stopped one of these creatures whose voice was peculiarly disagreeable, and asked [...] "Why do you sing like this? Is it for pleasure that you do it, or for pain? What do {{you get out of}} it? Is it for the sake of those up there? Is it for your own sake--for the sake of your family--for whose sake? Do you think your songs worth listening to? Answer!" ...|$|R

50|$|The acorns are {{the largest}} of any North American oak (thus the Latin species name macrocarpa—large fruit), and are an {{important}} wildlife food; American black bears sometimes tear off branches to get them. However, <b>heavy</b> <b>nut</b> crops are borne only every few years. In this evolutionary strategy, known as masting, the large seed crop every few years overwhelms the ability of seed predators to eat the acorns, thus ensuring the survival of some seeds. Other wildlife, such as deer and porcupine, eat the leaves, twigs and bark. Cattle are heavy browsers in some areas. The bur oak is the only known foodplant of Bucculatrix recognita caterpillars.|$|R

And those were derived from KOH/char ratio of 4 with activation time from 20 to 150 minutes exhibited high BET surface area from 682 to 1026 m 2. g- 1.

40|$|The rate {{at which}} fallen hickory nuts are removed from beneath the parent tree, and the effect on this rate of the seed {{predator}} Conotrachelus affinis, was studied in an oak-hickory forest in southeastern Michigan, USA, during {{a year in which}} few nuts were produced. The trees responded to Conotrachelus, which destroyed half the nut crop, by aborting inviable nuts during the summer. The seed dispersers, mostly gray squirrels, removed fallen nuts rapidly, showing the ability to distinguish viable nuts and remove them preferentially. The number of nuts removed in a week varies directly with the number available, and removal rate increases when many viable nuts are falling. The death of most seeds before dispersal, and the squirrels' efficiency at foraging on nuts and recovering them after burial, imply that successful hickory reproduction takes place only in years of <b>heavy</b> <b>nut</b> production. ...|$|R

40|$|Hazel (Corylus avellana) {{has been}} a key species in European {{woodlands}} throughout the Holocene (10 KYA?present). Like many tree species, it is increasingly under threat from climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species and emergent pathogens. As knowledge of the genetic structure of natural populations of trees is vital for managing these threats, {{as well as an}} essential basis for selection of material for replanting and restocking, we analysed levels and patterns of genetic diversity in the species at a range of spatial scales using high-resolution microsatellite markers. Our findings indicate that hazel populations exhibit high levels of genetic diversity along with low levels of population differentiation, suggesting extensive gene flow. Fine-scale genetic structuring was observed in some of the woodlands studied, probably resulting from restricted dispersal of the <b>heavy</b> <b>nuts</b> produced by the species. This, coupled with higher levels of pollen-mediated gene flow, resulted in a weak but significant pattern of isolation by distance.

40|$|<b>Nuts</b> are <b>heavy</b> and nutritious {{seeds that}} need animals to be {{successfully}} dispersed. Most studies address nut removal {{by a single}} animal species once seeds fall onto the ground. However, nuts are also accessible before the seed drop and usually to a wide guild of seed foragers. This study examines the factorscontrollingarborealseedremoval in oak–beechforests within the whole guild of nut foragers. We found that seed-dispersing rodents (Apodemus sylvaticus) were the main acorn removers in the oaks (up to 3. 75 m height), with a rapid seed encounter and a high removal rate. However, rodents did not climb the beech trees, probably due to their smoother bark in comparison to oak bark and/or the lower nutritional value of beechnuts with regard to acorns. Jays (Garrulus glandarius) were more abundant in oak stands (both dense and scattered) and clearly preferred acorns to beechnuts whereas nuthatches (Sitta europaea) were more abundant in beech stands and preferred beechnuts to acorns. Non-storing birds such as great tits (Parus major) also removed acorns and beechnuts, especially in the stands where oaks are dominant. Jays and rodents preferred sound seeds over insect-infested seeds but such a preference was not found for nuthatches. This study highlights that pure beech stands showed a reduced guild of arboreal nut foragers in comparison to oak stands. This different guild could probably affect the spatial patterns of seed dispersal, with a proportionally higher number of long dispersal events for acorns (mostly jay-dispersed) than for beechnuts (mostly nuthatch-dispersed). Long-distance dispersal of beechnuts (by jays) {{is determined by the}} presence of other preferred species (oaks) and their frequency of non-mast years. Seed location in different habitats strongly determines the contribution of different arboreal removers (including climbing rodents) and their removal speed, leading to a differential seed fate that will eventually affect tree regeneration. As nuthatches are sedentary birds, it is important to maintain old and dead trees where they can breed (crevices), forage (arthropods) and store seeds in order to favor beechnut dispersal and gene flow. By maintaining or favoring oak trees within beech stands we will ensure a wider guild of arboreal nut dispersers...|$|R
60|$|For {{the most}} part, however, {{additions}} to the flora, and still more to the fauna, were very gradually made; {{so much so that}} most of the species now found in the group did not arrive there till {{after the end of the}} Glacial epoch, and belong essentially to the modern European assemblage of plants and animals. This was partly because the islands themselves were surrounded by pack-ice during that chilly period, which interrupted for a time the course of my experiment. It was interesting, too, after the ice cleared away, to note what kinds could manage by stray accidents to cross the ocean with a fair chance of sprouting or hatching out on the new soil, and which were totally unable by original constitution to survive the ordeal of immersion in the sea. For instance, I looked anxiously at first for the arrival of some casual acorn or some floating filbert, which might stock my islands with waving greenery of oaks and hazel bushes. But I gradually discovered, in the course of a few centuries, that these <b>heavy</b> <b>nuts</b> never floated securely so far as the outskirts of my little archipelago; and that consequently no chestnuts, apple trees, beeches, alders, larches, or pines ever came to diversify my island valleys. The seeds that did really reach us from time to time belonged rather to one or other of four special classes. Either they were very small and light, like the spores of ferns, fungi, and club-mosses; or they were winged and feathery, like dandelion and thistle-down; or they were the stones of fruits that are eaten by birds, like rose-hips and hawthorn; or they were chaffy grains, enclosed in papery scales, like grasses and sedges, of a kind well adapted to be readily borne on the surface of the water. In all these ways new plants did really get wafted by slow degrees to the islands; and if they were of kinds adapted to the climate they grew and flourished, living down the first growth of ferns and flowerless herbs in the rich valleys.|$|R
