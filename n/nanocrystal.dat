50|$|The {{blinking}} in nanocrystals {{was first}} reported in 1996. The discovery was unexpected. The {{consensus is that}} blinking happens because illuminated nanocrystals can be charged (or ionized), and then neutralized. Under normal conditions when <b>nanocrystal</b> is neutral, a photon excites an electron-hole pair, which then recombines, emitting another photon and leading to photoluminescence. This process is called radiative recombination. If however, the <b>nanocrystal</b> is charged, the extra carrier triggers a process called non-radiative Auger recombination, where exciton energy is transferred to an extra electron or hole. Auger recombination occurs orders of magnitude faster than the radiative recombination. So photoluminescence is almost entirely suppressed in charged nanocrystals. Scientists still do not fully understand {{the origin of the}} charging and neutralization process. One of the photoexcited carriers (the electron or the hole) must be ejected from the <b>nanocrystal.</b> At some later time, the ejected charge returns to the <b>nanocrystal</b> (restoring charge neutrality and therefore radiative recombination). The details of how these processes occur still are not understood.|$|E

We describe herein a chemical functionalization procedure to passivate surface states on GaAs <b>nanocrystals.</b> Cl-terminated GaAs <b>nanocrystals</b> have been produced by anisotropic etching of oxide-covered GaAs <b>nanocrystals</b> with 6 M HCl(aq). The Cl-terminated GaAs <b>nanocrystals</b> were then functionalized by reaction with hydrazine or sodium hydrosulfide. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements revealed that the surfaces of the Cl-, hydrazine-, and sulfide-treated <b>nanocrystals</b> were As-rich, due to significant amounts of As^ 0.
