2500|$|The {{stabilizer}} of a dessin is the {{subgroup of}} Γ consisting of group elements that leave the dessin unchanged. Due to the Galois correspondence between subgroups of Γ and algebraic number fields, the stabilizer {{corresponds to a}} field, the field of moduli of the dessin. An orbit of a dessin is the set of all other dessins into which it may be transformed; due to the degree invariant, orbits are necessarily finite and stabilizers are of finite index. One may similarly define the stabilizer of an orbit (the subgroup that fixes all elements of the orbit) and the corresponding field of moduli of the orbit, another invariant of the dessin. The stabilizer of the orbit is the maximal normal subgroup of Γ contained in the stabilizer of the dessin, and the field of moduli of the orbit corresponds to the smallest <b>normal</b> <b>extension</b> of Q that contains the field of moduli of the dessin. For instance, for the two conjugate dessins considered in this section, the field of moduli of the orbit is Q (...) [...] The two Belyi functions f1 and f2 of this example are defined over the field of moduli, but there exist dessins for which the field of definition of the Belyi function must be larger than the field of moduli.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{algebraic}} {{proof of}} the fundamental theorem can be given using Galois theory. It suffices to show that C has no proper finite field extension. Let K/C be a finite extension. Since the normal closure of K over R still has a finite degree over C (or R), we may assume {{without loss of generality}} that K is a <b>normal</b> <b>extension</b> of R (hence it is a Galois extension, as every algebraic extension of a field of characteristic 0 is separable). Let G be the Galois group of this extension, and let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, so that the order of H is a power of 2, and the index of H in G is odd. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there exists a subextension L of K/R such that Gal(K/L)=H. As = is odd, and there are no nonlinear irreducible real polynomials of odd degree, we must have L= R, thus [...] and [...] are powers of 2. Assuming by way of contradiction that >1, we conclude that the 2-group Gal(K/C) contains a subgroup of index 2, so there exists a subextension M of C of degree2. However, C has no extension of degree2, because every quadratic complex polynomial has a complex root, as mentioned above. [...] This shows that [...] = 1, and therefore K = C, which completes the proof.|$|E
