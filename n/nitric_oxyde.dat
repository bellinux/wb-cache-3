40|$|Background: Chronic pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} disease symptoms and represents a global health problem with a considerable economic burding, affecting an estimated 20 % to 30 % of adults worldwide. The affectiveness of pharmacological treatments for chronic pain is often limited, and there is growing concern about the adverse effets of these treatment, including opioid dependance. Non pharmacological approach to chronic pain may be an attractive alternative or adjunctive treatment. With this study, we describe the effectiveness of a multi-combined nutraceutical treatment on chronic pain syndrome as chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia like symptomes. Objective: To assess the analgesic effect of a multi-nutraceutical supplement of palmitoylethanolamide, ß - caryophyillene, carnosic acid and Commiphora Myrrha in terms of clinical outcome with improvement of evaluation scales, reduction of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxyde</b> levels, oxidative stress parameters (AOPP) and increase of the production of endogenous antioxidants (protein thiol groups and FRAP). Selection Criteria: Randomised, double blind, active or alternative dietary supplement controlled trials investigating the use of the multiple dietary supplement (for at least six weeks' duration), for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain or myalgia, with at least 10 participants per treatment group. Participants were adults aged 35 and over, Methods: Twenty patients with diagnosis of chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia-like symptomes were first of all characterized by sex, age, lifestyle, comorbilities and concomitants therapies. The selected patients were evaluated with neurological examination, clinimetric evaluations scales focused on fatigue, pain and quality of life, CPK serum levels, electomiography (EMG) and electroneurography (ENG). Then, we measured the production of lactate, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxyde</b> and oxidative stress parameters during an aerobic multistage exercise tests performed on a bycicle ergometer, since the achievement of the 70 % of the maximum theorical treshold calculated by sex, age and weight. Finally, after a six-week long add-on nutraceutical therapy, patients repeated the tests and clinical evaluations.

40|$|The {{calcium ion}} {{dependence}} of soluble and particulate <b>nitric</b> <b>oxyde</b> synthase (NOS) activity fromViviparus ater immunocytes was investigated. At a calcium ion concentration of 2 nM, the NOS activitymeasured by citrulline formation was 27. 1 ± 2. 2 and 9. 3 ± 0. 8 pmol/min/ 106 cell for soluble andparticulate NOS, respectively. The increase in free calcium ion concentration to 300 nM increasesenzyme activity to 57. 5 ± 4. 1 and 23. 5 ± 1. 2 pmol/min/ 106 cell, respectively. The 50 % activation of thecalcium-dependent activity is 91 and 97 nM Ca 2 + for soluble and particulate enzymes. Trifluoperazine,an inhibitor of the calmodulin-dependent enzyme, partially inhibits both activities. Soluble NOS is fivetimes {{more sensitive than}} particulate NOS. The behaviour of both activities with three NOS inhibitors(7 -nitroindazole, S-methylisothiourea sulphate, diphenyleneiodonium) is very similar, with IC 50 valuesthat are not significantly different. The calcium ion dependence of NOS activities, {{in a range of}} freecalcium ion variations, which are transiently observed in receptor-stimulated cells, suggests that nitricoxyde in V. ater immunocytes not only has a defensive role but also signalling relevance in crosstalkingbetween immunocytes and other cells...|$|E
40|$|Two soluble {{forms of}} {{vascular}} endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, sVEGFR- 1 and sVEGFR- 2, are physiologically released and overproduced in some pathologies. They {{are known to}} act as anti-VEGF agents. Here, we report that these soluble receptors contribute to vessel maturation by mediating a dialogue between endothelial cells (EC) and mural cells that leads to blood vessel stabilization. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we provide evidences that these soluble VEGF receptors promote mural cell migration through a paracrine mechanism involving interplay in EC between VEGF/VEGFR- 2 and sphingosine- 1 - phosphate type- 1 (S 1 P) /S 1 P 1 pathways that leads to endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxyde</b> synthase (eNOS) activation. This new paradigm {{is supported by the}} finding that sVEGFR- 1 and - 2 : 1) induce an eNOS-dependent outgrowth of a mural cell network in an ex vivo model of angiogenesis, 2) increase the mural cell coverage of neovessels in vitro and in vivo, 3) promote mural cell migration towards EC, 4) stimulate endothelial S 1 P 1 overproduction and eNOS activation that promote the migration and the recruitment of neighboring mural cells. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms regulating physiological and pathological angiogenesis and vessel stabilization. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} {{is common}} in patients with diabetes mellitus. Vascular, neurological and hormonal alterations {{are involved in this}} complication. Many studies showed altered endothelium-dependent and neurogenic relaxations in corpus cavernosum from diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). This finding has been associated with a lack of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxyde</b> (NO) production and a significant increase in NO synthase (NOS) binding sites in penile tissues, induced by diabetes. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) concur to diabetic vascular complications by quenching NO activity and by increasing the expression of mediators of vascular damage such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), possessing permeabilizing and neoangiogenic effects, and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), with vaso-constricting and mitogenic action. Moreover, the differential gene expression for various growth factors in penile tissues may be involved in the pathophysiology of ED associated with diabetes. Neuropathy is also likely to be an important cause of diabetic ED: morphological alterations of autonomic nerve fibers in cavernosal tissue of patients with diabetic ED have been demonstrated. Finally, androgens enhance nNOS gene expression in the penile corpus cavernosum of rats, suggesting that they play a role in maintaining NOS activity. However, sexual dysfunctions in women with diabetes has received less attention in clinical research. Several studies suggest an increased prevalence of deficient vaginal lubrication, making sexual intercourse unpleasant. Sexual dysfunction is associated with lower overall quality of marital relation and more depressive symptoms in diabetic women...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Lemon pepper fruits (Zanthoxylum acanthopodium DC.; Rutaceae) {{have been}} used as a {{traditional}} source against stomach ache by Batak people in North Sumatera province, Indonesia. However, its scientific evidence for treatment of inflammatory disorders particularly gastritis has not been reported. Approach: Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of Lemon Pepper Fruit Extract (LPFE) against inflammatory biomarkers by conducting cell culture experiments in vitro. The fruits of lemon pepper were dried and extracted twice in 70 % ethanol, followed by evaporation and freeze-drying. The concentrated extract was further tested for its potential inhibition on the protein and gene expression of several inflammatory biomarkers, i. e., Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -&# 945;, Interleukin (IL) - 6, inducible <b>Nitric</b> <b>Oxyde</b> Synthase (iNOS), Cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 and Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced macrophages by performing Western blot, gelatin zymography and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Results: LPFE (1 - 10 &# 956;g mL - 1) and LPS (2 &# 956;g mL - 1) had no cytotoxicity effects on macrophages. LPFE dose dependently decreased the expression of TNF-&# 945; and COX- 2 proteins and MMP- 9 activity in macrophages treated with LPS. At the gene level, LPFE were effectively found to block the mRNA expression of TNF-&# 945;, IL- 6, iNOS, COX- 2 and MMP- 9. Conclusion: Our results suggest that LPFE significantly inhibits selected inflammatory biomarkers at the protein and gene levels in LPS-induced macrophages. Further in vivo study using animal models is needed to determine the exact anti-inflammatory potential of LPFE...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntroduction Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) {{has been}} shown to improve {{survival}} in rodent models of lethal hemorrhage. Conversely, other authors have reported that inhibition of endogenous H 2 S production improves hemodynamics and reduces organ injury after hemorrhagic shock. Since all of these data originate from unresuscitated models and/or the use of a pre-treatment design, we therefore tested the hypothesis that the H 2 S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), may improve hemodynamics in resuscitated hemorrhagic shock and attenuate oxidative and nitrosative stresses. Methods Thirty-two rats were mechanically ventilated and instrumented to measure mean arterial pressure (MAP) and carotid blood flow (CBF). Animals were bled during 60 minutes in order to maintain MAP at 40 ± 2 mm Hg. Ten minutes prior to retransfusion of shed blood, rats randomly received either an intravenous bolus of NaHS (0. 2 mg/kg) or vehicle (0. 9 % NaCl). At the end of the experiment (T = 300 minutes), blood, aorta and heart were harvested for Western blot (inductible <b>Nitric</b> <b>Oxyde</b> Synthase (iNOS), Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), phosphorylated Inhibitor κB (P-IκB), Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule (I-CAM), Heme oxygenase 1 (HO- 1), Heme oxygenase 2 (HO- 2), as well as nuclear respiratory factor 2 (Nrf 2)). Nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O 2 -) were also measured by electron paramagnetic resonance.

40|$|Diabetes is {{associated}} with accelerated atherosclerosis and macrovascular complications are {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality in this disease. Although our understanding of vascular pathology has lately greatly improved, the mechanism(s) underlying enhanced atherosclerosis in diabetes remain unclear. Endothelial cell dysfunction is emerging as a key component in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular abnormalities associated with diabetes. Although it has been established that endothelium plays a critical role in overall homeostasis of the vessels, vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) in the arterial intima have a relevant part in the development of atherosclerosis in diabetes. However, high glucose induced alterations in vSMC behaviour are not fully characterized. Several studies have reported that impaired nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and/or actions are often present in diabetes and endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, although endothelial cells are by far the main site of vascular NO synthesis, vSMC do express <b>nitric</b> <b>oxyde</b> synthases (NOSs) and NO synthesis in vSMC might be important in vessel’s function. Although it is known that vSMC contribute to vascular pathology in diabetes by their change from a quiescent state to an activated proliferative and migratory phenotype (termed phenotypic modulation), whether this altered phenotypic modulation might also involve alterations in the nitrergic systems is still controversial. Our recent data indicate that, in vivo, chronic hyperglycemia might induce an increased number of vSMC proliferative clones which persist in culture and are associated with increased eNOS expression and activity. However, upregulation of eNOS and increased NO synthesis occur {{in the presence of a}} marked concomitant increase of O 2 − production. Since NO bioavailabilty might not be increased in high glucose stimulated vSMC, it is tempting to hypothesize that the proliferative phenotype observed in cells from diabetic rats {{is associated}} with a redox imbalance responsible quenching and/or trapping of NO, with the consequent loss of its biological activity. This might provide new insight on the mechanisms responsible for accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Sesamum radiatum Schum. & Thonn. (Pedaliaceae) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} plant, which {{belongs to the}} family Pedaliaceae and genus Sesamum. Sesame is used in traditional medicine in Africa and Asia for many diseases treatment. Sesame plant especially the leaves, seed and oil are consumed locally as a staple food by subsistence farmers. The study analyses the relaxation induced by the aqueous extract of leaves from sesame (ESera), {{compared with those of}} acetylcholine (ACh) in the guinea-pig aortic preparations (GPAPs), in order to confirm the use in traditional medicine for cardiovascular diseases. Methods The longitudinal strips of aorta of animals were rapidly removed from animals. The aorta was immediately placed in a Mac Ewen solution. Experiments were performed in preparations with intact endothelium as well as in aortae where the endothelium had been removed. The preparations were suspended between two L-shaped stainless steel hooks in a 10 ml organ bath with Mac Ewen solution. The isometric contractile force of the aorta strips of guinea-pig were recorded by using a strain gauge. All both drugs caused concentration-dependent relaxations responses. Results The aqueous extract of leaves from sesame ESera (1 × 10 - 7 – 0. 1 μg/ml) caused a graded relaxation in GPAPs with intact endothelium, with a EC 50 -value of 1 × 10 - 4 μg/ml. The same effect was observed with ACh (7 × 10 - 2 nM – 7 × 10 - 1 μM), which caused relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxation in response to ESera and, like that to ACh in GPAPs without endothelium, was fully abolished. Destruction of the endothelium or incubation with the <b>nitric</b> <b>oxyde</b> synthase inhibitor (L-NNA) significantly enhanced the inhibition of the relaxation response to ESera. Moreover, all concentrations induced vasoconstrictions. However, L-NNA produced a significant displacement to the right (about 65 -fold) of the relaxation response to ESera. Similar results were obtained with ACh. Both diclofenac and tetra-ethyl-ammonium (TEA) pretreatment of GPAPs induced a suppression of the relaxation caused by ESera, and produced a very significant rightward shifts of the CRC (16 -fold) for diclofenac and increase the Emax. In contract, the relaxation caused by ACh was not significantly affected by diclofenac or by TEA. Conclusion Thus, the present results indicate clearly that the nitric oxide largely contribute to the relaxation effect of Esera and of ACh in GPAPs. In addition, their contractile effects are also mediated by cyclooxygenase activation, and probably the K+ channels involvement, that confirm the use of various preparations of Esera for the treatments of cardiovascular diseases. </p...|$|E
