25|$|Stability of <b>nanoparticle</b> agglomerates is {{critical}} for estimating size distribution of aerosolized particles from nano-powders or other sources. At nanotechnology workplaces, workers can be exposed via inhalation to potentially toxic substances during handling and processing of nanomaterials. Nanoparticles in the air often form agglomerates due to attractive inter-particle forces, such as van der Waals force or electrostatic force if the particles are charged. As a result, aerosol particles are usually observed as agglomerates rather than individual particles. For exposure and risk assessments of airborne nanoparticles, {{it is important to}} know about the size distribution of aerosols. When inhaled by humans, particles with different diameters are deposited in varied locations of the central and periphery respiratory system. Particles in nanoscale have been shown to penetrate the air-blood barrier in lungs and be translocated into secondary organs in the human body, such as the brain, heart and liver. Therefore, the knowledge on stability of <b>nanoparticle</b> agglomerates is important for predicting the size of aerosol particles, which helps assess the potential risk of them to human bodies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Gold <b>nanoparticles</b> {{are useful}} tools for {{biological}} applications {{due to their}} attractive physical and chemical properties. Their applications can be further expanded when they are functionalized with biological molecules. The biological molecules not only provide the interfaces for interactions between <b>nanoparticles</b> and biological environment, but also contribute their biological functions to the <b>nanoparticles.</b> Therefore, we used self-assembling protein <b>nanoparticles</b> (SAPNs) to encapsulate gold <b>nanoparticles.</b> The protein <b>nanoparticles</b> are formed upon self-assembly of a protein chain that is composed of a pentameric coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus and trimeric coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus. The self-assembling protein <b>nanoparticles</b> form a central cavity of about 10 nm in size, which is ideal for the encapsulation of gold <b>nanoparticles</b> with similar sizes. Results We have used SAPNs to encapsulate several commercially available gold <b>nanoparticles.</b> The hydrodynamic size and the surface coating of gold <b>nanoparticles</b> are two important factors influencing successful encapsulation by the SAPNs. Gold <b>nanoparticles</b> with a hydrodynamic size of less than 15 nm can successfully be encapsulated. Gold <b>nanoparticles</b> with citrate coating appear to have stronger interactions with the proteins, which can interfere {{with the formation of}} regular protein <b>nanoparticles.</b> Upon encapsulation gold <b>nanoparticles</b> with polymer coating interfere less strongly with the ability of the SAPNs to assemble into <b>nanoparticles.</b> Although the central cavity of the SAPNs carries an overall charge, the electrostatic interaction appears to be less critical for the efficient encapsulation of gold <b>nanoparticles</b> into the protein <b>nanoparticles.</b> Conclusions The SAPNs can be used to encapsulate gold <b>nanoparticles.</b> The SAPNs can be further functionalized by engineering functional peptides or proteins to either their N- or C-termini.
