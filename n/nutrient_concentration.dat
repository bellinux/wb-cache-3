40|$|Data {{collected}} on four large-scale surveys around the subantarctic island of South Georgia {{provide information on}} the variability {{in the distribution of}} chlorophyll and inorganic nutrients during the austral summer and winter. During three summer surveys, surface water cholorophyll and <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> were highly patchy over scales ranging from a few to hundreds of kilometres.

Concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sodium (Na) in spruce, pine and birch stumps were assessed in eight sites across Scandinavia. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> were higher in birch than in spruce and pine. In Sweden and Finland, the <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> were generally higher at the southern sites than at the sites located in the northern part of the countries, except for P. For all <b>nutrients,</b> <b>concentrations</b> were significantly higher in the bark of the stump and roots than in the wood.

Foliar <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> from 126 sugarcane commercial fields were analyzed during the 1996 / 97 season, to calculate DRIS indices. Regression analysis was used to fit a model relating DRIS indices to <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Experiments were carried out during the 1997 / 98 season, whose treatments consisted of the addition of the most limiting nutrients according to DRIS. A new diagnosis was performed. At the end of 1997 / 98 season, the yields of each plot were collected. Analysis of variance and Duncan test (5 %) were used for the evaluation of the collected data. There was a positive and significant relationship between sugarcane foliar <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> and DRIS indices. The optimum foliar <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> for sugarcane are: 13. 4 g ha- 1 for N, 1. 91 g ha- 1 for P, 12. 2 g ha- 1 for K, 2. 99 g ha- 1 for Ca, 2. 15 g ha- 1 for Mg, 1. 61 g ha- 1 for S, 4. 48 mg ha- 1 for Cu, 67. 8 mg ha- 1 for Mn and 11. 7 mg ha- 1 for Zn.

40|$|Nutrient homeostasis-the {{maintenance}} of relatively constant internal <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> in fluctuating external environments-is {{essential to the}} survival of most organisms. Transcriptional regulation of plasma membrane transporters by internal <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> is typically assumed to be the main mechanism by which homeostasis is achieved. While this mechanism is homeostatic we show that it does not achieve global perfect homeostasis-a condition where internal <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> are completely independent of external <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations</b> for all external <b>nutrient</b> <b>concentrations.</b> We show that the criterion for global perfect homeostasis is that transporter levels must be inversely proportional to net nutrient flux into the cell and that downregulation of active transporters (activity-dependent regulation) is a simple and biologically plausible mechanism that meets this criterion. Activity-dependent transporter regulation creates a trade-off between robustness and efficiency, i. e., the system's ability to withstand perturbation in external nutrients and the transporter production rate needed to maintain homeostasis. Additionally, we show that a system that utilizes both activity-dependent transporter downregulation and regulation of transporter synthesis by internal nutrient levels can create a system that mitigates the shortcomings of each of the individual mechanisms. This analysis highlights the utility of activity-dependent regulation in achieving homeostasis and calls for a re-examination of the mechanisms of regulation of other homeostatic systems...|$|R
