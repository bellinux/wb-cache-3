25|$|Doukas {{places the}} {{defenders}} at 5,000, but Archbishop Benedetto claims that only 1,000 were present; among them 70 Knights Hospitaller and 110 Catalan mercenaries. According to Doukas, {{the town of}} Mytilene harboured a civilian population of around 20,000. The defenders further hoped for {{the assistance of the}} Venetians; a fleet of under Vettore Cappello was nearby at Chios. After the siege began, Cappello with his 29 galleys sailed towards Lesbos, and could easily have overwhelmed the Turkish fleet, whose crews had gone ashore to assist in the siege, but in the end, he obeyed his strict instructions <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that might provoke a war with the Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|Horthy's {{attitude}} to Hitler was ambivalent. On one hand, Hungary was a revisionist state {{that refused to}} accept the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon. Furthermore, the three states with which Hungary had territorial disputes, namely Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, were all allies of France, so a German-Hungarian alliance seemed logical. On the other hand, Admiral Horthy was a good navalist who believed that sea power was {{the most important factor in}} war. He felt that Britain, as the world's greatest sea power, would inevitably defeat Germany should another war begin. During a meeting with Hitler in 1935, Horthy was well pleased that Hitler informed him that he wanted Germany and Hungary to partition Czechoslovakia, but Horthy went on to tell Hitler that he must careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that might cause an Anglo–German war, because British sea power would sooner or later cause the defeat of the Reich. Horthy was always torn between his belief that an alliance with Germany was the only means that could enable him to revise Trianon and his belief that war against the international order could only end in defeat.|$|E
500|$|In a 1920 essay, {{after the}} World War I, Gandhi wrote, [...] "where {{there is only}} a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence." [...] Rahul Sagar interprets Gandhi's efforts to recruit for the British {{military}} during the War, as Gandhi's belief that, at that time, it would demonstrate that Indians were willing to fight. Further, it would also show the British that his fellow Indians were [...] "their subjects by choice rather than out of cowardice." [...] In 1922, Gandhi wrote that abstinence from violence is effective and true forgiveness only when one has the power to punish, not when one decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> because one is helpless.|$|E

500|$|Johnston had a {{reputation}} as a poor batsman, averaging less than 13 in Tests and first-class matches without making a half century. He headed the averages in England in 1953, being not out 16 times out of 17 and averaging 102.00. He attributed this to [...] "a lot of application, concentration and dedication", stating that [...] "class always tells". When Hassett realised that Johnston was atop the batting averages, he told Johnston to tell the opposing captain of this fact and ask them to refrain from dismissing him. In the last match against T. N. Pearce's XI at Scarborough, English Test paceman Alec Bedser bowled wide of the stumps and advised Johnston <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that would lose him his wicket. In 1954–55 he made 39 for the last wicket with Neil Harvey as they chased 78 for victory before he edged Frank Tyson to the wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans.|$|E
500|$|The {{veterans}} made {{camp in the}} Anacostia flats {{while they}} awaited the congressional decision {{on whether or not}} to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that would cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a [...] "Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican".|$|E
500|$|On the {{characterization}} of Catwoman, Waters explained [...] "Sam Hamm {{went back to the}} way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> so you had to wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E

500|$|Though Stelmach pledged <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to {{curb the}} {{development}} of the oilsands, he did promise to review royalty rates—the rates paid by oil companies for the privilege of extracting Alberta's oil. He also committed to reducing the proportion of bitumen that left Alberta to be upgraded out of province, likening the export of bitumen to [...] "scraping off the top soil" [...] from farmland. Soon after becoming Premier, he commissioned the Alberta Royalty Review panel to make recommendations on the province's royalty regime; opposition politicians had accused the government of undercharging substantially. [...] Stelmach rejected many of the panel's recommendations, and claimed to increase royalty rates by approximately 20% (25% less than recommended by the panel), however instead of an increase in royalties on oil and gas, Alberta collected $13.5 billion less from 2009 to 2014. Just after the 2008 election, Stelmach's government announced a five-year royalty break worth $237million per year to encourage development that it feared would have become uneconomical under the new plan. He was less decisive in increasing in-province bitumen upgrading; in 2008 he conceded that Alberta would continue upgrading between sixty and sixty-five percent of the bitumen it produced for the foreseeable future, rather than the seventy-two percent target he had previously announced for 2016. This admission came {{in the wake of his}} government's approval of three new pipelines designed to export bitumen.|$|E
500|$|While {{attempting}} {{to fix a}} broken toaster, Homer accidentally turns it into a time machine. It transports him to prehistoric times where he realizes he must be careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to change history. After swatting a mosquito, {{he returns to the}} present to find a dystopia where Ned is a dictator of the world. Homer travels back in time again {{attempting to}} set things right; however, he accidentally kills a walking fish, and after returning to the present, he finds Bart and Lisa are giants, narrowly avoiding being crushed by them. He then sneezes and infects the dinosaurs with a cold virus while defending himself from a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which proceeds to cause their extinction. He is initially pleased with the results in the present; amongst other perks, the family is now extremely wealthy and Patty and Selma have died, but is horrified upon discovering that donuts do not exist in this timeline and flees, only seconds before donuts begin raining from the sky. In another world, Willie attempts to help Homer, but is again struck in the back with an axe, this time by Maggie. After several more trips back and forth in time, Homer eventually arrives in a reality that appears normal; he finds humans eating with lizard-like tongues, but finally decides that it is [...] "close enough".|$|E
2500|$|Swami Vivekananda {{compared}} {{human mind}} with a monkey {{who is always}} restless and incessantly active by his own nature. He noticed, the human mind naturally wants to get outside, to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs. So, he stressed on practice of concentration, as he felt there is no limit {{to the power of}} the human mind, the more concentrated it is, the more powerful it becomes. [...] Swami Vivekananda suggested <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> which disturbs the mind or makes it restless.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Goh {{was a key}} {{member of}} the PAP's Central Executive Committee, and later became its vice-chairman. Goh {{successfully}} contested the Kreta Ayer seat in the 1959 general election, {{was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly on 30 May, and joined the first government of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as Minister for Finance. In this role, he assumed stewardship of Singapore's economy. As a budget deficit of S$14 million was forecast that year, he introduced stringent fiscal discipline which including cutting civil service salaries. As a result of these measures, he was able to announce {{at the end of the}} year when delivering the budget that the Government had achieved a surplus of $1 million. He initiated the setting up of the Economic Development Board which was established in August 1961 to attract foreign multinational corporations to invest in Singapore. The next year, he started the development of the Jurong industrial estate on the western end of the island which was then a swamp, offering incentives to local and foreign business to locate there. According to former Permanent Secretary Sim Kee Boon, Goh admitted that the Jurong project was [...] "an act of faith and he himself jokingly said that this could prove to be Goh's folly". Nonetheless, Goh also felt strongly that [...] "the only way to avoid making mistakes is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> And that... will be the ultimate mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{so-called}} dynamic infinitive may {{be governed}} by verbs of will or desire to do something ( [...] or [...] "to be willing, wish to", [...] "pray, wish for", [...] "pray against, imprecate curse to", [...] "choose, prefer to", [...] "to be about to, or: delay to", [...] "urge, command to", [...] "order to", [...] "vote to", [...] "allow to", [...] "beg to" [...] etc.), verbs of will or desire <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> ( [...] "fear to", [...] "be afraid to", [...] "abstain from doing", [...] "be ashamed to", [...] "forbid to", [...] "hinder, prevent" [...] etc.) and verbs or verbal expressions denoting ability, fitness, necessity, capacity, etc. ( [...] , [...] "be able to", , [...] "know how to", [...] "learn to", , [...] "I am able to", [...] "it is fair/right to", [...] "it is necessary to", [...] "it is time to" [...] etc.). It {{can also be found}} after adjectives (and sometimes derived adverbs) of kindred meaning ( [...] "skillful", [...] "able", [...] "able", [...] "sufficient, capable" [...] etc.). It stands as the object (direct or indirect) of such verbs or verbal expressions, or it serves as the subject if the verb/the verbal expression is used impersonally; it also defines the meaning of an adjective almost as an accusative of respect. An infinitive of this kind denotes only aspect or stage of action, not actual tense, and can be in any tense stem (mostly in the present and aorist (see also here), the perfect being rare enough) except the future one; only the verb [...] "I am about to" [...] may exceptionally take a dynamic future infinitive.|$|E
