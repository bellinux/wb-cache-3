25|$|It {{has been}} said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of {{leadership}} would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration {{would have been in}} not struggling for something better. Today, I am <b>not</b> <b>ashamed.....</b> The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain things are no longer acceptable to us as a people.|$|E
25|$|The obscure word sōpiō (gen. sōpiōnis) {{seemed to}} mean a sexualized {{caricature}} with an abnormally large penis, such as the Romans were known to draw. It appears in Catullus 37: frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam ("I will draw sopios {{on the front of}} the tavern") and in graffiti from Pompeii: ut merdas edatis, qui scripseras sopionis ("whoever drew sopios, let him eat shit!'") The grammarian Sacerdos preserves a quotation about Pompey, that says quem non pudet et rubet, non est homo, sed sopio ("whoever is <b>not</b> <b>ashamed,</b> and does not blush, is not a man, but a sopio.") Sōpiō would appear to describe drawings such as that of the god Mercury in the illustration.|$|E

25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
25|$|Coppola's {{next project}} was Jack, which was {{released}} on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so {{at the age of}} ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, Jack also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film Big, in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for Jack, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.|$|E

[...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't.

500|$|While the Athenians and the Thebans were {{preparing}} themselves for war, Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies, proposing in vain a new peace treaty.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285. After a few trivial encounters {{between the two}} sides, which resulted in minor Athenian victories, Philip drew the phalanx of the Athenian and Theban confederates into a plain near Chaeronea, where he defeated them. Demosthenes fought as a mere hoplite. Such was Philip's hatred for Demosthenes that, according to Diodorus Siculus, the king after his victory sneered at the misfortunes of the Athenian statesman. However, the Athenian orator and statesman Demades {{is said to have}} remarked: [...] "O King, when Fortune has cast you in the role of Agamemnon, are you <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> to act the part of Thersites? [...] " [...] Stung by these words, Philip immediately altered his demeanour.|$|E

The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties.
