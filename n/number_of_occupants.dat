However, the figures given– 854 persons and 795 persons respectively– far exceed the confirmed number of 712 survivors, due to confusion and misreporting.

25|$|As {{early as}} 1770 Voght {{had come in}} contact with prisons, when, {{representing}} his father, he had shown the English prison reformer John Howard around Hamburg's penitentiary. From that time he maintained a great interest in matters related to poorhouses and prisons. Together {{with the head of the}} trade academy (Handelsakademie) Johann Georg Büsch and the lawyer Johann Arnold Günther, Voght initiated in 1788 the establishment of a 'common institution for the poor' (Allgemeinen Armenanstalt) with which he reformed Hamburg's poor provision. The foundation of this reform was the division of the city into care zones whose approximately 200 inhabitants were entrusted with finding voluntary means of caring for the poor in that zone. The institute guaranteed medical attention for the poor, support during pregnancy and childbirth, and education and work for poor children. In contrast to the prevailing mode of providing for the poor, which was usually ecclesiastical and focused on moral and spiritual aspects of the situation, the reform was directed towards the economic needs of those affected. The cost of the effort was met by tithes collected in churches and weekly collections for the poor. As a result of this effort, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in Hamburg's penitentiaries sank drastically.|$|E

At 11:10p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down a window, and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, Before I Wake, that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.|$|E
25|$|Boat 4 {{appears to}} have had about 42 people aboard (about 40 women and {{children}} and two or three crew members) when it was lowered. As it had been ordered, Perkis steered the boat {{along the side of the}} ship in search for open gangways, since he had been told to take on board more passengers through them, but found no one. This way, the boat ended up near the davits of Boat 16 (which had been already launched), and two greasers, Thomas Ranger and Frederick William Scott, who were standing near them, climbed down the falls to Boat 4 (Scott fell into the water but was hauled aboard the lifeboat). The boat then rowed away from the ship in order to avoid suction. A third man, lamp trimmer Samuel Ernest Hemming, climbed down the falls of another lifeboat and swam over to No. 4, which was about 200 yards far. Immediately after the sinking the boat rowed back to the wreckage to pick up more survivors (the only lifeboat to try immediately to do so). The boat picked up six or seven more men (trimmer Thomas Patrick Dillon, seaman William Henry Lyons, stewards Andrew Cunningham and Sidney Conrad Siebert, storekeeper Frank Winnold Prentice, and one or two more unidentified swimmers) from the water. Two (Siebert and Lyons) later died of exposure. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> later increased when other people were transferred from Boat 14 and Collapsible Boat D. By the time it reached Carpathia at 8:00a.m. it had about 60 occupants.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHousehold carbon {{emission}} (HCE) {{is a growing}} concern among develop countries such as China, United States, and United Kingdom. Numerous researches have been done in order to identify the factors contributing to increase of HCE. Among the factors are <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants,</b> household incomes, transportation fuels, electricity and liquefy petroleum gas (LPG) consumption, and waste generated by households. Unfortunately, results from these researches are possibly inapplicable at Malaysia due to difference in type of study area and climate. Thus, the purpose of this research is to identify the primary factor contributed to HCE at a residential area in Penang with the application of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The independent variables involved in the research are the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> households, household total incomes, electricity consumptions, LPG consumptions, and transportation fuel. The samples consist of 52 households using simple random sampling. There are significant positive correlations between total household income, electricity consumption, and transportation fuel with the amount of HCE.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the energy and comfort impact of the HVAC equipment granularity in offices through building performance simulation. To this end, the occupancy data gathered from 37 private offices in Ottawa, Canada were analysed. For each occupant, four parameters that play an important role over the HVAC operation were extracted. These parameters are the earliest expected arrival time, the latest expected departure time, the latest expected arrival time, and the longest expected duration of intermediate vacancy. Through random sampling from the 37 occupants, hypothetical zones with varying <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> were created, and EnergyPlus simulations were conducted. Results indicate that the earliest expected arrival time in one-person zones is on average two hours later than it is in twelve-person zones. Similarly, the latest expected departure time in one-person zones is on average two hours earlier than it is in twelve-person zones. Heating and cooling energy use with adaptive occupancy-based temperature setback scheduling in one-person zones is estimated to be 20 % less than it is in twelve-person zones.
