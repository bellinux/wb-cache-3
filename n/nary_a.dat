At that time, the CBC only had {{rights to the}} Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs' games; home games only during the season and all games in the playoffs. However, with both the Canadiens and Maple Leafs eliminated in the semi-finals, the CBC's worst nightmare became reality. The CBC had to conceive a way to carry the Finals between the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings or face public revolt. According to lore, the CBC {{found a way to}} link their Windsor viewers as having a vested interest in the Finals with the across the river Red Wings. Thus, CBC was able to carry the series after inking special contracts with the Red Wings and Black Hawks as a service to the Windsor market. From Windsor, CBC linked the signal to Toronto and they relayed the coverage Dominion-wide. From there, Canadians were able to see the Finals with <b>nary</b> <b>a</b> glitch in the coverage.|$|E

The Daily Telegraph critic Michael Hogan singled out Dunst, Danson and Wilson for their work on the show, as did the San Francisco Chronicle David Wiegand, whose opinion was that many of the performers' signature roles enhanced Hawley's script. Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine found Wilson to be the stand out among a pool of actors that [...] "deserve their own stand-alone appreciations". He said of the actor's performance: [...] "He's a young man, and he's in good shape, but he carries himself like an older, heavier one, as if weighed down by burdens he hasn't fully acknowledged because he's not ready yet. You get a sense of a personality, perhaps a soul, in the process of evolving." [...] Reviews from Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post singled out Donovan, Smart, Milioti, Garrett, and Offerman for their acting. Grantland, the New York Observer, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the ensemble performances.|$|E

Hewitt labeled the characters [...] "unrepentant, nihilistic, vile, venal, animalistic, avaricious, charmless, entitled, sub-Kardashian, stunningly irresponsible brats". Hewitt ended his review by stating that the film was [...] "possibly the worst film of the last 20 years. It's certainly the worst comedy of the last 20 years". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter was similarly critical, calling it [...] "grimly depressing, glumly unfunny teensploitation", but admitted that it would [...] "enthrall a portion of the high school/college age demographic it depicts, just as it alternately outrages, confounds and disgusts other, presumably older audiences." [...] USA Todays Claudia Puig found the film treated female characters poorly, labeling it a [...] "heinous, misogynistic movie filled with faceless crowds and <b>nary</b> <b>a</b> character who resembles an actual human being", a sentiment echoed by Melissa Anderson of The Village Voice who felt the film promoted [...] "skull-numbing hedonism without consequences", and [...] "second-nature misogyny", and that the only purpose of the male characters is to [...] "'get high, fuck bitches.'" ...|$|E

40|$|The UK’s Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883, {{introduced}} {{provision for}} trade marks in colours. However, notwithstanding this statutory provision, {{there was an}} ongoing conservative approach to the approval of colour trade marks. In 1887, the Chancery Division considered an application for the registration of the colours blue, white and red {{in the form of}} a Tricolor, on a label for a well-known brand of French coffee. 1 In handing down his judgement, Kay J remarked:“ [...] . you cannot register a mark of which the only distinction is the use of a colour, because, practically under the terms of the act, that would give you a monopoly of all the colours of the rainbow". 2 The application was refused, but on the grounds that the trade mark lacked distinctiveness independently of the colour, and that the colour should, in essence, be deemed an accident. This paper examines the recent judicial decisions on the registration of colour trade marks in respect of two longstanding and contentious cases, namely BP Amoco plc (BP) in respect of the colour green and Cadbury Schweppes (Cadbury) in respect of the colour purple.

The most comprehensive studies/expressions of third wave feminism that have appeared in the US, such as Leslie Heywoods and Jennifer Drakes Third Wave Agenda, the special issue of Hypatia on Third Wave Feminisms edited by Jacqueline Zita, and the anti-intellectual Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future by Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards, explore many new ways of doing feminism but exhibit little concern with the politics of gender and sexuality outside the west. Likewise, a perusal of third wave feminist websites yields only one site centered on the fight for social justice (Third Wave Foundation), and even that one unself-consciously focuses exclusively on events in New York City and on womens efforts in that town to combat inequalities stemming from age, gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status and so on.

David Edelstein of New York magazine claimed that Like Crazy was [...] "the most infectious love story in decades", comparing its [...] "wonderfully sane" [...] perspective to other romance films and romantic comedies. Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film an A- grade and praised Doremus, Yelchin and Felicity Jones's storytelling ability in creating [...] "a palpably real, universally identifiable manifestation of young love {{in all its}} ecstasy and agony". In a review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that [...] "Drake Doremus has crafted a crazily inventive and totally irresistible tale of first love that makes the familiar seem bittersweet and heart-stoppingly new". He described Felicity Jones as [...] "a marvel" [...] and Yelchin as [...] "outstanding". Time magazine's Mary Pols commended the film's ambiguous ending and wrote, [...] "Like Crazy is a cinematic love potion and you leave it feeling bewitched." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Jones and Yelchin's performances and the [...] "intelligent, graceful indie style" [...] of the film, although he found the storyline somewhat unrealistic. Indiewire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ grade and felt that while the plot developed slowly, Yelchin and Jones shared [...] "an indelible and entirely realistic chemistry". Variety film critic Andrew Barker, who described the film as [...] "an exquisite, beautifully acted gem", gave particular praise to the film's [...] "dexterous editing", given that it [...] "contains <b>nary</b> <b>an</b> extraneous detail, while still managing to luxuriate in the tender and awkward silences of young love".|$|R
5000|$|On Stranger Tides {{also had}} {{positive}} reviews; some critics found {{the film to}} be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as [...] "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story [...] "pure cartoon, but {{a lot easier to}} follow than the other sequels", and summing as [...] "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it." [...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has <b>nary</b> <b>an</b> original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|R
