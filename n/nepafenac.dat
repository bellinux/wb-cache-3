40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} once-daily <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % {{to prevent}} and treat ocular pain and inflammation after cataract surgery. SettingSixty-five centers in the United States and Europe. DesignRandomized double-masked vehicle- and active-controlled phase 3 study. MethodsPatients received <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % once daily, <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % 3 times daily, or their respective vehicles from day − 1 to day 14 after cataract extraction. An additional drop of study drug was administered 30 to 120 minutes preoperatively. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a cure for inflammation (score of 0 for both aqueous cells and flare) at day  14. ResultsOf randomized patients, 817 received <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 %, 819 received <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 %, and 200 and 206 received the respective vehicles. Significantly more <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % patients had no inflammation (68. 4 % versus 34. 0 %) and were pain free (91. 0 % versus 49. 7 %) at day 14 than vehicle patients (both P<. 0001). <b>Nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % was noninferior to <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % for inflammation (95 % confidence interval [CI], − 5. 73 % to 3. 17 %) and pain-free rates (95 % CI, − 3. 08 % to 2. 70 %). At all postoperative visits, fewer treatment failures (P≤. 0012) and more clinical successes (P≤. 0264) were observed with <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % versus vehicle. <b>Nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % was well tolerated and had a safety profile {{comparable to that of}} <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 %. ConclusionsOnce-daily <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % was noninferior to <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % 3 times daily for prevention and treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. The safety of <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % was comparable to that of <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 %, with the added convenience of once-daily dosing. Financial DisclosureDrs.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{effectiveness of}} topical <b>nepafenac</b> in reducing macular edema following panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Design. Prospective randomized double-blinded controlled study. Methods. Sixty eyes of 60 patients having proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy had PRP. Patients were then {{divided into two}} groups: <b>nepafenac</b> group (30 eyes) receiving 1 % topical <b>nepafenac</b> eye drops for 6 months and control group (30 eyes) receiving carboxymethylcellulose eye drops for 6 months. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular optical coherence tomography were followed up at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after PRP. Results. BCVA was significantly better in <b>nepafenac</b> group than in control group at all follow-ups (P< 0. 01). At 6 months post-PRP, logMAR BCVA was 0. 11 [*]±[*] 0. 04 (equivalent to 20 / 26 Snellen acuity) in the <b>nepafenac</b> group and 0. 18 [*]±[*] 0. 08 (equivalent to 20 / 30 Snellen acuity) {{in the control group}} (P< 0. 01). Central foveal thickness (CFT) increased in both groups from the first month after PRP. Increase in CFT was higher in control group than in <b>nepafenac</b> group throughout follow-up, but the difference became statistically significant only after 4 months. No significant ocular adverse events were reported with topical <b>nepafenac.</b> Conclusion.

However, the fact that the cure rate of <b>nepafenac</b> was significantly higher than placebo implies that <b>nepafenac</b> is likely to be effective in preventing the development of CME.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNepafenac {{ophthalmic}} suspensions, 0. 1 % (NEVANAC®) and 0. 3 % (ILEVRO™), are topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) products {{approved in}} the United States, Europe {{and various other}} countries to treat pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery. NEVANAC is also approved in Europe for {{the reduction in the}} risk of postoperative macular edema (ME) associated with cataract surgery in diabetic patients. The efficacy against ME suggests that topical administration leads to distribution of <b>nepafenac</b> or its active metabolite amfenac to the posterior segment of the eye. This article evaluates the ocular distribution of <b>nepafenac</b> and amfenac and the extent of local delivery to the posterior segment of the eye, following topical ocular instillation in animal models. <b>Nepafenac</b> ophthalmic suspension was instilled unilaterally in New Zealand White rabbits as either a single dose (0. 1 %; one drop) or as multiple doses (0. 3 %, one drop, once-daily for 4 days, or 0. 1 % one drop, three-times daily for 3 days and one morning dose on day 4). <b>Nepafenac</b> (0. 3 %) was also instilled unilaterally in cynomolgus monkeys as multiple doses (one drop, three-times daily for 7 days). <b>Nepafenac</b> and amfenac concentrations in harvested ocular tissues were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Locally-distributed compound concentrations were determined as the difference in levels between dosed and undosed eyes. In single-dosed rabbit eyes, peak concentrations of locally-distributed <b>nepafenac</b> and amfenac showed a trend of sclera > choroid > retina. <b>Nepafenac</b> peak levels in sub-samples posterior to the eye equator and inclusive of the posterior pole (E-PP) were 55. 1, 4. 03 and 2. 72  nM, respectively, at 0. 25 or 0. 50  h, with corresponding amfenac peak levels of 41. 9, 3. 10 and 0. 705  nM at 1 or 4  h. By comparison, peak levels in sclera, choroid and retina sub-samples in a band between the ora serrata and the equator (OS-E) were 13 - to 40 -fold (<b>nepafenac)</b> or 11 - to 23 -fold (amfenac) higher, indicating an anterior-to-posterior directional concentration gradient. In multiple-dosed rabbit eyes, with 0. 3 % <b>nepafenac</b> instilled once-daily or 0. 1 % <b>nepafenac</b> instilled three-times daily, cumulative 24 -h locally-distributed levels of <b>nepafenac</b> in E-PP retina were similar between these groups, whereas exposure to amfenac once-daily dosing <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % was 51 % of that achieved with three-times daily dosing of 0. 1 %. In single-dosed monkey eyes, concentration gradients showed similar directionality as observed in rabbit eyes. Peak concentrations of locally-distributed <b>nepafenac</b> were 1580, 386, 292 and 13. 8  nM in E-PP sclera, choroid and retina, vitreous humor, respectively, at 1 or 2  h after drug instillation. Corresponding amfenac concentrations were 21. 3, 11. 8, 2. 58 and 2. 82  nM, observed 1 or 2  h post-instillation. The data indicate that topically administered <b>nepafenac</b> and its metabolite amfenac reach pharmacologically relevant concentrations in the posterior eye segment (choroid and retina) via local distribution, following an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient. The proposed pathway involves a choroidal/suprachoroidal or periocular route, along with an inward movement of drug through the sclera, choroid and retina, with negligible vitreal compartment involvement. Sustained high <b>nepafenac</b> concentrations in posterior segment tissues may be a reservoir for hydrolysis to amfenac...|$|E

40|$|As a new {{ophthalmic}} {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) with prodrug structure, <b>Nepafenac</b> {{was supposed}} to have a better efficacy than conventional NSAIDs both in patients' tolerability and ocular inflammation associated with cataract surgery.

The objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and patients' tolerability of <b>Nepafenac</b> and Ketorolac following cataract surgery. To clarify this, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Eleven articles were included in this study. The dataset consisted of 1165 patients, including 1175 cataract surgeries. Among them, 574 patients were in the <b>Nepafenac</b> group and 591 in the Ketorolac group. Our analysis indicated that these two drugs were equally effective in controlling post cataract surgery ocular inflammation, reducing macular edema, achieving a better visual ability and maintaining intraoperative mydriasis during cataract surgery. However, <b>Nepafenac</b> was more effective than Ketorolac in reducing the incidence of postoperative conjunctival hyperemia and ocular discomfort. This meta-analysis indicated that topical <b>Nepafenac</b> is superior to Ketorolac in patients' tolerability following cataract surgery. However, these two drugs are equally desirable in the management of anterior chamber inflammation, visual rehabilitation and intraoperative mydriasis. Given the limitations in our study, more researches with larger sample sizes and focused on more specific indicators such as peak aqueous concentrations of drugs or PEG 2 levels are required to reach a firmer conclusion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To compare <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % with placebo and {{ketorolac}} 0. 5 % {{for prevention}} and treatment of ocular pain and inflammation after cataract surgery. METHODS: In a multi-center, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-masked clinical trial, 227 patients with cataract were randomized to receive <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 %, ketorolac 0. 5 %, or placebo TID beginning 1 day pre-operatively and continuing for 21 days postoperatively. At each postoperative visit, cure rates and clinical success rates (</= 5 aqueous cells and no flare) were calculated, and investigators evaluated patients' pain. On Day 7, patients judged ocular comfort after study drug instillation. RESULTS: <b>Nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % produced significantly more cures compared to placebo at Day 14 (76. 3 % vs 59. 2 %, p = 0. 0241), more clinical successes from Day 7 onward (p < 0. 05), and more pain-free patients from Day 3 onward (p < 0. 05). <b>Nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % was superior to ketorolac 0. 5 % in terms of clinical success at Day 14 (p = 0. 0319) and in percentage of pain-free patients at Day 3 (p = 0. 0366). <b>Nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % also demonstrated less discomfort upon instillation than ketorolac 0. 5 % (p = 0. 0158).

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % for cystoid macular edema (CME). Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective review of 22 CME cases (20 patients) treated with <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % (six with concomitant prednisolone acetate 1 %) from December 2005 to April 2008 : three acute pseudophakic CME cases, 13 chronic/recalcitrant pseudophakic CME cases, and six cases of uveitic CME. Pre- and post-treatment retinal thickness and visual acuity were reported. Results: Following treatment for six weeks to six months, six eyes with uveitic CME showed a mean retinal thickness improvement of 227 ± 168. 1 μm; mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement was 0. 36 ± 0. 20 logMAR. All three cases of acute pseudophakic CME improved after four to 10 weeks of <b>nepafenac,</b> with a mean improvement in retinal thickness of 134 ± 111. 0 μm.

30|$|<b>Nepafenac</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) and a prodrug that is metabolized {{into its}} active form, amfenac, following ocular administration. Delivering amfenac as a prodrug permits increased corneal penetration and high aqueous {{concentration of the}} compound [1]. Amfenac suppresses prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), as do other NSAIDs [1]. Following the administration of diclofenac, total prostaglandin production by the rabbit iris–ciliary body was inhibited by approximately 40 % within 5  min and remained unchanged thereafter, while <b>nepafenac</b> exhibited an inhibitory effect on prostaglandin production between 5 and 10  min after administration, with the inhibitory rate exceeding 90 % between 40 and 80  min after administration [2]. The inhibitory effect of <b>nepafenac</b> on extravascular protein exudation into the aqueous humor of the rabbit continued for 8  h after administration while diclofenac inhibited vascular permeation up to 4  h after administration but exhibited no significant inhibitory effect 8  h after administration [2]. Since its launch in the USA in 2005, <b>nepafenac</b> 0.1 % has been widely used in clinical practice in more than 70 countries worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Bora Yüksel, Ömer Karti, Tuncay Kusbeci Department of Ophthalmology, Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital, İzmir, Turkey Abstract: Since {{its first}} description, the {{prevention}} of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (PCME) continues to pose challenges for ophthalmologists. Recent evidence suggests that prophylaxis is unnecessary in patients without risk factors. Diabetes mellitus is generally considered as {{a risk factor for}} the development of PCME after cataract surgery since it causes breakdown of the blood–retinal barrier. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) increases the risk even further. Therefore, prophylactic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be considered in diabetic patients, especially if they have DR. NSAIDs block the cyclooxygenase enzymes responsible for prostaglandin production and reduce the incidence of PCME after cataract surgery. <b>Nepafenac</b> seems superior to other NSAIDs in terms of ocular penetration allowing higher and sustained therapeutic levels in retina and choroid. Topical steroids are less effective and may cause intraocular pressure increase limiting their long-term use. <b>Nepafenac</b> is cost effective, when the burden of PCME prevention is compared with the burden of treatment. Prevention is much cheaper and less harmful than invasive treatments like periocular or intravitreal injections. Overall, both <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 1 % and <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % are well tolerated. They should be used carefully in patients with compromised corneas such as those with severe dry eye or penetrating grafts. If otherwise healthy cataract patients have ≥ 2 risk factors, like PCME in the other eye or posterior capsule rupture during surgery, treatment should be considered. Once-daily <b>nepafenac</b> 0. 3 % dosing may improve postoperative outcomes through increased patient compliance and may reduce treatment burden further. Every patient should be assessed in terms of risks/benefits of the treatment, in individual basis, before cataract surgery.

30|$|In this study, <b>nepafenac</b> {{expected}} to prevent postoperative inflammation and ocular pain, was administered as a monotherapy to patients undergoing cataract surgery, and its efficacy and {{safety in the}} management of postoperative inflammation and ocular pain were compared with those of a placebo. The subjects were Japanese patients with cataracts who were undergoing cataract surgery with PEA and IOL implantation. Evaluations were based on cure rates 14  days after surgery and ocular pain-free rates during the first 14  days after surgery. The cure rate was 71.4 % in the <b>nepafenac</b> group and 28.6 % in the placebo group, showing a significant difference between groups. Those who achieved cures in the placebo group appeared to have undergone spontaneous resolution of postoperative inflammation, as indicated by a gradual increase in cure rates over the course of treatment. In contrast, the <b>nepafenac</b> group demonstrated higher cure rates than those in the placebo group, with significant intergroup differences observed on days  7 and 14 postoperatively. This study revealed significant differences in cure rates between <b>nepafenac</b> and placebo over the course of treatment, which was consistent with the results of a study conducted in the USA using the same evaluation [4].|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} effects of {{preoperative}} use of topical anti-inflammatory prednisolone acetate, ketorolac tromethamine, <b>nepafenac</b> and placebo, on the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis during cataract surgery. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Materials and Methods: This single-center, masked, randomized clinical study comprised 140 patients scheduled for cataract surgery. Patients (35 in each group) were randomized to receive placebo, prednisolone acetate, ketorolac tromethamine 0. 4 % or <b>nepafenac.</b> These eye drops were administered three times daily for the two days prior to surgery. The pupillary diameters were measured by the surgeon using a compass prior to the corneal section {{and at the end}} of surgery. The primary outcome was the number of patients with pupil >= 6 mm at the end of the surgery; the secondary outcome was the number of patients with pupil >= 6 mm at the beginning of the surgery. Results: All the patients achieved pupil >= 6 mm at the beginning of the surgery. The number of patients in the prednisolone (29 / 35), <b>nepafenac</b> (31 / 35) and ketorolac (30 / 35) groups with pupil >= 6 mm was greater than in the placebo group in the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis (19 / 35 - P = 0. 003). There was no statistical difference among the prednisolone, <b>nepafenac</b> and ketorolac groups in the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis (P =. 791).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess {{adjuvant}} treatment with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (0. 9 % bromfenac, 0. 1 % <b>nepafenac,</b> 0. 5 % indomethacin, or 0. 1 % diclofenac) in addition to topical steroidal treatment with 0. 1 % dexamethasone and 0. 3 % netilmicin for prevention of cystoid macular edema (CME) after uneventful small incision cataract extraction with foldable intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Setting: Institute of Ophthalmology, Department of Scienze Mediche di Base, Neuroscienze ed Organi di Senso, Aldo Moro University, Policlinico Consorziale di Bari, Bari, Italy. Design: A retrospective 6 -month single center study. Methods: Patients were divided into groups according to treatment with topical drugs for 2 weeks, after phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation. CME incidence was evaluated by assessing retinal foveal thickness changes using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. All patients were treated with a fixed combination of dexamethasone and netilmicin, and some patients were additionally treated with NSAIDs (bromfenac, <b>nepafenac,</b> indomethacin, or diclofenac). Results: Fourteen patients were treated with bromfenac, 15 with <b>nepafenac,</b> 12 with indomethacin, and 14 with diclofenac; ten patients were treated with dexamethasone and netilmicin alone. At the end of the follow-up, macular thickness, evaluated at 1 -week post-surgery, was reduced only in the group treated with <b>nepafenac</b> (− 1. 3 %, p = 0. 048), was increased in the group treated with dexamethasone and netilmicin alone (+ 4. 3 %, p = 0. 04), and did not change in the groups treated with bromfenac (− 1. 1 %, p = 0. 3), indomethacin (+ 0. 1 %, p = 0. 19), or diclofenac (+ 1. 2 %, p = 0. 74). There were no side effects in any group. Conclusions: Topical treatment with <b>nepafenac,</b> bromfenac, and indomethacin enhanced the efficacy of steroids to reduce postoperative macular edema.

Methods: A total of 60 eyes (60 patients) were selected for this study, with no ocular diseases other than cataract (scheduled for cataract surgery by one surgeon). Patients were randomly enrolled to receive <b>nepafenac</b> or diclofenac in the perioperative period, and cataract surgery was performed using torsional microcoaxial phacoemulsification and aspiration with intraocular lens implantation via a transconjunctival single-plane sclerocorneal incision at the 12 o’clock position. We compared intra- and intergroup differences preoperatively and postoperatively in conjunctival and corneal fluorescein staining scores, tear film breakup times, Schirmer’s tests, the Dry Eye Related Quality of Life Scores, and tear meniscus areas using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Results: The diclofenac group had significantly higher conjunctival and corneal fluorescein staining scores at 4 weeks postoperatively compared with the <b>nepafenac</b> group (P< 0. 001). Within the diclofenac group, significantly higher conjunctival and corneal fluorescein staining scores were noted at 4 weeks postoperatively than those seen preoperatively (P< 0. 001) and at 1 week postoperatively (P< 0. 001). No statistically significant differences were found in any other items.

In late 1999 the use of topical ocular NSAIDs declined in the US {{as a result of}} incidents involving corneal melts and toxicity surrounding use of generic diclofenac. However, since the removal of diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution from the marketplace, ophthalmic NSAIDs have regained use as viable pharmacotherapeutic entities. Moreover, several new ophthalmic NSAID products have recently been introduced for commercial use in the US including the novel chemical entity <b>nepafenac.</b> The purpose of this report is to revisit the use of topical ophthalmic NSAIDs for the treatment of surgically induced anterior segment inflammation with a particular focus on <b>nepafenac.</b> <b>Nepafenac</b> is unique among ophthalmic NSAIDs in that it is a prodrug deaminated to amfenac, a highly effective non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor.

30|$|The use of LFCM in the {{evaluation}} of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery has been described in many studies [18 – 20]. LFCM enables assessment of the degree of inflammation by quantitatively measuring such parameters as white blood cell count and protein concentration in the aqueous humor. This study also included secondary endpoints that were evaluated with LFCM. Aqueous cell counts and aqueous flare values as measured with LFCM were significantly lower in the <b>nepafenac</b> than in the placebo group. The mean flare value in the placebo group reached its peak on day  7 while no postoperative increase in flare values was observed in the <b>nepafenac</b> group. Cell scores and flare scores determined by slit lamp biomicroscopy and flare values and cell counts measured with LFCM showed similar patterns of changes over time from day  3 and thereafter, demonstrating the appropriateness of the efficacy evaluation based on cell scores and flare scores determined by slit lamp biomicroscopy and the efficacy of <b>nepafenac</b> in the management of postoperative inflammation.|$|E
30|$|In Japan, the {{ophthalmic}} preparations {{of steroids}} or NSAIDs {{are used for}} the treatment of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery. NSAIDs are also used for the prevention of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME). Diclofenac sodium and bromfenac have been shown to reduce postoperative inflammation [7 – 10]. Some studies have shown that aqueous flare values in the early postoperative period are even lower in those treated with diclofenac sodium than in those treated with steroids [11, 12]. Other studies have demonstrated that NSAIDs are effective in preventing postoperative CME [13 – 16], in which an ophthalmic NSAID was administered for several months after cataract surgery. <b>Nepafenac</b> is a prodrug metabolized into its active form, amfenac. Ex vivo inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by nepafenac/amfenac was significantly greater and of longer duration than diclofenac [2]. And <b>nepafenac</b> had sixfold greater corneal penetration than diclofenac [17]. Amfenac was the more potent COX- 2 inhibitor than bromfenac and ketorolac. And the combined area under the curve of <b>nepafenac</b> and amfenac was higher than the bromfenac and ketorolac [1].|$|E

Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study of 263 adult diabetic patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring cataract surgery. Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to instill <b>nepafenac</b> or vehicle three times daily beginning 1 day prior to surgery through day 90. Efficacy included the percentage of patients who developed macular edema (&ge; 30 % increase in central subfield macular thickness from baseline) and the percentage of patients with decreases of more than five letters in best-corrected visual acuity from day 7 to 90. Results: A significantly lower percentage of patients in the <b>nepafenac</b> group developed macular edema relative to patients in the vehicle group (3. 2 % versus 16. 7 %; P &lt; 0. 001). A significantly lower percentage of patients in the <b>nepafenac</b> group had best-corrected visual acuity decreases of more than five letters relative to patients in the vehicle group on day 30 (P &lt; 0. 001), day 60 (P = 0. 002), and day 90 (P = 0. 006). The mean central subfield macular thickness and mean percent change from baseline in macular volume were also significantly lower in the <b>nepafenac</b> group versus the vehicle group at days 14 through 90 (P &le; 0. 005). No safety issues or trends were identified when dosing was increased to 90 days that negatively impacted the favorable benefit/risk profile of <b>nepafenac.</b> Conclusion: <b>Nepafenac</b> demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant advantages compared with vehicle in preventing macular edema and maintaining visual acuity in diabetic patients following cataract surgery. These advantages were seen at multiple time points over the course of the 90 -day therapy period. There was no clinically relevant increase in risk from 90 days dosing compared with 14 days. Therefore, with a similar safety profile and benefit in preventing macular edema and maintaining vision, the risk/benefit to the diabetic patient undergoing cataract surgery appears to be positive.

Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either bromfenac (n = 10) QD or <b>nepafenac</b> (n = 10) three times daily. Dosing began 3 days before cataract surgery, continuing to day 21 postsurgery. In addition to the investigated nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug regimen, all subjects received antiinfective intraoperative and postoperative standard of care. Subjects were followed at 1 day and 1, 3, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Study visit assessments included best-corrected visual acuity, biomicroscopy, summed ocular inflammation score (anterior chamber cells and flare grading), intraocular pressure measurement, adverse event recording, and concomitant medication review. Optical coherence tomography was performed at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. Results: Both treatment groups had similar baseline measurements. Outcomes for mean letters read (P = 0. 318), mean change in macular volume (P = 0. 665), and retinal thickness (P = 0. 552) were not statistically different between the groups from baseline through week six, although independently only the bromfenac group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in letters gained from baseline to week six (P = 0. 040). In the same time period, mean macular volume and retinal thickening worsened in the <b>nepafenac</b> group, demonstrating a statistically significant increase (P = 0. 006) at week six for macular volume when compared to baseline. One subject in the <b>nepafenac</b> group experienced recurrent inflammation at week six, was unmasked, and then rescued with bromfenac 0. 09 % QD and difluprednate 0. 05 % QD. Conclusion: Both bromfenac and <b>nepafenac</b> resulted in positive clinical outcomes of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuities.
