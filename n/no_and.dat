In the seven months after Dr. No was released, 1.5 million copies of the novel were sold. Worldwide sales of all the Bond books rose throughout the sixties as Dr. <b>No</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent films – From Russia with Love and Goldfinger – were released: in 1961 500,000 books had been sold, which rose to six million in 1964 and seven million in 1965. Between the years 1962 to 1967, a total of nearly 22.8 million Bond novels were sold.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the Scare, {{filmed in}} a North London school, {{consists}} of role-playing scenes with actual teachers.

The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote child protection projects in schools. Although Harris appears in Beyond the Scare, his role is less prominent than in Kids Can Say <b>No!</b> <b>and</b> his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{visits the}} island, where he meets a local shell diver, Honey Ryder. The three are {{attacked}} by No's men, who kill Quarrel using a flame-throwing armoured tractor; Bond and Honey are taken prisoner. Dr. No informs them he {{is a member}} of SPECTRE, the SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion, and he plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam. Bond and Honey escape from the island, killing <b>No</b> <b>and</b> blowing up his lair in the process.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. <b>No</b> <b>and</b> her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E

5|$|Copies of Kids Can Say No! were {{purchased}} by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe.

5|$|Fleming's {{novels and}} early screen adaptations {{presented}} minimal {{equipment such as}} the booby-trapped attaché case in From Russia with Love, although this situation changed dramatically with the films.

5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say <b>No!</b> <b>and</b> therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E

5|$|Production of Skyfall was {{suspended}} throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles. Preproduction resumed following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010; in January 2011, {{the film was}} officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. Subsequently, MGM and Sony Pictures announced that the UK release date would be brought forward to 26 October 2012, two weeks ahead of the US release date, which remained scheduled for 9 November 2012. The film's budget is estimated to have been between US$ and $, compared to the $ spent on Quantum of Solace. Skyfall was part of year-long celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Dr. <b>No</b> <b>and</b> the Bond film series. According to producer Michael G. Wilson, a documentary crew was scheduled to follow production of the film to celebrate the anniversary.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the two Eon Productions Bond films {{released}} prior to {{the writing of the}} novel (Dr. <b>No</b> <b>and</b> From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in the scene of the attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.|$|E

5|$|The film Dr. No was {{released}} in 1962, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and directed by Terence Young. It was the first Bond film in the Eon Productions series; Sean Connery portrayed Bond, with Joseph Wiseman as Doctor <b>No</b> <b>and</b> Ursula Andress as Honeychile Rider. Although the story follows the same general storyline, there are some changes: the film shows No to be an operative of the fictional crime organisation SPECTRE and his island fortress is nuclear-powered; No is killed not by the mountain of guano, but by drowning in reactor coolant. The novel was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in May 2008. The actor Toby Stephens played Bond, while No was played by David Suchet.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained {{on the top of}} the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. <b>No</b> <b>and</b> On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAbdominal {{patterning}} in Drosophila {{requires the}} function of Nanos (<b>nos)</b> <b>and</b> Pumilio (pum) to repress posterior translation of hunchback mRNA. Here we provide the first functional analysis of nanos and pumilio genes during blastodermal patterning of a short-germ insect. We found that <b>nos</b> <b>and</b> pum in {{the red flour beetle}} Tribolium castaneum crucially contribute to posterior segmentation by preventing hunchback translation. While this function seems to be conserved among insects, we provide evidence that <b>Nos</b> <b>and</b> Pum may also act on giant expression, another gap gene. After depletion of <b>nos</b> <b>and</b> pum by parental RNAi, Hunchback and giant remain ectopically at the posterior blastoderm and the posterior Krüppel (Kr) domain is not being activated. giant may be a direct target of Nanos and Pumilio in Tribolium and presumably prevents early Kr expression. In the absence of Kr, the majority of secondary gap gene domains fail to be activated, and abdominal segmentation is terminated prematurely. Surprisingly, we found <b>Nos</b> <b>and</b> Pum also to be involved in early head patterning, as the loss of <b>Nos</b> <b>and</b> Pum results in deletions and transformations of gnathal and pre-gnathal anlagen. Since the targets of <b>Nos</b> <b>and</b> Pum in head development remain to be identified, we propose that anterior patterning in Tribolium may involve additional maternal factors...|$|R
