In cytological studies, we demonstrated that suppressed recombination correlates with an extensive unpaired region at pachytene.

During both the rapid mitosis of syncytial embryos and the more conventional mitosis of larval neuroblasts, Nup 107 is gradually released from the NE, but it remains partially confined to the <b>nuclear</b> (<b>spindle)</b> region up to late prometaphase, in contrast to nucleoporins detected by wheat germ agglutinin and lamins.

During mitotic exit, Mad 2 and Mad 1 are actively imported back from the cytoplasm into the nucleus after the NE and NPCs have reformed, but they reassociate with the NE only later in G 1, concomitantly with the recruitment of the basket nucleoporin Mtor (the Drosophila orthologue of vertebrate Tpr).

We monitored dynamics of green fluorescent protein-labeled nuclei and microtubules over several cell cycles. Early nuclear migration steps such as nuclear positioning and spindle orientation were slightly affected, but late phases such as rapid oscillations and insertion of the anaphase nucleus into the bud neck were mostly absent. Analyzes of microtubule dynamics revealed normal {{behavior of the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spindle</b> but frequent detachment of astral microtubules after SPB separation. Concomitantly, Spc 72 protein, the cytoplasmic anchor for the gamma-tubulin complex, was partially lost from the SPB region with dynamics similar to those observed for microtubules.

However, successful nuclear segregation in cnm 67 Delta cells can still be achieved by elongation forces of spindles that were correctly oriented before astral microtubule detachment by action of Kip 3 /Kar 3 motors.

40|$|Candida albicans is an {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen whose virulence {{is related}} to its ability to switch between yeast, pseudohyphal, and true-hyphal morphologies. To ask how long-distance nuclear migration occurs in C. albicans hyphae, we identified the fundamental properties of nuclear movements and microtubule dynamics using time-lapse microscopy. In hyphae, nuclei migrate to, and divide across, the presumptive site of septation, which forms 10 to 15 μm distal to the basal cell. The mother nucleus returns to the basal cell, while the daughter nucleus reiterates the process. We used time-lapse microscopy to identify the mechanisms by which C. albicans nuclei move over long distances and are coordinated with hyphal morphology. We followed nuclear migration and spindle dynamics, {{as well as the}} time and position of septum specification, defined it as the presumptum, and established a chronology of <b>nuclear,</b> <b>spindle,</b> and morphological events. Analysis of microtubule dynamics revealed that premitotic forward nuclear migration is due to the repetitive sliding of astral microtubules along the cell cortex but that postmitotic forward and reverse nuclear migrations are due primarily to spindle elongation. Free microtubules exhibit cell cycle regulation; they are present during interphase and disappear at the time of spindle assembly. Finally, a growth defect in strains expressing Tub 2 -green fluorescent protein revealed a connection between hyphal elongation and the nuclear cell cycle that is coordinated by hyphal length and/or volume...|$|E

For this purpose we studied the final products of oocyte meiosis at the first cleavage division of multipronuclear zygotes arising after ICSI, and compared the results with abnormally fertilized oocytes after conventional in-vitro insemination. Of 37 successfully analysed tripronuclear zygotes, 18 had three individual metaphases. Abnormal complements of 11 zygotes in this group indicated that non-disjunction occurred predominantly at the second meiotic division of the oocytes. Nine of the 37 tripronuclear zygotes exhibited two individual metaphases. Seven were abnormal and there were some indications that non-disjunction took place during oocyte meiosis. Of the 37 tripronuclear zygotes, 10 had a single metaphase and three showed an aneuploid number of chromosomes. The overall rate of aneuploidy among tripronuclear microinjected zygotes was 56. 7 %. In addition, seven zygotes with more than three pronuclei arising after ICSI displayed severely depleted chromosome complements. The incidence of non-disjunction in oocytes fertilized by conventional in-vitro insemination was significantly lower (20. 0 %, P < 0. 01), since only four zygotes had an aneuploid number of chromosomes.

50|$|HAP1 {{cells are}} {{malignant}} neoplastic cells, {{also known as}} cancer cells. These cells are characterized primarily by uninhibited growth. As the rate of mitosis increases, defects in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spindles</b> form, which results in atypical chromosomes, such as those found in HAP1 cells. Due to their irregular chromosomes, malignant cells are also morphologically different from healthy cells. These cells are often irregular shapes and sizes. They have large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and scarce or atypically colored cytoplasm. Ribosomes and mRNA accumulate in the cytoplasm and membrane bound organelles change in shape, size, and function. Some become larger than normal, greatly reduced, or entirely non-existent. HAP1 cells are derived from leukemic cells, which develop from mutated myeloid cells in the bone marrow.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} a novel {{role for the}} Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) in spindle positioning {{and stability in the}} early C. elegans embryo. Within the embryo the ER is intimately associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton and I show that the disruption of this association leads to instability of <b>nuclear</b> and <b>spindle</b> positioning. I first describe RNA interference screens that I performed to identify new genes involved in the regulation of spindle positioning. This led to the identification of three ER resident proteins that comprise C. elegans homologs of the Oligosaccharyl Transferase (OST) complex. Through characterisation of the spindle phenotypes induced by knockdown of OST components, I show that these proteins are similar to a diverse collection of mutants affecting the ER, such as the trans-membrane ER protein, ooc- 3 and the npp (nuclear pore protein) genes. I found that identical <b>nuclear</b> and <b>spindle</b> instability phenotypes could be replicated by using the drug Brefeldin A to rapidly disrupt the ER, suggesting the ER might have a structural role in stabilizing <b>nuclear</b> and <b>spindle</b> position. I also provide evidence suggesting that the association between the ER and the microtubule cytoskeleton involves Clathrin heavy-chain (CHC). CHC may form part of the link between the ER and microtubule networks. Overall my results describe a role for the reticular ER network in stabilizing the assembling mitotic spindle and a potential new role for clathrin in linking the ER and microtubules.

40|$|Microtubules form a {{multifunctional}} filamentous structure {{essential for}} the cell. In interphase, microtubules form networks in the cytoplasm and play pivotal roles in cell polarity and intracellular transport of various biomolecules. In mitosis, microtubules dramatically change their morphology to assemble the mitotic spindle, thereby pulling the chromosomes toward the spindle poles. One long-standing question is how microtubules are reorganized upon mitotic entry. Yeast cells undergo closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope persists, whereas higher eukaryotes undergo open mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope breaks down. Microtubule reorganization must be controlled by selective localization of microtubule-assembly factors. Recent findings in fission yeast indicate that several microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus through regulation by Ran GTPase, the universal organizer of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Furthermore, the synergistic interplay of Ran and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) induces the critical spatiotemporal shift of modes in microtubule assembly from cytoplasmic arrays to <b>nuclear</b> <b>spindles.</b> A MAP complex Alp 7 /TACC-Alp 14 /TOG undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in interphase, whereas it is retained in the mitotic nucleus through a decrease of its nuclear export by CDK. Our understanding of how microtubules are reorganized during the cell cycle is beginning to emerge...|$|R
40|$|Nucleolar spindle {{associated}} protein (NuSAP) is a microtubule-stabilizing {{protein that}} localizes to chromosome arms and chromosome-proximal microtubules during mitosis {{and to the}} nucleus, with enrichment in the nucleoli, during interphase. The critical function of NuSAP is underscored by the finding that its depletion in HeLa cells results in various mitotic defects. Moreover, NuSAP is found overexpressed in multiple cancers and its expression levels often correlate with the aggressiveness of cancer. Due to its localization on chromosome arms and combination of microtubule-stabilizing and DNA-binding properties, NuSAP takes a special place within the extensive group of spindle assembly factors. In this study, we identify a SAP-like domain that shows DNA binding in vitro with a preference for dsDNA. Deletion of the SAP-like domain abolishes chromosome arm binding of NuSAP during mitosis, but {{is not sufficient to}} abrogate its chromosome-proximal localization after anaphase onset. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments revealed the highly dynamic nature of this NuSAP-chromatin interaction during mitosis. In interphase cells, NuSAP also interacts with chromatin through its SAP-like domain, as evident from its enrichment on dense chromatin regions and intranuclear mobility, measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The obtained results are in agreement with a model where NuSAP dynamically stabilizes newly formed microtubules on mitotic chromosomes to enhance chromosome positioning without immobilizing these microtubules. Interphase NuSAP-chromatin interaction suggests additional functions for NuSAP, as recently identified for other <b>nuclear</b> <b>spindle</b> assembly factors with a role in gene expression or DNA damage response. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Xpo 1 is the orthologue of {{the nuclear}} {{transport}} receptor Crm 1 in the budding yeast Sac-charomyces cerevisiae. In higher eukaryotes, Crm 1 exports proteins such as the transcription factor AP- 1 or the tumor suppressor p 53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. A role of Crm 1 in messenger RNA export is discussed contoversely. In contrast, Xpo 1 is involved in protein and mRNA export in the budding yeast. Despite Xpo 1 's essential function, only few transport substrates have been identified so far. Xpo 1 binds in the nucleus cooperatively to cargo molecules containing a nuclear export sequence (NES) and to the GTPase Ran/Gsp 1, which exists in the nucleus in its GTP-bound form. After passage through the nuclear pore, factors localized in the cytoplasm trigger the hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP. This causes a conformational change which leads to cargo release. Unloaded Xpo 1 travels back into the nucleus. Nuclear transport receptors and Ran {{also play a role}} in the formation of a bipolar spindle: in higher eukaryotes, Crm 1 is involved in the control of centrosome duplication, and the localization of Ran-GTP at the chromosomes promotes the formation of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spindle.</b> In the present work, at first the importance of the different Xpo 1 domains in protein and mRNA export was analyzed by introducing several mutations in the XPO 1 coding region. The resulting xpo 1 alleles showed various defects in protein and mRNA export, but a clear correlation between the observed defects and the alterations in the protein se-quence was not obvious. To identify new proteins interacting with Xpo 1, an undirected 2 -hybrid assay was performed. Among other proteins Spc 72 was found, a component of the spindle pole body, the functional equivalent of the centrosomes in the budding yeast. Spc 72 anchors the γ-tubulin complex from which microtubules polymerize at the cytosolic face of the spindle pole body. By analogy of Crm 1 binding to centrosomes in mammalian cells, the localization of Xpo 1 was determined. Also in the budding yeast, Xpo 1 can be found at the spindle pole bodies, and this localization can be affected by changing the Ran status of the cell. However, Xpo 1 's localization is not solely dependent on Spc 72 as it still binds to the spindle pole bodies in a SPC 72 deletion strain. The interaction of Xpo 1 with Spc 72 was analyzed further by in vitro binding assays. Xpo 1, Spc 72, and Ran-GTP form a trimeric complex that fulfills the criteria of a nuclear export complex. A NES could be identified in Spc 72 and its function was confirmed by a 2 -hybrid assay and reporter plasmid assays. Mutations in this NES decrease the amount of Spc 72 at the spindle pole bodies in the cell and cause a reduction of cytoplasmic microtubules. This phenotype was also observed in Xpo 1 alleles. This work shows first hints to a functional interaction between Xpo 1 and Spc 72 in the cell that is dependent on the NES of Spc 72. Moreover, a localization of Xpo 1 at the spindle pole bodies in the budding yeast was proved for the first time. Xpo 1 could participate in processes such as spindle pole body duplication, regulation of microtubule polymerisation or distribution of the γ-tubulin complex...|$|E
40|$|Fission yeast has two kinesin- 8 s, Klp 5 and Klp 6, which {{associate}} {{to form a}} heterocomplex. Here, we show that Klp 5 and Klp 6 are mutually dependent on each other for nuclear mitotic localization. During interphase, they are exported to the cytoplasm. In sharp contrast, during mitosis, Klp 5 and Klp 6 remain in the nucleus, which requires the existence of each counterpart. Canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) is identified in the nonkinesin C-terminal regions. Intriguingly individual NLS mutants (NLSmut) exhibit loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that Klp 5 and Klp 6 enter the nucleus separately. Indeed, although neither Klp 5 -NLSmut nor Klp 6 -NLSmut enters the nucleus, wild-type Klp 6 or Klp 5, respectively, does so with different kinetics. In the absence of Klp 5 / 6, microtubule catastrophe/rescue frequency and dynamicity are suppressed, whereas growth and shrinkage rates are least affected. Remarkably, chimera strains containing only the N-terminal Klp 5 kinesin domains cannot disassemble interphase microtubules during mitosis, leading to the coexistence of cytoplasmic microtubules and <b>nuclear</b> <b>spindles</b> with massive chromosome missegregation. In this strain, a marked reduction of microtubule dynamism, even higher than in klp 5 / 6 deletions, is evident.

Microtubule-based motor proteins of the kinesin and dynein families generate the forces needed for spindle elongation during anaphase, but no motors have been identified which mediate <b>nuclear</b> migration and <b>spindle</b> orientation during interphase. In addition, it is unknown how multiple motors interact to elicit anaphase spindle elongation. Here we have employed genetic and cytological methods in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to explore the role of kinesin-related Kip 3 p in interphase <b>nuclear</b> and <b>spindle</b> movements, and to investigate the relative contributions of kinesin-related Kip 1 p and Cin 8 p to anaphase spindle elongation. To determine the function of KIP 3, we deleted the gene and examined the <b>nuclear</b> and <b>spindle</b> morphology by fixed and live cell microscopy. KIP 3 was essential for nuclear migration to the cleavage site and spindle orientation along the division axis. Comparison of the kip 3 mutant with a dynein mutant defined two stages of nuclear/spindle positioning, a Kip 3 p-mediated interphase stage and a dynein-mediated anaphase stage. Simultaneous loss of KIP 3 and kinesin-related KAR 3, or of KIP 3 and dynein was lethal suggesting that these motors perform overlapping or dependent functions. Kip 1 p and Cin 8 p were originally identified as motors required for metaphase spindle assembly. Since kip 1 cin 8 mutants never entered anaphase, their anaphase contribution was not characterized. We identified new kip 1 cin 8 mutants and growth conditions in which spindle assembly occurred, enabling us to investigate the anaphase function of these motors by live cell microscopy. The anaphase kinetics of kip 1 cin 8, cin 8 and wild type cells suggested that Cin 8 p functions during all stages of anaphase, whereas Kip 1 p primarily functions during later stages. Together, these studies reveal that accurate chromosome segregation results from overlapping and sequentially acting motor proteins. ...|$|R

The addition of Ran–guanosine diphosphate and an energy source, which generates Ran–guanosine triphosphate (GTP) locally at mitotic chromosomes, enhanced the importin-β–mediated chromosome loading of hKid. Our results indicate that the association of importin-β and -α with hKid triggers the initial targeting of hKid to mitotic chromosomes and that local Ran-GTP–mediated cargo release promotes the accumulation of hKid on chromosomes.

40|$|AbstractThe Ran GTPase is {{required}} for nuclear assembly, <b>nuclear</b> transport, <b>spindle</b> assembly, and mitotic regulation. While the first three processes are relatively well understood, details of Ran's role in mitotic progression remain obscure. We have found that elevated levels of Ran's exchange factor (RCC 1) abrogate the spindle assembly checkpoint in Xenopus egg extracts, restore APC/C activity, and disrupt the kinetochore localization of checkpoint regulators, including Mad 2, CENP-E, Bub 1, and Bub 3. Depletion of Ran's GTPase activating protein (RanGAP 1) and its accessory factor (RanBP 1) similarly abrogates checkpoint arrest. By contrast, the addition of RanGAP 1 and RanBP 1 to extracts with exogenous RCC 1 restores the spindle checkpoint. Together, these observations suggest that the spindle checkpoint is directly responsive to Ran-GTP levels. Finally, we observe a clear wave of RCC 1 association to mitotic chromosomes at the metaphase-anaphase transition in normal cycling extracts, suggesting that this mechanism has {{an important role in}} unperturbed cell cycles...|$|R

40|$|Formins are {{a family}} of conserved {{proteins}} that assemble unbranched actin filaments. In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the formin isoforms Bni 1 p and Bnr 1 p are vital for nucleating and elongating the essential actin cables to guide polarized growth. Here I demonstrate {{that there are three}} localization regions in the Nterminal domain of Bni 1 p: one in the N-terminal 333 amino acids which requires dimerization, one in the region encompassed by amino acids 334 - 834 which covers the DID-DD-CC domains, and the third in the Spa 2 p binding domain. The three localization regions can each localize to the bud cortex and bud neck independently of endogenous Bni 1 p at the right stage of the cell cycle. Bni 1 p truncations with internal regions of the N-terminal half deleted confirm that the N-terminal domain is important for localization. Cells with delocalized Bni 1 p truncations have misoriented cables, defects in <b>nuclear</b> movement and <b>spindle</b> orientation, with the extent of these phenotypes varying in accordance with how much of the N-terminal region is truncated. Defects in <b>nuclear</b> movement and <b>spindle</b> orientation are due to the Bni 1 p truncations assembling actin cables at the wrong place. Thus, although the N-terminal localization regions of Bni 1 p are not needed for the viability of cells, they are needed for proper functions of formins...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{development}} is severely defective {{in children with}} lissencephaly. The highly organized distribution of neurons within the cerebral cortex is disrupted, a condition that might arise from improper migration of neuronal progenitors to their cortical destinations. Type I lissencephaly results from mutations in the LIS 1 gene, which has been implicated in the cytoplasmic dynein and platelet-activating factor pathways. Recent studies have identified roles for the product of LIS 1 in <b>nuclear</b> migration, mitotic <b>spindle</b> orientation and chromosome alignment, where it appears to act in concert with cytoplasmic dynein. A unifying hypothesis for the subcellular function of LIS 1 is presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{putative}} spindle matrix {{has been}} hypothesized to mediate chromosome motion, but its existence and functionality remain controversial. In this report, {{we show that}} Megator (Mtor), the Drosophila melanogaster counterpart of the human nuclear pore complex protein translocated promoter region (Tpr), and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein Mad 2 form a conserved complex that localizes to a <b>nuclear</b> derived <b>spindle</b> matrix in living cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments supports that Mtor is retained around spindle microtubules, where it shows distinct dynamic properties. Mtor/Tpr promotes the recruitment of Mad 2 and Mps 1 but not Mad 1 to unattached kinetochores (KTs), mediating normal mitotic duration and SAC response. At anaphase, Mtor {{plays a role in}} spindle elongation, thereby affecting normal chromosome movement. We propose that Mtor/Tpr functions as a spatial regulator of the SAC, which ensures the efficient recruitment of Mad 2 to unattached KTs at the onset of mitosis and proper spindle maturation, whereas enrichment of Mad 2 in a spindle matrix helps confine the action of a diffusible “wait anaphase” signal to the vicinity of the spindle...|$|R
40|$|RCC 1 is {{the only}} known {{exchange}} factor for the Ran guanosine triphosphatase and performs essential roles in <b>nuclear</b> transport, <b>spindle</b> organization, and <b>nuclear</b> envelope formation. RCC 1 binds to chromatin through a bimodal attachment to DNA and histones, and defects in binding cause chromosome missegregation. Chromatin binding is enhanced by apo-Ran. However, the mechanism underlying this regulation has been unclear. We now demonstrate that the N-terminal tail of RCC 1 is essential for association with DNA but inhibits histone binding. Apo-Ran significantly promotes RCC 1 binding to both DNA and histones, and these effects are tail mediated. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor, we detect conformational changes in the tail of RCC 1 coupled to the two binding modes {{and in response to}} interactions with Ran and importin-α. The biosensor also reports changes accompanying mitosis in living cells. We propose that Ran induces an allosteric conformational switch in the tail that exposes the histone-binding surface on RCC 1 and facilitates association of the positively charged tail with DNA...|$|R
40|$|The γ-tubulin complex, via {{its ability}} to {{organize}} microtubules, is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. To better understand its roles, we have purified the S. pombe γ-tubulin complex. Mass spectrometric analyses of the purified complex revealed known components and identified two novel proteins (i. e., Mbo 1 p and Gfh 1 p) with homology to γ-tubulin–associated proteins from other organisms. We show that both Mbo 1 p and Gfh 1 p localize to microtubule organizing centers. Although cells deleted for either mbo 1 + or gfh 1 + are viable, they exhibit a number of defects associated with altered microtubule function such as defects in cell polarity, <b>nuclear</b> positioning, <b>spindle</b> orientation, and cleavage site specification. In addition, mbo 1 Δ and gfh 1 Δ cells exhibit defects in astral microtubule formation and anchoring, suggesting that these proteins have specific roles in astral microtubule function. This study expands the known roles of γ-tubulin complex components in organizing different types of microtubule structures in S. pombe...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative nuclei of fungi Ceratocystis fagacearum and Fusarium oxysporum {{were studied}} {{both in the}} living {{condition}} with phase-contrast microscopy and after fixation and staining by HCI-Giemsa, aceto-orcein, and acid fuchsin techniques. Nucleoli, chromosomes, centrioles, <b>spindles,</b> and <b>nuclear</b> envelopes were seen in living hyphae of both fungi. The entire division process occurred within an intact <b>nuclear</b> envelope. <b>Spindles</b> were produced between separating daughter centrioles. At metaphase the chromosomes became attached to the spindle at different points. In F. oxysporum the metaphase chromosomes were clear enough to allow counts to be made, and longitudinal splitting of the chromosomes into chromatids was observed. Anaphase was characterized in both fungi by separation of chromosomes to poles established by the centrioles, and in F. oxysporum anaphase separation of chromosomes was observed in vivo. Continued elongation of the spindles further separated the daughter nuclei. Maturing daughter nuclei of both fungi were quite motile; and in C. fagacearum the centriole preceded {{the bulk of the}} nucleus during migration. The above observations on living cells were corroborated by observations on fixed and stained material...|$|R
