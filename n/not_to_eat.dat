5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|Some foods {{were also}} off-limits, as the Tang court {{encouraged}} people <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> beef (since the bull was a valuable working animal), and from 831 to 833 Emperor Wenzong of Tang even banned {{the slaughter of}} cattle {{on the grounds of}} his religious convictions to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|The {{finding of}} high mercury levels {{prompted}} further studies and a health advisory warning hunters <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> common goldeneye or northern shoveler, {{two species of}} duck found in the lake. It has been stated that this does not pose a risk to other recreational users of the lake.|$|E
50|$|There {{are certain}} food women are allowed <b>to</b> and are <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> during {{pregnancy}} and labor, {{as they could}} have a lasting effect of the child’s health. For example, women are <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> eggs.|$|R

25|$|One may not {{conclude}} the Passover meal with dainties. If {{some of the}} party fell asleep, they could eat when they awoke, but if all fell asleep, they were <b>not</b> permitted <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Rabbi Jose said that if they slept only lightly, they could eat, but if they fell fast asleep, they were <b>not</b> permitted <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b>|$|R
5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums tend <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{the leaves}} of the tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Poisonous {{sausages}} containing toad meat {{are being}} trialled in the Kimberley (Western Australia) {{to try to}} protect native animals from cane toads' deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation has been working with the University of Sydney to develop baits to train native animals <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals {{to stay away from the}} amphibians. Researcher David Pearson says trials run in laboratories and in remote parts of the Kimberley region of WA are looking promising, although the baits will not solve the cane toad problem altogether.|$|E

25|$|Meat {{is part of}} {{the human}} diet in most cultures, where it often has {{symbolic}} meaning and important social functions. Many people, however, choose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> meat (this is referred to as vegetarianism) or any food made from animals (veganism). The reasons for not eating all or some meat may include ethical objections to killing animals for food, health concerns, environmental concerns or religious dietary laws.|$|E
25|$|On November 3, student Jonathan Butler {{launched}} a hunger strike, vowing <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> until the president resigned. One of Butler's stated {{reasons for this}} was that Wolfe's car had hit him during a protest against Wolfe at the school's homecoming parade. As students confronted the president by linking {{arms in front of}} his vehicle, video showed Butler advancing towards the vehicle and making minimal contact. No police charges were filed in connection to the incident.|$|E
25|$|The {{patient is}} kept NPO (Nil per os) or NBM (Nothing By Mouth) that is, told <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> {{for at least}} 4 hours before the procedure. Most {{patients}} tolerate the procedure with only topical anesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed.|$|E
