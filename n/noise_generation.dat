40|$|The LF 336 /E is a 36 inch (0. 914 meter) {{diameter}} fan {{designed to}} operate in a rotor-alone configuration. Design features required for modification of the existing LF 336 /A rotor-stator fan into the LF 336 /E statorless fan configuration are discussed. Tests of the statorless fan identified an aerodynamic performance deficiency due to inaccurate accounting of the fan exit swirl during the aerodynamic design. This performance deficiency, related to fan exit static pressure levels, produced about a 20 percent thrust loss. A study was then conducted for further evaluation of the fan exit flow fields typical of statorless fan systems. This study showed that through proper selection of fan design variables such as pressure ratio, radius ratio, and swirl distributions, performance of a statorless fan configuration could be improved with levels of thrust approaching the conventional rotor-stator fan system. Acoustic measurements were taken for the statorless fan system at both GE and NASA, and {{when compared to other}} lift fan systems, showed noise levels comparable to the quietest lift fan configuration which included rotor-stator spacing and acoustic treatment. The statorless fan system was also used to determine effects of rotor leading edge serrations on <b>noise</b> <b>generations.</b> A cascade test program identified the serration geometry based on minimum pressure losses, wake turbulence levels and <b>noise</b> <b>generations...</b>|$|R

The H160 {{is the first}} civilian helicopter to utilise a canted fenestron anti-torque tail rotor. The H160 will be powered by two Turbomeca Arrano turboshaft engines; a second engine, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210E, was to be offered as an alternative option, but this was eliminated due to insufficient power output and to reduce design complexity.

40|$|Abstract—A 0. 7 – 2 -GHz precise {{multiphase}} delay-locked loop (DLL) using {{a digital}} calibration circuit is presented. Incorporating with the proposed digital calibration circuit, the mismatch-induced timing error among multiphase clocks {{in the proposed}} DLL can be self-calibrated. When the calibration procedure is finished, the digital calibration circuit can be turned off automatically to save power dissipations and reduce <b>noise</b> <b>generations.</b> A start controlled circuit is proposed to enlarge the operating frequency range of the DLL. Both the start-controlled circuit and the calibration circuit require an external reset signal to ensure the correctness of the calibration after temperature, operating frequency, and power supply voltage are settled. This DLL with the digital calibration circuit has been fabricated in a 0. 18 - m CMOS process. The measured results show the DLL exhibits a lock range of 0. 7 – 2 GHz while the peak-to-peak jitter and rms jitter is 18. 9 ps and 2. 5 ps at 2 GHz, respectively. When the calibration procedure is completed and the DLL operates at 1 GHz, the maximum mismatch-induced timing error among multiphase clocks is reduced from 20. 4 ps (7. 34 degree) to 3. 5 ps (1. 26 degree).

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} survey, various methods for the {{acoustic}} design of aeroengine nacelle are first briefly introduced {{along with the}} comments on their advantages and disadvantages for practical application, and then detailed analysis and discussion focus {{on a kind of}} new method which is called “transfer element method” (TEM) with emphasis on its application in the following three problems: turbomachinery <b>noise</b> <b>generations,</b> sound transmission in ducts and radiation from the inlet and outlet of ducts, as well as the interaction between them. In the theoretical frame of the TEM, the solution of acoustic field in an infinite duct with stator sound source or liner is extended to that in a finite domain with all knows and unknowns on the interface plane, and the relevant acoustic field is solved by setting up matching equation. In addition, based on combining the TEM with the boundary element method (BEM) by establishing the pressure and its derivative continuum conditions on the inlet and outlet surface, the sound radiation from the inlet and outlet of ducts can also be investigated. Finally, the effects of various interactions between the sound source and acoustic treatment have been discussed in this survey. The numerical examples indicate that it is quite important to consider the effect of such interactions on sound attenuation during the acoustic design of aeroengine nacelle...|$|R
