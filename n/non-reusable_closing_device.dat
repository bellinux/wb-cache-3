After a brief discussion of the concept of closing as it is used in conversation analytic research, the paper presents syntactic, lexical and prosodic resources that may occur when a topic and/or a sequence is being closed. It is shown that left-dislocations, which partake in such a closing are often rhythmically structured: this observation leads us to argue that rhythm functions as a contextualization cue signaling an upcoming topical/sequential closing. Moreover, we will compare rhythmical left-dislocations to another recurrent topic <b>closing</b> <b>device,</b> i. e. figurative expressions. The comparison will show different similarities between the two <b>closing</b> <b>devices,</b> with regard to their sequential treatments as well as to their pragmatic effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} technology electrochemical machining (ECM) finds numerous applications in industrial production. Especially for shaping and surface structuring of metals by controlled anodic dissolution {{the process is}} used. The advantages of ECM are mainly the high removal rates, the slight influence on the work piece material structure and the independence of material strength and hardness. Thus ECM is advantage compared to metal cutting manufacturing processes. Precise electrochemical machining (PEM) is an innovative machining technology which results from further development of the electrochemical sinking. PEM works with pulsed low frequency direct current and oscillation of the tool electrode. It enables the manufacturing of tools and machine elements with high precision requirements and reproduction accuracy. [1, 2] With PEM actually the manufacturing of structure sizes < 1 mm and flatness < 5 µm by front surface machining is possible. As {{part of the project}} ‘Electrochemical machining of internal precision and micro-geometries with high aspect ratios by process-state-dependent electrolyte management‘ (ElAs) the aim is to develop a new combination of high pressure flush and a flexible electrode concept. Filigreed electrodes with structure elements smaller than 0. 2 mm are targeted for the aimed manufacturing of big aspect ratios. Moreover inner micro structures are obstacle by them self for the needed electrolyte flush in the working cap. Due to this the manufacturing process has to be qualified to a non-flux of electrolyte at the dissolution process. Interaction between conduction and the geometry of the electrodes should be avoided. Therefore a <b>closed</b> process <b>device</b> has to be developed which is able to admit a defined pressure charge. By concerted modifications the oscillation inducted effect of compression should become accessible as input parameter for the process. Experimental research of model geometries regarding to the electrode shape, the inducted compression, the precision, the surface and the current efficiency are content of the project. Multiphysics simulations are applied to characterise the modified process. For the simulation of the electrolyte flow in the <b>closed</b> <b>device</b> COMSOL MultiphysicsTM is used. To get use of the simulation software a suitable model geometry had to be deducted and initial values were defined. The <b>closed</b> <b>device</b> has a cylindrical shape with connections for the electrolyte supply. Thus the device isn’t rotationally symmetric. The electrolyte flow results from interaction of the transverse flow and the tool electrode oscillation. One challenge is to develop a model which fits the geometric requirements of the <b>closed</b> <b>device</b> and even the requirements for simulation. The numerical simulations of high turbulent flows are really sophisticated and a lot of computing power is needed [3]. Therefore the simulation was designed in a 2 -dimensional environment and the geometric specifications were adjusted accordingly to comply with these claims. By solving a transient model of turbulent flow the field of velocity in the <b>closed</b> <b>device</b> could be shown. It can be recognized that the field of velocity in the <b>closed</b> <b>device</b> is highly turbulent with many random vortexes. This is due to the interaction of oscillating velocity at the upper edge of the model and the transverse flux in the <b>closed</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a comprehensive analytical framework with foundations in stochastic geometry {{to characterize the}} performance of cluster-centric content placement in a cache-enabled device-to-device (D 2 D) network. Different from device-centric content placement, cluster-centric placement focuses on placing content in each cluster such that the collective performance of all the devices in each cluster is optimized. Modeling {{the locations of the}} devices by a Poisson cluster process, we define and analyze the performance for three general cases: (i) k-Tx case: receiver of interest is chosen uniformly at random in a cluster and its content of interest is available at the k^th <b>closest</b> <b>device</b> to the cluster center, (ii) ℓ-Rx case: receiver of interest is the ℓ^th <b>closest</b> <b>device</b> to the cluster center and its content of interest is available at a device chosen uniformly at random from the same cluster, and (iii) baseline case: the receiver of interest is chosen uniformly at random in a cluster and its content of interest is available at a device chosen independently and uniformly at random from the same cluster. Easy-to-use expressions for the key performance metrics, such as coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the whole network, are derived for all three cases. Our analysis concretely demonstrates significant improvement in the network performance when the device on which content is cached or device requesting content from cache is biased to lie closer to the cluster center compared to baseline case. Based on this insight, we develop and analyze a new generative model for cluster-centric D 2 D networks that allows to study the effect of intra-cluster interfering devices that are more likely to lie closer to the cluster center.
