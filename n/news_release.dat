Bowers believes this film was shot during the winter and kept for its later June release. The winter of 1909 through 1910 contained two notable snow events that might have possibly been used in the production. A major snow storm from December 25 to December 26, 1909, would make its way through New York City with snow total of about 10 inches and wind gusts up to 58mph. A second major snow event occurred three weeks later, on January 14 through 15, 1910, with New York City getting 15 inches of snow. Another lesser snow event, deemed a blizzard in the press, was recorded in early February.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} impact of {{high-frequency}} public news sentiment on intraday return volatility of the constituent stocks in the Tokyo Stock Exchange over the period from January 2000 to December 2012. By using textual and linguistic analytical techniques, we compute the various sentiment scores for all the intraday firm-specific <b>news</b> <b>releases</b> obtained from Dow Jones Newswires. The results show that intraday volatility persistence is significantly reduced after incorporating the effects of firm-specific <b>news</b> <b>releases</b> and their sentiment scores. Compared with positive news, {{the impact of}} <b>news</b> <b>releases</b> with negative sentiment on future intraday volatility levels is higher. These findings highlight the importance of public news sentiment on examining high-frequency volatility dynamics...|$|R

25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a <b>news</b> <b>release</b> announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E
