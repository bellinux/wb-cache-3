5|$|Provence {{urged the}} king to act {{strongly}} against the declaration, while the king's popular minister Jacques <b>Necker</b> intended to {{compromise with the}} new assembly. Louis XVI was characteristically indecisive. On 9 July, the assembly declared itself a National Constituent Assembly that would give France a Constitution. On 11 July, Louis XVI dismissed <b>Necker,</b> which led to widespread rioting across Paris. On 12 July, the sabre charge of the cavalry regiment of Charles-Eugène de Lorraine, prince de Lambesc, on a crowd gathered at the Tuileries gardens, sparked the Storming of the Bastille two days later.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques <b>Necker</b> and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E

60|$|Andre-Louis was in {{the gardens}} of the Palais Royal, that place of shops and puppet-shows, of circus and cafes, of gaming houses and brothels, that {{universal}} rendezvous, on that Sunday morning when the news of <b>Necker's</b> dismissal spread, carrying with it dismay and fury. Into <b>Necker's</b> dismissal the people read {{the triumph of the}} party hostile to themselves. It sounded the knell of all hope of redress of their wrongs.|$|R
25|$|Events soon overtook <b>Necker's</b> complex {{scheme of}} {{giving in to}} the Communes on some points while holding firm on others. No longer {{interested}} in <b>Necker's</b> advice, Louis XVI, {{under the influence of}} the courtiers of his privy council, resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On June 19, he ordered the Salle des États, the hall where the National Assembly met, closed, and remained at Marly for several days while he prepared his address.|$|R
5|$|While {{approaching}} the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Neki weakened to tropical storm status. Continued wind shear exposed the circulation from the convection, although further weakening {{was slow to}} occur. On October24, Neki made its closest approach to land after passing within 13mi (21km) of the uninhabited <b>Necker</b> Island. Its forward motion slowed due to a building ridge to the north, causing the storm to execute a small loop. Despite the shear, Neki was initially able to continue developing thunderstorms, although cooler water temperatures resulted in further weakening. The storm resumed its northward motion after the ridge receded to the east, and on October26 Neki weakened to a tropical depression once the circulation decoupled from the thunderstorms. The next day it dissipated as the center became elongated ahead of an approaching cold front.|$|E

25|$|By this time, <b>Necker</b> {{had earned}} the enmity of {{many members of}} the French court for his overt {{manipulation}} of public opinion. Marie Antoinette, the King's younger brother the Comte d'Artois, and other conservative members of the King's privy council urged him to dismiss <b>Necker</b> as financial advisor. On 11 July 1789, after <b>Necker</b> published an inaccurate account of the government's debts and made it available to the public, the King fired him, and completely restructured the finance ministry at the same time.|$|E

25|$|<b>Necker</b> {{was born}} in Geneva, at that time an {{independent}} republic. His father, Karl Friedrich <b>Necker,</b> {{was a native of}} Küstrin in Neumark, Prussia (now Kostrzyn nad Odrą, Poland). After the publication of some works on international law, he was elected a professor of public law at Geneva, of which he became a citizen. Jacques <b>Necker</b> was sent to Paris in 1747 to become a clerk in the bank of Isaac Vernet, a friend of his father. In 1762, he became a partner and by 1765, he had become very wealthy through successful financial speculations. Soon, he co-founded the bank of Thellusson, <b>Necker</b> et Compagnie with another Genevese, Peter Thellusson. Thellusson (also known as Pierre Thellusson) superintended the bank in London (his son was made a peer as Baron Rendlesham), while <b>Necker</b> was managing partner in Paris. Both partners became very rich by means of loans to the French treasury and speculations in grain.|$|E

He also translated Jacques <b>Necker's</b> Treatise on the Finances of France, London 3 vols., 1785.|$|R
2500|$|Lastly, {{in matters}} of finance, he {{attacked}} <b>Necker's</b> [...] "caisse d'escompte", which {{was to have the}} whole control of the taxes, as usurping the Assembly's power of the purse, and heartily approved of the system of assignats, with the reservation that the issue should be limited to no more than one-half the value of the lands to be sold.|$|R
50|$|What Is the Third Estate? (Qu'est-ce que le tiers-état?) is a {{political}} pamphlet written in January 1789, shortly before {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution, by the French thinker and clergyman Abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (1748-1836). The pamphlet was Sieyès' response to finance minister Jacques <b>Necker's</b> invitation for writers to state how they thought the Estates-General should be organized.|$|R
25|$|In 1763, <b>Necker</b> fell in {{love with}} Madame de Verménou, the widow of a French officer. But while on a visit to Geneva, Madame de Verménou met Suzanne Curchod, who was the {{daughter}} of a pastor near Lausanne and had been engaged to Edward Gibbon. In 1764, Madame de Verménou brought Suzanne to Paris as her companion. There <b>Necker,</b> transferring his love from the wealthy widow to the poor Swiss girl, married Suzanne {{before the end of the}} year. On 22 April 1766, they had a daughter, Anne Louise Germaine <b>Necker,</b> who became a renowned author under the name of Madame de Staël.|$|E
25|$|This was not {{received}} well by the King's ministers, and <b>Necker,</b> hoping {{to bolster his}} position, argued to be made a minister. The King refused, <b>Necker</b> was dismissed, and Charles Alexandre de Calonne {{was appointed to the}} Comptrollership. Calonne initially spent liberally, but he quickly realised the critical financial situation and proposed a new tax code.|$|E

5000|$|Lastly, {{in matters}} of finance, he {{attacked}} <b>Necker's</b> [...] "caisse d'escompte", which {{was to have the}} whole control of the taxes, as usurping the Assembly's power of the purse, and heartily approved of the system of assignats, with the reservation that the issue should be limited to no more than one-half the value of the lands to be sold.|$|R
5000|$|In 1788, Louis XVI of France {{proposed}} the convocation of the Estates-General of France after an interval {{of more than}} a century and a half. This proposal, and Jacques <b>Necker's</b> invitation to French writers to state their views as to the organization of society by Estates, enabled Sieyès to publish his celebrated January 1789 pamphlet, Qu'est-ce que le tiers-état? (What Is the Third Estate?) He begins his answer: ...|$|R
6000|$|... [130] I see by M. <b>Necker's</b> account, {{that the}} {{national}} guards of Paris have received, {{over and above the}} money levied within their own city, about 145,000l. sterling out of the public treasure. Whether this be an actual payment for the nine months of their existence, or an estimate of their yearly charge, I do not clearly perceive. It is of no great importance, as certainly they may take whatever they please.|$|R
25|$|The budget deficit, {{which was}} aggravated by France's {{participation}} in the War of American Independence, led to conflict between the finance minister, <b>Necker,</b> who sought to limit expenditures, and Sartine, who wanted to expand the French Navy even further. <b>Necker</b> accused Sartine of exceeding the budget allocated to the Navy by 20 million livres (approx. US$100 million in 2006). <b>Necker</b> complained sharply to King Louis XVI that this overrun threatened an already almost bankrupt State. Eventually, the king dismissed Sartine on October 14, 1780 and replaced him with the marquis de Castries. Sartine, however, was dismissed with honors: he received a reward of 150,000 livres (approx. US$700,000) for his services and he was granted a 70,000 livres yearly pension.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, <b>Necker</b> {{occupied}} {{himself with}} literature and produced his famous Traité de l'administration des finances de la France (1784). He also {{spent time with}} his beloved only child, who married the ambassador of Sweden in 1786 and became Madame de Staël. In 1787, <b>Necker</b> was banished to 40 leagues from Paris by a lettre de cachet for his very public exchange of pamphlets and memoirs attacking his successor as minister of finance, Charles Alexandre de Calonne. Yet in 1788, the country was struck by both economic and financial problems {{to the point of}} emergency, and <b>Necker</b> was called back to the office of Director-General of Finance to stop the deficit and save France from financial ruin.|$|E
25|$|Marie Antoinette was {{instrumental}} in the reinstatement of Jacques <b>Necker</b> as Finance Minister on 26 August, a popular move, even though she herself was worried that it would go against her if <b>Necker</b> proved unsuccessful in reforming the country's finances. She accepted Necker's proposition to double the representation of the Third Estate (tiers état) in an attempt to check the power of the aristocracy.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Paris, of a family from Armagnac. He was brought up with the {{children}} of the king of France, and showed some taste for letters. He entered the army in 1754, was successively colonel of the Grenadiers and the Royal-Vaissaux regiment, and in 1780 was made maréchal-de-camp. Some pieces of verse and several comedies gained him admission to the Académie française in 1784. He was elected deputy to the Estates-General of 1789 by the nobles of Paris, and, animated by Liberal ideas, he soon joined the Third Estate, and seconded <b>Necker's</b> financial schemes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Necker's</b> {{dismissal}} {{provoked the}} storming of the Bastille on 14 July. At {{the insistence of}} Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Charles and his family left France three days later, on 17 July, along with several other courtiers, including the Duchess of Polignac, the queen's favourite. His flight has historically been largely attributed to personal fears for his own safety. However recent research indicates that the King approved in advance of his brother's departure, seeing it {{as a means of}} ensuring that one close relative would be free to act as a spokesman for the monarchy after Louis himself had been removed from Versailles to Paris.|$|R
5000|$|After {{taking part}} in the second Assembly of Notables and {{supporting}} Protestants' claims in the parlement (where he appeared as a peer), on 24 March 1789 he was elected a noble deputy for the bailliage of Sens in the Estates General of 1789. There he supported Jacques <b>Necker's</b> plans, but opposed the reforms demanded by the majority of the assembly - he notably protested against the suppression of the rights of péage and minage. He resigned on 20 April 1790 and left France the following year. He fought with the royalist army in the 1792 campaign and then moved to England, where he was welcomed by George III with [...] "kindness" [...] and [...] "distinction".|$|R
25|$|<b>Necker</b> {{realised}} {{that the}} country's extremely regressive tax system subjected {{the lower classes}} to a heavy burden, while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy. He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country's fiscal shortages. <b>Necker</b> published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36million livres, and proposed restricting {{the power of the}} parlements.|$|E
25|$|The Estates-General {{convened in}} the Grands Salles des Menus-Plaisirs in Versailles on 5 May 1789 and {{opened with a}} three-hour speech by <b>Necker.</b> The Third Estate demanded that the {{credentials}} of deputies should be verified by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members, but negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this. The commoners appealed to the clergy, who asked for more time. <b>Necker</b> then stated that each estate should verify its own members' credentials and that the king should act as arbitrator.|$|E
25|$|Amid the Assembly's {{preoccupation with}} {{constitutional}} affairs, {{the financial crisis}} had continued largely unaddressed, and the deficit had only increased. Honoré Mirabeau now led the move to address this matter, and the Assembly gave <b>Necker</b> complete financial dictatorship.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>Necker's</b> {{tax policy}} failed miserably, Louis {{dismissed}} him, and replaced him, in 1783, with Charles Alexandre de Calonne, who increased public spending {{in an attempt}} to [...] "buy" [...] the country's way out of debt. This policy also failed; therefore, Louis convened the Assembly of Notables in 1787 to discuss a revolutionary new fiscal reform proposed by Calonne. When the nobles were told the extent of the debt, they were shocked; however, the shock did not motivate them to rally behind the plan - but to reject it. This negative turn of events signaled to Louis that he had lost the ability to rule as an absolute monarch, and he fell into depression.|$|R
40|$|Verbal {{transformation}} effect – an auditory imagery task {{equivalent to}} <b>Necker's</b> cube in visual imagery – recruits a specific working memory, the so-called articulatory or phonological loop. Is this mechanism sensitive to articulatory control constraints, i. e. phase relationships between vowel and consonant gestures? In our experiment, 56 French students repeatedly pronounced aloud non-sense syllables- all combinations of [] with [p] and [s]- {{and were asked}} to stop as soon as they heard a possible syllable transformation. In agreement with our in-phase predictions, the winner is syllable [ps], where all gestures can be launched in synchrony. This experiment demonstrates that verbal working memory – a primary candidate as input memory for word learning – is sensitive to articulatory control of syllable phasing...|$|R
