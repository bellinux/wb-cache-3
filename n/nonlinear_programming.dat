25|$|The {{iterative}} {{methods used}} to solve problems of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programming</b> differ according to whether they evaluate Hessians, gradients, or only function values.

In some cases, the computational complexity may be excessively high.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the solution of}} <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programs</b> with <b>nonlinear</b> semidefiniteness constraints. The need for an efficient exploitation of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices makes the solution of such <b>nonlinear</b> semidefinite <b>programs</b> more complicated than the solution of standard <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programs.</b> In particular, a suitable symmetrization procedure needs to be chosen for the linearization of the complementarity condition. The choice of the symmetrization procedure can be shifted in a very natural way to certain linear semidefinite subproblems, and can thus {{be reduced to a}} well-studied problem. The resulting sequential semidefinite programming (SSP) method is a generalization of the well-known SQP method for standard <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programs.</b> We present a sensitivity result for <b>nonlinear</b> semidefinite <b>programs,</b> and then based on this result, we give a self-contained proof of local quadratic convergence of the SSP method.

25|$|In {{industrial}} statistics, simplices {{arise in}} problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In {{the design of}} bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, {{in which case the}} feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programming</b> method, such as sequential quadratic programming.|$|E

40|$|We propose two primal {{heuristics}} for nonconvex mixed-integer <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programs.</b> Both {{are based}} on the idea of rounding the solution of a continuous <b>nonlinear</b> <b>program</b> subject to linear constraints. Each rounding step is accomplished through the solution of a mixed-integer linear program. Our heuristics use the same algorithmic scheme, but they differ in the choice of the point to be rounded (which is feasible for nonlinear constraints but possibly fractional) and in the linear constraints. We propose a feasibility heuristic, that aims at finding an initial feasible solution, and an improvement heuristic, whose purpose is to search for an improved solution within the neighborhood of a given point. The neighborhood is defined through local branching cuts or box constraints. Computational results show the effectiveness in practice of these simple ideas, implemented within an open-source solver for nonconvex mixed-integer <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

Since nonconvex <b>nonlinear</b> <b>programs</b> do not guarantee global optimality, two techniques are developed to enhance the perfor-mance of the optimization models by generating initial starting points. The first technique is a heuristic-based approach to find an initial {{starting point for the}} discrete variables of the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>program</b> (the isocenters of radiation doses and the collimator sizes.) This technique uses a variant of a sphere packing approach combined with a Medial Axis Transformation, often used in computer graphics.
