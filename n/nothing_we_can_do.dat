500|$|Game Director and creator David Jaffe {{confirmed}} the game {{would be a}} cinematic presentation. He said that at E3, they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said, [...] "we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas" [...] of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players [...] "hate cinematic camera systems, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> will help you like the God of War cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001).|$|E
500|$|On the {{potential}} for [...] "superhero fatigue", Feige stated, [...] "This year , we've got Civil War and we've got Doctor Strange in November, two completely different movies. To me, and to all of Marvel Studios, that's what keeps it going. As long as we're surprising people, as long as we're not falling into things becoming too similar ... next year, , , [...] Those are three totally different movies ... {{as long as the}} only shared thing is they come from the same source material and they've got our Marvel logo in front of the movies. Other than that they can be very distinct. What other studios do, what other properties, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it. The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, {{and we wanted to}} do it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unrelated}} U.S. magazine Rolling Stone, {{called the}} newspaper's actions [...] "horrific" [...] {{and stated that}} Rolling Stone magazine has [...] "demanded they [...] cease using our name as a title". However, the magazine had little legal recourse because, despite copyrighting the name [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] in {{a large number of}} countries, they had not copyrighted it in Uganda. As publisher Jann Wenner stated, [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> We never copyrighted the name in Uganda. We own the copyright for the name in many, many countries. But who would have thought we'd have to own the copyright in Uganda?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the safety}} {{copy of the}} Basement Tapes, this song was labeled [...] "Answer to Ode". Heylin interprets it as a parody of [...] "Ode to Billie Joe", which was a hit single for Bobbie Gentry in mid-1967 when the {{basement}} songs were being taped. He calls it [...] "as deadpan a deconstruction" [...] of the Gentry hit as the Blonde on Blonde track [...] "4th Time Around" [...] was of The Beatles' [...] "Norwegian Wood". (He adds that, in his view, Dylan generally parodied songs that he liked.) For Heylin, it illustrates Dylan's feeling that folk songs delivered [...] "the underground story". An event with potentially world-shaking implications—"The vice president's gone mad!"—is treated in a detached, stoic manner by the community: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it". The narrative piles up both banal and surreal details, but [...] "Dylan delivers the 'saga' in the most laconic manner imaginable".|$|E
2500|$|With {{about four}} minutes {{to play in}} the first half, McCoy {{connected}} with Limas Sweed for an apparent five-yard (5m) touchdown pass. [...] However, Sweed was flagged for offensive pass interference which the Austin American-Statesman later suggested was [...] "questionable". [...] According to the Austin American-Statesman, the refs [...] "blew the call" [...] stating that replays showed that Sweed was involved in some [...] "spirited hand checking while the ball was in the air, but neither player appeared to push or be guilty of interference". [...] All three broadcasters working the game for ABC also initially spoke out against the penalty call, although later acknowledging that enough interference had occurred to justify the call. [...] In an ABC half-time interview, Mack Brown said [...] "I thought it was a bad call," [...] but added [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about that. We should’ve done a better job on third down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly they should, if they're fools {{enough to}} {{want to build a}} place to pray in, when they have got one already built for them.

6000|$|... "May you return, ere long, {{safe and}} sound!" [...] the count said. [...] "Is there <b>nothing</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you?

60|$|CONFUCIUS. <b>Nothing</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{will stop}} it. We cannot in our souls {{really want to}} stop it: the vital force that has {{produced}} this change would paralyse our opposition to it, if we were mad enough to oppose. But we will not oppose. You and I may be of the elect, too.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Imperial Conference {{on the night}} of August 13–14 at which the {{surrender}} finally was decided, Anami had two conversations in which he expressed opposition to the surrender. He asked Yoshijirō Umezu if [...] "the war should be continued even at the risk of launching a coup d'état," [...] to which Umezu concluded that, [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now but to comply with the Emperor's decision." [...] Anami then confronted a Colonel Saburo Hayashi in a washroom and asked about [...] "the possibility of attacking a large American convoy rumored to be outside of Tokyo." [...] Hayashi dashed Anami's suggestion by reaffirming the Imperial decision while noting the presence of the convoy was only a rumor. Finally, his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Masahiko Takeshita confronted Anami first suggesting Anami resign, which would topple the government, then suggesting he support the coup. To the first, Anami noted that the fall of the government would not stop the Imperial edict, while to the second, he replied that he wished to go to the Army Ministry first.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2006, {{a report}} {{commissioned}} by British Gas showed that housing in Uttlesford produced the highest average carbon emissions {{in the country at}} 8,092 kg of carbon dioxide per dwelling.

5000|$|Moran dominates his daughter's {{lives and}} they {{regularly}} {{return to the}} family home despite their own busy lives. They yearn for his approval, yet fear his temper. He tells them {{that it is important}} that the family stick together: [...] "Alone <b>we</b> might be <b>nothing.</b> Together <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything." [...] They find individuality painful compared to the protection of the familial identity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can promise}} you a hearty welcome," [...] Dame Margaret said kindly. [...] "I trust {{that you may}} never apply for it; but should, as your father says, aught happen to him, come to me fearlessly, and be assured {{that you will be}} treated as one of my own family. We shall ever be mindful {{of the fact that you}} saved our lives last night, and that <b>nothing</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you will cancel that obligation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing in the meanwhile, boys," [...] he said. [...] "In fact, {{there is}} <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{but try to}} extort some trifling {{concession}} from Slavin before we surrender to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gross {{took the}} radio. [...] "This is Commander Gross, Security. We're being carried into outer space. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> Is {{there any way}} that we can be removed from this ship?" ...|$|E

60|$|Hence also it will follow, {{that the}} first thing {{necessary}} to the possession of a school of architecture is {{the formation of a}} school of able sculptors, and that till <b>we</b> have that, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>can</b> be called architecture at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mr. George, [...] "there is <b>nothing</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{to guard}} {{absolutely}} against {{the possibility of}} losing our property when we are travelling--or in any other case, in fact. There is {{a certain degree of}} risk that we must incur, and various losses {{in one way or another}} will come. All we have to do is to exercise the right degree of precaution, neither too much nor too little, and then submit good naturedly to whatever comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Roland to Margaret, [...] "there's <b>nothing</b> {{more that}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{in regard to}} that affair. As soon as there are any new {{developments}} we shall have to consider it again, but until then let us give up our whole souls {{to each other and}} the Artesian ray." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he's {{a friend}} of yours, miss, kindly get 'im to cheese it and get a move on. We're {{clearing}} out. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> It's got {{too much of an}} 'old. In about another two ticks the roof's going to drop on us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] remarked the King. [...] "Yet {{something}} must be done to protect us from this monster. For many years it has annoyed us by eating our choicest crops, and <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> seems of any avail to save us from its ravages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{stay where you}} are, Mr. Glover, until it gets dusk. You would only be a mark for every man with a musket, up in the trees above us, and, so far as I can see, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> until they begin work in earnest." ...|$|E
5000|$|At that time, Mars and Beyoncé {{were both}} doing a diet and {{stressing}} out. One {{day before the}} performance they were [...] "watching playback backstage", while Beyonce ate a bag of Cheetos. Mars asked her [...] "That's what you're doing?", to which she replied [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> more <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> these last two days. It's gonna be what it's gonna be. So I'm gonna enjoy this bag of Cheetos." [...] Mars strongly believes that Beyoncé is [...] "coming for you every single time. So you better bring your A-game every time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{straight}} from out the sea arose [...] A female seal and six; [...] "O kill us now, and let our blood [...] With that of father's mix.

5000|$|The song reached number 4 {{and number}} 11, respectively, in the UK and US singles charts, {{and earned a}} gold record more quickly than {{a number of the}} group's other singles. The song was not {{included}} on the BBC Radio 1 playlist, prompting criticism from fans and British members of parliament. After the release of [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] and [...] "Real Love", Starr commented: [...] "Recording the new songs didn't feel contrived at all, it felt very natural and {{it was a lot of}} fun, but emotional too, at times. But it's the end of the line, really. There's <b>nothing</b> more <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> as the Beatles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} no {{business}} {{for two or three}} weeks at least," [...] he said; [...] "and while George is so sick there is really <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for him. Now I propose that you and I find the signs of oil that those fellows claim to have found, and when George gets well the work will be all done for him." ...|$|E
60|$|What then {{is to be}} done? The {{tentative}} {{suggestions of}} this chapter may appear to the reader inadequate. But the opportunity was missed at Paris during the six months which followed the Armistice, and <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now can repair the mischief wrought at that time. Great privation and great risks to society have become unavoidable. All that is now open to us is to redirect, so far as lies in our power, the fundamental economic tendencies which underlie {{the events of the}} hour, so that they promote the re-establishment of prosperity and order, instead of leading us deeper into misfortune.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile Upton {{had said}} nothing about his {{discovery}} on the ridge. His first impulse had been to blurt out the news, but on second thought he had decided not to. At the first opportunity he drew Pat aside and told him. The big fellow's face darkened. [...] "Say nothing about it," [...] he counseled. [...] "There's no use in spoiling a merry day, and the knowledge that we are being watched will do them no good. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it to-day. 'Tis not likely they mean us any harm. It's the fur they are after, and they've just {{taken advantage of the}} crust which leaves no trail to look us over and find out how many are in our party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} {{its effect on}} her mind," [...] he said gravely. [...] "And I wish, for your sake, the thing had not happened. However, we have {{discovered}} that there WAS a predisposing influence against you--and there is one uncertainty cleared out of our way, at any rate. I see <b>nothing</b> more that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now. Our next step in this inquiry must be the step that takes us to Rachel." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, {{the opinion of the}} Chiefs of Staff was that Malta was indefensible and this view was supported by a later review that stated: [...] "there is <b>nothing</b> practicable that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to increase the powers of resistance of Malta". Winston Churchill disagreed. In July 1940, he insisted that Hurricanes be flown in [...] "at the earliest moment".

This Lal Ruang will {{grow up to be a}} great warrior, a great hunter, and a great ruler, and his fame will spread to all the corners of Chinland. His worth to you will be greater than thirty big villages. Rejoice that you will be the father of such a great son. As for me, I must go on and proceed to Mithi Khua.
