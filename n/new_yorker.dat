5|$|During {{the time}} that Benchley was filming various short films, he also began working at The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> which had started in February 1925 {{under the control of}} Benchley's friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of getting {{involved}} with another publication for various reasons, he completed some freelance work for The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> over the first few years, and was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the lead conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic for The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> in 1929, leaving Life, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine. The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.|$|E

25|$|According to a NY1 news poll, 41% of <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> thought {{both the}} MTA and the Transport Workers Union were {{to blame for}} the strike.

But race was also shown to play into this result: 38% of white <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> thought the TWU's demands were fair, while nearly three-quarters of both African-Americans and Latinos agreed with the TWU's proposals.

His friend Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard Law School professor, was among those lobbying hard for Hand's appointment. President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed Charles Evans Hughes, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican candidate for President in 1916, as Chief Justice.
