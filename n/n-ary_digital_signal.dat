40|$|A <b>digital</b> {{communications}} <b>signal</b> is a sinusoidal waveform that is {{modified by}} a binary (<b>digital)</b> information <b>signal.</b> The sinusoidal waveform {{is called the}} carrier. The carrier may be modified in amplitude, frequency, phase, {{or a combination of}} these. In this project a binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) signal is the communication signal. In a BPSK signal the phase of the carrier is set to one of two states, 180 degrees apart, by a binary (i. e., 1 or 0) information <b>signal.</b> A <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is a sampled version of a "real world" time continuous <b>signal.</b> The <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is generated by sampling the continuous signal at discrete points in time. The rate at which the signal is sampled is called the sampling rate (f(s)). The device that performs this operation is called an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter or a digitizer. The <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is composed of the sequence of individual values of the sampled BPSK <b>signal.</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing (DSP) is the modification of the <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> by mathematical operations.
