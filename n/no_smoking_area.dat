Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} in Jeddah, using a two-stage cluster sampling, randomly selecting 4 out of 85 government male secondary schools. Data were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire eliciting responses to questions on personal background, smoking behavior, knowledge, behavior, and attitude toward smoking.

Results: Of the studied group, 258 (37 %) currently smoked, and of these, 83. 7 % had started smoking at the age of 14 years or less. The most common reason for smoking was the influence of family, especially the presence of someone at home who smoked (65, 9 %) and friends who smoked (42. 5 %).

40|$|Abstract Background: We aimed to: (i) assess {{compliance}} {{with a new}} smokefree law {{in a range of}} hospitality settings; and (ii) {{to assess the impact of}} the new law by measuring air quality and making comparisons with air quality in outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> and with international data from hospitality settings. Methods: We included 34 pubs, restaurants and bars, 10 transportation settings, nine other indoor settings, six outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> of bars and restaurants, and six other outdoor settings. These were selected using a mix of random, convenience and purposeful sampling. The number of lit cigarettes among occupants at defined time points in each venue was observed and a portable real-time aerosol monitor was used to measure fine particulate levels (PM 2. 5). Results: <b>No</b> <b>smoking</b> was observed during the data collection periods among over 3785 people present in the indoor venues, nor in any of the transportation settings. The levels of fine particulates were relatively low inside the bars, pubs and restaurants in the urban and rural settings (mean 30 -minute level = 16 μg/m 3 for 34 venues; range of mean levels for each category: 13 μg/m 3 to 22 μg/m 3). The results for other smokefree indoor settings (shops, offices etc) and for smokefree transportation settings (eg, buses, trains, etc) were even lower. However, some "outdoor" <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> attached to bars/restaurants had high levels of fine particulates, especially those that were partly enclosed (eg, up to a 30 -minute mean value of 182 μg/m 3 and a peak of maximum value of 284 μg/m 3). The latter are far above WHO guideline levels for 24 -hour exposure (ie, 25 μg/m 3). Conclusion: There was very high {{compliance with}} the new national smokefree law and this was also reflected by the relatively good indoor air quality in hospitality settings (compared to the "outdoor" <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> and the comparable settings in countries that permit indoor smoking). Nevertheless, adopting enhanced regulations (as used in various US and Canadian jurisdictions) may be needed to address hazardous air quality in relatively enclosed "outdoor" <b>smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> </p...|$|R

An investigation was carried out into the level of exposure to ETS present in 8 pubs in Ireland which included designated <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> complying with two different definitions of a <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> set out in Irish legislation. In addition, ETS exposure in a pub with a designated <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> not in compliance with the legislation was also investigated. The results of this investigation showed that the two differing definitions of a <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> present in pubs produced similar concentrations of benzene within <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> (5. 1 - 5. 4 ?g/m 3) but differing concentrations within the `smoke-free? areas (1. 42 - 3. 01 ?g/m 3). <b>Smoking</b> <b>areas</b> in breach of legislative definitions were found to produce the highest levels of benzene in the <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> (49. 5 ?g/m 3) and `smoke-free? area (7. 68 ?g/m 3). 3 D exposure modelling of hypothetical <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> showed that a wide range of ETS exposure concentrations were possible in <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> with the same floor <b>area</b> and same <b>smoking</b> rate but differing height to width and length to width ratios.
