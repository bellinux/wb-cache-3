40|$|We {{investigate}} to {{what extent}} high <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates between non-work and work household income may distort work incentives. Using a microsimulation model, we find that <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates are particularly high for households with a working partner and children. While <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates decreased moderately between 1996 and 2006 as wages rose faster than social benefits, the incidence of unemployment traps remains high. In particular, {{about a third of}} all employed individuals have a low incentive to avoid short spells of unemployment with the unemployment benefits provided, while unemployment traps are also widespread among the unemployed. The incidence of unemployment traps increased further in 2007 despite a reform of benefits. In particular, housing benefit, which was overhauled to reflect housing costs, increases <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates, distorting work incentives particularly among households with children. In addition, the rise in parental allowance may lock eligible individuals in non-employment, increasing the loss of human capital among non-working parents. This is particularly important for single parents, who face the highest specific unemployment rate, and also long unemployment spells among all household types. While the link between <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates and labour market stocks and flows is not straightforward across household types, further research should focus on the labour market behaviour of particular household types.

40|$|Using <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> {{rates between}} net {{household}} income while {{out of work}} and in work, the authors investigate to what extent taxes and benefits may affect work incentives. They find that in 2006, <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates are higher for low-income households and for households with children and a partner, attenuating work incentives. Work incentives are significantly affected by eligibility rules and the amounts of benefits, particularly unemployment benefit and social assistance. Next, the authors examine how the reform of social benefits introduced in 2007 affects work incentives. While social assistance is less generous, diminishing the incidence of high <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates, the reform gives preferential treatment to households with some work income. <b>Net</b> <b>replacement</b> rates are also higher for households with children, who receive a substantially higher housing benefit, but some less well-off households consequently receive less social assistance. The authors also see that increased parental allowance has the same crowding-out effect on other income-tested benefits as higher housing benefit has on social assistance. In addition, the rise in parental allowance may lock eligible individuals in non-employment, increasing the loss of human capital. This is particularly important for lone parents, who face the highest specific unemployment rate compared to other household types. labor supply, microsimulations, <b>net</b> <b>replacement</b> rate, tax-benefit system...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to describe attrition, physical integrity and insecticide persistence of LLINs over time to assist with better quantification of <b>nets</b> needing <b>replacement.</b> Methods 999 LLINs distributed in 2011 in two highly endemic provinces in Zambia were randomly selected, and were enrolled at 1220 months old. LLINs were followed every 620 months up to 3020 months of age. Holes were counted and measured (finger, fist, and head method) and a proportional hole index (pHI) was calculated. Households were surveyed about net care and repair and if applicable, reasons for attrition. Functional survival was defined as nets with a pHI 20 < 643 and present for follow-up.

Information on durability of insecticidal efficacy and physical integrity of LLINs and community usage at different time intervals of their use is essential to plan <b>net</b> <b>replacements</b> to maintain universal coverage for an effective and sustainable malaria control strategy. Therefore, a study was undertaken to assess these parameters in two malaria endemic districts of the Odisha State. Methods: A total of 309 households were selected in 15 villages of two community health centres (CHCs) (Borigumma and Laxmipur) from Koraput district and one (Khairput) from Malkangiri district. Data on net usage were collected during March to July 2014 using semi-structured questionnaires. PermaNet 2. 0 were sampled from all households, replaced with new ones, and bioassays were carried out to determine the insecticidal efficacy of LLINs after four and half, four and two years of field use following the standard procedure of World Health Organization. Results: LLIN use rate varied from 57. 9 to 90. 2 per cent in the study CHCs. The annual washing rate per net in Borigumma, Khairput and Laxmipur was 6. 6, 3. 2 and 4. 8, respectively.
