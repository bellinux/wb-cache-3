The {{different parts of}} the object do <b>not</b> <b>move</b> the same distance.

5|$|Baroš joined Liverpool in 2002 in a {{transfer}} worth £3.2 million, {{although he did}} <b>not</b> <b>move</b> straight away due to delays in obtaining a work permit for him. He made his club debut in a UEFA Champions League tie away to Barcelona on 13 March; he played last 16 minutes in place of Emile Heskey as the match finished goalless. It was his only appearance of the 2001–02 season.|$|E

In the spring of 1954, he {{underwent}} surgery to correct his left hand, which he had broken in his childhood. He could <b>not</b> <b>move</b> the hand well enough to catch high shots and compensated by using the rest of his body. The operation was successful.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can <b>not</b> <b>move</b> downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do <b>not</b> <b>move,</b> and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Iazyges did <b>not</b> <b>move</b> west in their entirety, and that some of them stayed along the Sea of Azov, which would explain the occasional surname of , however if this is true, the Iazyges that remained along the Sea of Azov are never mentioned again.|$|E

5|$|Most house sparrows do <b>not</b> <b>move</b> {{more than}} a few {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E
5|$|On October29, {{tropical}} storm watches and warnings were issued for {{portions of the}} Mexican coastline; however, these were canceled the following day due to the storm's rapid weakening. Although the storm did <b>not</b> <b>move</b> over land, its outer bands brought locally heavy rain and gusty winds to Sinaloa and Jalisco.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{what time}} {{they entered the}} straits, the Persians did <b>not</b> <b>move</b> to attack the Allies until daylight. Since they were not {{planning}} to flee after all, the Allies {{would have been able}} to spend the night preparing for battle, and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.|$|E

5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and <b>not</b> <b>move</b> even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
5|$|A {{supplementary}} {{member of}} the Storting, he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee. During 1839–57, he was a {{member of the}} supervisory board of Norges Bank. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having a profound wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals. Knudtzon eventually bequeathed his entire book collection and five of Thorvaldsen's sculptures to the society, with the condition that they <b>not</b> <b>move</b> to Christiania.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did <b>not</b> <b>move</b> to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E

5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did <b>not</b> <b>move</b> from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does <b>not</b> <b>move</b> off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E

5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across syllable boundaries do not assimilate {{for place}} in Wagiman {{as they do}} in many other languages. This means that a nasal in a syllable coda will <b>not</b> <b>move</b> to the position of the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation. In English and most other Indo-European languages, this movement occurs regularly, such that the prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would <b>not</b> <b>move</b> at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft does <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward, but hovers {{in front of}} the boss. Each boss has a single {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E
