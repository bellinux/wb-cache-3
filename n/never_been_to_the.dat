5|$|Promoted to {{the rank}} of brigadier, after the German {{surrender}} in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to Algiers where {{he was part of the}} staff committee planning the invasion of Italy. There, he learned that the India Office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country, he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first. As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the British 10th Corps. As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in Naples and then Capri, where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.|$|E

With {{less than two months}} left in the 1995 regular season, the Angels held a comfortable lead in the AL West standings, 11 games ahead of the second-place Texas Rangers and 13 games ahead of the third-place Mariners. However, the Mariners mounted a late-season comeback, coupled with a late-season collapse by the Angels, to force the tie-breaker.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} good advance reviews; Otis Ferguson of The New Republic {{thought the}} film very funny, praising Hawks' direction. Variety praised the film, singling out Hawks' pacing and direction, calling Hepburn's performance [...] "one {{of her most}} invigorating screen characterizations" [...] and saying Grant [...] "performs his role to the hilt"; their only criticism was {{the length of the}} jail scene. Film Daily called it [...] "literally a riot from beginning to end, with the laugh total heavy and the action fast." [...] Harrison's Reports called the film [...] "An excellent farce" [...] with [...] "many situations that provoke hearty laughter," [...] and John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that both stars [...] "manage to be funny" [...] and that Hepburn had never [...] "seemed so good-natured." [...] However, Frank S. Nugent of the New York Times disliked the film, considering it derivative and cliché-ridden, a rehash of dozens of other screwball comedies of the period.

500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} really <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E

Voting began after the initial All-Star rosters were announced. To help garner votes for Peña, the Rays started the [...] "Vote for 'Los" [...] campaign, having T-shirts made with Peña's face on them which players wore during batting practice. The Rays asked fans to bring their laptop computers to Tropicana Field and vote online during the game, as well as using advertisements, online commercials, fliers, merchandise, and even a video message from comedian Rob Schneider. Despite all efforts, Peña would ultimately finish fourth in the voting. Brandon Inge of the Detroit Tigers received the most votes to get the last remaining spot. Even though he didn't win, Peña said he was flattered and humbled to see how many were in support of him to make the All-Star Game. Peña would eventually make the team anyway as a replacement to Dustin Pedroia, who would have been the starting 2nd baseman, as he pulled out due to a [...] "serious family health matter" [...] involving his wife.|$|E
