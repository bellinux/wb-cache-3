50|$|For some years, critics {{argued that}} {{scholarship}} in children's geographies was characterised {{by a lack}} of theoretical diversity and 'block politics'. However, since the mid-2000s, the subdiscipline has seen a proliferation and diversification of theoretical work away from the social constructivist principles of childhood studies and the <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> of Childhood. A major, influential trend has been the development of Non-representational theory by children's geographers, and especially scholars such as Peter Kraftl, John Horton, Matej Blazek, Veronica Pacini-Ketchabaw, Affrica Taylor, Pauliina Rautio and Kim Kullman. This work shares many theoretical influences with a so-called 'new wave' of childhood studies, and especially the influence of poststructural, new materialist and feminist theorists such as Gilles Deleuze, Rosi Braidotti, Donna Haraway and Jane Bennett (political theorist). For instance, in a series of articles, John Horton and Peter Kraftl have challenged a sense of 'what matters' in scholarship with children - from the material objects, emotions and affects that characterise 'participation' {{to the ways in which}} our embodied engagements with place in childhood are carried forward into adulthood, thereby scrambling any neat notion of 'transition' from childhood to adulthood. Elsewhere, Veronica Pacini-Ketchabaw and Affrica Taylor have developed innovative approaches to understanding the 'common worlds' of children and a range of nonhuman species, including both domestic and 'wild' animals. Their vibrant 'common worlds' research collective http://commonworlds.net/ brings together a range of scholars who seek to explore how children's lives are entangled with those of nonhumans in ways that challenge oppressive, colonial and/or neoliberal views of the human as an individuated subject somehow distanced from 'nature'. Recently, there has been vibrant debate about the political value of nonrepresentational approaches to childhood. Some scholars argue that nonrepresentational theories encourage a focus upon the banal, everyday, ephemeral and small-scale at the expense of understanding and critically interrogating wider-scaled and longer-standing processes of marginalisation. Others argue that, whilst valid, nonrepresentational and 'new wave' approaches extend beyond the small-scale, offering useful and in some cases fundamental ways to critically and creatively re-think the ways that we do research with children and their 'common worlds'.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze {{theoretically}} the need to improve Social Studies Education in Turkey in a pedagogical manner and on the basis of the intended contributions and goals of a <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Movement to the field. Social Studies Education is an important teaching discipline to equip individuals with the necessary knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to operate efficiently in a knowledge society. The <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> movement of 1960 s in the USA contributed to the development of Social Studies Education. This movement tried to establish a constructivist approach. They emphasized on the importance of an inquiry based approach, and rich and real life situation in the classrooms and skills such as critical thinking, reflective thinking, cooperation and collaboration in Social Studies Education. However, the movement diminished in a short while due to the lack of research to support their theoretically sound ideas, appropriate teaching resources for teachers and students and ill-equipped teachers while their ideas were and still are gaining impetus in many countries in the world. Social Studies Education is relatively new in Turkey. Social Studies Education in Turkey has weaknesses in terms of both in theoretically and practically. The quality of teaching resources and materials and teacher qualifications are not up-to-standards to carry out a constructivist Social Studies Education. A new movement has started in Turkey to improve Social Studies Education.

40|$|In this <b>study,</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Curriculum is {{introduced}} {{and the differences}} and similarities between thiscurriculum and the <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey are determined by comparing and contrasting them. Survey model is usedas {{the purpose is to}} present the current situation. Therefore, <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums and the sources about them are obtainedfrom libraries and internet. After the curriculums and the resources are obtained, <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums of the two countries are investigated in termsof structure and content. In this <b>study,</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum (4 - 7. grades) practiced in Turkey isn’t comprehensivelymentioned because of time restraint. The following results are found after the investigation of both countries’ social studiescurriculums. Comparison in terms of Teaching ApproachesSocial Studies in New Zealand is developed on the basis of “Social studies as citizenship transfer”, <b>Social</b> <b>studies</b> as socialsciences”, <b>Social</b> <b>studies</b> as reflective inquiry”, which are known as <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> teaching approaches and accepted by manycountries and our country, and of approaches known as “Social studeis as individual, social and ethical development”. In themeantime, perspectives in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> teaching programs; “Bicultural perspectives”, “Multicultural perspectives”, “Perspectiveson gender”, “Perspectives on the present issues” and “Perspectives on the future” have become effective on the content ofteaching program. Comparison in respect of StructureThe <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums of both countries are structured in respect of learning areas. Learning areas in New Zealandsocial studies curriculums are determined as; 1. Social Organization, 2. Culture and Heritage, 3. Place and Environment, 4. Time,Permanency and Change, 5. Sources and Economical Activities. Those in the social studeis curriculums in Turkey are determinedas; 1. Individual and Society, 2. Culture and Heritage, 3. People, Places and Change, 4. Production, Distribution andConsumption, 5. Time, Permanency and Change, 6. Science, Technology and Society, 7. Groups, Institutions and SocialOrganizations, 8. Power, Administration and Society, 9. Global Connections. It can be stated that learning areas in both countries’ <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums are similar in terms of content. The purposesdefined in <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum are maintained using inquiry, values exploration and social decision makingwhich are stated as <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> process whereas they are carried out through concept, skill and value dimensions in Turkey. While a perception based on constructivist approach is expressed clearly in Turkey, it is understood through the statements in theprogram in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in <b>New</b> Zealand. Comparison in terms of Teaching ObjectivesWhen the objectives of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey is examined, it is seen that the national goals stated in the generalobjectives in the Turkish national education system comply with the 17 special objectives stated in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum. Inother words, <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey has a feature focusing on national benefits. However, <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> studiescurriculum has rather an individualistic view and highlights personal development, which makes the effect of “Social <b>studies</b> aspersonal, <b>social</b> and ethical development”, an approach stated in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> approaches section and felt in social studiescurriculum. Comparison in terms of Concept DimensionThe following are the results of the investigation of both countries’ <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums in terms of concept dimension:Concepts in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey (4 - 5, 6 - 7. classes) are aimed to be taught after a three-step process. However,such a practice doesn’t exist in New Zealand curriculum. Concepts in New Zealand curriculum are stated in two different languages, which is because New Zealand is composed oftwo different nations. Any information about how concepts will be taught doesn’t exist in <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> curriculum. Onlyinformation about what the concepts that will be used during the teaching process are is given in the program. This causes theconcept teaching to be the initiative of the teacher. Nevertheless, in Turkey, there is information about how the concepts in socialstudies curriculum (4 - 5, 6 - 7. classes) will be taught. Another striking issue about concept dimension in <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> studiescurriculum is that there isn’t information about what the materials {{that can be used in}} concept teaching are and how thesematerials should be used. This issue is comprehensively emphasised in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey. Comparison in terms of Skills DimensionIt can be asserted that particularly the skills dimension is structured better in <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum than inthe <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey. Skills are taught through <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> processes in <b>New</b> Zealand. However, they aretaught through units that are structured by the learning areas and through the activities that are prepared appropriately to theachievements stated in these units. Comparison in terms of Value DimensionValues dimension is more comprehensively structured in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey than in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculumin <b>New</b> Zealand. Which values should be structured by students and which approaches should be used during this process aregiven through sample applications in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey. However, this application is handled together with thevalues exploration within <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> processes in <b>New</b> Zealand. This gives the impression that value teaching is donesystematically but, in fact, there isn’t enough and comprehensive information about which values should be dealt with in socialstudies curriculum in New Zealand. Some information about this issue exists in “New Zealand Curriculum”. Comparison in terms of Teaching MaterialsMaterials are not given as a whole during teaching-learning process in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey. This causes twodifferent viewpoints. The first is that materials in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum can not be seen as a whole and the second is thatmaterials are given together with the sample applications where they are used, which enables the use of materials effectively byteachers. Similar materials are used during the teaching-learning process in both countries. However, the deficiency of informationabout how and in which situations the materials should be used brings out the conclusion that, in terms of materials, the currentsocial studies curriculum in Turkey is more effective than the <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in <b>New</b> Zealand. Comparison in terms of Assessment DimensionAssessment process in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in Turkey includes the assessment of concept, skills and value dimensions. The fact that <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum brings the basic principles of constructivist approach to the fore affects the assessmenttools and the assessment done according to these tools as well. Comprehensive information about the assessment process doesn’texist in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum in <b>New</b> Zealand and, instead of this, an effective assessment process takes part in “New ZealandCurriculum”, which is considered inadeaquat...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a largely}} {{theoretical}} thesis about <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education in <b>New</b> Zealand. Its {{aim is to}} consider how learners’ ‘ethical decision-making and action’ (to paraphrase the curriculum) could be better supported by proposing a broad theoretical orientation to this curriculum requirement. It argues that although ethics is central to learners’ lives and to the purposes of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education, this has hitherto been minimally communicated and elucidated through New Zealand curriculum documentation. It takes the view that while providing pedagogical guidance to teachers is urgent and vital, theoretical considerations should be a first priority. The thesis begins by offering a partly stipulative definition for ethics and foregrounds the complexities of ethical decision-making and action in our everyday lives and in academic ethics. It then considers the relationship between ethics and the purposes of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education, and uses a form of content analysis to describe the curricular meanings that have been implicitly ascribed to ethics over time. It explores how the present <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum is framed theoretically {{and what could be}} possible within this framing to better support learners to navigate in their ethical worlds. Three adjustments to the curriculum’s framing are proposed: <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> as issues-based education, as counter-socialisation, and as engagement with the philosophy of ethics. These are defended as a matter of social justice, and {{on the basis of their}} contribution to a range of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> outcomes. The thesis then considers the theoretical underpinnings of these proposed adjustments in greater depth. It explores whether an ethically reflexive orientation would better support <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> learners’ ethical decision-making and action, through three analytic moves: charting reflexivity’s tropes in the social sciences and social theory literature, developing an understanding of ethical reflexivity, and questioning the work this concept could do in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education. The thesis argues that an ethically reflexive orientation is a theoretical space in the literature worthy of attention, not least because it maps onto the contemporary ethical space in which learners find themselves. The considerable challenges ahead for such an orientation are readily acknowledged, but the thesis finds within the literature, and from the perspectives of a small group of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> teachers and learners, some optimism that a reflexive orientation could transcend the ethically silent space of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education...|$|R

40|$|More {{than half}} a century has passed since the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 2001 that led not only to deep geopolitical, economic and social changes but also stimulated transformations in the educational sector of most post-Soviet states. Having common background and historical roots national educational systems of most of these countries were modifying their past experience under the influence of modernization strategies and internationalization processes after signing Bologna Agreements {{in the first half of}} the XXI century. Thus, this Special Issue is an attempt to trace retrospectively the changes that took place on the post-Soviet territory using <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education as an example with a focus on educational policy, theory and practice. It seems reasonable and worthy as it provides multifaceted comparative perspective of the development within this field during the periods of transition, stabilization and potential growth. Under <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education we understand integrated and systemic teaching and learning experience in such disciplines as anthropology, archaeology, economics, history, geography, philosophy, psychology, pedagogy, religion and sociology. The eleven articles in this Special Issue focus on the topics within the following general strands: •	transformation of post-Soviet <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education curriculum under the influence of modernization and internationalization processes; •	enhancing instruction in post-Soviet <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education; •	emergence of new assessment methods and techniques in post-Soviet social Sstudies education; •	diversification of curriculum, instruction and assessment for various categories of learners in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education; •	professional development of <b>new</b> age <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> researchers from post-Soviet states...|$|R
