5|$|The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia (now the Eurasian Customs Union) {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 2010. The Customs Union's priorities were the elimination of intra-bloc tariffs, establishing a common external tariff policy {{and the elimination of}} <b>non-tariff</b> barriers. It was launched as a first step towards forming a broader single market inspired by the European Union, with the objective of forming an alliance between former Soviet states. The member states planned to continue with economic integration and were set to remove all customs borders between each other after July 2011.|$|E

25|$|The GATT/WTO {{framework}} led {{participating countries}} {{to reduce their}} tariff and <b>non-tariff</b> barriers to trade. Governments shifted their economies from central planning to markets. These internal reforms allowed enterprises to adapt more quickly and exploit opportunities created by technology shifts.|$|E
25|$|India is a founding-member of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the WTO. While {{participating}} {{actively in}} its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing {{the concerns of}} the developing world. For instance, India has continued its opposition to the inclusion of labour, environmental issues and other <b>non-tariff</b> barriers to trade in WTO policies.|$|E
25|$|Progress in {{negotiations}} stalled after {{the breakdown of}} the July 2008 negotiations over disagreements concerning agriculture, industrial tariffs and <b>non-tariff</b> barriers, services, and trade remedies. The most significant differences are between developed nations led by the European Union (EU), the United States (US), Canada, and Japan and the major developing countries led and represented mainly by India, Brazil, China, and South Africa. There is also considerable contention against and between the EU and the US over their maintenance of agricultural subsidies—seen to operate effectively as trade barriers.|$|E
25|$|India {{perceives}} {{certain aspects}} of European human rights agenda (social clauses) and some statutory labour requirements or precautionary measures in environmental safety as protectionist <b>non-tariff</b> trade barriers. Recurrent trade restrictions on Indian products decided by the European Commission (around 700 generic medicines were black-listed in 2015 which followed an earlier import ban on fruits and vegetables from India in 2014) and the European Parliament resolution in 2015 on alleged human rights violations by India are examples of recent actions which were unhelpful impediments to the improvement of European Union-India relations.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking control}} of the economy, Aziz aggressively {{promoted}} the privatisation, deregulation and economic liberalisation programme and open the large heavy mechanical industries, petroleum companies, electropetroleum and chemical enterprises and state-owned corporations to private sectors. His tenure as finance minister and prime minister, the agriculture production and construction well increased, whilst aggressively and forcefully implementing his policies to liberalise the trade, and eliminated the <b>non-tariff</b> barriers. Under his regime, the maximum bound tariffs were brought down to high as 300% to 25% whilst the applied tariff averages falls in the range of 5% to 10%.|$|E
25|$|The IBSA {{economic}} ministers met in New Delhi in March 2005 {{and agreed}} on a mechanism to identify and eliminate <b>non-tariff</b> barriers which impede mutual trade. Some of the mechanisms considered include customs cooperation, sharing of expertise {{in the field of}} energy, agriculture, food processing, tourism and financial and banking services. It has been decided to promote cooperation in the SME sector. For this purpose, common terms of reference have been developed which can aid in development of this sector. As, all the three countries have a large number of small-scale enterprises, it is expected that cooperation in this sector can have profound development implications.|$|E
25|$|The United States is Israel's largest trading partner, and Israel is the United States' 26th-largest trading partner; two-way trade totaled some $24.5billion in 2010, up from $12.7billion in 1997. The {{principal}} U.S. {{exports to}} Israel include computers, integrated circuits, aircraft parts and other defense equipment, wheat, and automobiles. Israel's chief {{exports to the}} U.S. include cut diamonds, jewelry, integrated circuits, printing machinery, and telecommunications equipment. The two countries signed {{a free trade agreement}} (FTA) in 1985 that progressively eliminated tariffs on most goods traded between the two countries over the following ten years. An agricultural trade accord was signed in November 1996, which addressed the remaining goods not covered in the FTA. Some <b>non-tariff</b> barriers and tariffs on goods remain, however. Israel also has trade and cooperation agreements in place with the European Union and Canada, and is seeking to conclude such agreements with a number of other countries, including Turkey, Jordan and several countries in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{goals of}} the Tariff and <b>Non-Tariff</b> Barriers group include agreeing that {{insecticides}} manufactured by US companies can be sold throughout India. India had also agreed to cut special regulations on trading carbonated drinks, many medicinal drugs, and lowering regulations on many imports that are not of an agricultural nature. Both nations have agreed to discuss improved facets of Indian regulation in the trade of jewellery, computer parts, motorcycles, fertiliser, and those tariffs that affect American exporting of boric acid. The group has also discussed matters such as those wishing {{to break into the}} accounting market, Indian companies gaining licenses for the telecommunications industry, and setting policies regarding Indian media and broadcasting markets. Other foci include the exchange of valuable information on recognising different professional services, discussing the movement and positioning of people in developing industries, continuation of talks on financial services markets, limitation of equities, insurance, retail, joint investment in agricultural processing and transportation industries, and small business initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Another factor which {{continues}} to {{play a significant role}} in the sales of Proton cars is the National Automotive Policy (NAP), enforced by the Malaysian government in the interests of Proton, Perodua, Naza and foreign brands with manufacturing plants in Malaysia. Under the NAP, imported vehicles are subjected to varying degrees of import and excise duties depending on the vehicle's origin of manufacture and engine displacement, with excise duty imposed at 60 to 105 percent being the highest component in the duty structure. Vehicles imported from members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, such as Thailand and Indonesia, are subject to the least import duties, whereas those from Europe suffer the worst. However, imported hybrid vehicles and cars purchased in duty-free Langkawi are exempted from the import and excise duties. The NAP ensures the survival of Proton and other Malaysian-made vehicles under a biased playing field in the Malaysian market. Nonetheless, the import duties of the NAP have been progressively revised and reduced in line with the eventual liberation of the market, but excise duties, the larger component of tariffs, continues to be high and opaquely applied, with <b>non-tariff</b> barriers effectively reducing the rate for Malaysian made vehicles. In March 2013, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia) announced that vehicles manufactured in Australia and Japan will face a gradual reduction of import duties in stages to zero by 2016. Proton however responded positively to the announcement, citing their recent positive developments such as the 5-star ANCAP safety recognition of the Proton Prevé as part of its commitment to progress.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} {{transport}} costs and trade barriers hinder {{the expansion of}} the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties, exchange controls, import quotas and other <b>non-tariff</b> barriers to trade are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing. More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of capital accumulation remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view. Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of [...] "inward looking growth" [...] as opposed to [...] "outward looking growth". (See Import substitution industrialization) ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{the chapter}} {{established}} a Committee on Trade in Goods {{with the purpose}} of providing arbitration for each country to [...] "raise issues of concern in relation to tariffs, <b>non-tariff</b> measures, rules of origin and customs administration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Non-discrimination. It has {{two major}} {{components:}} the most favoured nation (MFN) rule, {{and the national}} treatment policy. Both are embedded in the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e. a WTO member has to grant the most favourable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members. [...] "Grant someone a special favour {{and you have to}} do the same for all other WTO members." [...] National treatment means that imported goods should be treated no less favourably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle <b>non-tariff</b> barriers to trade (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties {{brought about a}} GATT anti-dumping Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies {{was the first major}} attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on <b>non-tariff</b> barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two. Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a provisional basis.|$|E
6000|$|No one, however, will {{deny that}} there has been a fall in the [...] prices of textile fabrics and {{manufactured}} goods. That is the [...] result of a general law of value, and of the tendencies of a [...] progressive state of industry.(372) The causes of this [...] acknowledged fall would be at work, no matter whether tariffs [...] existed or not. It is the result of the general forward march of [...] improvements, as evidenced in the application of new inventions [...] and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes. To say [...] that it comes because of a tariff, is a complete non sequitur. [...] How true this is may be seen by observing that a country like [...] England, without tariffs, shares in the general fall of prices of [...] manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy [...] customs-duties. The causes must be wider than tariffs, if they are [...] seen working alike in tariff and <b>non-tariff</b> countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{scarcity}} {{of information on}} <b>non-tariff</b> barriers {{is a major problem}} to the competitiveness of developing countries.

5000|$|<b>Non-tariff</b> {{barriers}} to trade (NTBs) or sometimes called [...] "Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs)" [...] are trade barriers that restrict imports or exports of goods or services through mechanisms other than the simple imposition of tariffs. The SADC says, [...] "a <b>Non-Tariff</b> Barrier is any obstacle to international trade {{that is not an}} import or export duty. They may take the form of import quotas, subsidies, customs delays, technical barriers, or other systems preventing or impeding trade." [...] According to the World Trade Organisation, <b>non-tariff</b> {{barriers to}} trade include import licensing, rules for valuation of goods at customs, pre-shipment inspections, rules of origin ('made in'), and trade prepared investment measures.|$|E

50|$|<b>Non-tariff</b> {{measures}} (NTMs) are <b>non-tariff</b> policy {{measures that}} affect international trade. NTMs cover {{a broad range}} of measures both directly and indirectly related to trade, and their use has risen as tariff rates have fallen under subsequent WTO negotiation rounds. In many cases, NTMs can be classified as <b>non-tariff</b> barriers to trade (NTBs). Some areas of NTMs are dealt with under specific WTO agreements, notably the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, the Anti-dumping agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the Agreement on Safeguards. WTO Members seek to continually improve market access through the regular WTO work programme and through negotiations such as those launched at the Doha Ministerial Conference in November 2001.|$|E
