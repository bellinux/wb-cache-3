5|$|Internal {{migration}} was likewise {{instrumental in}} the development of the new domains emerging in former royal lands. The new landholders granted personal freedom and more favorable financial conditions to those who arrived in their estates, which also enabled the peasants who decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to improve their position. BélaIV granted privileges to more than a dozen towns, including Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia) and Pest.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get the advice of his friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, who had gone to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Nashville.|$|E

50|$|How {{does the}} system perform: When all {{differentials}} are unlocked, the car will <b>not</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> if one wheel (front or rear) loses traction (is on ice or {{raised in the}} air). When center differential is locked with rear differential unlocked, the car will <b>not</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> if one front wheel and one rear wheel lose traction. When rear differential locked with center unlocked, the car will <b>not</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> if two rears or one front loses traction. When both center and rear differentials are locked, the car will <b>not</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> if two rears and one front lose traction.|$|R
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm {{approximately}} 800 prisoners had surrendered, and {{arrangements were}} made {{for them to be}} transferred to other prisons. At 8:00 pm Governor O'Friel agreed that prison officers should enter E wing, and at 8:05 pm approximately ten Control & Restraint (C) units each consisting of twelve prison officers entered the wing. By 8:10 pm all four landings of E wing had been secured, and one C unit progressed to the Centre where they fought with rioting prisoners. This was reported to Governor O'Friel, who instructed the officers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> beyond E wing. Scaffolding poles and other missiles were thrown at the C teams from the roof area above the fourth landing in E wing, and when prisoners broke onto the wing the C teams withdrew at 0:22 am on 2 April, leaving prisoners in control of the wing. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, {{and by the end of}} the first day 700 had surrendered and been transferred to other prisons along with 400 prisoners who were not involved in the rioting. Between 200 and 350 prisoners occupied the rooftop of the main prison during the night.|$|E
5|$|In reserve, Farnese {{deployed}} a large battalion {{made up by}} the German regiments of Hannibal d'Altemps and Georg von Frundsberg, flanked on {{its right}} by troops of reiters under Duke Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg, elder brother of Duke Maurice, John Casimir's former lieutenant, and on its left by lancers under Pierre de Taxis. The remaining Spanish cavalry, led by Ottavio Gonzaga, covered the rear. Farnese led his troops personally, and before the battle was started, he scouted the Dutch position, having ordered his troops <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> until his return. On the Dutch side, while De la Noue and Norreys directed the men standing in Borgerhout, William of Orange witnessed the battle from the walls of Antwerp in company of archduke Matthias, brother of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, whom the States General had elected as Governor of the Netherlands {{in opposition to the}} deceased John of Austria.|$|E

5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E
5|$|The credits appear over a {{flashback}} to a Christmas dinner {{where all the}} Scoobies are present, having a typical lighthearted conversation as Joyce and Buffy discuss a pie that drops on the floor. The scene snaps back to Buffy in the living room, shaking Joyce and screaming at her. She calls for an ambulance and attempts CPR, accidentally snapping a rib in the process, but to no avail. Buffy calls Giles. The paramedics arrive and work on Joyce and she revives, the paramedics declare it a miracle in the ambulance, and Joyce, Buffy, and Dawn rejoice in the hospital. The scene snaps back {{to the living room}} where the paramedics continue to work on Joyce until they stop and tell Buffy that Joyce is dead. They leave, and Buffy goes into the hall and vomits. Giles arrives and Buffy tells him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the body, shocking herself by using that word.|$|E
5|$|The duo wrote three songs while touring {{in support}} of their debut album Felt Mountain, but decided to take their work in a {{different}} direction with more rhythmic music. Goldfrapp chose to record in a studio in a Bohemian area of Bath, England, because they needed a place to put their equipment and start working. The band began working on the album in January 2002 with a list of songs they wanted to try to record, such as a disco song with only string instruments. The studio's walls were covered in neon lights and Alison Goldfrapp used them to write down her song ideas. They recorded early demos and worked on pre-production using a Yamaha 02R digital mixing console. Goldfrapp held jam sessions with Mark Linkous and Adrian Utley and, after they built momentum writing the album, decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to another studio.|$|E

5|$|This however {{was not to}} be the end of General Nansouty's {{action at}} the great Battle of Wagram. Although the great cavalry attack had done much to ease the {{pressure}} on Napoleon's left-centre, the latter's situation remained critical. The Emperor thus launched the Corps of General Jacques MacDonald in an attack against the Austrian right-centre. MacDonald's attack formation, formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought, was a huge infantry attack column or square, comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for Napoleonic warfare. Four squadrons of Nansouty's carabiniers-à-cheval were sent to support the flank of this attack, with the rest of his division further back. Realising that his advance is hampered by intense Austrian artillery fire, MacDonald aimed to clear the enemy guns before him, asking for a cavalry charge from Walther's Guard cavalry on his right and Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division on his left. With no direct orders from the Emperor and his commander, Marshal Bessières, out of action, Walther opted <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> while Nansouty did send his men forward but, having been positioned too far back, he arrived only after the enemy guns had moved away.|$|E
5|$|Gotovina {{said that}} {{although}} Operations Winter'94, Leap1 and Leap2 were planned and executed as three distinct operations, they represent a unified military action. Operation Winter'94 ostensibly failed to achieve its primary objective of relieving pressure on the Bihać pocket by drawing off VRS and ARSK forces to contain the attack; however, that was due to a decision by Chief of VRS General Staff General Ratko Mladić and not to mistakes in planning or execution. Faced with a choice between continuing with the attack on Bihać and blocking the advance from the Livanjsko field, the VRS chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> its forces, but Bihać was successfully defended by the 5thCorps of the ARBiH. The secondary objective of Operation Winter'94 was achieved more easily; the Croatian forces approached the Knin-Drvar road and directly threatened the main supply route between the Republika Srpska and the RSK capital. Operations Leap1 and2 built on the achievements of Operation Winter'94, threatened Bosansko Grahovo and created conditions to isolate Knin in Operation Summer'95, which was executed the following month. The advance was strategically significant; Mladić's decision not to react to Operation Winter'94 was a gamble which ultimately cost the Republika Srpska territory extending to Jajce, Mrkonjić Grad and Drvar and brought about {{the destruction of the}} RSK as the advances of the Croatian forces paved the way for Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{this period}} the pro-independence forces made two {{important}} advances. In the Southern Cone, a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, José de San Martín, became the governor of the Province of Cuyo. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru. San Martín's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes, which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan Martín de Pueyrredón became Supreme Director of the United Provinces. In January 1817, San Martín was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the Río de la Plata <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> against Chile, San Martín together with General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Martín had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a war with no quarter, the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane, Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Martín and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.|$|E

5|$|Zolciak {{received}} the first spin-off from The Real Housewives of Atlanta, titled Don't Be Tardy for the Wedding, which documented the preparations for her nuptials to Kroy Biermann. It premiered on April 9, 2012 and was renewed {{for a second}} season on April 16, 2013, at which time its title was shortened to Don't Be Tardy. The show returned for a third season on July 17, 2014. Subsequent seasons follow {{the daily lives of}} Kim and her now-husband Kroy as he tries to juggle between his professional career and personal life while Kim deals with her growing family. Originally planned as a one-time television special, The Kandi Factory was launched as the second spin-off from The Real Housewives of Atlanta in 2012. It followed Burruss and her record producers as they attempted to launch the music careers of undiscovered artists, although it was confirmed in 2013 that the series was canceled after airing one season. After reconciling with her ex-husband Gregg, Leakes received her own spin-off series , which documented the preparations for their second wedding; it premiered on September 17, 2013. Bravo announced Burruss and Tucker's wedding spin-off, Kandi's Wedding, on April 8, 2014. The series premiered on June 1, 2014, and concluded on July 6, 2014. Kandi's Wedding brought in very high ratings for Bravo, and topped NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak's previous spin-offs. In March 2015, Bravo renewed Don't Be Tardy... for a fourth season as well as announced another spin-off show, NeNe and Kim: The Road to Riches, starring both Leakes and Zolciak. However, the network later decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward with the show. The network later announced another series titled Kandi's Ski Trip, the third offshoot starring Burruss. The three-part special premiered after the conclusion of the seventh season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.|$|E
