40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of the dynamical model used in the orbit determination of the Lagrangian <b>navigation</b> <b>satellites,</b> the nonlinear perturbations acting on Lagrangian <b>navigation</b> <b>satellites</b> are estimated by a neural network. A neural network based state observer is applied to autonomously determine the orbits of Lagrangian <b>navigation</b> <b>satellites</b> using only satellite-to-satellite range. This autonomous orbit determination method does not require linearizing the dynamical mode. There is no need to calculate the transition matrix. It is proved that three satellite-to-satellite ranges are needed using this method; therefore, the navigation constellation should include four Lagrangian <b>navigation</b> <b>satellites</b> at least. Four satellites orbiting on the collinear libration orbits are chosen to construct a constellation which is used to demonstrate the utility of this method. Simulation results illustrate that the stable error of autonomous orbit determination is about 10 [*]m. The perturbation can be estimated by the neural network...|$|R

25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional <b>navigation</b> <b>satellite</b> system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global <b>Navigation</b> <b>Satellite</b> Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} calculating the accurate position of a GNSS device operating in an urban canyon, where lines of sight (LOS) with <b>navigation</b> <b>satellites</b> are too few for accurate trilateration calculation. We introduce a post-processing refinement algorithm, which makes use of a 3 D map of the city buildings as well as captured signals from all traceable <b>navigation</b> <b>satellites.</b> This includes weak signals originating from satellites with no line of sight (NLOS) with the device. We also address the dual problem- computing a 3 D map of the city buildings when {{the position of the}} device is given. This is achieved by storing LOS/NLOS rays to all <b>navigation</b> <b>satellites</b> sampled at multiple locations within a region of interest (ROI). These rays are then used to compute the 3 D shapes of buildings in the ROI. A series of field experiments confirm that both algorithms are applicative. The position refinement algorithm significantly improves the device’s accuracy and the mapping algorithm allows few users to map a complex urban region simply by walking through it...|$|R
