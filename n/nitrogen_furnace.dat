30|$|In our {{previous}} research, Si-NCs are fabricated by post-deposition annealing of Si-rich SiC (SRC) {{layer in a}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>furnace</b> {{for a long time}} (more than 1 h) [8, 9]. Both Si and SiC NC have been clearly observed in x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements when annealing temperature rise above 900 °C. After annealing, SiC-NCs in beta phase (β-SiC) as well as amorphous Si are found surrounding the Si-NC. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) has been considered as a primary annealing technique in semiconductor industry because of the low energy cost and better crystallization result [10, 11] In nanocrystalline system, better crystallization has also been reported in RTA because heating of the structure is caused by light directly absorbed in the layers [12]. In this paper, we compare two annealing techniques: conventional furnace annealing and RTA upon Si and SiC nanocrystalline system, and subsequently research the differences of structural characterization. By investigating the crystallization differences, we try to explain the crystallization mechanism of Si and SiC-NC.|$|E
40|$|A {{testing method}} was {{developed}} to cycle quickly and repeatably Ni 60 Ti 40 (wt. %) SMA specimens through temperature-induced transformation while under constant stress until failure. Previous works have shown fatigue cracks to initiate in or around Ni 3 Ti precipitates during repeated thermal cycling in this highly Ni-rich alloy. Actuation fatigue tests were conducted on specimens produced from material from different material suppliers and direction relative to cold-rolling. The specimens were placed under a constant applied stress of 200 MPa and thermally cycled through complete transformation. Some of the specimens were homogenized for 1 hour in a vacuum furnace and the rest were homogenized for 2 hours in a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>furnace,</b> and were all aged for 20 hours. It was seen during actuation fatigue testing that specimens homogenized for two hours had higher actuation strain, accumulated more irrecoverable strain and had longer actuation fatigue lives compared to specimens homogenized for one hour. Another trend observed was that specimens with {{the greatest amount of}} accumulated irrecoverable strain, which was caused predominately by transformation induced plasticity, had the longest actuation fatigue lives. Postmortem analysis showed a change in cracking behavior with precipitate orientation. Cracks initiated inside the Ni 3 Ti precipitates oriented parallel to the loading direction and at the interface between the precipitate and matrix when perpendicular. Two dimensional plane stress finite element simulations of a linear elastic ellipsoidal precipitate inside a non-linear transforming SMA matrix were conducted to explain further the change in cracking behavior by analyzing the stress fields in and around the precipitates. The results showed the stress inside the precipitate was greater when oriented parallel than perpendicular to the loading direction, which explains the observed change in cracking behavior. Another objective of actuation fatigue testing is to generate useful data to create predictive tools for future SMA actuator designs. A work-based method has been developed using actuation fatigue results found in literature. The method is shown to fit accurately data found in literature to a curve with only two material parameters. The results of this method show promise to predict accurately the actuation fatigue life of SMA components, however more testing is necessary to validate completely the method...|$|E
40|$|A novel burner, {{in which}} fuel (natural gas) and oxidant (oxygen or air) are {{separately}} injected into a furnace, shows promise for achieving very low nitrogen oxide(s) (NO{sub x}) emissions for commercial furnace applications. The dilute oxygen combustion (DOC) burner achieves very low NO{sub x} through in-furnace dilution of the oxidant stream prior to combustion, {{resulting in low}} flame temperatures, thus inhibiting thermal NO{sub x} production. The results of a fundamental and applied research effort {{on the development of}} the DOC burner are presented. In addition, the results of a market survey detailing the potential commercial impact of the DOC system are disclosed. The fundamental aspects of the burner development project involved examining the flame characteristics of a natural gas turbulent jet in a high-temperature ({approximately} 1366 K) oxidant (7 - 27 % O{sub 2 } vol. wet). Specifically, the mass entrainment rate, the flame lift-off height, the velocity field and major species field of the jet were evaluated as a function of surrounding-gas temperature and composition. The measured entrainment rate of the fuel jet decreased with increasing oxygen content in the surrounding high-temperature oxidant, and was well represented by the d{sup +} scaling correlation found in the literature. The measured flame lift-off height decreased with increasing oxygen content and increasing temperature of the surrounding gas. An increase in surrounding-gas oxygen content and/or temperature inhibited the velocity decay within the jet periphery as a function of axial distance as compared to isothermal turbulent jets. However, the velocity measurements were only broadly represented by the d{sup +} scaling correlation. Several DOC burner configurations were tested in a laboratory-scale furnace at a nominal firing rate of 185 kW ({approximately} 0. 63 MMBtu/h). The flue gas composition was recorded as a function of <b>furnace</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content, <b>furnace</b> temperature, burner geometric arrangement, firing rate, and fuel injection velocity. NO{sub x} emissions increased with increasing <b>furnace</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content and <b>furnace</b> temperature, but remained relatively insensitive to variations in fuel injection velocity and firing rate. NO{sub x} emissions below 5 {times} 10 {sup - 3 } g/MJ (10 ppm-air equivalent at 3 % O{sub 2 } dry) were obtained for furnace temperatures below 1533 K (2300 {degree}F) and <b>furnace</b> <b>nitrogen</b> levels between 1 and 40 %. CO emissions were typically low (< 35 ppm). Detailed in- furnace species measurements revealed the importance of the interior furnace circulation patterns, as influenced by fuel and oxidant injection schemes, on pollutant emissions. The combustion stability traits of several DOC burner arrangements were ascertained through furnace pressure measurements, with increased stability occurring as furnace temperature increased and as the separation distance between fuel and oxidant inputs decreased. Based on current market conditions, oxy-fuel conversion of batch steel reheat furnaces with a DOC burner is justified on the basis of utility costs alone. However, conversion of continuous steel reheat furnaces, which are responsible for most steel production, requires additional economic incentives, such as further fuel savings, increased furnace productivity, or emission credits...|$|R

A mixture of Eu-doped 15 R-SiAlON with α-Al 2 O 3 impurity was obtained for Si/Al = 1 / 6, using AlN together with Al(NO 3) _[3]· 9 H 2 O in a 2 / 1 atomic ratio as the aluminum source.

40|$|International audienceSludge {{incineration}} is {{a widely}} used technology because of its large volume reduction and complete organic destruction. However, incineration does encounter a number of drawbacks, among which are notably carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Carbon monoxide emissions are efficiently avoided by oxygen regulation in the <b>furnace.</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> oxide (NOx) formation, however, is very complex and not well known. This paper proposes a dynamic model of sludge combustion in an industrial fluidized bed combustor mainly focused on NOx formation. The model is tuned with industrial data. A control strategy is proposed to improve on the current industrial regulation, simultaneously ensuring CO and NOx control, yet without decreasing the combustion efficiency. The results are sufficiently acceptable for this process {{to be carried out}} in a real incinerator plant...|$|R

Effect of m-ZrO 2 (2 %- 5 % in mass) on sintering behavior and thermal shock resistance of Cr 2 O 3 material was investigated. The results show that m-ZrO 2 can accelerate the sintering of Cr 2 O 3 material, but excess 2 wt % m-ZrO 2 doesn’t work; m-ZrO 2 can obviously improve thermal shock resistance of Cr 2 O 3 material, sample containing 3 wt% m-ZrO 2 has 34 wind quenching cycles from 1 150 to room temperature, and sample without m-ZrO 2 only has 11 cycles...|$|R
40|$|As the {{spectral}} reflectance search continues for links between meteorites and their parent body asteroids, {{the effects of}} optical surface alteration processes need to be considered. We present {{the results of an}} experimental simulation of the melting and recrystallization that occurs to a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite regolith powder upon heating. As done for the ordinary chondrite meteorites, we show the effects of possible parent-body regolith alteration processes on reflectance spectra of carbonaceous chondrites (CC's). For this study, six CC's of different mineralogical classes were obtained from the Antarctic Meteorite Collection: two CM meteorites, two CO meteorites, one CK, and one CV. Each sample was ground with a ceramic mortar and pestle to powders with maximum grain sizes of 180 and 90 microns. The reflectance spectra of these powders were measured at RELAB (Brown University) from 0. 3 to 2. 5 microns. Following comminution, the 90 micron grain size was melted in a <b>nitrogen</b> controlled-atmosphere fusion <b>furnace</b> at an approximate temperature of 1700 C. The fused sample was immediately held above a flow of nitrogen at 0 C for quenching.

40|$|Dilute Oxygen Combustion (DOC) burners {{have been}} {{successfully}} installed and operated in the reheat furnace at Auburn Steel Co., Inc., Auburn, NY, under Phase 3 of the Dilute Oxygen Combustion project. Two new preheat zones were created employing a total of eight 6. 5 MMBtu/hr capacity burners. The preheat zones provide a 30 percent increase in maximum furnace production rate, from 75 tph to 100 tph. The fuel rate is essentially unchanged, with the fuel savings expected from oxy-fuel combustion being offset by higher flue gas temperatures. When allowance is made for the high nitrogen level and high gas phase temperature in the furnace, measured NOx emissions {{are in line with}} laboratory data on DOC burners developed in Phase 1 of the project. Burner performance has been good and there have been no operating or maintenance problems. The DOC system continues to be used as part of Auburn Steel?s standard reheat furnace practice. High gas phase temperature {{is a result of the}} high firing density needed to achieve high production rates, and little opportunity exists for improvement in that area. However, fuel and NOx performance can be improved by further conversion of furnace zones to DOC burners, which will lower <b>furnace</b> <b>nitrogen</b> levels. Major obstacles are cost and concern about increased formation of oxide scale on the steel. Oxide scale formation may be enhanced by exposure of the steel to higher concentrations of oxidizing gas components (primarily products of combustion) in the higher temperature zones of the furnace. Phase 4 of the DOC project will examine the rate of oxide scale formation in these higher temperature zones and develop countermeasures that will allow DOC burners to be used successfully in these furnace zones...|$|R
