25|$|Fulani {{also sought}} the {{endorsement}} of the Peace and Freedom Party of California, but despite winning a majority in that party's primary, she would lose the nomination to Ronald Daniels, the former Director the <b>National</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition.</b> Rather than pursuing a ballot space of her own, Fulani would endorse Daniels's candidacy in California.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, as the intra-elite rivalry in the <b>National</b> Alliance of <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> and {{fissures}} {{over the}} constitutional negotiations turned perilous {{ahead of the}} 2005 referendum, Mutunga joined the Ford Foundation in Nairobi as a human rights programme officer. In 2009, he became the executive director overseeing all grant making in Eastern Africa, mainly focusing on human rights and social justice and protection of women's rights.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} of the 2002 elections, the National Alliance Party of Kenya (Formerly NAK now NAPK) allied itself with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form the <b>National</b> Alliance of <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> (NARC). On December 27, 2002, NARC won a landslide victory over KANU. NARC presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki got 62% of the votes in the presidential elections, against only 31% for the KANU candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta. On December 30, 2002, Mwai Kibaki {{was sworn in as}} the third President of Kenya.|$|R
5000|$|Mutunga {{has been}} hailed as [...] "an {{excellent}} negotiator". He convened the breakfast {{meetings of the}} then opposition stalwarts, Mwai Kibaki, Charity Ngilu, and Michael Wamalwa, to forge a common alliance ahead of the 2002 elections. The unity talks culminated {{in the creation of}} the National Alliance for Change as a single coalition of fourteen parties, later renamed the National Alliance Party of Kenya. The Alliance merged with defectors from President Daniel arap Moi's Kenya African National Union and joined the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form the <b>National</b> Alliance of <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> (NARC). Mutunga declined an offer to serve as the chairperson of NARC, saying that his main interest was to unite the opposition and not to join active politics. The NARC won the 2002 elections. After the elections, Mutunga was one of the senior counsels appointed by President Kibaki in 2003 under Section 17 of the Advocates Act.|$|R
25|$|For {{a leader}} who was popularly swept into power in 2002 on an anti-corruption platform, Kibaki's tenure saw graft scandals where {{hundreds}} of millions of shillings were siphoned from public coffers. Kibaki's <b>National</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> — which took power from the authoritarian rule of Daniel arap Moi—was welcomed for its promises of change and economic growth, but soon showed that it was better suited to treading established paths.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the <b>National</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> won {{political}} control of Kenya, {{but the country}} remained politically unstable. Electoral manipulation was alleged, and it was widely confirmed by international observers in the 2007 elections. The political fallout from the 2007 election resulted in a country-wide economic and humanitarian crisis extending into 2008. Throughout the 2000s, there had been widespread ethnic violence in Kenya and East Africa, including killings, and the displacement {{of hundreds of thousands}} of people by 2008.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{her return}} to Kenya, Maathai again campaigned for {{parliament}} in the 2002 elections, this time as a candidate of the <b>National</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition,</b> the umbrella organization which finally united the opposition. On 27 December 2002, the Rainbow Coalition defeated the ruling party Kenya African National Union, and in Tetu Constituency Maathai won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote. In January 2003, she was appointed Assistant Minister in the Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources and served in that capacity until November 2005. She founded the Mazingira Green Party of Kenya in 2003 to allow candidates to run {{on a platform of}} conservation as embodied by the Green Belt Movement.

He had been arrested {{with his father and}} brother the year before in a similar activity. His protest against apartheid extended to weekly demonstrations in front of the South African Consulate in Chicago. Jackson shared the stage with Nelson Mandela when Mandela made his historic speech following his release from a 27-year imprisonment in Cape Town in February 1990. Before entering the House, he became secretary of the Democratic National Committee's Black Caucus, the national field director of the <b>National</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> {{and a member of the}} Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.

500|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> (Rainbow Coalition for short) was a {{political}} organization {{that grew out of}} Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign. During the campaign, Jackson began speaking about a [...] "Rainbow Coalition", an idea created by Fred Hampton, regarding the disadvantaged and welcomed voters from a broad spectrum of races and creeds. The goals of the campaign were to demand social programs, voting rights, and affirmative action for all groups that had been neglected by Reaganomics. Jackson's campaign blamed President Ronald Reagan's policies for reduction of government domestic spending, causing new unemployment and encouraging economic investment outside of the inner cities, while they discouraged the rebuilding of urban industry. The industrial layoffs caused by these policies hit the black and other minority populations particularly hard. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention on July 18, 1984, in San Francisco, California, Jackson delivered an address entitled [...] "The Rainbow Coalition". [...] The speech called for Arab Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, youth, disabled veterans, small farmers, lesbians and gays to join with African Americans and Jewish Americans for political purpose. Whereas the purpose of PUSH had been to fight for economic and educational opportunities, the Rainbow Coalition was created to address political empowerment and public policy issues. After his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 1984, Jackson attempted to build a broad base of support among groups that [...] "were hurt by Reagan administration policies" [...] - racial minorities, the poor, small farmers, working mothers, the unemployed, some labor union members, gays, and lesbians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> (and <b>rainbow</b> {{politics}} in general) provides a suitable {{context in which}} to explore ideas {{about the relationship between}} theories of social identity and actual processes of identity formation. A brief outline of the history of Rev. Jesse Jackson's two presidential nomination campaigns is provided. Existing academic interpretations of the <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> are then reviewed, and a class-based analysis is favoured rather than one grounded in racial politics or new social movements. This conclusion needs to be tempered by a fuller consideration of the geography of the <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> than has been available so far. The paper ends with a tentative examination of what geographical principles and themes are involved, drawing on case studies from Vermont, Van Nuys, C/ and Baltimore, MD, It is suggested that a focus on the circulation of finance capital may provide both the principle linking the coalition's diverse constituencies and places and a significant point of political leverage for future rainbow politics...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Mobile Telecommunication and Innovation at (MSc. MTI) at Strathmore UniversityConstituency Development Fund (CDF) in Kenya has been hailed {{as one of the}} most innovative creations of the <b>National</b> Alliance <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> (NARC) administration (2003 - 2007). With the Government working hard to cultivate an image of transparency and inclusiveness for good governance in Kenya, implementation of E-Governance services for creating better relations between citizens and those in power has been a real struggle. ICT has been exploited in this relationship to help transform the accessibility, quality and cost-effectiveness of public services. The emergence of mobile technologies has further accelerated the different sectors of Government in implementing faster and cost-effective means of communication. However, there have been notable challenges in the CDF Bursary Fund application process including but not limited to delayed information relay about commencement of application window and disconnect between CDF bursary officials and the applicants. This dissertation describes a study on the challenges and gaps in the bursary fund application process in the context of technological need. The study identified challenges such as delayed information relay on commencement and updates on disbursements as well as lack student historical data with regards being a bursary beneficiary. The study also aimed to develop, test and validate a mobile application that can be used to solve these challenges. In order to establish the relevant system requirements needed, data collection methodologies including interviews with stakeholders, questionnaires with CDF Bursary applicants were used to highlight the needs of the applicants. This data was then analysed using data analysis tool IDEA and used in the design of the application. Waterfall methodology was then used to develop the mobile application using Android Platform. The application included features that enabled capture of applicants data, SMS updates for applicants at the inception of the application window, after application, and during disbursements process. The application also enabled the applicants to obtain application forms easily during the application window. This solution was tested by the developer and validated by selected users who formed part of the test team. The solution proved to be a viable solution with 90 % acceptance levels...|$|R
