6000|$|... "I--well, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> but we've {{heard of}} him." [...] The editor was thankful, and resumed his composure. Sally added: [...] "Is he--is he--well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I? No, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of.</b> I merely said to her, {{that it was}} {{dangerous}} to drive those Highland bullocks--as it IS. She turned in such a way, and said--"I suppose you think I'm afraid {{of you and your}} cattle, don't you?" [...] So I asked her [...] "why," [...] and for answer she flung me a back-hander across the face.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it would}} be better <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would stay were it <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can be of no real service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Faith! <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of,' said Loveday, reflecting. 'I didn't say {{a single}} thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should {{naturally}} have said, on purpose to give no offence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oah no. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> but {{of course}} he found a letter-writer who can write English verree well, and so he wrote. I do hope you understand.' ...|$|R
60|$|Thirdly, {{from the}} Experiment of {{charring}} of Coals (whereby {{we see that}} notwithstanding the great heat, and the duration of it, the solid parts of the Wood remain, whilest they are preserv'd from the free access of the air undissipated) we may learn, that which has <b>not,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> been publish'd or hinted, nay, {{not so much as}} thought of, by any; and that in short is this.|$|E
60|$|I do not {{affirm that}} this was the Case at first, because being not present in that black Divan, at least <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> for who knows where he was or was not in his pre-existent State? I cannot be {{positive}} in the Resolve that past there; but except for some very little Contradiction, which we find in the sacred Writings, I should, I confess, incline to believe it Historically; and I shall speak of those things which I call Contradictions to it more largely hereafter.|$|E
60|$|I had {{had enough}} of this grisly place by this time, and wanted to leave, but I couldn't, because I had {{something}} on my mind that my conscience kept prodding me about, and wouldn't let me forget. If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn't have any conscience. It {{is one of the most}} disagreeable things connected with a person; and although it certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot be said to pay, in the long run; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort. Still, this is only my opinion, and I am only one man; others, with less experience, may think differently. They have a right to their view. I only stand to this: I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started with. I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we prize anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so. If we look at it in another way, we see how absurd it is: if I had an anvil in me would I prize it? Of course not. And yet when you come to think, there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil--I mean for comfort. I have noticed it a thousand times. And you could dissolve an anvil with acids, when you couldn't stand it any longer; but there isn't any way that you can work off a conscience--at least so it will stay worked off; <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> anyway.|$|E
6000|$|... "Likely enough. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{anything}} of the kind; but as I hate him {{from the bottom of}} my heart, it is natural to suppose that he has the same feeling in regard to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, {{you will}} see," [...] said Anna. [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what is clever, {{but he has}} got a {{scholarship}} already, and papa says he will get a fellowship, and nobody is better at games. He is cleverer than Mr. Middleton, and everybody but you call Mr. Middleton clever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should hate {{to think}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am looking upon the jungle for the last time, dear," [...] he said, [...] "were it <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going to a new world of {{happiness}} with you forever," [...] and, bending down, Tarzan of the Apes kissed his mate upon her lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because--he expects it. You see, he {{is a good}} {{judge of}} character; he will {{naturally}} infer, from what he knows of my temperament, that after this experience I shall {{want to get back to}} England and safety. So I should--if it were <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he will expect it. As it is, I must go elsewhere; I must draw him after me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every one fights {{according}} to his own method, Cnut; and <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> there is <b>not</b> some thing {{to be said for}} this outcry, for it is really so wild and fearful that it makes my blood almost curdle in my veins; and were it <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the proved valor of our knights and footmen, I should feel shaken by this terrible introduction to the fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{she said}} frankly, [...] "writing {{must be a}} trade, like {{anything}} else. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> anything about it, of course. I only bring common judgment to bear. You couldn't hope to be a blacksmith without spending three years at learning the trade--or is it five years! Now writers are so much better paid than blacksmiths {{that there must be}} ever so many more men who would like to write, who--try to write." ...|$|R
6000|$|Think <b>not</b> but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> these things; [...] Or think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> them not, [...] Not {{therefore}} am I short [...] Of {{knowing what}} I ought, &c.|$|R
60|$|Bel. Madam, madam, that bashfulness must be laid aside: <b>Not</b> but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> your {{business}} perfectly; and will, if you please, unfold {{it to you}} all immediately.|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} money, and I taught him the trick--and I regretted it {{almost as soon}} as it was done. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> mind, of any serious {{consequences}} <b>that</b> followed; for <b>I</b> returned to London the next morning. My sentiments were those of a man of honor, who felt that he had degraded his art, and who could not be quite sure <b>that</b> he might <b>not</b> have armed the hand of an assassin as well. I have no more to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stood {{high among}} the lieutenants, and {{expected}} to get it before long; but I am proud, indeed, of the D.S.O." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Atherton, is it you?" [...] Wilfrid exclaimed. [...] "You {{arrived at}} a lucky moment indeed. No, <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> hurt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of, beyond a shake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Except an {{anonymous}} parcel, {{returning to the}} brothers in Canada the sum he had taken with him. Strangely, the clue was not followed up, and he is lost sight of! But Wilfred's air, and still more his manner, is always recalling his cousin to me, and, Nag, dear, I {{could not bear to}} see Vera go through the same trial by my exposing her to the intercourse. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> any harm of Wilfred, but his parents could not like anything of the kind." ...|$|R
60|$|LOMAX [handsomely] <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mind, you <b>know,</b> if Sarah don't.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps we may; {{but it is}} {{more than}} I ever thought of. And as to most matters, to say the truth, there are <b>not</b> many <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> my own mind about." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{from this}} I shall proceed {{to a second}} {{considerable}} Ph√¶nomenon which these Diamants exhibit, {{and that is the}} regularity of their Figure, which is a propriety not less general than the former, It comprising within its extent, all kinds of Metals, all kinds of Minerals, most Precious stones, all kinds of Salts, multitudes of Earths, and almost all kinds of fluid bodies. And this is another propiety, which, though a little superficially taken notice of by some, has <b>not,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> been so much as attempted to be explicated by any.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} downstairs {{and let me}} out?" [...] she asked. [...] "I have looked down and it is all dark on the ground floor. <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> my way." ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{the manner}} and {{extent to which}} he took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards {{at the ends of}} hands, before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had, {{respecting}} his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could never bear to speak to him about her, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mamma, do <b>not</b> say <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{how good}} you have been,--how you have thought of me in every thing. Pray do <b>not</b> say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> reproach you!" [...] And she came and knelt at her mother's lap.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grey?--ah, let me see. Yes, certainly. You are Mr. Grey the recluse, the hermit, the philosopher, and {{all that}} sort of thing. Why, certainly; Dr. Jones, our surgeon, has told me all about you. Dear me, how {{interesting}} a rencontre! Lived all alone here for seven--was it seven years?--yes, I remember now. Existed quite au naturel, one might say. How odd! <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> anything about <b>that</b> sort of thing, you know. I've lived always among people, and am really quite a stranger, I assure you. But honestly, Mr.--I beg your pardon--Mr. Grey, how do you like it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} {{to tell you how}} I loved you. I always loved you. From the first I was a {{different}} man when I was with you. But of course it was absurd, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> well enough. <b>I</b> never said anything, and I tried not to make myself ridiculous. But I {{just want you to know}} about it now that it can't matter one way or the other. You'll understand <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really do love you when <b>I</b> tell you <b>that,</b> if it were <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> you were frightened and unhappy, these last two days in which we have been always together would have been infinitely the happiest of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oswald was <b>not</b> there. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> is {{what you}} mean to ask. Papa said that he might come if he pleased. Oswald stipulated {{that he should be}} {{received}} as a son. Then my father spoke the hardest word that ever fell from his mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{explain how}} I feel about it," [...] I answered. [...] "I am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> myself. Only you must see {{that if it}} were known that he set out from the village last night to call upon me, people might say {{unpleasant}} things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What to do, you ask,' {{said the}} Rector; 'I am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what you mean. If your neglect {{has added to}} her sufferings, you cannot remove them; and I would not add to your sorrow unless you wished me {{to do so for}} your good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paris, my dear young friend--Paris and life! Now I am back again--I am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> why. <b>I</b> {{came over}} with these French people, {{to see them}} start their theater. Forgive me, I have not paid my respects to our hostess. We shall meet again presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said just}} {{now he was}} vestry-clerk, like his father before him. I am <b>not</b> quite sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what a vestry-clerk is." ...|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE. Please <b>not</b> to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> why. Suddenly {{he stopped}} and swung his cane. You know how gallantly he swings his cane.|$|R
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. It was <b>not</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>know</b> what Good might be talking about. He talks about so many things.|$|R
