40|$|It might largely be symbolic, but Australia {{would benefit}} from signing the <b>non-agression</b> treaty with ASEAN, argues Ross Buckley LAST week was a big week in trade. John Howard refused to {{consider}} signing a non-aggression treaty with the Association of South East Asian Nations. China and ASEAN signed a full-blown free trade agreement. Australia and ASEAN announced negotiations would commence towards an FTA. India and Singapore announced agreement on a far-reaching economic treaty. A new annual East Asia Summit meeting was announced, and, surprisingly, we were invited to next year’s meeting. All of this occurred at the ASEAN summit in Laos, the first time Australia {{had been invited to}} an ASEAN summit since 1977. Does all this matter, and {{what does it mean for}} Australia? The ASEAN leaders wanted us to ‘consider’ our position on their Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. John Howard refused. Yet the treaty is utterly innocuous. It speaks of the need to respect sovereignty and build good relations. China, India, Japan and Pakistan have signed. South Korea and New Zealand have indicated they will. John Howard’s refusal to even consider it is mystifying. He seems to dismiss signing because it is essentially a symbolic treaty. But it is a symbolic treaty in a region where symbolism matters. Inexpensive gifts are often given in business dealings in Asia. These are given not for their value, but for what they symbolise: mutual respect and regard. This treaty is a national equivalent. John Howard has visited a host’s home and refused their hospitality. The FTA between China and ASEAN will scrap tariffs in most sectors of trade between China and ASEAN’s six richest members - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand - by 2010. ASEAN’s four poorer members - Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam - are given a further five years to comply. This FTA could severely damage our exports of agricultural products and processed food to ASEAN nations, and of vegetable oil to China. It comes into effect on 1 January 2005 and increases the pressure on us to secure FTAs with ASEAN and China. The negotiation of our FTA with ASEAN is expected to take at least two years. The China-ASEAN FTA is a big step towards Asian economic integration, and is the first real step towards a China-ASEAN free trade zone. It will drive major changes within national economies. Indonesia’s trade unions are already complaining that local industry won’t be able to compete with Chinese imports on price or quality and unemployment in Indonesia will soar. They are probably right. Singapore and India announced agreement on the final terms of their Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. It will be signed early in 2005. Under this treaty India will immediately slash its tariffs on Singaporean imports by 80 per cent and reduce them to zero within five years. The agreement will improve opportunities for Indian professionals to work in Singapore’s service industries, promote Singaporean investment into India, and liberalise air transport between the countries. This will place Australian businesses seeking to benefit from India’s booming economy at a competitive disadvantage as against Singaporean businesses. Since 1997, ASEAN summits have included China, Japan and South Korea. Next year, Malaysia will host an East Asian Summit in conjunction with this ASEAN+ 3 summit, with the express intention of working towards the East Asian Summit supplanting the ASEAN+ 3 model. The establishment of an East Asian Summit realises a long-held Malaysian ambition, and is another step towards an East Asian free trade zone. China’s hand is also visible in this development. The East Asian Summit gives it a core seat at a regional summit, whereas it was on the margins of ASEAN+ 3. Mitchell Reiss, Director of Policy Planning for the US State Department, has already expressed his ‘personal’ concern at this development, saying ‘While we encourage greater integration, greater economic development, greater dialogue among all countries of this region, we don’t want to be excluded from that conversation. ’ After years of sticking to its knitting, China is moving decisively to increase its regional influence. The US doesn’t like it, but it had better get used to it. The creation of the East Asian Summit gives rise to an opportunity for us to secure a regular seat at the table. This is critical for Australia. Good bilateral relations are not enough. We need to be part of regional deliberations, to be able to influence the formation of views. Our invitation to the summit next year in Malaysia is marvellous news. But be in no doubt - we will have to earn an ongoing seat at the table. Let’s hope we reconsider our approach to non-aggression treaties in the interim, and leave our cultural blinkers at home when we go to Malaysia.
