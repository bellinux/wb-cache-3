2500|$|During the Twelve-Metre era, the New York Yacht Club, {{citing the}} Deed {{language}} that the Cup should be [...] "perpetually a Challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign countries", had adopted several interpretive resolutions intended to strengthen <b>nationality</b> <b>requirements.</b> By 1980, these resolutions specified that besides being {{constructed in the}} country of the challenger or defender, a yacht had to be designed by and crewed by nationals of the country where the yacht club was located. Globalization made it increasingly impractical to enforce design nationality rules, and starting in 1984, the Royal Perth Yacht Club began relaxing this requirement. Numerous members of the New Zealand AC 2000 team became key members of the Swiss 2003 Alinghi challenge, led by biotechnology entrepreneur Ernesto Bertarelli.

Foreigners include, apart from the usual definition, those Frenchmen who left without intent of returning. They also cite the opinion of Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century: Common sense requires that princes of the blood who have become foreigners be excluded from the throne just as the male descendants of princesses. The exclusion of both is {{in the spirit of}} the fundamental custom, which overlooks the royal blood in princesses only to prevent the scepter from falling in foreign hands.For this reason, Orléanists also exclude the Orléans-Braganza (Brazilians) and Orléans-Galliera (Spanish), junior descendants of Louis Philippe, King of the French, from the succession to the French throne.|$|E

40|$|International audience"This {{comparative}} research {{was triggered by}} the assessment of property registration law published in the World Bank Doing Business reports (DB). The international and interdisciplinary team aimed to assess how legal certainty was imagined {{and put into practice}} in French and English law, using commercial real estate as a case study. Not only does this study identify the economic impact of the law in both jurisdictions, it also looks at the practitioners' functions in dealing with commercial real estate transactions. In other words, it analyzes the topical position of practitioners, such as the French notaires and the role of solicitors in England. Nowadays, the profession of notaires is confronted by numerous challenges. For instance, <b>nationality</b> <b>requirement</b> for its access has been ruled by the ECJ as contrary to the freedom of establishment and article 49 TFEU, and not justified by 'the exercise of public authority. ' In this study, the authors argue that the actual nature {{and the quality of the}} work done by the practitioners should be considered, as well as financial cost and delays. They also argue that a liberalization of professions, such as civil law notaires, would have very little impact on the cost associated with doing business. As a matter of fact, both the English and the French mechanisms are very similar in their objectives and outcome even though they handle the same transaction differently because of the culturally different relevant angles.

In retrospect however this often became criticised as being a rigid system in which promotion was based primarily on one's seniority and not on the ability of forward thinking or risk taking.

These results agreed with independent ratings of translation quality, but the statistical techniques were more sensitive. When included in scales, the items exhibiting DIF had only a little impact on conclusions about cross-national differences in health in the general population. However, if used as single items, the DIF items could seriously bias results from cross-national comparisons. Also, the DIF items might have larger impact on cross-national comparison of groups with poorer health status.

30|$|Social {{citizenship}} is constituted by social {{rights and obligations}} (Kvist 2007; Marshall 1950). According to Kvist (2007), social rights are manifested through different configurations of benefit characteristics, i.e. generosity of benefits and eligibility criteria. The generosity of benefits refers to the legally guaranteed benefit levels, whereas the eligibility criteria define the pool of persons who may access the benefit. Obvious examples of eligibility criteria are <b>nationality</b> and residence <b>requirements</b> and means tests. However, the shift of social policy measures towards activation has by now been extensively documented (Aurich 2011; Marchal and Van Mechelen 2014 b; Immervoll 2012; Kenworthy 2010; Eichhorst and Konle-Seidl 2008).

This makes Spain unique among European nations as the only nation that currently grants automatic citizenship to the descendants of Jews expelled during the European medieval evictions. As of November 2015, 4300 Sephardi Jews have benefited from this law and acquired Spanish citizenship, swearing allegiance to the Spanish Constitution.

Both Zainichi organisations oppose this, as both organisations see naturalization as de facto assimilation. In November 2011, the South Korean government moved to register Zainichi Koreans as voters in South Korean elections, a move which attracted few registrants. While Mindan-affiliated Zainichi Koreans presses for voting rights in Japan, they have very little interest in becoming a voting bloc in South Korean politics.

5000|$|German {{nationality}} {{law is the}} law {{governing the}} acquisition, transmission and loss of German citizenship.

Naturalisation is also possible for foreign nationals after six to eight years of legal residence in Germany. However, non-EU and non-Swiss citizens must usually renounce their old citizenship before being naturalised in Germany.

German citizens wanting to acquire a non-EU or non-Swiss citizenship and to maintain their German citizenship must apply for a permission (Beibehaltungsgenehmigung) before acquiring the other citizenship, or they will automatically lose their German citizenship when they acquire the foreign citizenship.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for receiving protection through investment arbitration for foreign investments under investment protection treaties {{is that the}} investments concerned satisfy the definitions of "investor" and "investment" in those treaties. To date, however, the interpretation of provisions concerning the definition of investors and investments {{has given rise to}} a variety of legal problems. With regard to the concept of an investor, a major point at issue is that of how to construe the <b>nationality</b> <b>requirements,</b> and in arbitral awards that have been made to date, the following two issues in particular have been disputed. (i) When the link between an investor and the investing country is weak, and in fact a national of a third country controls that investor, the point at issue is whether the said investor is qualified as a national of the investing country to file an investment arbitration claim. (ii) Even if a company is established in the recipient country, if it is controlled by a national of another country (a signatory to an investment protection treaty) it can file for investment arbitration against the recipient country on the basis of paragraph 2 (b) of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, but the point at issue is whether simply holding shares in a local company is sufficient to constitute control as defined here (or in other words, whether a local company can file a claim even when a top parent company residing in a country that has not concluded an investment protection treaty has effective management control of the local company). On these issues the stance shown by some arbitral awards has in principle been to respect the intentions of the countries or private actors that have been party to the investment protection treaties or investment agreements, and they have recognized jurisdiction for arbitration in the above two situations unless there have been special provisions limiting the eligibility of investors for protection. Nevertheless, if a firm is established as a corporation of convenience in a country that has concluded an investment protection treaty {{for the sole purpose of}} obtaining arbitration jurisdiction, and even if the treaty contains no provisions for refusing protection to such investors, an arbitral tribunal still could exercise its own discretion to deny jurisdiction, for example by piercing the corporate veil. Therefore, although the eligibility of the investors to enjoy protection is in principle subject to the intensions of the parties to the agreements concerned, an arbitral tribunal could conclude otherwise if they were inconsistent with the object and purpose of those agreements. The same is true with regard to the concept of investment. That is, parties to an investment protection treaty can freely determine what sort of investments would fall under the treaty's protection, and can also make it a condition for protection that foreign investment must be made in accordance with the domestic rules of the recipient country. However, according to some arbitral awards, the concept of investment in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, for example, implicitly includes objective requirements to be satisfied by all investments in order to fall within the coverage of protection, rejecting subjective modifications by the contracting states. In addition, there have been a couple of cases in which even where foreign investments violate the laws and regulations of the recipient country, and arbitral jurisdiction would have been denied if the provision of compliance with domestic rules had been applied in an automatic manner, what in fact happened was that after taking into account the circumstances of each case and the object and purpose of the investment protection agreements concerned, arbitral tribunals resorted to their own rational judgments to affirm jurisdiction. Accordingly, with regard to the concept of investment, too, the scope of protection is determined by a combination of the intentions of the parties concerned and the tribunals' original evaluations. ...|$|R

This paper looks at both the direct effect of immigration status on benefit eligibility, {{and the effect of}} benefit entitlement conditions themselves on third country nationals in the fifteen member countries of the European Union (EU) at different stages of settlement. It analyses each country’s benefit entitlement conditions by <b>nationality</b> criteria, contribution <b>requirements</b> and stipulations about years of residence, and the requirement to be present in the country. The paper draws attention to the important distinction between contributory and noncontributory benefits, with the latter tending to be less open to migrants and less likely to be included in international agreements; the lack of agreements between EU member countries and some sending countries with large stocks and flows; and suggests that the social security arrangements in the EU member countries create a hierarchy of statuses for migrants which may exclude those migrants who are most in need. Finally the paper examines the European Commission’s proposal to extend Regulation (EEC) 1408 / 71 to include third country nationals and concludes that the proposal moves beyond the principle of reciprocity towards a more inclusive conception of European citizenship...|$|R
