5|$|In Ukraine, a {{study of}} the origins of the {{political}} abuse of psychiatry was conducted for five years {{on the basis of the}} State archives. A total of 60 people were again examined. All were citizens of Ukraine, convicted of political crimes and hospitalized on the territory of Ukraine. <b>Not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them, it turned out, was in need of any psychiatric treatment.|$|E
5|$|Quinine wouldn't be {{successfully}} synthesized until 1918. Synthesis remains elaborate, expensive and low yield, {{with the additional}} problem of separation of the stereoisomers. Though quinine is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the major drugs used in treatment, modern production still relies on extraction from the cinchona tree.|$|E

5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 1995 college {{football}} season for Texas and Virginia Tech, the 1995 Sugar Bowl provided a final opportunity for players to demonstrate their skills on the field prior to the next NFL Draft. Several players from both teams announced their intention to enter the draft and attempt to play in the National Football League. Star Virginia Tech defender Cornell Brown was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these players. Prior to the draft, he announced his intention to remain at Tech for his senior year.|$|E

5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
5|$|Belize {{received}} a universality invitation from the Tripartite Commission {{to send a}} judoka competing in the men's middleweight category (90kg) to the Olympics. This was Renick James's Olympic debut. He participated in the men's 90 kilograms event. Only six judokas participated in the round of 64, and James was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. He lost 100-000 in the round of 32 against Ovini Uera of Nauru. Uera went on to lose his next bout against Varlam Liparteliani of Georgia. Liparteliani also {{went on to win}} a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, {{has led to the}} nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E

5|$|For her {{performance}} as Alice Howland, Julianne Moore won an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award. Still Alice marked her first Academy Award win after four previous nominations. Although she was widely considered the Best Actress frontrunner {{in anticipation of}} the Academy Awards ceremony, some critics felt that Still Alice was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Moore's strongest performances and did not deserve to win. Moore dedicated her Academy Award win to Glatzer, who died from ALS several weeks later on March 10, 2015.|$|E
5|$|He {{had little}} impact on {{the running of the}} navy, but he was {{interested}} enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of John Flamsteed's Observations in 1704. He was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most colourful political characters of his day—he was content to spend his time building model ships—but he was a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, Cloverleaf {{tried to}} sell Rosecroft {{multiple}} times. In mid-2002, several buyers {{became interested in the}} track, but Cloverleaf was involved in lawsuits, so the track could not be sold. One bidder was Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, but he withdrew in 2005. All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006, and only one remaining bidder was left—Penn National Gaming. Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007, but Rosecroft was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the locations sanctioned for expanded gambling by the law. As a result, Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track. From the gambling revenue, 7 percent goes to the horse-racing industry.|$|E

5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of}} the plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Pigs are <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms {{though there are}} some specialised units. They used {{to be kept in}} small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{days after}} the Double Tenth, Bishop John Wilson of St Andrew's Cathedral {{was taken to the}} YMCA, and placed in the cell next to Elizabeth. He was {{severely}} beaten for three days before the Japanese accepted that he was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the ringleaders in their imagined conspiracy. One night Elizabeth saw Rob Scott, by then badly disfigured {{as a result of the}} beatings and water tortures that he had been subjected to. At the end of one session Scott was told that he had been sentenced to death, and was forced to write a farewell letter to his wife. He was later sentenced to six years' imprisonment in Outram Road Prison instead, the site where convicted sepoy mutineers had been detained and executed by the British Army in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of the bad blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E
