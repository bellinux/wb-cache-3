I should be just delighted; because we could visit in comfort, since we shouldn't have to do any shopping--did it all in New York last week, and a tremendous pull it was too.|$|E

50|$|The company {{expanded}} rapidly {{during the}} 1930s, by <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>new</b> headquarters in Chepstow. It acquired several bus {{companies in the}} Swansea area and elsewhere in South Wales. In 1933 Red & White acquired the business of Red Bus Services of Stroud. Also in 1933 Red & White purchased All-British Travels Ltd. This company had been formed in 1930 by coach operators George Taylor of Chester, Alfred Harding of Birkenhead and J.W. Scott of Edinburgh, with sleeping partner Evan R. Davies, a solicitor in Pwllheli. Under the fleet name of 'All-British Line' the initial intention was to run express coach services to and from Liverpool and Llandudno to London via Taylor's Market Square car showroom in Chester and to operate a central London travel agency to advertise those services and the other coach services of the respective companies. This express coach service to and from London commenced on 14 April 1930. When Red & White purchased All-British Travels Ltd in January 1933, this included an option to purchase the final remaining All-British Line service between Liverpool and London which was operated by Taylor and which subsequently went ahead. George Taylor was paid £850 for the goodwill of the service and the All-British Line service between Liverpool and London ceased on 26 September 1933. Taylor continued in the coach excursion business and car trade in Chester up to 1972.|$|E

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{economic}} situation of Bela-Bela changed severely {{in the last}} twenty years. The emergence of tourism transformed the rural municipality into a popular tourism hub. The transformation of the landscape of Bela-Bela Local municipality has not only changed the area spatially and economically, though also influenced the nature of poverty. Within this research the central question is how the spatial and economic situation of Bela-Bela changed and what the consequences are for poverty. The process of de-agrarianisation of the area fits within a more global trend in the Rural South. Rigg (2006) describes {{the emergence of a}} rural non-farm economy within the Rural South, which leads to a new type of poverty. Instead of old poverty, whereby the poor are not integrated in the system, the poor suffer <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>new</b> poverty; meaning that they are integrated, but on very unfavourable terms. The transformation of Bela-Bela not only involves the emergence of tourism, though also the implementation of land reform projects. The elitist position of tourism and the mainly failing land reform projects within the area put Bela-Bela in a distinct position. Although the process of de-agrarianisation fits within Rigg' s concept of the changing Rural South, the position of the poor is contradicting. It seems that in the apartheid era, the poor were in a position whereby they were actually part of the mainstream economy, though treated very unequally. Nowadays one can identify a clear disconnection between {{the rich and the poor}} whereby failing agricultural land reform projects only create holes in the economic landscape. Furthermore the pro-poor focus of tourism is more or less absent. Nonetheless it provides the area with a successful land restitution and development model, in the case of the Bela-Bela CPA. The collaboration between the white established order and the black community provides an exemplary role for the further transformation of Bela-Bela and South Africa...|$|E
40|$|The {{basic premise}} of my {{research}} regarding the fashion production of Sirogojno style was that „objects are, like words, carriers of information“. Based on research published so far – a paper by Bojana Bogdanovic being the most detailed – and my own fieldwork conducted in 2010, I have attempted to ascertain {{the extent to which}} this particular style of fashion carried information about the cultural environment which it represented. The research encompasses the study of the materials being used, the production and the sale of products made of wool. The development of this particular style was influenced by the enthusiasm of designer Dobrila Vasiljevic-Smiljanic and the women of the mt. Zlatibor region, as well as the support provided by the political structure of the period, the local government, and through Dobrila Vasiljevic-Smiljanic’s family ties – the church. Her creations are famous for incorporating adapted local ornaments. A distinct and recognizable style of woolen products was created. This „Wool Road“ – from using local raw materials to materials imported from Iceland, from creating unique motifs to sale in the open, from national and international sales to musealized sales {{in the first decade of}} the 21 st century – has lasted for over fifty years. Products from Sirogojno were renowned both in the country and abroad. All the negative processes which happened during the nineties influenced the decline of production and distribution of hand-crafted products from Sirogojno. In the late 1990 ’s, the production was acquired by a local owner who didn’t show much interest in it. This production has been musealized in the first decade of the 21 st century. Dobrila Vasiljevic-Smiljanic told me in 2010 that „everything should be started from scratch <b>now,</b> <b>from</b> <b>new</b> motifs to new marketing“. The new owners of the firm say that „the villages are deserted and there aren’t enough weavers“. On the other hand, there is sale in the open, well set up and visible to visitors of Sirogojno. In this space, in typical small houses, women weave and sell woolen garments adorned with motifs which were once created by Dobrila Vasiljevic-Smiljanic. Most of these women feed their families this way, because a number of men were left without jobs in this region. All of my informants who work in the open state that they aren’t satisfied with their status. And none of them had any specific relation toward the fact that they were copying motifs created by Dobrila Vasiljevic-Smiljanic. In the final part of the paper I will offer my own understanding of the textile craft in Sirogojno. I emphasize that Dobrila Vasiljevic-Smiljanic had an active role in the shaping of the idea to found the Staro Selo Museum. It is a pity that her initial idea to represent the traditional way of producing woolen garments in this attractive setting fell through. Research conducted in 2010 has shown that the original production of „Sirogojno style“ is shrinking and being musealized. The Staro Selo Museum could pool the resources, become a center for craftsmanship and thus protect, develop and promote the textile heritage of Sirogojno...|$|E
