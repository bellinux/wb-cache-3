Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear.

5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator.

40|$|Radiographic density {{analysis}} of jaw bone by adding an aluminum step wedge has shown high precision, accuracy and diagnostic specificity in previous studies. Objectives: To determine aluminum equivalent density(AED) values of peri-implant bone at implant <b>neck,</b> <b>threads</b> and apical regions, identify bone density changes after healing and check if AED values can identify absence of osseointegration, using histological images as gold-standard. Methods: Ten Göttingen minipigs received 40 implants (20 commercially pure titanium; 20 Osseospeed 3. 5 S, Astra Techs) and were sacrificed 3 months later. Standardized intra-oral radiographs were taken at implant placement (baseline) and after 3 months. Custom-made and DBSwin software (DürrDental) {{were used to}} measure bone density(AED) and marginal bone level, respectively. For histomorphometrical analyses, implant sections were stained to visualize mineralized and non-mineralized bone and measure bone defect depth and peri-implant bone volume. Statistical analyses used linear regression analysis, Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon and Pearson correlation tests at significance level of 0. 05. Results: Bone around implant threads and apical region showed a significantly higher bone density than around implant neck(table 1 - 2). No significant changes of AED were found after 3 months, despite the higher values compared to baseline(table 3 - 4). AED was significantly, but weakly, correlated to bone defect depth(table 5) and bone loss(table 6), however no correlation was found with peri-implant bone volume(r= 0. 21; p= 0. 18). AED values lower than 5 mmAleq at baseline showed bone loss greater than 2. 0 mm after 3 months healing(table 7 /fig. 3). Conclusions: AED is a promising diagnostic tool to predict bone tissue response to titanium implants. An increased bone loss (> 2 mm) seem {{more likely to occur}} at low density bones(< 5 mmAleq). Distinct bone densities are found around implant <b>neck,</b> <b>threads</b> and apical regions. Yet, for a more precise {{analysis of}} osseointegration, further studies are needed to better diagnose the absence of bone formation around implant by means of radiological images...|$|E

40|$|Devoid of any science based evidence, {{the neck}} of dental {{implants}} was firstly chosen to be smooth. Recent finite element studies reveal that a smooth implant neck induces high stress peaks in bone at the retention elements. Implant threads were, therefore, extended to include the neck as well. In more recent applications of immediately loaded implant more retention, less micro-motion, and larger support areas are needed. Consequently, new implant designs presenting threaded neck with different thread sizes have been introduced. However. to date, such designs have not been realistically and satisfactorily tested. Therefore. {{the aim of this}} study is to compare the outcome of smooth neck and threaded neck designs in terms of stress distribution in bone as well as implant's micro motions. Axisymmetric 3 D models of an implant and the surrounding bone are developed on FEM software (ABAQUS). The models mimic smooth neck implant in addition to three different thread configurations (macro-thread and 2 different sizes of micro•threads). For each model, two simulations are carried out; one with regards of a fully osseointegrated implant (bonded contact) condition while the other concerns an immediately loaded implant (free contact) condition. Under a load of lOON results showed that the presence of the threads in the osseointegrated case showed slight increase in Von•Mises stresses at the cortical bone of 4 % and 14 % in the micro [...] threads while it decreased in the macro• threads by 5 % compared to smooth neck. However, Von•Mises stresses in the cancellous bone did not change significantly (about 27 MPa). In the inunediale loading case, the Von•Mises stresses in the cortical bone in all threaded implants increased by a fold of 3 or more while it decreased in the cancellous bone by a factor of 2 or more, depending on the thread size. This clearly emphasizes the importance of the <b>neck</b> <b>threads</b> in the case of immediate loadings...|$|E
50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of <b>neck</b> <b>thread</b> specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{plastics}} for packaging {{has been increasing}} steadily over the years. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dominates the carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) market as the main material used in this application due to its toughness, clarity and superior barrier properties. Currently, the CSD bottles constitute 40 % of the global PET consumption.

Manufacturing of the bottles starts with the production of PET resin from petrochemicals.

Julian, therefore, saw nothing more of Catherine until she came into the drawing-room, a few minutes before the announcement of dinner, wearing a wonderful toilette of pale blue silk, with magnificent pearls around her <b>neck</b> and <b>threaded</b> in her Russian headdress. As is the way with all women of genius, Catherine's complete change of toilette indicated a parallel change in her demeanour. Her interesting but somewhat subdued manner of the previous evening seemed to have vanished. At the dinner table she dominated the conversation. She displayed an intimate acquaintance with every capital of Europe and with countless personages of importance. She exchanged personal reminiscences with Lord Shervinton, who had once been attached to the Embassy at Rome, and with Mr. Hannaway Wells, who had been first secretary at Vienna. She spoke amusingly of Munich, at which place, it appeared, she had first studied art, but dilated, with all the artist's fervour, on her travellings in Spain, on the soft yet wonderfully vivid colouring of the southern cities. She seemed to have escaped altogether from the gravity of which she had displayed traces on the previous evening. She was no longer the serious young woman with a purpose. From the chrysalis she had changed into the butterfly, the brilliant and cosmopolitan young queen of fashion, ruling easily, not with the arrogance of rank, but with the actual gifts of charm and wit. Julian himself derived little benefit from being her neighbour, for the conversation that evening, from first to last, was general. Even after she had left the room, the atmosphere which she had created seemed to linger behind her.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{in vitro}} {{comparative}} {{study was conducted}} in order to evaluate the effects of an air-abrasive system on dental implant surfaces. Eight new titanium dental implants, four standard machined implants (machined group), and four standard plasma-sprayed implants (plasma-sprayed group) were selected for investigation. Both neck and body surfaces of the implants were analyzed. Each pair of implants in each group was treated as follows: the spray of the air-abrasive unit was applied to each area for 5 seconds on the first implant and 15 seconds on the second implant. A total of 24 areas were observed: 16 test implants and 8 controls. Scanning electron photomicrographs were analyzed by 3 examiners using a category rating scale (k = 0. 594). The images were also computerized for texture analysis. The results indicate that a single air-powder abrasive treatment of the dental implants selected for this study modified their exposed surfaces. After treatment, the <b>threaded</b> <b>neck</b> surface of a machined group implant was least affected, whereas the body was the most altered. In the plasma-sprayed group, comparisons between implant surfaces showed little change. In the machined group, more change was observed in both neck and body areas.

5000|$|A Straus flask (often misspelled [...] "Strauss") is {{subclass}} of [...] "bomb" [...] flask {{originally developed}} by Kontes Glass Company, commonly used for storing dried and degassed solvents. Straus flasks are {{sometimes referred to}} as solvent bombs — a name which applies to any Schlenk bomb dedicated to storing solvent. Straus flasks are mainly differentiated from other [...] "bombs" [...] by their neck structure. Two necks emerge from a round bottom flask, one larger than the other. The larger neck ends in a ground glass joint and is permanently partitioned by blown glass from direct access to the flask. The smaller <b>neck</b> includes the <b>threading</b> required for a teflon plug to be screwed in perpendicular to the flask. The two necks are joined through a glass tube. The ground glass joint can be connected to a manifold directly or through an adapter and hosing. Once connected, the plug valve can be partially opened to allow the solvent in the Straus flask to be vacuum transferred to other vessels. Or, once connected to the line, the neck can be placed under a positive pressure of inert gas and the plug valve can be fully removed. This allows direct access to the flask through a narrow glass tube now protected by a curtain of inert gas. The solvent can then be transferred through cannula to another flask. In contrast, other bomb flask plugs are not necessarily ideally situated to protect the atmosphere of the flask from the external atmosphere.|$|R
5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, <b>necking,</b> flange curling, <b>thread</b> rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|R
