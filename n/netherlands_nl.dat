We hypothesized {{that even in}} the nutrient-poor bog environment, elevated CO 2 would stimulate Sphagnum growth more than vascular plant growth, thereby improving Sphagnum's competitive strength and enhancing carbon (C) sequestration. Free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments took place on predominantly ombrotrophic peatbog-lawns in Finland (FI), Sweden (SW), The <b>Netherlands</b> (<b>NL),</b> and Switzerland (CH). After 3 yr of treatment, increased CO 2 concentration (560 ppm on volume basis) had no significant effect on Sphagnum or vascular plant biomass at either site.

A variety of additional measures against BSE led to further decrease of R 0 to about 0. 06 in the years around 1998. The calculated R 0 values were consistent with the observations made on the surveillance results for UK, but were partially conflicting with the surveillance results for NL and CH. There was evidence for a dependency of the BSE epidemic in NL and CH from an infection source not considered in the deterministic transmission model. Imports of MBM and feed components can be an explanation for this discrepancy, and the importance of imports for these observations is discussed...|$|E

The idea of national locality is changing in European enterprises because of the new shared markets and possibilities for cooperation. In this article we explore technology start-ups taking an Italian sample (N = 20) from the Torino-Milano area as a benchmark. Survey findings as well as case-study interviews are used as data. Italians are reputed to be communitarian and family minded as part of their national culture. Such start-ups would prefer to cooperate locally. A questionnaire and in-depth interviews are used to shed light on this issue. The samples from other EU countries, such as the United Kingdom (UK), The <b>Netherlands</b> (<b>NL)</b> (both N = 5) and Germany (N = 24) are used for comparison. Italy still seems to prefer family values and local cooperation, but with an openness to build teams within and between start-ups. The trend is similar in the UK and Germany, but not in the NL. Results also suggest that cooperation often happens informally and randomly even if benefits of it are widely recognised...|$|E

Plants at Mediterranean sites (IT, SP) showed a higher root-surface phosphatase activity than plants at temperate sites (WL, NL, DK). We suggest it might be an adaptation of plant species evolved under Mediterranean climate that allows them a) to compensate in wet period for the decrease in phosphatase activity, and thus P uptake, during drought periods, and/or b) to benefit from soluble organic P flushes following the frequent drying-rewetting episodes experienced by soils in Mediterranean ecosystems...|$|E

To refine these assessments, exposures were also calculated using three long-term exposure models, observed individual means (OIM), Iowa State University Foods (ISUF), and betabinomial-normal (BBN) models, combined with individual food consumption data of NL. BBN and ISUF correct the variation in long-term exposure for the within-person variation, whereas OIM calculates the mean exposure over the days in the food consumption survey. Exposures obtained with the concise database were highest, and those obtained with OIM higher than with BBN and ISUF. Contribution of the major sources of exposure differed between the concise database and the three models. Given {{the constraints of the}} concise database, exposures obtained with this database should be interpreted as a first tier assessment. Preferably, refined assessments using models that correct the variation in long-term exposure for the within-person variation combined with individual food consumption data and national concentration data should be used to assess the long-term exposure.

We investigated {{the effect of}} including the birth cohort dimension in trend studies of prescription drug use by studying prevalence of statin use among adults. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data from a drug prescription database in the <b>Netherlands</b> (IADB. <b>nl)</b> were used to obtain the number of users of statin per 1, 000 population (prevalence) in the age range 18 - 85 years from 1994 to 2008.

RESULTS: From 1994 to 2008, the prevalence increased from ∼ 10 to ∼ 90 users per 1, 000 population, with the peak in prevalence shifting from age 63 to 78 years. The APC model shows patterns that were masked in the age-period (AP) model. The prevalence rate ratio increased from the 1911 birth cohort to the 1930 birth cohort and then declined. Similar for both sexes, adding nonlinear period effects contributed ∼ 4. 4 % to reductions in deviance, whereas adding nonlinear birth cohort effects contributed ∼ 12. 9 %.
