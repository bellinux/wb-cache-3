40|$|The Institute of Internal Auditors is in {{the process}} of {{developing}} <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> for the internal auditing profession. The first set of these standards will be implemented with effect from 1 January 2002. The purpose of professional standards is to lay down the minimum requirements to be maintained for acceptable practice. In June 1999, a new formal definition of internal auditing was adopted to address relevant issues with which internal auditing is currently faced. Existing standards, when read in conjunction with the new definition, have deficiencies and these deficiencies have led to the development of <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> for the profession. The purpose of this article is to discuss the limitations of the current standards, to identify the changes incorporated in the <b>new</b> <b>standards,</b> and to evaluate the changes. The article evaluates whether the <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> address the changes in the new definition and highlights the influence of the changes in the standards on the internal auditing profession. The findings are that the <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> are difficult to analyse, especially because the current standards must still be used in conjunction with the <b>new</b> <b>standards,</b> yet the changes successfully address the challenges facing the internal auditing profession...|$|R

5|$|A {{review of}} the National Waymarked Trails in Ireland by the National Trails Office in 2010 {{acknowledged}} these shortcomings and recommended that the Wicklow Way be selected as one of fourteen trails to be upgraded to a National Long Distance Trail. This is a proposed <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> of trail in Ireland, intended to meet international standards for outstanding trails. It would require sections on unsuitable roads to comprise less than 10% of the total trail and for appropriate support services – accommodation, meals, transport, luggage transfer etc. – to be available. The review also recommended the development of shorter looped walks off the Wicklow Way and improving parking facilities.|$|E

5|$|Also on 13 September 1926, {{a further}} {{connection}} between the CCE and the C was opened when tunnels were brought into service from the CCE's Charing Cross station (now Embankment) to Kennington station, the latter having been rebuilt with four platforms. An intermediate station was constructed at Waterloo. Thus fully integrated, combined services operated over the C and CCE routes using <b>new</b> <b>Standard</b> Stock trains. On tube maps, the combined lines were then shown in a single colour, although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s.

5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the <b>new</b> <b>standard,</b> and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

This project concludes that Danske Bank has not succeeded in turning the corporation’s legitimacy around, but their credibility is rising with the shareholders and business customers, which is the segment that contributes to Danske Bank in achieving their financial goals. Danske Bank’s vision is to be the most trusted financial partner, and their mission to become that is founded in Danske Bank’s strategy and their financial goals. In this sense this project discusses if Danske Bank has been prioritizing their stakeholders, in relation to achieving their goals...|$|R
5|$|Carte {{had been}} {{planning}} {{to build a new}} theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of Savoy. It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's love {{of music}} led him to serve for twenty years as {{chairman}} of the council of Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. During this time the company expanded its scope. From producing the hymnbooks Hymns Ancient and Modern (A), and The English Hymnal, it also took ownership of Canterbury Press, SCM Press, and the Church Times, leading to jokes that Chadwick was an ecclesiastical Rupert Murdoch. He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs Ancient and Modern, and Hymns Ancient and Modern <b>New</b> <b>Standard,</b> which combined the best of the original book with that from the supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the inclusion of the Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM {{proposed the}} use of wavelength of a specific light source as the standard for defining length, and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that the speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre. This proposal was accepted in 1983.|$|E

MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began construction planning in 1993. Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{introduction of}} the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society. Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence. Napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles (traditional units of measurement) for retail trade—a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but {{were based on the}} kilogram and the metre; for example the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g instead of 489.5 g—the value of the livre du roi (the king's pound). Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive {{introduction of the}} metric system across parts of Europe {{in the middle of the}} 19th century.|$|E
