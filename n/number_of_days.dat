The size of the raiding force depended on the objective. The smallest raid was two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest raid involved over 10,500 men in Operation Jubilee.

Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm.

Maltese school students receive the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> off of all school students in Europe, with 90 days during the 2010-11 academic year being non-school days.

5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much they liked it. For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 {{was chosen as the}} upper limit to mask the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1 if they disliked the number very much, to 6 if they liked it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E

5|$|In November, Seattle averages more {{rainfall}} {{than any}} other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from June to September. Seattle {{is one of the}} five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year. By comparison, Fort Myers, Florida, reports thunder on 93 days per year, Kansas City on 52, and New York City on 25.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the busy preceding season, this season had much lower activity than usual, with only 36days {{in which there was}} a tropical storm or cyclone active; this was 17 less than normal.

There were only five named storms, only the fifth such time {{since the beginning of the}} satellite era in 1967. As most storms formed toward the eastern periphery of the basin, damage was much less than the preceding year.|$|E

5|$|On May21, 2006, a {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered the}} East Pacific. The wave drifted westward, and after several days began to interact with a low-level trough near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, {{and as a result}} deep convection increased. By May25, a large area of low pressure formed several hundred miles south of Acapulco, Mexico. Wind shear inhibited development initially, though conditions became slightly more favorable after a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> and at 0600UTC on May27, {{a tropical}} depression formed about 190mi (305km) south of Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|Primarily nocturnal, nursehounds {{spend the}} day inside small holes in rocks and swim into deeper water at night to hunt. Sometimes two sharks will squeeze into the same hole, and several {{individuals}} will seek out refuges within the same local area. In one tracking study, a single immature nursehound was observed to use five different refuges in succession {{over a period of}} 168 days, consistently returning to each one over a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> before moving on. Nursehounds may occupy refuges to hide from predators, avoid harassment by mature conspecifics, and/or to facilitate thermoregulation. In captivity, these sharks are gregarious and tend to rest in groups, though the individuals comprising any particular group changes frequently. This species is less common than the small-spotted catshark.|$|E
